      <title>Normalisation of SWIFT Message Counterparties with Feature Extraction and Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Short text clustering is a known use case in the text analytics community. When the structure and content falls in the natural language domain e.g. Twitter posts or instant messages, then natural language techniques can be used, provided texts are of sufficient length to allow for use of (pre)trained models to extract meaningful information, such as part-of-speech or topic annotations. However, natural language models are not suitable for clustering transaction counterparties, as they are found in bank payment messaging systems, such as SWIFT. The manually typed tags are typically physical or legal entity details, which lack sentence structure, while containing all the variations and noise that manual entry introduces. This leaves a gap in an investigator or counter-fraud professional's toolset when looking to augment their knowledge of payment flow originator and beneficiary entities and trace funds and assets. A gap that vendors traditionally try to close with fuzzy matching tools. With these considerations in mind, we are proposing a hybrid string similarity, topic modelling, hierarchical clustering and rule-based pipeline to facilitate clustering of transaction counterparties, also catering for unknown number of expected clusters. We are also devising metrics to supplement the evaluation of the approach, based on the well-known measures of precision and recall. Testing on a real-life labelled dataset demonstrates significantly improved performance over a baseline rule-based ('keyword') approach. The approach retains most of the interpretability found in rule-based systems, as the former adds an additional level of cluster refinement to the latter. The resulting workflow reduces the need for manual review. When only a subset of the population needs to be investigated, such as in sanctions investigations, the approach allows for better control of the risks of missing entity variations.</description>

      <title>Beyond Prediction: Reinforcement Learning as the Defining Leap in Healthcare AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) marks a fundamental shift in how artificial intelligence is applied in healthcare. Instead of merely predicting outcomes, RL actively decides interventions with long term goals. Unlike traditional models that operate on fixed associations, RL systems learn through trial, feedback, and long-term reward optimization, introducing transformative possibilities and new risks. From an information fusion lens, healthcare RL typically integrates multi-source signals such as vitals, labs clinical notes, imaging and device telemetry using temporal and decision-level mechanisms. These systems can operate within centralized, federated, or edge architectures to meet real-time clinical constraints, and naturally span data, features and decision fusion levels. This survey explore RL's rise in healthcare as more than a set of tools, rather a shift toward agentive intelligence in clinical environments. We first structure the landscape of RL techniques including model-based and model-free methods, offline and batch-constrained approaches, and emerging strategies for reward specification and uncertainty calibration through the lens of healthcare constraints. We then comprehensively analyze RL applications spanning critical care, chronic disease, mental health, diagnostics, and robotic assistance, identifying their trends, gaps, and translational bottlenecks. In contrast to prior reviews, we critically analyze RL's ethical, deployment, and reward design challenges, and synthesize lessons for safe, human-aligned policy learning. This paper serves as both a a technical roadmap and a critical reflection of RL's emerging transformative role in healthcare AI not as prediction machinery, but as agentive clinical intelligence.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal EEG-Based Emotion Recognition Using SAM Ratings from Serious Games with Hybrid Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in EEG-based emotion recognition have shown promising outcomes using both deep learning and classical machine learning approaches; however, most existing studies focus narrowly on binary valence prediction or subject-specific classification, which limits generalizability and deployment in real-world affective computing systems. To address this gap, this paper presents a unified, multigranularity EEG emotion classification framework built on the GAMEEMO dataset, which consists of 14-channel EEG recordings and continuous self-reported emotion ratings (boring, horrible, calm, and funny) from 28 subjects across four emotion-inducing gameplay scenarios. Our pipeline employs a structured preprocessing strategy that comprises temporal window segmentation, hybrid statistical and frequency-domain feature extraction, and z-score normalization to convert raw EEG signals into robust, discriminative input vectors. Emotion labels are derived and encoded across three complementary axes: (i) binary valence classification based on the averaged polarity of positive and negative emotion ratings, and (ii) Multi-class emotion classification, where the presence of the most affective state is predicted. (iii) Fine-grained multi-label representation via binning each emotion into 10 ordinal classes. We evaluate a broad spectrum of models, including Random Forest, XGBoost, and SVM, alongside deep neural architectures such as LSTM, LSTM-GRU, and CNN-LSTM. Among these, the LSTM-GRU model consistently outperforms the others, achieving an F1-score of 0.932 in the binary valence task and 94.5% and 90.6% in both multi-class and Multi-Label emotion classification.</description>

      <title>PVPO: Pre-Estimated Value-Based Policy Optimization for Agentic Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Critic-free reinforcement learning methods, particularly group policies, have attracted considerable attention for their efficiency in complex tasks. However, these methods rely heavily on multiple sampling and comparisons within the policy to estimate advantage, which may cause the policy to fall into local optimum and increase computational cost. To address these issues, we propose PVPO, an efficient reinforcement learning method enhanced by an advantage reference anchor and data pre-sampling. Specifically, we use the reference model to rollout in advance and employ the calculated reward score as a reference anchor. Our approach effectively corrects the cumulative bias introduced by intra-group comparisons and significantly reduces reliance on the number of rollouts. Meanwhile, the reference model can assess sample difficulty during data pre-sampling, enabling effective selection of high-gain data to improve training efficiency. Experiments conducted on nine datasets across two domains demonstrate that PVPO achieves State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) performance. Our approach not only demonstrates robust generalization across multiple tasks, but also exhibits scalable performance across models of varying scales.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Low-rank Approximation of Full-Matrix Preconditioner for Training Generalized Linear Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adaptive gradient methods like Adagrad and its variants are widespread in large-scale optimization. However, their use of diagonal preconditioning matrices limits the ability to capture parameter correlations. Full-matrix adaptive methods, approximating the exact Hessian, can model these correlations and may enable faster convergence. At the same time, their computational and memory costs are often prohibitive for large-scale models. To address this limitation, we propose AdaGram, an optimizer that enables efficient full-matrix adaptive gradient updates. To reduce memory and computational overhead, we utilize fast symmetric factorization for computing the preconditioned update direction at each iteration. Additionally, we maintain the low-rank structure of a preconditioner along the optimization trajectory using matrix integrator methods. Numerical experiments on standard machine learning tasks show that AdaGram converges faster or matches the performance of diagonal adaptive optimizers when using rank five and smaller rank approximations. This demonstrates AdaGram's potential as a scalable solution for adaptive optimization in large models.</description>

      <title>An Explainable, Attention-Enhanced, Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory Neural Network for Joint 48-Hour Forecasting of Temperature, Irradiance, and Relative Humidity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a Deep Learning (DL) framework for 48-hour forecasting of temperature, solar irradiance, and relative humidity to support Model Predictive Control (MPC) in smart HVAC systems. The approach employs a stacked Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) network with attention, capturing temporal and cross-feature dependencies by jointly predicting all three variables. Historical meteorological data (2019-2022) with encoded cyclical time features were used for training, while 2023 data evaluated generalization. The model achieved Mean Absolute Errors of 1.3 degrees Celsius (temperature), 31 W/m2 (irradiance), and 6.7 percentage points (humidity), outperforming state-of-the-art numerical weather prediction and machine learning benchmarks. Integrated Gradients quantified feature contributions, and attention weights revealed temporal patterns, enhancing interpretability. By combining multivariate forecasting, attention-based DL, and explainability, this work advances data-driven weather prediction. The demonstrated accuracy and transparency highlight the framework's potential for energy-efficient building control through reliable short-term meteorological forecasting.</description>

      <title>Automating the Deep Space Network Data Systems; A Case Study in Adaptive Anomaly Detection through Agentic AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Deep Space Network (DSN) is NASA's largest network of antenna facilities that generate a large volume of multivariate time-series data. These facilities contain DSN antennas and transmitters that undergo degradation over long periods of time, which may cause costly disruptions to the data flow and threaten the earth-connection of dozens of spacecraft that rely on the Deep Space Network for their lifeline. The purpose of this study was to experiment with different methods that would be able to assist JPL engineers with directly pinpointing anomalies and equipment degradation through collected data, and continue conducting maintenance and operations of the DSN for future space missions around our universe. As such, we have researched various machine learning techniques that can fully reconstruct data through predictive analysis, and determine anomalous data entries within real-time datasets through statistical computations and thresholds. On top of the fully trained and tested machine learning models, we have also integrated the use of a reinforcement learning subsystem that classifies identified anomalies based on severity level and a Large Language Model that labels an explanation for each anomalous data entry, all of which can be improved and fine-tuned over time through human feedback/input. Specifically, for the DSN transmitters, we have also implemented a full data pipeline system that connects the data extraction, parsing, and processing workflow all together as there was no coherent program or script for performing these tasks before. Using this data pipeline system, we were able to then also connect the models trained from DSN antenna data, completing the data workflow for DSN anomaly detection. This was all wrapped around and further connected by an agentic AI system, where complex reasoning was utilized to determine the classifications and predictions of anomalous data.</description>

      <title>Adaptive LLM Routing under Budget Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing, but their varying capabilities and costs pose challenges in practical applications. LLM routing addresses this by dynamically selecting the most suitable LLM for each query/task. Previous approaches treat this as a supervised learning problem, assuming complete knowledge of optimal query-LLM pairings. However, real-world scenarios lack such comprehensive mappings and face evolving user queries. We thus propose to study LLM routing as a contextual bandit problem, enabling adaptive decision-making using bandit feedback without requiring exhaustive inference across all LLMs for all queries (in contrast to supervised routing). To address this problem, we develop a shared embedding space for queries and LLMs, where query and LLM embeddings are aligned to reflect their affinity. This space is initially learned from offline human preference data and refined through online bandit feedback. We instantiate this idea through Preference-prior Informed Linucb fOr adaptive rouTing (PILOT), a novel extension of LinUCB. To handle diverse user budgets for model routing, we introduce an online cost policy modeled as a multi-choice knapsack problem, ensuring resource-efficient routing.</description>

      <title>Privacy Auditing Synthetic Data Release through Local Likelihood Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Auditing the privacy leakage of synthetic data is an important but unresolved problem. Most existing privacy auditing frameworks for synthetic data rely on heuristics and unreasonable assumptions to attack the failure modes of generative models, exhibiting limited capability to describe and detect the privacy exposure of training data through synthetic data release. In this paper, we study designing Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) that specifically exploit the observation that tabular generative models tend to significantly overfit to certain regions of the training distribution. Here, we propose Generative Likelihood Ratio Attack (Gen-LRA), a novel, computationally efficient No-Box MIA that, with no assumption of model knowledge or access, formulates its attack by evaluating the influence a test observation has in a surrogate model's estimation of a local likelihood ratio over the synthetic data. Assessed over a comprehensive benchmark spanning diverse datasets, model architectures, and attack parameters, we find that Gen-LRA consistently dominates other MIAs for generative models across multiple performance metrics. These results underscore Gen-LRA's effectiveness as a privacy auditing tool for the release of synthetic data, highlighting the significant privacy risks posed by generative model overfitting in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Deep Residual Echo State Networks: exploring residual orthogonal connections in untrained Recurrent Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Echo State Networks (ESNs) are a particular type of untrained Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) within the Reservoir Computing (RC) framework, popular for their fast and efficient learning. However, traditional ESNs often struggle with long-term information processing. In this paper, we introduce a novel class of deep untrained RNNs based on temporal residual connections, called Deep Residual Echo State Networks (DeepResESNs). We show that leveraging a hierarchy of untrained residual recurrent layers significantly boosts memory capacity and long-term temporal modeling. For the temporal residual connections, we consider different orthogonal configurations, including randomly generated and fixed-structure configurations, and we study their effect on network dynamics. A thorough mathematical analysis outlines necessary and sufficient conditions to ensure stable dynamics within DeepResESN. Our experiments on a variety of time series tasks showcase the advantages of the proposed approach over traditional shallow and deep RC.</description>

      <title>FUTURE: Flexible Unlearning for Tree Ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tree ensembles are widely recognized for their effectiveness in classification tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance across diverse domains, including bioinformatics, finance, and medical diagnosis. With increasing emphasis on data privacy and the \textit{right to be forgotten}, several unlearning algorithms have been proposed to enable tree ensembles to forget sensitive information. However, existing methods are often tailored to a particular model or rely on the discrete tree structure, making them difficult to generalize to complex ensembles and inefficient for large-scale datasets. To address these limitations, we propose FUTURE, a novel unlearning algorithm for tree ensembles. Specifically, we formulate the problem of forgetting samples as a gradient-based optimization task. In order to accommodate non-differentiability of tree ensembles, we adopt the probabilistic model approximations within the optimization framework. This enables end-to-end unlearning in an effective and efficient manner. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that FUTURE yields significant and successful unlearning performance.</description>

      <title>Manifold Trajectories in Next-Token Prediction: From Replicator Dynamics to Softmax Equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decoding in large language models is often described as scoring tokens and normalizing with softmax. We give a minimal, self-contained account of this step as a constrained variational principle on the probability simplex. The discrete, normalization-respecting ascent is the classical multiplicative-weights (entropic mirror) update; its continuous-time limit is the replicator flow. From these ingredients we prove that, for a fixed context and temperature, the next-token distribution follows a smooth trajectory inside the simplex and converges to the softmax equilibrium. This formalizes the common ``manifold traversal'' intuition at the output-distribution level. The analysis yields precise, practice-facing consequences: temperature acts as an exact rescaling of time along the same trajectory, while top-k and nucleus sampling restrict the flow to a face with identical guarantees. We also outline a controlled account of path-dependent score adjustments and their connection to loop-like, hallucination-style behavior. We make no claims about training dynamics or internal representations; those are deferred to future work.</description>

      <title>Model-Task Alignment Drives Distinct RL Outcomes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in applying reinforcement learning (RL) to large language models (LLMs) have led to substantial progress. In particular, a series of remarkable yet often counterintuitive phenomena have been reported in LLMs, exhibiting patterns not typically observed in traditional RL settings. For example, notable claims include that a single training example can match the performance achieved with an entire dataset, that the reward signal does not need to be very accurate, and that training solely with negative samples can match or even surpass sophisticated reward-based methods. However, the precise conditions under which these observations hold - and, critically, when they fail - remain unclear. In this work, we identify a key factor that differentiates RL observations: whether the pretrained model already exhibits strong Model-Task Alignment, as measured by pass@k accuracy on the evaluated task. Through a systematic and comprehensive examination of a series of counterintuitive claims, supported by rigorous experimental validation across different model architectures and task domains, our findings show that while standard RL training remains consistently robust across settings, many of these counterintuitive results arise only when the model and task already exhibit strong model-task alignment. In contrast, these techniques fail to drive substantial learning in more challenging regimes, where standard RL methods remain effective.</description>

      <title>Class Incremental Continual Learning with Self-Organizing Maps and Variational Autoencoders Using Synthetic Replay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces a novel generative continual learning framework based on self-organizing maps (SOMs) and variational autoencoders (VAEs) to enable memory-efficient replay, eliminating the need to store raw data samples or task labels. For high-dimensional input spaces, such as of CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, we design a scheme where the SOM operates over the latent space learned by a VAE, whereas, for lower-dimensional inputs, such as those found in MNIST and FashionMNIST, the SOM operates in a standalone fashion. Our method stores a running mean, variance, and covariance for each SOM unit, from which synthetic samples are then generated during future learning iterations. For the VAE-based method, generated samples are then fed through the decoder to then be used in subsequent replay. Experimental results on standard class-incremental benchmarks show that our approach performs competitively with state-of-the-art memory-based methods and outperforms memory-free methods, notably improving over best state-of-the-art single class incremental performance on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 by nearly $10$\% and $7$\%, respectively. Our methodology further facilitates easy visualization of the learning process and can also be utilized as a generative model post-training. Results show our method's capability as a scalable, task-label-free, and memory-efficient solution for continual learning.</description>

      <title>A Mixture of Experts Gating Network for Enhanced Surrogate Modeling in External Aerodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The computational cost associated with high-fidelity CFD simulations remains a significant bottleneck in the automotive design and optimization cycle. While ML-based surrogate models have emerged as a promising alternative to accelerate aerodynamic predictions, the field is characterized by a diverse and rapidly evolving landscape of specialized neural network architectures, with no single model demonstrating universal superiority. This paper introduces a novel meta-learning framework that leverages this architectural diversity as a strength. We propose a Mixture of Experts (MoE) model that employs a dedicated gating network to dynamically and optimally combine the predictions from three heterogeneous, state-of-the-art surrogate models: DoMINO, a decomposable multi-scale neural operator; X-MeshGraphNet, a scalable multi-scale graph neural network; and FigConvNet, a factorized implicit global convolution network. The gating network learns a spatially-variant weighting strategy, assigning credibility to each expert based on its localized performance in predicting surface pressure and wall shear stress fields. To prevent model collapse and encourage balanced expert contributions, we integrate an entropy regularization term into the training loss function. The entire system is trained and validated on the DrivAerML dataset, a large-scale, public benchmark of high-fidelity CFD simulations for automotive aerodynamics. Quantitative results demonstrate that the MoE model achieves a significant reduction in L-2 prediction error, outperforming not only the ensemble average but also the most accurate individual expert model across all evaluated physical quantities. This work establishes the MoE framework as a powerful and effective strategy for creating more robust and accurate composite surrogate models by synergistically combining the complementary strengths of specialized architectures.</description>

      <title>RelP: Faithful and Efficient Circuit Discovery via Relevance Patching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Activation patching is a standard method in mechanistic interpretability for localizing the components of a model responsible for specific behaviors, but it is computationally expensive to apply at scale. Attribution patching offers a faster, gradient-based approximation, yet suffers from noise and reduced reliability in deep, highly non-linear networks. In this work, we introduce Relevance Patching (RelP), which replaces the local gradients in attribution patching with propagation coefficients derived from Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP). LRP propagates the network's output backward through the layers, redistributing relevance to lower-level components according to local propagation rules that ensure properties such as relevance conservation or improved signal-to-noise ratio. Like attribution patching, RelP requires only two forward passes and one backward pass, maintaining computational efficiency while improving faithfulness. We validate RelP across a range of models and tasks, showing that it more accurately approximates activation patching than standard attribution patching, particularly when analyzing residual stream and MLP outputs in the Indirect Object Identification (IOI) task. For instance, for MLP outputs in GPT-2 Large, attribution patching achieves a Pearson correlation of 0.006, whereas RelP reaches 0.956, highlighting the improvement offered by RelP. Additionally, we compare the faithfulness of sparse feature circuits identified by RelP and Integrated Gradients (IG), showing that RelP achieves comparable faithfulness without the extra computational cost associated with IG.</description>

      <title>Owen Sampling Accelerates Contribution Estimation in Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) aggregates information from multiple clients to train a shared global model without exposing raw data. Accurately estimating each client's contribution is essential not just for fair rewards, but for selecting the most useful clients so the global model converges faster. The Shapley value is a principled choice, yet exact computation scales exponentially with the number of clients, making it infeasible for large federations. We propose FedOwen, an efficient framework that uses Owen sampling to approximate Shapley values under the same total evaluation budget as existing methods while keeping the approximation error small. In addition, FedOwen uses an adaptive client selection strategy that balances exploiting high-value clients with exploring under-sampled ones, reducing bias and uncovering rare but informative data. Under a fixed valuation cost, FedOwen achieves up to 23 percent higher final accuracy within the same number of communication rounds compared to state-of-the-art baselines on non-IID benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Guess-and-Learn (G&amp;L): Measuring the Cumulative Error Cost of Cold-Start Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evaluation of machine learning models typically emphasizes final accuracy, overlooking the cost of adaptation: the cumulative errors incurred while learning from scratch. Guess-and- Learn (G&amp;L) v1.0 addresses this gap by measuring cold-start adaptability - the total mistakes a model makes while sequentially labeling an unlabeled dataset. At each step, the learner selects an instance, predicts its label, receives the ground truth, and updates parameters under either online (per-sample) or batch (delayed) mode. The resulting error trajectory exposes adaptation speed, selection quality, and bias - dynamics invisible to endpoint metrics.
  G&amp;L defines four tracks (Scratch/Pretrained $\times$ Online/Batch) to disentangle the effects of initialization and update frequency. We formalize the protocol, relate it to classical mistake-bound theory, and estimate a heuristic "oracle reference band" for MNIST as a plausibility reference. Baseline experiments on MNIST and AG News, spanning classical methods (Perceptron, k-NN), convolutional architectures (CNN, ResNet-50), and pretrained transformers (ViT-B/16, BERT-base), reveal systematic differences in early-phase efficiency: smaller models can adapt with fewer initial errors, while pretraining benefits vary by domain. Across settings, current models remain well above the oracle band, highlighting an adaptability gap.
  By quantifying the mistake cost of early learning, G&amp;L complements conventional benchmarks and provides a reproducible framework for developing learners that are not only accurate in the limit but also reliable from the first examples.</description>

      <title>CALM: A Framework for Continuous, Adaptive, and LLM-Mediated Anomaly Detection in Time-Series Streams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection of anomalies in non-stationary time-series streams is a critical but challenging task across numerous industrial and scientific domains. Traditional models, trained offline, suffer significant performance degradation when faced with concept drift, where the underlying statistical properties of the data change over time. This paper introduces CALM (Continuous, Adaptive, and LLM-Mediated), a novel, end-to-end framework for real-time anomaly detection designed to address this challenge. CALM is built on the Apache Beam distributed processing framework and leverages the TimesFm foundation model for forecasting-based anomaly detection. The framework's novelty lies in two core contributions. First, it implements a closed-loop, continuous fine-tuning mechanism that allows the anomaly detection model to adapt to evolving data patterns in near real-time. Second, it introduces an LLM-as-a-Judge component, a Large Language Model that provides semantic, context-aware judgments on detected anomalies to curate a high-quality training dataset, deciding whether an anomaly represents transient noise or a meaningful pattern shift. We evaluate CALM on the comprehensive TSB-UAD benchmark. Our results demonstrate that the continuously fine-tuned model improves the ROC AUC score in most datasets compared to the static, pre-trained base model, validating the efficacy of our adaptive, LLM-guided approach to maintaining high-performance anomaly detection in dynamic streaming environments.</description>

      <title>Detecting Domain Shifts in Myoelectric Activations: Challenges and Opportunities in Stream Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting domain shifts in myoelectric activations poses a significant challenge due to the inherent non-stationarity of electromyography (EMG) signals. This paper explores the detection of domain shifts using data stream (DS) learning techniques, focusing on the DB6 dataset from the Ninapro database. We define domains as distinct time-series segments based on different subjects and recording sessions, applying Kernel Principal Component Analysis (KPCA) with a cosine kernel to pre-process and highlight these shifts. By evaluating multiple drift detection methods such as CUSUM, Page-Hinckley, and ADWIN, we reveal the limitations of current techniques in achieving high performance for real-time domain shift detection in EMG signals. Our results underscore the potential of streaming-based approaches for maintaining stable EMG decoding models, while highlighting areas for further research to enhance robustness and accuracy in real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>MyGO: Memory Yielding Generative Offline-consolidation for Lifelong Learning Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continual or Lifelong Learning aims to develop models capable of acquiring new knowledge from a sequence of tasks without catastrophically forgetting what has been learned before. Existing approaches often rely on storing samples from previous tasks (experience replay) or employing complex regularization terms to protect learned weights. However, these methods face challenges related to data privacy, storage limitations, and performance degradation when tasks are dissimilar. To address these challenges, we introduce MyGO (Memory Yielding Generative Offline-consolidation), a novel lifelong learning framework inspired by the biological wake-sleep cycle. During the "wake" phase, the system rapidly learns a new task and trains a compact generative model (Generative Memory, G-mem) to capture its data distribution. During the "sleep" phase, the system enters an offline state, using all learned G-mem models to generate pseudo-data ("dreams") and consolidate new and old knowledge into a core feature extractor via knowledge distillation. This approach obviates the need to store any raw data, retaining only compact generative models, which offers significant advantages in privacy and storage efficiency. We evaluate MyGO on computer vision (Split-MNIST) and natural language processing (Split-AG News) benchmarks, comparing it against a sequential fine-tuning baseline. The results demonstrate that MyGO significantly mitigates catastrophic forgetting and maintains high average accuracy across tasks, proving the framework's effectiveness and domain-generality.</description>

      <title>Improving Fisher Information Estimation and Efficiency for LoRA-based LLM Unlearning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LLMs have demonstrated remarkable performance across various tasks but face challenges related to unintentionally generating outputs containing sensitive information. A straightforward approach to address this issue is to retrain the model after excluding the problematic data. However, this approach incurs prohibitively high computational costs. To overcome this limitation, machine unlearning has emerged as a promising solution that can effectively remove sensitive information without the need to retrain the model from scratch. Recently, FILA has been proposed as a parameter-efficient unlearning method by integrating LoRA adapters. Specifically, it calculates the Fisher information to identify parameters associated with the forget set and assigns them to LoRA adapters for updates. Despite its innovative approach, FILA still requires access to all model parameters and does not adequately account for fundamental assumptions underlying Fisher information, leading to inaccuracies in importance estimation. To address these limitations, we propose VILA, a novel unlearning framework that explicitly considers the assumptions overlooked in FILA, thereby enhancing the accuracy of parameter identification for the forget set. Moreover, VILA significantly reduces computational costs by enabling parameter identification without accessing the entire model. Our method achieves up to 100x higher parameter efficiency and 40x faster training speed compared to FILA, and sets new state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks including TOFU, WMDP, and MUSE. Our code is available at https://github.com/kyj93790/VILA.</description>

      <title>Convergence of regularized agent-state-based Q-learning in POMDPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a framework to understand the convergence of commonly used Q-learning reinforcement learning algorithms in practice. Two salient features of such algorithms are: (i)~the Q-table is recursively updated using an agent state (such as the state of a recurrent neural network) which is not a belief state or an information state and (ii)~policy regularization is often used to encourage exploration and stabilize the learning algorithm. We investigate the simplest form of such Q-learning algorithms which we call regularized agent-state-based Q-learning (RASQL) and show that it converges under mild technical conditions to the fixed point of an appropriately defined regularized MDP, which depends on the stationary distribution induced by the behavioral policy. We also show that a similar analysis continues to work for a variant of RASQL that learns periodic policies. We present numerical examples to illustrate that the empirical convergence behavior matches with the proposed theoretical limit.</description>

      <title>Distribution-Aware Feature Selection for SAEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) decompose neural activations into interpretable features. A widely adopted variant, the TopK SAE, reconstructs each token from its K most active latents. However, this approach is inefficient, as some tokens carry more information than others. BatchTopK addresses this limitation by selecting top activations across a batch of tokens. This improves average reconstruction but risks an "activation lottery," where rare high-magnitude features crowd out more informative but lower-magnitude ones. To address this issue, we introduce Sampled-SAE: we score the columns (representing features) of the batch activation matrix (via $L_2$ norm or entropy), forming a candidate pool of size $Kl$, and then apply Top-$K$ to select tokens across the batch from the restricted pool of features. Varying $l$ traces a spectrum between batch-level and token-specific selection. At $l=1$, tokens draw only from $K$ globally influential features, while larger $l$ expands the pool toward standard BatchTopK and more token-specific features across the batch. Small $l$ thus enforces global consistency; large $l$ favors fine-grained reconstruction. On Pythia-160M, no single value optimizes $l$ across all metrics: the best choice depends on the trade-off between shared structure, reconstruction fidelity, and downstream performance. Sampled-SAE thus reframes BatchTopK as a tunable, distribution-aware family.</description>

      <title>Stage-Diff: Stage-wise Long-Term Time Series Generation Based on Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative models have been successfully used in the field of time series generation. However, when dealing with long-term time series, which span over extended periods and exhibit more complex long-term temporal patterns, the task of generation becomes significantly more challenging. Long-term time series exhibit long-range temporal dependencies, but their data distribution also undergoes gradual changes over time. Finding a balance between these long-term dependencies and the drift in data distribution is a key challenge. On the other hand, long-term time series contain more complex interrelationships between different feature sequences, making the task of effectively capturing both intra-sequence and inter-sequence dependencies another important challenge. To address these issues, we propose Stage-Diff, a staged generative model for long-term time series based on diffusion models. First, through stage-wise sequence generation and inter-stage information transfer, the model preserves long-term sequence dependencies while enabling the modeling of data distribution shifts. Second, within each stage, progressive sequence decomposition is applied to perform channel-independent modeling at different time scales, while inter-stage information transfer utilizes multi-channel fusion modeling. This approach combines the robustness of channel-independent modeling with the information fusion advantages of multi-channel modeling, effectively balancing the intra-sequence and inter-sequence dependencies of long-term time series. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of Stage-Diff in long-term time series generation tasks.</description>

      <title>DLGAN : Time Series Synthesis Based on Dual-Layer Generative Adversarial Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time series synthesis is an effective approach to ensuring the secure circulation of time series data. Existing time series synthesis methods typically perform temporal modeling based on random sequences to generate target sequences, which often struggle to ensure the temporal dependencies in the generated time series. Additionally, directly modeling temporal features on random sequences makes it challenging to accurately capture the feature information of the original time series. To address the above issues, we propose a simple but effective generative model \textbf{D}ual-\textbf{L}ayer \textbf{G}enerative \textbf{A}dversarial \textbf{N}etworks, named \textbf{DLGAN}. The model decomposes the time series generation process into two stages: sequence feature extraction and sequence reconstruction. First, these two stages form a complete time series autoencoder, enabling supervised learning on the original time series to ensure that the reconstruction process can restore the temporal dependencies of the sequence. Second, a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is used to generate synthetic feature vectors that align with the real-time sequence feature vectors, ensuring that the generator can capture the temporal features from real time series. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate the superiority of this model across various evaluation metrics.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Heavy-Tailed Stochastic Gradient Descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the era of large-scale neural network models, optimization algorithms often struggle with generalization due to an overreliance on training loss. One key insight widely accepted in the machine learning community is the idea that wide basins (regions around a local minimum where the loss increases gradually) promote better generalization by offering greater stability to small changes in input data or model parameters. In contrast, sharp minima are typically more sensitive and less stable. Motivated by two key empirical observations - the inherent heavy-tailed distribution of gradient noise in stochastic gradient descent and the Edge of Stability phenomenon during neural network training, in which curvature grows before settling at a plateau, we introduce Adaptive Heavy Tailed Stochastic Gradient Descent (AHTSGD). The algorithm injects heavier-tailed noise into the optimizer during the early stages of training to enhance exploration and gradually transitions to lighter-tailed noise as sharpness stabilizes. By dynamically adapting to the sharpness of the loss landscape throughout training, AHTSGD promotes accelerated convergence to wide basins. AHTSGD is the first algorithm to adjust the nature of injected noise into an optimizer based on the Edge of Stability phenomenon. AHTSGD consistently outperforms SGD and other noise-based methods on benchmarks like MNIST and CIFAR-10, with marked gains on noisy datasets such as SVHN. It ultimately accelerates early training from poor initializations and improves generalization across clean and noisy settings, remaining robust to learning rate choices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Do neural networks build their representations through smooth, gradual refinement, or via more complex computational processes? We investigate this by extending the logit lens to analyze the policy network of Leela Chess Zero, a superhuman chess engine. We find strong monotonic trends in playing strength and puzzle-solving ability across layers, yet policy distributions frequently follow non-smooth trajectories. Evidence for this includes correct puzzle solutions that are discovered early but subsequently discarded, move rankings that remain poorly correlated with final outputs, and high policy divergence until late in the network. These findings contrast with the smooth distributional convergence typically observed in language models.</description>

      <title>PMODE: Theoretically Grounded and Modular Mixture Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce PMODE (Partitioned Mixture Of Density Estimators), a general and modular framework for mixture modeling with both parametric and nonparametric components. PMODE builds mixtures by partitioning the data and fitting separate estimators to each subset. It attains near-optimal rates for this estimator class and remains valid even when the mixture components come from different distribution families. As an application, we develop MV-PMODE, which scales a previously theoretical approach to high-dimensional density estimation to settings with thousands of dimensions. Despite its simplicity, it performs competitively against deep baselines on CIFAR-10 anomaly detection.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking the State of Networks with a Low-Cost Method Based on Reservoir Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using data from mobile network utilization in Norway, we showcase the possibility of monitoring the state of communication and mobility networks with a non-invasive, low-cost method. This method transforms the network data into a model within the framework of reservoir computing and then measures the model's performance on proxy tasks. Experimentally, we show how the performance on these proxies relates to the state of the network. A key advantage of this approach is that it uses readily available data sets and leverages the reservoir computing framework for an inexpensive and largely agnostic method. Data from mobile network utilization is available in an anonymous, aggregated form with multiple snapshots per day. This data can be treated like a weighted network. Reservoir computing allows the use of weighted, but untrained networks as a machine learning tool. The network, initialized as a so-called echo state network (ESN), projects incoming signals into a higher dimensional space, on which a single trained layer operates. This consumes less energy than deep neural networks in which every weight of the network is trained. We use neuroscience inspired tasks and trained our ESN model to solve them. We then show how the performance depends on certain network configurations and also how it visibly decreases when perturbing the network. While this work serves as proof of concept, we believe it can be elevated to be used for near-real-time monitoring as well as the identification of possible weak spots of both mobile communication networks as well as transportation networks.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Layer-wise Model Merging through Chain of Merges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fine-tuning pretrained models has become a standard pathway to achieve state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of domains, leading to a proliferation of task-specific model variants. As the number of such specialized modules in-creases, merging them into a unified model without retraining has become a critical challenge. Existing merging techniques often rely on interference heuristics,importance weighting, or activation matching while treating each layer independently, thereby failing to account for the inter-layer dependencies inherent in deep networks. This simplification leads to distributional mismatches, especially inactivation-based methods, when changes in early layers are not properly reflected in downstream ones. We identify these mismatches as a form of internal covariate shift, comparable to the phenomenon encountered in the initial phases of neural networks training. To address it, we propose Chain of Merges (CoM), a layer-wise merging procedure that updates activation statistics in an auto-regressive fashion, explicitly accounting for cross-layer interactions. CoM produces a coherent merged model through a series of conditionally optimal updates, effectively mitigating degradation caused by covariate shift. Experiments on standard bench-marks demonstrate that CoM achieves state-of-the-art performance.</description>

      <title>Quantum enhanced ensemble GANs for anomaly detection in continuous biomanufacturing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of continuous biomanufacturing processes requires robust and early anomaly detection, since even minor deviations can compromise yield and stability, leading to disruptions in scheduling, reduced weekly production, and diminished economic performance. These processes are inherently complex and exhibit non-linear dynamics with intricate relationships between process variables, thus making advanced methods for anomaly detection essential for efficient operation. In this work, we present a novel framework for unsupervised anomaly detection in continuous biomanufacturing based on an ensemble of generative adversarial networks (GANs). We first establish a benchmark dataset simulating both normal and anomalous operation regimes in a continuous process for the production of a small molecule. We then demonstrate the effectiveness of our GAN-based framework in detecting anomalies caused by sudden feedstock variability. Finally, we evaluate the impact of using a hybrid quantum/classical GAN approach with both a simulated quantum circuit and a real photonic quantum processor on anomaly detection performance. We find that the hybrid approach yields improved anomaly detection rates. Our work shows the potential of hybrid quantum/classical approaches for solving real-world problems in complex continuous biomanufacturing processes.</description>

      <title>Beyond expected value: geometric mean optimization for long-term policy performance in reinforcement learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms typically optimize the expected cumulative reward, i.e., the expected value of the sum of scalar rewards an agent receives over the course of a trajectory. The expected value averages the performance over an infinite number of trajectories. However, when deploying the agent in the real world, this ensemble average may be uninformative for the performance of individual trajectories. Thus, in many applications, optimizing the long-term performance of individual trajectories might be more desirable. In this work, we propose a novel RL algorithm that combines the standard ensemble average with the time-average growth rate, a measure for the long-term performance of individual trajectories. We first define the Bellman operator for the time-average growth rate. We then show that, under multiplicative reward dynamics, the geometric mean aligns with the time-average growth rate. To address more general and unknown reward dynamics, we propose a modified geometric mean with $N$-sliding window that captures the path-dependency as an estimator for the time-average growth rate. This estimator is embedded as a regularizer into the objective, forming a practical algorithm and enabling the policy to benefit from ensemble average and time-average simultaneously. We evaluate our algorithm in challenging simulations, where it outperforms conventional RL methods.</description>

      <title>Normalized Maximum Likelihood Code-Length on Riemannian Manifold Data Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, with the large-scale expansion of graph data, there has been an increased focus on Riemannian manifold data spaces other than Euclidean space. In particular, the development of hyperbolic spaces has been remarkable, and they have high expressive power for graph data with hierarchical structures. Normalized Maximum Likelihood (NML) is employed in regret minimization and model selection. However, existing formulations of NML have been developed primarily in Euclidean spaces and are inherently dependent on the choice of coordinate systems, making it non-trivial to extend NML to Riemannian manifolds. In this study, we define a new NML that reflects the geometric structure of Riemannian manifolds, called the Riemannian manifold NML (Rm-NML). This Rm-NML is invariant under coordinate transformations and coincides with the conventional NML under the natural parameterization in Euclidean space. We extend existing computational techniques for NML to the setting of Riemannian manifolds. Furthermore, we derive a method to simplify the computation of Rm-NML on Riemannian symmetric spaces, which encompass data spaces of growing interest such as hyperbolic spaces. To illustrate the practical application of our proposed method, we explicitly computed the Rm-NML for normal distributions on hyperbolic spaces.</description>

      <title>Controllable 3D Molecular Generation for Structure-Based Drug Design Through Bayesian Flow Networks and Gradient Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in Structure-based Drug Design (SBDD) have leveraged generative models for 3D molecular generation, predominantly evaluating model performance by binding affinity to target proteins. However, practical drug discovery necessitates high binding affinity along with synthetic feasibility and selectivity, critical properties that were largely neglected in previous evaluations. To address this gap, we identify fundamental limitations of conventional diffusion-based generative models in effectively guiding molecule generation toward these diverse pharmacological properties. We propose CByG, a novel framework extending Bayesian Flow Network into a gradient-based conditional generative model that robustly integrates property-specific guidance. Additionally, we introduce a comprehensive evaluation scheme incorporating practical benchmarks for binding affinity, synthetic feasibility, and selectivity, overcoming the limitations of conventional evaluation methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed CByG framework significantly outperforms baseline models across multiple essential evaluation criteria, highlighting its effectiveness and practicality for real-world drug discovery applications.</description>

      <title>Priors Matter: Addressing Misspecification in Bayesian Deep Q-Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Uncertainty quantification in reinforcement learning can greatly improve exploration and robustness. Approximate Bayesian approaches have recently been popularized to quantify uncertainty in model-free algorithms. However, so far the focus has been on improving the accuracy of the posterior approximation, instead of studying the accuracy of the prior and likelihood assumptions underlying the posterior. In this work, we demonstrate that there is a cold posterior effect in Bayesian deep Q-learning, where contrary to theory, performance increases when reducing the temperature of the posterior. To identify and overcome likely causes, we challenge common assumptions made on the likelihood and priors in Bayesian model-free algorithms. We empirically study prior distributions and show through statistical tests that the common Gaussian likelihood assumption is frequently violated. We argue that developing more suitable likelihoods and priors should be a key focus in future Bayesian reinforcement learning research and we offer simple, implementable solutions for better priors in deep Q-learning that lead to more performant Bayesian algorithms.</description>

      <title>Failure Prediction Is a Better Performance Proxy for Early-Exit Networks Than Calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Early-exit models speed up inference by attaching internal classifiers to intermediate layers of the model and allowing computation to stop once a prediction satisfies an exit criterion. Most early-exit methods rely on confidence-based exit strategies, which motivated some works to calibrate intermediate classifiers to improve the performance of the entire model. In this paper, we show that calibration measures can be misleading indicators of the performance of multi-exit models: a well-calibrated classifier may still waste computation, and common calibration methods do not preserve the sample ranking within a classifier. We demonstrate empirical cases where miscalibrated networks outperform calibrated ones. As an alternative, we propose to use failure prediction as a more useful proxy for early-exit model performance. Unlike calibration, failure prediction accounts for changes in the ranking of samples and shows a strong correlation with efficiency improvements, making it a more dependable basis for designing and evaluating early-exit models.</description>

      <title>Spiking Decision Transformers: Local Plasticity, Phase-Coding, and Dendritic Routing for Low-Power Sequence Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning agents based on Transformer architectures have achieved impressive performance on sequential decision-making tasks, but their reliance on dense matrix operations makes them ill-suited for energy-constrained, edge-oriented platforms. Spiking neural networks promise ultra-low-power, event-driven inference, yet no prior work has seamlessly merged spiking dynamics with return-conditioned sequence modeling. We present the Spiking Decision Transformer (SNN-DT), which embeds Leaky Integrate-and-Fire neurons into each self-attention block, trains end-to-end via surrogate gradients, and incorporates biologically inspired three-factor plasticity, phase-shifted spike-based positional encodings, and a lightweight dendritic routing module. Our implementation matches or exceeds standard Decision Transformer performance on classic control benchmarks (CartPole-v1, MountainCar-v0, Acrobot-v1, Pendulum-v1) while emitting fewer than ten spikes per decision, an energy proxy suggesting over four orders-of-magnitude reduction in per inference energy. By marrying sequence modeling with neuromorphic efficiency, SNN-DT opens a pathway toward real-time, low-power control on embedded and wearable devices.</description>

      <title>Accept or Deny? Evaluating LLM Fairness and Performance in Loan Approval across Table-to-Text Serialization Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly employed in high-stakes decision-making tasks, such as loan approvals. While their applications expand across domains, LLMs struggle to process tabular data, ensuring fairness and delivering reliable predictions. In this work, we assess the performance and fairness of LLMs on serialized loan approval datasets from three geographically distinct regions: Ghana, Germany, and the United States. Our evaluation focuses on the model's zero-shot and in-context learning (ICL) capabilities. Our results reveal that the choice of serialization (Serialization refers to the process of converting tabular data into text formats suitable for processing by LLMs.) format significantly affects both performance and fairness in LLMs, with certain formats such as GReat and LIFT yielding higher F1 scores but exacerbating fairness disparities. Notably, while ICL improved model performance by 4.9-59.6% relative to zero-shot baselines, its effect on fairness varied considerably across datasets. Our work underscores the importance of effective tabular data representation methods and fairness-aware models to improve the reliability of LLMs in financial decision-making.</description>

      <title>On the Hardness of Learning GNN-based SAT Solvers: The Role of Graph Ricci Curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have recently shown promise as solvers for Boolean Satisfiability Problems (SATs) by operating on graph representations of logical formulas. However, their performance degrades sharply on harder instances, raising the question of whether this reflects fundamental architectural limitations. In this work, we provide a geometric explanation through the lens of graph Ricci Curvature (RC), which quantifies local connectivity bottlenecks. We prove that bipartite graphs derived from random k-SAT formulas are inherently negatively curved, and that this curvature decreases with instance difficulty. Building on this, we show that GNN-based SAT solvers are affected by oversquashing, a phenomenon where long-range dependencies become impossible to compress into fixed-length representations. We validate our claims empirically across different SAT benchmarks and confirm that curvature is both a strong indicator of problem complexity and can be used to predict performance. Finally, we connect our findings to design principles of existing solvers and outline promising directions for future work.</description>

      <title>What Data is Really Necessary? A Feasibility Study of Inference Data Minimization for Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data minimization is a legal principle requiring personal data processing to be limited to what is necessary for a specified purpose. Operationalizing this principle for recommender systems, which rely on extensive personal data, remains a significant challenge. This paper conducts a feasibility study on minimizing implicit feedback inference data for such systems. We propose a novel problem formulation, analyze various minimization techniques, and investigate key factors influencing their effectiveness. We demonstrate that substantial inference data reduction is technically feasible without significant performance loss. However, its practicality is critically determined by two factors: the technical setting (e.g., performance targets, choice of model) and user characteristics (e.g., history size, preference complexity). Thus, while we establish its technical feasibility, we conclude that data minimization remains practically challenging and its dependence on the technical and user context makes a universal standard for data `necessity' difficult to implement.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive Signal Quality Evaluation of a Wearable Textile ECG Garment: A Sex-Balanced Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel wearable textile-garment featuring an innovative electrode placement aimed at minimizing noise and motion artifacts, thereby enhancing signal fidelity in Electrocardiography (ECG) recordings. We present a comprehensive, sex-balanced evaluation involving 15 healthy males and 15 healthy female participants to ensure the device's suitability across anatomical and physiological variations. The assessment framework encompasses distinct evaluation approaches: quantitative signal quality indices to objectively benchmark device performance; rhythm-based analyzes of physiological parameters such as heart rate and heart rate variability; machine learning classification tasks to assess application-relevant predictive utility; morphological analysis of ECG features including amplitude and interval parameters; and investigations of the effects of electrode projection angle given by the textile / body shape, with all analyzes stratified by sex to elucidate sex-specific influences. Evaluations were conducted across various activity phases representing real-world conditions. The results demonstrate that the textile system achieves signal quality highly concordant with reference devices in both rhythm and morphological analyses, exhibits robust classification performance, and enables identification of key sex-specific determinants affecting signal acquisition. These findings underscore the practical viability of textile-based ECG garments for physiological monitoring as well as psychophysiological state detection. Moreover, we identify the importance of incorporating sex-specific design considerations to ensure equitable and reliable cardiac diagnostics in wearable health technologies.</description>

      <title>Limitations of Physics-Informed Neural Networks: a Study on Smart Grid Surrogation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) present a transformative approach for smart grid modeling by integrating physical laws directly into learning frameworks, addressing critical challenges of data scarcity and physical consistency in conventional data-driven methods. This paper evaluates PINNs' capabilities as surrogate models for smart grid dynamics, comparing their performance against XGBoost, Random Forest, and Linear Regression across three key experiments: interpolation, cross-validation, and episodic trajectory prediction. By training PINNs exclusively through physics-based loss functions (enforcing power balance, operational constraints, and grid stability) we demonstrate their superior generalization, outperforming data-driven models in error reduction. Notably, PINNs maintain comparatively lower MAE in dynamic grid operations, reliably capturing state transitions in both random and expert-driven control scenarios, while traditional models exhibit erratic performance. Despite slight degradation in extreme operational regimes, PINNs consistently enforce physical feasibility, proving vital for safety-critical applications. Our results contribute to establishing PINNs as a paradigm-shifting tool for smart grid surrogation, bridging data-driven flexibility with first-principles rigor. This work advances real-time grid control and scalable digital twins, emphasizing the necessity of physics-aware architectures in mission-critical energy systems.</description>

      <title>Summarize-Exemplify-Reflect: Data-driven Insight Distillation Empowers LLMs for Few-shot Tabular Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies show the promise of large language models (LLMs) for few-shot tabular classification but highlight challenges due to the variability in structured data. To address this, we propose distilling data into actionable insights to enable robust and effective classification by LLMs. Drawing inspiration from human learning processes, we introduce InsightTab, an insight distillation framework guided by principles of divide-and-conquer, easy-first, and reflective learning. Our approach integrates rule summarization, strategic exemplification, and insight reflection through deep collaboration between LLMs and data modeling techniques. The obtained insights enable LLMs to better align their general knowledge and capabilities with the particular requirements of specific tabular tasks. We extensively evaluate InsightTab on nine datasets. The results demonstrate consistent improvement over state-of-the-art methods. Ablation studies further validate the principle-guided distillation process, while analyses emphasize InsightTab's effectiveness in leveraging labeled data and managing bias.</description>

      <title>OASIS: Harnessing Diffusion Adversarial Network for Ocean Salinity Imputation using Sparse Drifter Trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ocean salinity plays a vital role in circulation, climate, and marine ecosystems, yet its measurement is often sparse, irregular, and noisy, especially in drifter-based datasets. Traditional approaches, such as remote sensing and optimal interpolation, rely on linearity and stationarity, and are limited by cloud cover, sensor drift, and low satellite revisit rates. While machine learning models offer flexibility, they often fail under severe sparsity and lack principled ways to incorporate physical covariates without specialized sensors. In this paper, we introduce the OceAn Salinity Imputation System (OASIS), a novel diffusion adversarial framework designed to address these challenges.</description>

      <title>Convergence of Stochastic Gradient Methods for Wide Two-Layer Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics informed neural networks (PINNs) represent a very popular class of neural solvers for partial differential equations. In practice, one often employs stochastic gradient descent type algorithms to train the neural network. Therefore, the convergence guarantee of stochastic gradient descent is of fundamental importance. In this work, we establish the linear convergence of stochastic gradient descent / flow in training over-parameterized two layer PINNs for a general class of activation functions in the sense of high probability. These results extend the existing result [18] in which gradient descent was analyzed. The challenge of the analysis lies in handling the dynamic randomness introduced by stochastic optimization methods. The key of the analysis lies in ensuring the positive definiteness of suitable Gram matrices during the training. The analysis sheds insight into the dynamics of the optimization process, and provides guarantees on the neural networks trained by stochastic algorithms.</description>

      <title>Introduction to the Analysis of Probabilistic Decision-Making Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decision theories offer principled methods for making choices under various types of uncertainty. Algorithms that implement these theories have been successfully applied to a wide range of real-world problems, including materials and drug discovery. Indeed, they are desirable since they can adaptively gather information to make better decisions in the future, resulting in data-efficient workflows. In scientific discovery, where experiments are costly, these algorithms can thus significantly reduce the cost of experimentation. Theoretical analyses of these algorithms are crucial for understanding their behavior and providing valuable insights for developing next-generation algorithms. However, theoretical analyses in the literature are often inaccessible to non-experts. This monograph aims to provide an accessible, self-contained introduction to the theoretical analysis of commonly used probabilistic decision-making algorithms, including bandit algorithms, Bayesian optimization, and tree search algorithms. Only basic knowledge of probability theory and statistics, along with some elementary knowledge about Gaussian processes, is assumed.</description>

      <title>Predicting Social Media Engagement from Emotional and Temporal Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a machine learning approach for predicting social media engagement (comments and likes) from emotional and temporal features. The dataset contains 600 songs with annotations for valence, arousal, and related sentiment metrics. A multi target regression model based on HistGradientBoostingRegressor is trained on log transformed engagement ratios to address skewed targets. Performance is evaluated with both a custom order of magnitude accuracy and standard regression metrics, including the coefficient of determination (R^2). Results show that emotional and temporal metadata, together with existing view counts, predict future engagement effectively. The model attains R^2 = 0.98 for likes but only R^2 = 0.41 for comments. This gap indicates that likes are largely driven by readily captured affective and exposure signals, whereas comments depend on additional factors not represented in the current feature set.</description>

      <title>Activation Subspaces for Out-of-Distribution Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To ensure the reliability of deep models in real-world applications, out-of-distribution (OOD) detection methods aim to distinguish samples close to the training distribution (in-distribution, ID) from those farther away (OOD). In this work, we propose a novel OOD detection method that utilizes singular value decomposition of the weight matrix of the classification head to decompose the model's activations into decisive and insignificant components, which contribute maximally, respectively minimally, to the final classifier output. We find that the subspace of insignificant components more effectively distinguishes ID from OOD data than raw activations in regimes of large distribution shifts (Far-OOD). This occurs because the classification objective leaves the insignificant subspace largely unaffected, yielding features that are ''untainted'' by the target classification task. Conversely, in regimes of smaller distribution shifts (Near-OOD), we find that activation shaping methods profit from only considering the decisive subspace, as the insignificant component can cause interference in the activation space. By combining two findings into a single approach, termed ActSub, we achieve state-of-the-art results in various standard OOD benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Inferring Effects of Major Events through Discontinuity Forecasting of Population Anxiety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimating community-specific mental health effects of local events is vital for public health policy. While forecasting mental health scores alone offers limited insights into the impact of events on community well-being, quasi-experimental designs like the Longitudinal Regression Discontinuity Design (LRDD) from econometrics help researchers derive more effects that are more likely to be causal from observational data. LRDDs aim to extrapolate the size of changes in an outcome (e.g. a discontinuity in running scores for anxiety) due to a time-specific event. Here, we propose adapting LRDDs beyond traditional forecasting into a statistical learning framework whereby future discontinuities (i.e. time-specific shifts) and changes in slope (i.e. linear trajectories) are estimated given a location's history of the score, dynamic covariates (other running assessments), and exogenous variables (static representations). Applying our framework to predict discontinuities in the anxiety of US counties from COVID-19 events, we found the task was difficult but more achievable as the sophistication of models was increased, with the best results coming from integrating exogenous and dynamic covariates. Our approach shows strong improvement ($r=+.46$ for discontinuity and $r = +.65$ for slope) over traditional static community representations. Discontinuity forecasting raises new possibilities for estimating the idiosyncratic effects of potential future or hypothetical events on specific communities.</description>

      <title>Neural Network Acceleration on MPSoC board: Integrating SLAC's SNL, Rogue Software and Auto-SNL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The LCLS-II Free Electron Laser (FEL) will generate X-ray pulses for beamline experiments at rates of up to 1~MHz, with detectors producing data throughputs exceeding 1 TB/s. Managing such massive data streams presents significant challenges, as transmission and storage infrastructures become prohibitively expensive. Machine learning (ML) offers a promising solution for real-time data reduction, but conventional implementations introduce excessive latency, making them unsuitable for high-speed experimental environments. To address these challenges, SLAC developed the SLAC Neural Network Library (SNL), a specialized framework designed to deploy real-time ML inference models on Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA). SNL's key feature is the ability to dynamically update model weights without requiring FPGA resynthesis, enhancing flexibility for adaptive learning applications. To further enhance usability and accessibility, we introduce Auto-SNL, a Python extension that streamlines the process of converting Python-based neural network models into SNL-compatible high-level synthesis code. This paper presents a benchmark comparison against hls4ml, the current state-of-the-art tool, across multiple neural network architectures, fixed-point precisions, and synthesis configurations targeting a Xilinx ZCU102 FPGA. The results showed that SNL achieves competitive or superior latency in most tested architectures, while in some cases also offering FPGA resource savings. This adaptation demonstrates SNL's versatility, opening new opportunities for researchers and academics in fields such as high-energy physics, medical imaging, robotics, and many more.</description>

      <title>UniMLR: Modeling Implicit Class Significance for Multi-Label Ranking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing multi-label ranking (MLR) frameworks only exploit information deduced from the bipartition of labels into positive and negative sets. Therefore, they do not benefit from ranking among positive labels, which is the novel MLR approach we introduce in this paper. We propose UniMLR, a new MLR paradigm that models implicit class relevance/significance values as probability distributions using the ranking among positive labels, rather than treating them as equally important. This approach unifies ranking and classification tasks associated with MLR. Additionally, we address the challenges of scarcity and annotation bias in MLR datasets by introducing eight synthetic datasets (Ranked MNISTs) generated with varying significance-determining factors, providing an enriched and controllable experimental environment. We statistically demonstrate that our method accurately learns a representation of the positive rank order, which is consistent with the ground truth and proportional to the underlying significance values. Finally, we conduct comprehensive empirical experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets, demonstrating the value of our proposed framework.</description>

      <title>Learning Unified Representations from Heterogeneous Data for Robust Heart Rate Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heart rate prediction is vital for personalized health monitoring and fitness, while it frequently faces a critical challenge when deploying in real-world: data heterogeneity. We classify it in two key dimensions: source heterogeneity from fragmented device markets with varying feature sets, and user heterogeneity reflecting distinct physiological patterns across individuals and activities. Existing methods either discard device-specific information, or fail to model user-specific differences, limiting their real-world performance. To address this, we propose a framework that learns latent representations agnostic to both heterogeneity, enabling downstream predictors to work consistently under heterogeneous data patterns. Specifically, we introduce a random feature dropout strategy to handle source heterogeneity, making the model robust to various feature sets. To manage user heterogeneity, we employ a time-aware attention module to capture long-term physiological traits and use a contrastive learning objective to build a discriminative representation space. To reflect the heterogeneous nature of real-world data, we created and publicly released a new benchmark dataset, ParroTao. Evaluations on both ParroTao and the public FitRec dataset show that our model significantly outperforms existing baselines by 17% and 15%, respectively. Furthermore, analysis of the learned representations demonstrates their strong discriminative power, and one downstream application task confirm the practical value of our model.</description>

      <title>MoE-Health: A Mixture of Experts Framework for Robust Multimodal Healthcare Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Healthcare systems generate diverse multimodal data, including Electronic Health Records (EHR), clinical notes, and medical images. Effectively leveraging this data for clinical prediction is challenging, particularly as real-world samples often present with varied or incomplete modalities. Existing approaches typically require complete modality data or rely on manual selection strategies, limiting their applicability in real-world clinical settings where data availability varies across patients and institutions. To address these limitations, we propose MoE-Health, a novel Mixture of Experts framework designed for robust multimodal fusion in healthcare prediction. MoE-Health architecture is specifically developed to handle samples with differing modalities and improve performance on critical clinical tasks. By leveraging specialized expert networks and a dynamic gating mechanism, our approach dynamically selects and combines relevant experts based on available data modalities, enabling flexible adaptation to varying data availability scenarios. We evaluate MoE-Health on the MIMIC-IV dataset across three critical clinical prediction tasks: in-hospital mortality prediction, long length of stay, and hospital readmission prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that MoE-Health achieves superior performance compared to existing multimodal fusion methods while maintaining robustness across different modality availability patterns. The framework effectively integrates multimodal information, offering improved predictive performance and robustness in handling heterogeneous and incomplete healthcare data, making it particularly suitable for deployment in diverse healthcare environments with heterogeneous data availability.</description>

      <title>QR-LoRA: QR-Based Low-Rank Adaptation for Efficient Fine-Tuning of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing scale of Large Language Models (LLMs) has necessitated the development of parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a promising approach, reducing the number of trainable parameters by applying low-rank updates to pretrained weights. While standard LoRA learns both update factors directly, several recent variants first initialize those matrices via an SVD of the pretrained weights -- an operation that can be expensive on large models and yields singular vectors that are not always easy to interpret. In this work, we extract an orthonormal basis from the pretrained weight matrix using QR decomposition with column pivoting, and then express the LoRA update as a linear combination of these basis vectors -- training only the scalar coefficients, which imposes clear structure on adaptation and drastically reduces parameter count. Experiments across GLUE tasks show that QR-LoRA matches or exceeds the performance of full fine-tuning, standard LoRA, and SVD-LoRA (LoRA with update matrices initialized via singular value decomposition) with as few as 601 parameters -- a reduction of over 1000x compared to full fine-tuning and 77x fewer than typical LoRA setups.</description>

      <title>Achieving Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Under R\'enyi Differential Privacy for Fair and Private Data Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As privacy regulations such as the GDPR and HIPAA and responsibility frameworks for artificial intelligence such as the AI Act gain traction, the ethical and responsible use of real-world data faces increasing constraints. Synthetic data generation has emerged as a promising solution to risk-aware data sharing and model development, particularly for tabular datasets that are foundational to sensitive domains such as healthcare. To address both privacy and fairness concerns in this setting, we propose FLIP (Fair Latent Intervention under Privacy guarantees), a transformer-based variational autoencoder augmented with latent diffusion to generate heterogeneous tabular data. Unlike the typical setup in fairness-aware data generation, we assume a task-agnostic setup, not reliant on a fixed, defined downstream task, thus offering broader applicability. To ensure privacy, FLIP employs R\'enyi differential privacy (RDP) constraints during training and addresses fairness in the input space with RDP-compatible balanced sampling that accounts for group-specific noise levels across multiple sampling rates. In the latent space, we promote fairness by aligning neuron activation patterns across protected groups using Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA), a similarity measure extending the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC). This alignment encourages statistical independence between latent representations and the protected feature. Empirical results demonstrate that FLIP effectively provides significant fairness improvements for task-agnostic fairness and across diverse downstream tasks under differential privacy constraints.</description>

      <title>Pep2Prob Benchmark: Predicting Fragment Ion Probability for MS$^2$-based Proteomics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Proteins perform nearly all cellular functions and constitute most drug targets, making their analysis fundamental to understanding human biology in health and disease. Tandem mass spectrometry (MS$^2$) is the major analytical technique in proteomics that identifies peptides by ionizing them, fragmenting them, and using the resulting mass spectra to identify and quantify proteins in biological samples. In MS$^2$ analysis, peptide fragment ion probability prediction plays a critical role, enhancing the accuracy of peptide identification from mass spectra as a complement to the intensity information. Current approaches rely on global statistics of fragmentation, which assumes that a fragment's probability is uniform across all peptides. Nevertheless, this assumption is oversimplified from a biochemical principle point of view and limits accurate prediction. To address this gap, we present Pep2Prob, the first comprehensive dataset and benchmark designed for peptide-specific fragment ion probability prediction. The proposed dataset contains fragment ion probability statistics for 608,780 unique precursors (each precursor is a pair of peptide sequence and charge state), summarized from more than 183 million high-quality, high-resolution, HCD MS$^2$ spectra with validated peptide assignments and fragmentation annotations. We establish baseline performance using simple statistical rules and learning-based methods, and find that models leveraging peptide-specific information significantly outperform previous methods using only global fragmentation statistics. Furthermore, performance across benchmark models with increasing capacities suggests that the peptide-fragmentation relationship exhibits complex nonlinearities requiring sophisticated machine learning approaches.</description>

      <title>ImmunoAI: Accelerated Antibody Discovery Using Gradient-Boosted Machine Learning with Thermodynamic-Hydrodynamic Descriptors and 3D Geometric Interface Topology</title>

Abstract: Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) poses serious risks to pediatric, elderly, and immunocompromised populations. Traditional antibody discovery pipelines require 10-12 months, limiting their applicability for rapid outbreak response. This project introduces ImmunoAI, a machine learning framework that accelerates antibody discovery by predicting high-affinity candidates using gradient-boosted models trained on thermodynamic, hydrodynamic, and 3D topological interface descriptors. A dataset of 213 antibody-antigen complexes was curated to extract geometric and physicochemical features, and a LightGBM regressor was trained to predict binding affinity with high precision. The model reduced the antibody candidate search space by 89%, and fine-tuning on 117 SARS-CoV-2 binding pairs further reduced Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) from 1.70 to 0.92. In the absence of an experimental structure for the hMPV A2.2 variant, AlphaFold2 was used to predict its 3D structure. The fine-tuned model identified two optimal antibodies with predicted picomolar affinities targeting key mutation sites (G42V and E96K), making them excellent candidates for experimental testing. In summary, ImmunoAI shortens design cycles and enables faster, structure-informed responses to viral outbreaks.</description>

      <title>Quantum-inspired probability metrics define a complete, universal space for statistical learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Comparing probability distributions is a core challenge across the natural, social, and computational sciences. Existing methods, such as Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD), struggle in high-dimensional and non-compact domains. Here we introduce quantum probability metrics (QPMs), derived by embedding probability measures in the space of quantum states: positive, unit-trace operators on a Hilbert space. This construction extends kernel-based methods and overcomes the incompleteness of MMD on non-compact spaces. Viewed as an integral probability metric (IPM), QPMs have dual functions that uniformly approximate all bounded, uniformly continuous functions on $\mathbb{R}^n$, offering enhanced sensitivity to subtle distributional differences in high dimensions. For empirical distributions, QPMs are readily calculated using eigenvalue methods, with analytic gradients suited for learning and optimization. Although computationally more intensive for large sample sizes ($O(n^3)$ vs. $O(n^2)$), QPMs can significantly improve performance as a drop-in replacement for MMD, as demonstrated in a classic generative modeling task. By combining the rich mathematical framework of quantum mechanics with classical probability theory, this approach lays the foundation for powerful tools to analyze and manipulate probability measures.</description>

      <title>Advanced Deep Learning Techniques for Classifying Dental Conditions Using Panoramic X-Ray Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates deep learning methods for automated classification of dental conditions in panoramic X-ray images. A dataset of 1,512 radiographs with 11,137 expert-verified annotations across four conditions fillings, cavities, implants, and impacted teeth was used. After preprocessing and class balancing, three approaches were evaluated: a custom convolutional neural network (CNN), hybrid models combining CNN feature extraction with traditional classifiers, and fine-tuned pre-trained architectures. Experiments employed 5 fold cross validation with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score as evaluation metrics. The hybrid CNN Random Forest model achieved the highest performance with 85.4% accuracy, surpassing the custom CNN baseline of 74.3%. Among pre-trained models, VGG16 performed best at 82.3% accuracy, followed by Xception and ResNet50. Results show that hybrid models improve discrimination of morphologically similar conditions and provide efficient, reliable performance. These findings suggest that combining CNN-based feature extraction with ensemble classifiers offers a practical path toward automated dental diagnostic support, while also highlighting the need for larger datasets and further clinical validation.</description>

      <title>R-4B: Incentivizing General-Purpose Auto-Thinking Capability in MLLMs via Bi-Mode Annealing and Reinforce Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) equipped with step-by-step thinking capabilities have demonstrated remarkable performance on complex reasoning problems. However, this thinking process is redundant for simple problems solvable without complex reasoning. To address this inefficiency, we propose R-4B, an auto-thinking MLLM, which can adaptively decide when to think based on problem complexity. The central idea of R-4B is to empower the model with both thinking and non-thinking capabilities using bi-mode annealing, and apply Bi-mode Policy Optimization~(BPO) to improve the model's accuracy in determining whether to activate the thinking process. Specifically, we first train the model on a carefully curated dataset spanning various topics, which contains samples from both thinking and non-thinking modes. Then it undergoes a second phase of training under an improved GRPO framework, where the policy model is forced to generate responses from both modes for each input query. Experimental results show that R-4B achieves state-of-the-art performance across 25 challenging benchmarks. It outperforms Qwen2.5-VL-7B in most tasks and achieves performance comparable to larger models such as Kimi-VL-A3B-Thinking-2506 (16B) on reasoning-intensive benchmarks with lower computational cost.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Bifurcation Handling in Physics-Based Reduced-Order Vascular Hemodynamic Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) finite-element simulations of cardiovascular flows provide high-fidelity predictions to support cardiovascular medicine, but their high computational cost limits clinical practicality. Reduced-order models (ROMs) offer computationally efficient alternatives but suffer reduced accuracy, particularly at vessel bifurcations where complex flow physics are inadequately captured by standard Poiseuille flow assumptions. We present an enhanced numerical framework that integrates machine learning-predicted bifurcation coefficients into zero-dimensional (0D) hemodynamic ROMs to improve accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency. We develop a resistor-resistor-inductor (RRI) model that uses neural networks to predict pressure-flow relationships from bifurcation geometry, incorporating linear and quadratic resistances along with inductive effects. The method employs non-dimensionalization to reduce training data requirements and apriori flow split prediction for improved bifurcation characterization. We incorporate the RRI model into a 0D model using an optimization-based solution strategy. We validate the approach in isolated bifurcations and vascular trees, across Reynolds numbers from 0 to 5,500, defining ROM accuracy by comparison to 3D finite element simulation. Results demonstrate substantial accuracy improvements: averaged across all trees and Reynolds numbers, the RRI method reduces inlet pressure errors from 54 mmHg (45%) for standard 0D models to 25 mmHg (17%), while a simplified resistor-inductor (RI) variant achieves 31 mmHg (26%) error. The enhanced 0D models show particular effectiveness at high Reynolds numbers and in extensive vascular networks. This hybrid numerical approach enables accurate, real-time hemodynamic modeling for clinical decision support, uncertainty quantification, and digital twins in cardiovascular biomedical engineering.</description>

Abstract: One in four people dementia live alone, leading family members to take on caregiving roles from a distance. Many researchers have developed remote monitoring solutions to lessen caregiving needs; however, limitations remain including privacy preserving solutions, activity recognition, and model generalizability to new users and environments. Structural vibration sensor systems are unobtrusive solutions that have been proven to accurately monitor human information, such as identification and activity recognition, in controlled settings by sensing surface vibrations generated by activities. However, when deploying in an end user's home, current solutions require a substantial amount of labeled data for accurate activity recognition. Our scalable solution adapts synthesized data from near-surface acoustic audio to pretrain a model and allows fine tuning with very limited data in order to create a robust framework for daily routine tracking.</description>

      <title>Synthetic CVs To Build and Test Fairness-Aware Hiring Tools</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Algorithmic hiring has become increasingly necessary in some sectors as it promises to deal with hundreds or even thousands of applicants. At the heart of these systems are algorithms designed to retrieve and rank candidate profiles, which are usually represented by Curricula Vitae (CVs). Research has shown, however, that such technologies can inadvertently introduce bias, leading to discrimination based on factors such as candidates' age, gender, or national origin. Developing methods to measure, mitigate, and explain bias in algorithmic hiring, as well as to evaluate and compare fairness techniques before deployment, requires sets of CVs that reflect the characteristics of people from diverse backgrounds.
  However, datasets of these characteristics that can be used to conduct this research do not exist. To address this limitation, this paper introduces an approach for building a synthetic dataset of CVs with features modeled on real materials collected through a data donation campaign. Additionally, the resulting dataset of 1,730 CVs is presented, which we envision as a potential benchmarking standard for research on algorithmic hiring discrimination.</description>

      <title>Multi-robot Path Planning and Scheduling via Model Predictive Optimal Transport (MPC-OT)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel methodology for path planning and scheduling for multi-robot navigation that is based on optimal transport theory and model predictive control. We consider a setup where $N$ robots are tasked to navigate to $M$ targets in a common space with obstacles. Mapping robots to targets first and then planning paths can result in overlapping paths that lead to deadlocks. We derive a strategy based on optimal transport that not only provides minimum cost paths from robots to targets but also guarantees non-overlapping trajectories. We achieve this by discretizing the space of interest into $K$ cells and by imposing a ${K\times K}$ cost structure that describes the cost of transitioning from one cell to another. Optimal transport then provides \textit{optimal and non-overlapping} cell transitions for the robots to reach the targets that can be readily deployed without any scheduling considerations. The proposed solution requires $\unicode{x1D4AA}(K^3\log K)$ computations in the worst-case and $\unicode{x1D4AA}(K^2\log K)$ for well-behaved problems. To further accommodate potentially overlapping trajectories (unavoidable in certain situations) as well as robot dynamics, we show that a temporal structure can be integrated into optimal transport with the help of \textit{replans} and \textit{model predictive control}.</description>

      <title>Can Layer-wise SSL Features Improve Zero-Shot ASR Performance for Children's Speech?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems often struggle to accurately process children's speech due to its distinct and highly variable acoustic and linguistic characteristics. While recent advancements in self-supervised learning (SSL) models have greatly enhanced the transcription of adult speech, accurately transcribing children's speech remains a significant challenge. This study investigates the effectiveness of layer-wise features extracted from state-of-the-art SSL pre-trained models - specifically, Wav2Vec2, HuBERT, Data2Vec, and WavLM in improving the performance of ASR for children's speech in zero-shot scenarios. A detailed analysis of features extracted from these models was conducted, integrating them into a simplified DNN-based ASR system using the Kaldi toolkit. The analysis identified the most effective layers for enhancing ASR performance on children's speech in a zero-shot scenario, where WSJCAM0 adult speech was used for training and PFSTAR children speech for testing. Experimental results indicated that Layer 22 of the Wav2Vec2 model achieved the lowest Word Error Rate (WER) of 5.15%, representing a 51.64% relative improvement over the direct zero-shot decoding using Wav2Vec2 (WER of 10.65%). Additionally, age group-wise analysis demonstrated consistent performance improvements with increasing age, along with significant gains observed even in younger age groups using the SSL features. Further experiments on the CMU Kids dataset confirmed similar trends, highlighting the generalizability of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Population-Scale Network Embeddings Expose Educational Divides in Network Structure Related to Right-Wing Populist Voting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Administrative registry data can be used to construct population-scale networks whose ties reflect shared social contexts between persons. With machine learning, such networks can be encoded into numerical representations -- embeddings -- that automatically capture individuals' position within the network. We created embeddings for all persons in the Dutch population from a population-scale network that represents five shared contexts: neighborhood, work, family, household, and school. To assess the informativeness of these embeddings, we used them to predict right-wing populist voting. Embeddings alone predicted right-wing populist voting above chance-level but performed worse than individual characteristics. Combining the best subset of embeddings with individual characteristics only slightly improved predictions. However, after transforming the embeddings to make their dimensions more sparse and orthogonal, we found that one embedding dimension was strongly associated with the outcome. Mapping this dimension back to the population network revealed differences in network structure related to right-wing populist voting between different school ties and achieved education levels. Our study contributes methodologically by demonstrating how population-scale network embeddings can be made interpretable, and substantively by linking structural network differences in education to right-wing populist voting.</description>

      <title>Weighted Support Points from Random Measures: An Interpretable Alternative for Generative Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Support points summarize a large dataset through a smaller set of representative points that can be used for data operations, such as Monte Carlo integration, without requiring access to the full dataset. In this sense, support points offer a compact yet informative representation of the original data. We build on this idea to introduce a generative modeling framework based on random weighted support points, where the randomness arises from a weighting scheme inspired by the Dirichlet process and the Bayesian bootstrap. The proposed method generates diverse and interpretable sample sets from a fixed dataset, without relying on probabilistic modeling assumptions or neural network architectures. We present the theoretical formulation of the method and develop an efficient optimization algorithm based on the Convex--Concave Procedure (CCP). Empirical results on the MNIST and CelebA-HQ datasets show that our approach produces high-quality and diverse outputs at a fraction of the computational cost of black-box alternatives such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) or Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs). These results suggest that random weighted support points offer a principled, scalable, and interpretable alternative for generative modeling. A key feature is their ability to produce genuinely interpolative samples that preserve underlying data structure.</description>

      <title>Deep Active Learning for Lung Disease Severity Classification from Chest X-rays: Learning with Less Data in the Presence of Class Imbalance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To reduce the amount of required labeled data for lung disease severity classification from chest X-rays (CXRs) under class imbalance, this study applied deep active learning with a Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) approximation and weighted loss function. This retrospective study collected 2,319 CXRs from 963 patients (mean age, 59.2 $\pm$ 16.6 years; 481 female) at Emory Healthcare affiliated hospitals between January and November 2020. All patients had clinically confirmed COVID-19. Each CXR was independently labeled by 3 to 6 board-certified radiologists as normal, moderate, or severe. A deep neural network with Monte Carlo Dropout was trained using active learning to classify disease severity. Various acquisition functions were used to iteratively select the most informative samples from an unlabeled pool. Performance was evaluated using accuracy, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AU ROC), and area under the precision-recall curve (AU PRC). Training time and acquisition time were recorded. Statistical analysis included descriptive metrics and performance comparisons across acquisition strategies. Entropy Sampling achieved 93.7% accuracy (AU ROC, 0.91) in binary classification (normal vs. diseased) using 15.4% of the training data. In the multi-class setting, Mean STD sampling achieved 70.3% accuracy (AU ROC, 0.86) using 23.1% of the labeled data. These methods outperformed more complex and computationally expensive acquisition functions and significantly reduced labeling needs. Deep active learning with BNN approximation and weighted loss effectively reduces labeled data requirements while addressing class imbalance, maintaining or exceeding diagnostic performance.</description>

      <title>Multi-Ontology Integration with Dual-Axis Propagation for Medical Concept Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Medical ontology graphs map external knowledge to medical codes in electronic health records via structured relationships. By leveraging domain-approved connections (e.g., parent-child), predictive models can generate richer medical concept representations by incorporating contextual information from related concepts. However, existing literature primarily focuses on incorporating domain knowledge from a single ontology system, or from multiple ontology systems (e.g., diseases, drugs, and procedures) in isolation, without integrating them into a unified learning structure. Consequently, concept representation learning often remains limited to intra-ontology relationships, overlooking cross-ontology connections. In this paper, we propose LINKO, a large language model (LLM)-augmented integrative ontology learning framework that leverages multiple ontology graphs simultaneously by enabling dual-axis knowledge propagation both within and across heterogeneous ontology systems to enhance medical concept representation learning. Specifically, LINKO first employs LLMs to provide a graph-retrieval-augmented initialization for ontology concept embedding, through an engineered prompt that includes concept descriptions, and is further augmented with ontology context. Second, our method jointly learns the medical concepts in diverse ontology graphs by performing knowledge propagation in two axes: (1) intra-ontology vertical propagation across hierarchical ontology levels and (2) inter-ontology horizontal propagation within every level in parallel. Last, through extensive experiments on two public datasets, we validate the superior performance of LINKO over state-of-the-art baselines. As a plug-in encoder compatible with existing EHR predictive models, LINKO further demonstrates enhanced robustness in scenarios involving limited data availability and rare disease prediction.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Enhanced Natural Language Generation: A Multi-Model Framework with Hybrid Quantum-Classical Architectures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of quantum text generation models against traditional Transformer/MLP architectures, addressing the growing interest in quantum computing applications for natural language processing. We conduct systematic experiments comparing five distinct models: Transformer (baseline), Quantum Kernel Self-Attention Network (QKSAN), Quantum RWKV (QRWKV), and Quantum Attention Sequence Architecture (QASA) across five diverse datasets including simple sentences, short stories, quantum phrases, haiku poetry, and proverbs. Our evaluation employs multiple metrics including perplexity, BLEU scores, vocabulary diversity, repetition rates, and fluency measures to assess different aspects of text generation quality. The experimental results reveal that while traditional Transformer models maintain overall superiority with the lowest average perplexity (1.21) and highest BLEU-1 score (0.2895), quantum-inspired models demonstrate competitive performance in specific scenarios. Notably, QKSAN achieves a competitive BLEU-1 score of 0.2800 while maintaining zero repetition rates, and QRWKV demonstrates perfect vocabulary diversity (Distinct-1 = 1.000) in certain tasks.</description>

      <title>Faster Inference of Cell Complexes from Flows via Matrix Factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the following inference problem: Given a set of edge-flow signals observed on a graph, lift the graph to a cell complex, such that the observed edge-flow signals can be represented as a sparse combination of gradient and curl flows on the cell complex. Specifically, we aim to augment the observed graph by a set of 2-cells (polygons encircled by closed, non-intersecting paths), such that the eigenvectors of the Hodge Laplacian of the associated cell complex provide a sparse, interpretable representation of the observed edge flows on the graph. As it has been shown that the general problem is NP-hard in prior work, we here develop a novel matrix-factorization-based heuristic to solve the problem. Using computational experiments, we demonstrate that our new approach is significantly less computationally expensive than prior heuristics, while achieving only marginally worse performance in most settings. In fact, we find that for specifically noisy settings, our new approach outperforms the previous state of the art in both solution quality and computational speed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming AI across industries, but their development and deployment remain complex. This survey reviews 16 key challenges in building and using LLMs and examines how these challenges are addressed by two state-of-the-art models with unique approaches: OpenAI's closed source GPT-4o (May 2024 update) and DeepSeek-V3-0324 (March 2025), a large open source Mixture-of-Experts model. Through this comparison, we showcase the trade-offs between closed source models (robust safety, fine-tuned reliability) and open source models (efficiency, adaptability). We also explore LLM applications across different domains (from chatbots and coding tools to healthcare and education), highlighting which model attributes are best suited for each use case. This article aims to guide AI researchers, developers, and decision-makers in understanding current LLM capabilities, limitations, and best practices.</description>

      <title>SatDINO: A Deep Dive into Self-Supervised Pretraining for Remote Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-supervised learning has emerged as a powerful tool for remote sensing, where large amounts of unlabeled data are available. In this work, we investigate the use of DINO, a contrastive self-supervised method, for pretraining on remote sensing imagery. We introduce SatDINO, a model tailored for representation learning in satellite imagery. Through extensive experiments on multiple datasets in multiple testing setups, we demonstrate that SatDINO outperforms other state-of-the-art methods based on much more common masked autoencoders (MAE) and achieves competitive results in multiple benchmarks.
  We also provide a rigorous ablation study evaluating SatDINO's individual components. Finally, we propose a few novel enhancements, such as a new way to incorporate ground sample distance (GSD) encoding and adaptive view sampling. These enhancements can be used independently on our SatDINO model. Our code and trained models are available at: https://github.com/strakaj/SatDINO.</description>

      <title>Standardized Multi-Layer Tissue Maps for Enhanced Artificial Intelligence Integration and Search in Large-Scale Whole Slide Image Archives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21418v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A Whole Slide Image (WSI) is a high-resolution digital image created by scanning an entire glass slide containing a biological specimen, such as tissue sections or cell samples, at multiple magnifications. These images can be viewed, analyzed, shared digitally, and are used today for Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithm development. WSIs are used in a variety of fields, including pathology for diagnosing diseases and oncology for cancer research. They are also utilized in neurology, veterinary medicine, hematology, microbiology, dermatology, pharmacology, toxicology, immunology, and forensic science.
  When assembling cohorts for the training or validation of an AI algorithm, it is essential to know what is present on such a WSI. However, there is currently no standard for this metadata, so such selection has mainly been done through manual inspection, which is not suitable for large collections with several million objects.
  We propose a general framework to generate a 2D index map for WSI and a profiling mechanism for specific application domains. We demonstrate this approach in the field of clinical pathology, using common syntax and semantics to achieve interoperability between different catalogs.
  Our approach augments each WSI collection with a detailed tissue map that provides fine-grained information about the WSI content. The tissue map is organized into three layers: source, tissue type, and pathological alterations, with each layer assigning segments of the WSI to specific classes.
  We illustrate the advantages and applicability of the proposed standard through specific examples in WSI catalogs, Machine Learning (ML), and graph-based WSI representations.</description>

      <title>HSFN: Hierarchical Selection for Fake News Detection building Heterogeneous Ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Psychological biases, such as confirmation bias, make individuals particularly vulnerable to believing and spreading fake news on social media, leading to significant consequences in domains such as public health and politics. Machine learning-based fact-checking systems have been widely studied to mitigate this problem. Among them, ensemble methods are particularly effective in combining multiple classifiers to improve robustness. However, their performance heavily depends on the diversity of the constituent classifiers-selecting genuinely diverse models remains a key challenge, especially when models tend to learn redundant patterns. In this work, we propose a novel automatic classifier selection approach that prioritizes diversity, also extended by performance. The method first computes pairwise diversity between classifiers and applies hierarchical clustering to organize them into groups at different levels of granularity. A HierarchySelect then explores these hierarchical levels to select one pool of classifiers per level, each representing a distinct intra-pool diversity. The most diverse pool is identified and selected for ensemble construction from these. The selection process incorporates an evaluation metric reflecting each classifiers's performance to ensure the ensemble also generalises well. We conduct experiments with 40 heterogeneous classifiers across six datasets from different application domains and with varying numbers of classes. Our method is compared against the Elbow heuristic and state-of-the-art baselines. Results show that our approach achieves the highest accuracy on two of six datasets. The implementation details are available on the project's repository: https://github.com/SaraBCoutinho/HSFN .</description>

      <title>Data-driven Discovery of Digital Twins in Biomedical Research</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent technological advances have expanded the availability of high-throughput biological datasets, enabling the reliable design of digital twins of biomedical systems or patients. Such computational tools represent key reaction networks driving perturbation or drug response and can guide drug discovery and personalized therapeutics. Yet, their development still relies on laborious data integration by the human modeler, so that automated approaches are critically needed. The success of data-driven system discovery in Physics, rooted in clean datasets and well-defined governing laws, has fueled interest in applying similar techniques in Biology, which presents unique challenges. Here, we reviewed methodologies for automatically inferring digital twins from biological time series, which mostly involve symbolic or sparse regression. We evaluate algorithms according to eight biological and methodological challenges, associated to noisy/incomplete data, multiple conditions, prior knowledge integration, latent variables, high dimensionality, unobserved variable derivatives, candidate library design, and uncertainty quantification. Upon these criteria, sparse regression generally outperformed symbolic regression, particularly when using Bayesian frameworks. We further highlight the emerging role of deep learning and large language models, which enable innovative prior knowledge integration, though the reliability and consistency of such approaches must be improved. While no single method addresses all challenges, we argue that progress in learning digital twins will come from hybrid and modular frameworks combining chemical reaction network-based mechanistic grounding, Bayesian uncertainty quantification, and the generative and knowledge integration capacities of deep learning. To support their development, we further propose a benchmarking framework to evaluate methods across all challenges.</description>

      <title>Binary Weight Multi-Bit Activation Quantization for Compute-in-Memory CNN Accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Compute-in-memory (CIM) accelerators have emerged as a promising way for enhancing the energy efficiency of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Deploying CNNs on CIM platforms generally requires quantization of network weights and activations to meet hardware constraints. However, existing approaches either prioritize hardware efficiency with binary weight and activation quantization at the cost of accuracy, or utilize multi-bit weights and activations for greater accuracy but limited efficiency. In this paper, we introduce a novel binary weight multi-bit activation (BWMA) method for CNNs on CIM-based accelerators. Our contributions include: deriving closed-form solutions for weight quantization in each layer, significantly improving the representational capabilities of binarized weights; and developing a differentiable function for activation quantization, approximating the ideal multi-bit function while bypassing the extensive search for optimal settings. Through comprehensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets, we show that BWMA achieves notable accuracy improvements over existing methods, registering gains of 1.44\%-5.46\% and 0.35\%-5.37\% on respective datasets. Moreover, hardware simulation results indicate that 4-bit activation quantization strikes the optimal balance between hardware cost and model performance.</description>

      <title>Adaptive generative moment matching networks for improved learning of dependence structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An adaptive bandwidth selection procedure for the mixture kernel in the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) for fitting generative moment matching networks (GMMNs) is introduced, and its ability to improve the learning of copula random number generators is demonstrated. Based on the relative error of the training loss, the number of kernels is increased during training; additionally, the relative error of the validation loss is used as an early stopping criterion. While training time of such adaptively trained GMMNs (AGMMNs) is similar to that of GMMNs, training performance is increased significantly in comparison to GMMNs, which is assessed and shown based on validation MMD trajectories, samples and validation MMD values. Superiority of AGMMNs over GMMNs, as well as typical parametric copula models, is demonstrated in terms of three applications. First, convergence rates of quasi-random versus pseudo-random samples from high-dimensional copulas are investigated for three functionals of interest and in dimensions as large as 100 for the first time. Second, replicated validation MMDs, as well as Monte Carlo and quasi-Monte Carlo applications based on the expected payoff of a basked call option and the risk measure expected shortfall as functionals are used to demonstrate the improved training of AGMMNs over GMMNs for a copula model fitted to the standardized residuals of the 50 constituents of the S&amp;P 500 index after deGARCHing. Last, both the latter dataset and 50 constituents of the FTSE~100 are used to demonstrate that the improved training of AGMMNs over GMMNs and in comparison to the fitting of classical parametric copula models indeed also translates to an improved model prediction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present MahaSTS, a human-annotated Sentence Textual Similarity (STS) dataset for Marathi, along with MahaSBERT-STS-v2, a fine-tuned Sentence-BERT model optimized for regression-based similarity scoring. The MahaSTS dataset consists of 16,860 Marathi sentence pairs labeled with continuous similarity scores in the range of 0-5. To ensure balanced supervision, the dataset is uniformly distributed across six score-based buckets spanning the full 0-5 range, thus reducing label bias and enhancing model stability. We fine-tune the MahaSBERT model on this dataset and benchmark its performance against other alternatives like MahaBERT, MuRIL, IndicBERT, and IndicSBERT. Our experiments demonstrate that MahaSTS enables effective training for sentence similarity tasks in Marathi, highlighting the impact of human-curated annotations, targeted fine-tuning, and structured supervision in low-resource settings. The dataset and model are publicly shared at https://github.com/l3cube-pune/MarathiNLP</description>

      <title>Adapting to Change: A Comparison of Continual and Transfer Learning for Modeling Building Thermal Dynamics under Concept Drifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transfer Learning (TL) is currently the most effective approach for modeling building thermal dynamics when only limited data are available. TL uses a pretrained model that is fine-tuned to a specific target building. However, it remains unclear how to proceed after initial fine-tuning, as more operational measurement data are collected over time. This challenge becomes even more complex when the dynamics of the building change, for example, after a retrofit or a change in occupancy. In Machine Learning literature, Continual Learning (CL) methods are used to update models of changing systems. TL approaches can also address this challenge by reusing the pretrained model at each update step and fine-tuning it with new measurement data. A comprehensive study on how to incorporate new measurement data over time to improve prediction accuracy and address the challenges of concept drifts (changes in dynamics) for building thermal dynamics is still missing.
  Therefore, this study compares several CL and TL strategies, as well as a model trained from scratch, for thermal dynamics modeling during building operation. The methods are evaluated using 5--7 years of simulated data representative of single-family houses in Central Europe, including scenarios with concept drifts from retrofits and changes in occupancy. We propose a CL strategy (Seasonal Memory Learning) that provides greater accuracy improvements than existing CL and TL methods, while maintaining low computational effort. SML outperformed the benchmark of initial fine-tuning by 28.1\% without concept drifts and 34.9\% with concept drifts.</description>

      <title>Machine Intelligence on the Edge: Interpretable Cardiac Pattern Localisation Using Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Matched filters are widely used to localise signal patterns due to their high efficiency and interpretability. However, their effectiveness deteriorates for low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) signals, such as those recorded on edge devices, where prominent noise patterns can closely resemble the target within the limited length of the filter. One example is the ear-electrocardiogram (ear-ECG), where the cardiac signal is attenuated and heavily corrupted by artefacts. To address this, we propose the Sequential Matched Filter (SMF), a paradigm that replaces the conventional single matched filter with a sequence of filters designed by a Reinforcement Learning agent. By formulating filter design as a sequential decision-making process, SMF adaptively design signal-specific filter sequences that remain fully interpretable by revealing key patterns driving the decision-making. The proposed SMF framework has strong potential for reliable and interpretable clinical decision support, as demonstrated by its state-of-the-art R-peak detection and physiological state classification performance on two challenging real-world ECG datasets. The proposed formulation can also be extended to a broad range of applications that require accurate pattern localisation from noise-corrupted signals.</description>

      <title>I Stolenly Swear That I Am Up to (No) Good: Design and Evaluation of Model Stealing Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Model stealing attacks endanger the confidentiality of machine learning models offered as a service. Although these models are kept secret, a malicious party can query a model to label data samples and train their own substitute model, violating intellectual property. While novel attacks in the field are continually being published, their design and evaluations are not standardised, making it challenging to compare prior works and assess progress in the field. This paper is the first to address this gap by providing recommendations for designing and evaluating model stealing attacks. To this end, we study the largest group of attacks that rely on training a substitute model -- those attacking image classification models. We propose the first comprehensive threat model and develop a framework for attack comparison. Further, we analyse attack setups from related works to understand which tasks and models have been studied the most. Based on our findings, we present best practices for attack development before, during, and beyond experiments and derive an extensive list of open research questions regarding the evaluation of model stealing attacks. Our findings and recommendations also transfer to other problem domains, hence establishing the first generic evaluation methodology for model stealing attacks.</description>

      <title>Surface Stability Modeling with Universal Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials: A Comprehensive Cleavage Energy Benchmarking Study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have revolutionized computational materials science by bridging the gap between quantum mechanical accuracy and classical simulation efficiency, enabling unprecedented exploration of materials properties across the periodic table. Despite their remarkable success in predicting bulk properties, no systematic evaluation has assessed how well these universal MLIPs (uMLIPs) can predict cleavage energies, a critical property governing fracture, catalysis, surface stability, and interfacial phenomena. Here, we present a comprehensive benchmark of 19 state-of-the-art uMLIPs for cleavage energy prediction using our previously established density functional theory (DFT) database of 36,718 slab structures spanning elemental, binary, and ternary metallic compounds. We evaluate diverse architectural paradigms, analyzing their performance across chemical compositions, crystal systems, thickness, and surface orientations. Our results reveal that training data composition dominates architectural sophistication: models trained on the Open Materials 2024 (OMat24) dataset, which emphasizes non-equilibrium configurations, achieve mean absolute percentage errors below 6% and correctly identify the thermodynamically most stable surface terminations in 87% of cases, without any explicit surface energy training. In contrast, architecturally identical models trained on equilibrium-only datasets show five-fold higher errors, while models trained on surface-adsorbate data fail catastrophically with a 17-fold degradation. Remarkably, simpler architectures trained on appropriate data achieve comparable accuracy to complex transformers while offering 10-100x computational speedup. These findings show that the community should focus on strategic training data generation that captures the relevant physical phenomena.</description>

      <title>Trajectory learning for ensemble forecasts via the continuous ranked probability score: a Lorenz '96 case study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper demonstrates the feasibility of trajectory learning for ensemble forecasts by employing the continuous ranked probability score (CRPS) as a loss function. Using the two-scale Lorenz '96 system as a case study, we develop and train both additive and multiplicative stochastic parametrizations to generate ensemble predictions. Results indicate that CRPS-based trajectory learning produces parametrizations that are both accurate and sharp. The resulting parametrizations are straightforward to calibrate and outperform derivative-fitting-based parametrizations in short-term forecasts. This approach is particularly promising for data assimilation applications due to its accuracy over short lead times.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces the Future Atmospheric Conditions Training System (FACTS), a novel platform that advances climate resilience education through place-based, adaptive learning experiences. FACTS combines real-time atmospheric data collected by IoT sensors with curated resources from a Knowledge Base to dynamically generate localized learning challenges. Learner responses are analyzed by a Generative AI powered server, which delivers personalized feedback and adaptive support. Results from a user evaluation indicate that participants found the system both easy to use and effective for building knowledge related to climate resilience.

      <title>A Soft Inducement Framework for Incentive-Aided Steering of No-Regret Players</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate a steering problem in a mediator-augmented two-player normal-form game, where the mediator aims to guide players toward a specific action profile through information and incentive design. We first characterize the games for which successful steering is possible. Moreover, we establish that steering players to any desired action profile is not always achievable with information design alone, nor when accompanied with sublinear payment schemes. Consequently, we derive a lower bound on the constant payments required per round to achieve this goal. To address these limitations incurred with information design, we introduce an augmented approach that involves a one-shot information design phase before the start of the repeated game, transforming the prior interaction into a Stackelberg game. Finally, we theoretically demonstrate that this approach improves the convergence rate of players' action profiles to the target point by a constant factor with high probability, and support it with empirical results.</description>

      <title>Why Stop at Words? Unveiling the Bigger Picture through Line-Level OCR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conventional optical character recognition (OCR) techniques segmented each character and then recognized. This made them prone to error in character segmentation, and devoid of context to exploit language models. Advances in sequence to sequence translation in last decade led to modern techniques first detecting words and then inputting one word at a time to a model to directly output full words as sequence of characters. This allowed better utilization of language models and bypass error-prone character segmentation step. We observe that the above transition in style has moved the bottleneck in accuracy to word segmentation. Hence, in this paper, we propose a natural and logical progression from word level OCR to line-level OCR. The proposal allows to bypass errors in word detection, and provides larger sentence context for better utilization of language models. We show that the proposed technique not only improves the accuracy but also efficiency of OCR. Despite our thorough literature survey, we did not find any public dataset to train and benchmark such shift from word to line-level OCR. Hence, we also contribute a meticulously curated dataset of 251 English page images with line-level annotations. Our experimentation revealed a notable end-to-end accuracy improvement of 5.4%, underscoring the potential benefits of transitioning towards line-level OCR, especially for document images. We also report a 4 times improvement in efficiency compared to word-based pipelines. With continuous improvements in large language models, our methodology also holds potential to exploit such advances.

      <title>Domain Generalization in-the-Wild: Disentangling Classification from Domain-Aware Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Evaluating domain generalization (DG) for foundational models like CLIP is challenging, as web-scale pretraining data potentially covers many existing benchmarks. Consequently, current DG evaluation may neither be sufficiently challenging nor adequately test genuinely unseen data scenarios. To better assess the performance of CLIP on DG in-the-wild, a scenario where CLIP encounters challenging unseen data, we consider two approaches: (1) evaluating on 33 diverse datasets with quantified out-of-distribution (OOD) scores after fine-tuning CLIP on ImageNet, and (2) using unlearning to make CLIP `forget' some domains as an approximation. We observe that CLIP's performance deteriorates significantly on more OOD datasets. To address this, we present CLIP-DCA (Disentangling Classification from enhanced domain Aware representations). Our approach is motivated by the observation that while standard domain invariance losses aim to make representations domain-invariant, this can be harmful to foundation models by forcing the discarding of domain-aware representations beneficial for generalization. We instead hypothesize that enhancing domain awareness is a prerequisite for effective domain-invariant classification in foundation models. CLIP-DCA identifies and enhances domain awareness within CLIP's encoders using a separate domain head and synthetically generated diverse domain data. Simultaneously, it encourages domain-invariant classification through disentanglement from the domain features. CLIP-DCA shows significant improvements within this challenging evaluation compared to existing methods, particularly on datasets that are more OOD.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Video Continual Learning via Non-Parametric Deep Embedded Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a realistic scenario for the unsupervised video learning where neither task boundaries nor labels are provided when learning a succession of tasks. We also provide a non-parametric learning solution for the under-explored problem of unsupervised video continual learning. Videos represent a complex and rich spatio-temporal media information, widely used in many applications, but which have not been sufficiently explored in unsupervised continual learning. Prior studies have only focused on supervised continual learning, relying on the knowledge of labels and task boundaries, while having labeled data is costly and not practical. To address this gap, we study the unsupervised video continual learning (uVCL). uVCL raises more challenges due to the additional computational and memory requirements of processing videos when compared to images. We introduce a general benchmark experimental protocol for uVCL by considering the learning of unstructured video data categories during each task. We propose to use the Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) of deep embedded video features extracted by unsupervised video transformer networks as a non-parametric probabilistic representation of the data. We introduce a novelty detection criterion for the incoming new task data, dynamically enabling the expansion of memory clusters, aiming to capture new knowledge when learning a succession of tasks. We leverage the use of transfer learning from the previous tasks as an initial state for the knowledge transfer to the current learning task. We found that the proposed methodology substantially enhances the performance of the model when successively learning many tasks. We perform in-depth evaluations on three standard video action recognition datasets, including UCF101, HMDB51, and Something-to-Something V2, without using any labels or class boundaries.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking GPT-5 in Radiation Oncology: Measurable Gains, but Persistent Need for Expert Oversight</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Introduction: Large language models (LLM) have shown great potential in clinical decision support. GPT-5 is a novel LLM system that has been specifically marketed towards oncology use.
  Methods: Performance was assessed using two complementary benchmarks: (i) the ACR Radiation Oncology In-Training Examination (TXIT, 2021), comprising 300 multiple-choice items, and (ii) a curated set of 60 authentic radiation oncologic vignettes representing diverse disease sites and treatment indications. For the vignette evaluation, GPT-5 was instructed to generate concise therapeutic plans. Four board-certified radiation oncologists rated correctness, comprehensiveness, and hallucinations. Inter-rater reliability was quantified using Fleiss' \k{appa}.
  Results: On the TXIT benchmark, GPT-5 achieved a mean accuracy of 92.8%, outperforming GPT-4 (78.8%) and GPT-3.5 (62.1%). Domain-specific gains were most pronounced in Dose and Diagnosis. In the vignette evaluation, GPT-5's treatment recommendations were rated highly for correctness (mean 3.24/4, 95% CI: 3.11-3.38) and comprehensiveness (3.59/4, 95% CI: 3.49-3.69). Hallucinations were rare with no case reaching majority consensus for their presence. Inter-rater agreement was low (Fleiss' \k{appa} 0.083 for correctness), reflecting inherent variability in clinical judgment. Errors clustered in complex scenarios requiring precise trial knowledge or detailed clinical adaptation.
  Discussion: GPT-5 clearly outperformed prior model variants on the radiation oncology multiple-choice benchmark. Although GPT-5 exhibited favorable performance in generating real-world radiation oncology treatment recommendations, correctness ratings indicate room for further improvement. While hallucinations were infrequent, the presence of substantive errors underscores that GPT-5-generated recommendations require rigorous expert oversight before clinical implementation.</description>

      <title>DynaMark: A Reinforcement Learning Framework for Dynamic Watermarking in Industrial Machine Tool Controllers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Industry 4.0's highly networked Machine Tool Controllers (MTCs) are prime targets for replay attacks that use outdated sensor data to manipulate actuators. Dynamic watermarking can reveal such tampering, but current schemes assume linear-Gaussian dynamics and use constant watermark statistics, making them vulnerable to the time-varying, partly proprietary behavior of MTCs. We close this gap with DynaMark, a reinforcement learning framework that models dynamic watermarking as a Markov decision process (MDP). It learns an adaptive policy online that dynamically adapts the covariance of a zero-mean Gaussian watermark using available measurements and detector feedback, without needing system knowledge. DynaMark maximizes a unique reward function balancing control performance, energy consumption, and detection confidence dynamically. We develop a Bayesian belief updating mechanism for real-time detection confidence in linear systems. This approach, independent of specific system assumptions, underpins the MDP for systems with linear dynamics. On a Siemens Sinumerik 828D controller digital twin, DynaMark achieves a reduction in watermark energy by 70% while preserving the nominal trajectory, compared to constant variance baselines. It also maintains an average detection delay equivalent to one sampling interval. A physical stepper-motor testbed validates these findings, rapidly triggering alarms with less control performance decline and exceeding existing benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Considerations for Estimating Causal Effects of Informatively Timed Treatments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Epidemiological studies are often concerned with estimating causal effects of a sequence of treatment decisions on survival outcomes. In many settings, treatment decisions do not occur at fixed, pre-specified followup times. Rather, timing varies across subjects in ways that may be informative of subsequent treatment decisions and potential outcomes. Awareness of the issue and its potential solutions is lacking in the literature, which motivate this work. Here, we formalize the issue of informative timing, problems associated with ignoring it, and show how g-methods can be used to analyze sequential treatments that are informatively timed. As we describe, in such settings, the waiting times between successive treatment decisions may be properly viewed as a time-varying confounders. Using synthetic examples, we illustrate how g-methods that do not adjust for these waiting times may be biased and how adjustment can be done in scenarios where patients may die or be censored in between treatments. We draw connections between adjustment and identification with discrete-time versus continuous-time models. Finally, we provide implementation guidance and examples using publicly available software. Our concluding message is that 1) considering timing is important for valid inference and 2) correcting for informative timing can be done with g-methods that adjust for waiting times between treatments as time-varying confounders.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.19470v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Label embedding is a framework for multiclass classification problems where each label is represented by a distinct vector of some fixed dimension, and training involves matching model output to the vector representing the correct label. While label embedding has been successfully applied in extreme classification and zero-shot learning, and offers both computational and statistical advantages, its theoretical foundations remain poorly understood. This work presents an analysis of label embedding in the context of extreme multiclass classification, where the number of classes $C$ is very large. We present an excess risk bound that reveals a trade-off between computational and statistical efficiency, quantified via the coherence of the embedding matrix. We further show that under the Massart noise condition, the statistical penalty for label embedding vanishes with sufficiently low coherence. Our analysis supports an algorithm that is simple, scalable, and easily parallelizable, and experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness in large-scale applications.</description>

Abstract: Actor Critic methods have found immense applications on a wide range of Reinforcement Learning tasks especially when the state-action space is large. In this paper, we consider actor critic and natural actor critic algorithms with function approximation for constrained Markov decision processes (C-MDP) involving inequality constraints and carry out a non-asymptotic analysis for both of these algorithms in a non-i.i.d (Markovian) setting. We consider the long-run average cost criterion where both the objective and the constraint functions are suitable policy-dependent long-run averages of certain prescribed cost functions. We handle the inequality constraints using the Lagrange multiplier method. We prove that these algorithms are guaranteed to find a first-order stationary point (i.e., $\Vert \nabla L(\theta,\gamma)\Vert_2^2 \leq \epsilon$) of the performance (Lagrange) function $L(\theta,\gamma)$, with a sample complexity of $\mathcal{\tilde{O}}(\epsilon^{-2.5})$ in the case of both Constrained Actor Critic (C-AC) and Constrained Natural Actor Critic (C-NAC) algorithms. We also show the results of experiments on three different Safety-Gym environments.</description>

Abstract: Federated learning is widely considered to be as a privacy-aware learning method because no training data is exchanged directly between clients. Nevertheless, there are threats to privacy in federated learning, and privacy countermeasures have been studied. However, we note that common and unique privacy threats among typical types of federated learning have not been categorized and described in a comprehensive and specific way. In this paper, we describe privacy threats and countermeasures for the typical types of federated learning; horizontal federated learning, vertical federated learning, and transfer federated learning.</description>

      <title>Two-Timescale Critic-Actor for Average Reward MDPs with Function Approximation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01371v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Several recent works have focused on carrying out non-asymptotic convergence analyses for AC algorithms. Recently, a two-timescale critic-actor algorithm has been presented for the discounted cost setting in the look-up table case where the timescales of the actor and the critic are reversed and only asymptotic convergence shown. In our work, we present the first two-timescale critic-actor algorithm with function approximation in the long-run average reward setting and present the first finite-time non-asymptotic as well as asymptotic convergence analysis for such a scheme. We obtain optimal learning rates and prove that our algorithm achieves a sample complexity of {$\mathcal{\tilde{O}}(\epsilon^{-(2+\delta)})$ with $\delta &gt;0$ arbitrarily close to zero,} for the mean squared error of the critic to be upper bounded by $\epsilon$ which is better than the one obtained for two-timescale AC in a similar setting. A notable feature of our analysis is that we present the asymptotic convergence analysis of our scheme in addition to the finite-time bounds that we obtain and show the almost sure asymptotic convergence of the (slower) critic recursion to the attractor of an associated differential inclusion with actor parameters corresponding to local maxima of a perturbed average reward objective. We also show the results of numerical experiments on three benchmark settings and observe that our critic-actor algorithm performs the best amongst all algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.12683v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conformal prediction (CP) is a powerful statistical framework that generates prediction intervals or sets with guaranteed coverage probability. While CP algorithms have evolved beyond traditional classifiers and regressors to sophisticated deep learning models like deep neural networks (DNNs), graph neural networks (GNNs), and large language models (LLMs), existing CP libraries often lack the model support and scalability for large-scale DL scenarios. This paper introduces TorchCP, a PyTorch-native library designed to integrate state-of-the-art CP algorithms into deep learning techniques, including DNN-based classifier/regressor, GNN, and LLM. Released under the LGPL-3.0 license, TorchCP comprises about 16k lines of code, validated with 100% unit test coverage and detailed documentation. Notably, TorchCP enables CP-specific training algorithms, online prediction, and GPU-accelerated batch processing, achieving up to 90% reduction in inference time on large datasets. With its low-coupling design, comprehensive suite of advanced methods, and full GPU scalability, TorchCP empowers researchers and practitioners to enhance uncertainty quantification across cutting-edge applications.</description>

      <title>Alice's Adventures in a Differentiable Wonderland -- Volume I, A Tour of the Land</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17625v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural networks surround us, in the form of large language models, speech transcription systems, molecular discovery algorithms, robotics, and much more. Stripped of anything else, neural networks are compositions of differentiable primitives, and studying them means learning how to program and how to interact with these models, a particular example of what is called differentiable programming.
  This primer is an introduction to this fascinating field imagined for someone, like Alice, who has just ventured into this strange differentiable wonderland. I overview the basics of optimizing a function via automatic differentiation, and a selection of the most common designs for handling sequences, graphs, texts, and audios. The focus is on a intuitive, self-contained introduction to the most important design techniques, including convolutional, attentional, and recurrent blocks, hoping to bridge the gap between theory and code (PyTorch and JAX) and leaving the reader capable of understanding some of the most advanced models out there, such as large language models (LLMs) and multimodal architectures.</description>

      <title>Mamba State-Space Models Are Lyapunov-Stable Learners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00209v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mamba state-space models (SSMs) have recently outperformed state-of-the-art (SOTA) Transformer large language models (LLMs) in various tasks and been widely adapted. However, a major concern for stable learning in recurrent-based deep models (such as SSMs) is the sensitivity of their recurrent dynamics. Despite widespread adaptation, the sensitivity of Mamba's recurrent dynamics under common fine-tuning methods-e.g., mixed-precision fine-tuning (MPFT) and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)-remains unexplored. Empirically, we show that Mamba LLMs are extremely stable to changes introduced by combinations of MPFT and PEFT, in stark contrast to Transformer LLMs, which we demonstrate may drastically diverge from their respective full-precision counterparts under different combinations of MPFT and PEFT (despite the near-ubiquitous adaptation of these fine-tuning frameworks for attention-based models). The demonstrated robustness of Mamba LLMs are due to their recurrent dynamics, which we prove are guaranteed to be stable using dynamical systems theory (in particular, Lyapunov stability). We conclude by using MPFT and PEFT to novelly study Mamba LLMs' in-context learning (ICL) abilities on natural language tasks, thus supplementing other recent work.</description>

      <title>Categorical Data Clustering via Value Order Estimated Distance Metric Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15189v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Clustering is a popular machine learning technique for data mining that can process and analyze datasets to automatically reveal sample distribution patterns. Since the ubiquitous categorical data naturally lack a well-defined metric space such as the Euclidean distance space of numerical data, the distribution of categorical data is usually under-represented, and thus valuable information can be easily twisted in clustering. This paper, therefore, introduces a novel order distance metric learning approach to intuitively represent categorical attribute values by learning their optimal order relationship and quantifying their distance in a line similar to that of the numerical attributes. Since subjectively created qualitative categorical values involve ambiguity and fuzziness, the order distance metric is learned in the context of clustering. Accordingly, a new joint learning paradigm is developed to alternatively perform clustering and order distance metric learning with low time complexity and a guarantee of convergence. Due to the clustering-friendly order learning mechanism and the homogeneous ordinal nature of the order distance and Euclidean distance, the proposed method achieves superior clustering accuracy on categorical and mixed datasets. More importantly, the learned order distance metric greatly reduces the difficulty of understanding and managing the non-intuitive categorical data. Experiments with ablation studies, significance tests, case studies, etc., have validated the efficacy of the proposed method.

      <title>ROSE: A Reward-Oriented Data Selection Framework for LLM Task-Specific Instruction Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00631v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Instruction tuning has underscored the significant potential of large language models (LLMs) in producing more human controllable and effective outputs in various domains. In this work, we focus on the data selection problem for task-specific instruction tuning of LLMs. Prevailing methods primarily rely on the crafted similarity metrics to select training data that aligns with the test data distribution. The goal is to minimize instruction tuning loss on the test data, ultimately improving performance on the target task. However, it has been widely observed that instruction tuning loss (i.e., cross-entropy loss for next token prediction) in LLMs often fails to exhibit a monotonic relationship with actual task performance. This misalignment undermines the effectiveness of current data selection methods for task-specific instruction tuning. To address this issue, we introduce ROSE, a novel Reward-Oriented inStruction data sElection method which leverages pairwise preference loss as a reward signal to optimize data selection for task-specific instruction tuning. Specifically, ROSE adapts an influence formulation to approximate the influence of training data points relative to a few-shot preference validation set to select the most task-related training data points. Experimental results show that by selecting just 5\% of the training data using ROSE, our approach can achieve competitive results compared to fine-tuning with the full training dataset, and it surpasses other state-of-the-art data selection methods for task-specific instruction tuning. Our qualitative analysis further confirms the robust generalizability of our method across multiple benchmark datasets and diverse model architectures.</description>

      <title>Refusal Tokens: A Simple Way to Calibrate Refusals in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06748v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A key component of building safe and reliable language models is enabling the models to appropriately refuse to follow certain instructions or answer certain questions. We may want models to output refusal messages for various categories of user queries, for example, ill-posed questions, instructions for committing illegal acts, or queries which require information past the model's knowledge horizon. Engineering models that refuse to answer such questions is complicated by the fact that an individual may want their model to exhibit varying levels of sensitivity for refusing queries of various categories, and different users may want different refusal rates. The current default approach involves training multiple models with varying proportions of refusal messages from each category to achieve the desired refusal rates, which is computationally expensive and may require training a new model to accommodate each user's desired preference over refusal rates. To address these challenges, we propose refusal tokens, one such token for each refusal category or a single refusal token, which are prepended to the model's responses during training. We then show how to increase or decrease the probability of generating the refusal token for each category during inference to steer the model's refusal behavior. Refusal tokens enable controlling a single model's refusal rates without the need of any further fine-tuning, but only by selectively intervening during generation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16083v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The increasing demand for privacy-preserving data analytics in various domains necessitates solutions for synthetic data generation that rigorously uphold privacy standards. We introduce the DP-FedTabDiff framework, a novel integration of Differential Privacy, Federated Learning and Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models designed to generate high-fidelity synthetic tabular data. This framework ensures compliance with privacy regulations while maintaining data utility. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DP-FedTabDiff on multiple real-world mixed-type tabular datasets, achieving significant improvements in privacy guarantees without compromising data quality. Our empirical evaluations reveal the optimal trade-offs between privacy budgets, client configurations, and federated optimization strategies. The results affirm the potential of DP-FedTabDiff to enable secure data sharing and analytics in highly regulated domains, paving the way for further advances in federated learning and privacy-preserving data synthesis.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Control for Fine-tuning Diffusion Models: Optimality, Regularity, and Convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18164v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as powerful tools for generative modeling, demonstrating exceptional capability in capturing target data distributions from large datasets. However, fine-tuning these massive models for specific downstream tasks, constraints, and human preferences remains a critical challenge. While recent advances have leveraged reinforcement learning algorithms to tackle this problem, much of the progress has been empirical, with limited theoretical understanding. To bridge this gap, we propose a stochastic control framework for fine-tuning diffusion models. Building on denoising diffusion probabilistic models as the pre-trained reference dynamics, our approach integrates linear dynamics control with Kullback-Leibler regularization. We establish the well-posedness and regularity of the stochastic control problem and develop a policy iteration algorithm (PI-FT) for numerical solution. We show that PI-FT achieves global convergence at a linear rate. Unlike existing work that assumes regularities throughout training, we prove that the control and value sequences generated by the algorithm maintain the regularity. Additionally, we explore extensions of our framework to parametric settings and continuous-time formulations, and demonstrate the practical effectiveness of the proposed PI-FT algorithm through numerical experiments. Our code is available at https://github.com/yinbinhan/fine-tuning-of-diffusion-models.</description>

      <title>Don't lie to your friends: Learning what you know from collaborative self-play</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14481v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To be helpful assistants, AI agents must be aware of their own capabilities and limitations. This includes knowing when to answer from parametric knowledge versus using tools, when to trust tool outputs, and when to abstain or hedge. Such capabilities are hard to teach through supervised fine-tuning because they require constructing examples that reflect the agent's specific capabilities. We therefore propose a radically new approach to teaching agents what they know: \emph{collaborative self-play}. We construct multi-agent collaborations in which the group is rewarded for collectively arriving at correct answers. The desired meta-knowledge emerges from the incentives built into the structure of the interaction. We focus on small societies of agents that have access to heterogeneous tools (corpus-specific retrieval), and therefore must collaborate to maximize their success while minimizing their effort. Experiments show that group-level rewards for multi-agent communities can induce policies that \emph{transfer} to improve tool use and selective prediction in settings where individual agents are deployed in isolation.</description>

      <title>FROG: Fair Removal on Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18197v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With growing emphasis on privacy regulations, machine unlearning has become increasingly critical in real-world applications such as social networks and recommender systems, many of which are naturally represented as graphs. However, existing graph unlearning methods often modify nodes or edges indiscriminately, overlooking their impact on fairness. For instance, forgetting links between users of different genders may inadvertently exacerbate group disparities. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework that jointly optimizes both the graph structure and the model to achieve fair unlearning. Our method rewires the graph by removing redundant edges that hinder forgetting while preserving fairness through targeted edge augmentation. We further introduce a worst-case evaluation mechanism to assess robustness under challenging scenarios. Experiments on real-world datasets show that our approach achieves more effective and fair unlearning than existing baselines.</description>

      <title>SpecPipe: Accelerating Pipeline Parallelism-based LLM Inference with Speculative Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04104v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The demand for large language model inference is rapidly increasing. Pipeline parallelism offers a cost-effective deployment strategy for distributed inference but suffers from high service latency. While incorporating speculative decoding to pipeline parallelism improves performance, it still faces challenges of low hardware utilization and narrow speculative window. Inspired by branch prediction in instruction pipelining, we introduce SpecPipe, which fills the pipeline with speculative tokens of a request step-by-step. By maximizing the hardware utilization, SpecPipe decodes one token per pipeline step ideally. Specifically, SpecPipe comprises a dynamic speculative token tree and a pipelined inference framework. The tree dynamically accepts tokens from a speculative token source and outputs the tokens to the inference pipeline. Since the speculative window relaxed in our framework, a high-accuracy draft model is integrated without fine-tuning. The pipeline inference framework follows node-wise computation, pruning propagation, and inter-node communication stages. We implement SpecPipe and a variant SpecPipe-DB with dynamic batching for single- and multi-request inference, respectively. On an 8-stage pipeline, SpecPipe improves time between tokens on diverse single-request workloads by $4.19\times$-$5.53\times$ over standard pipeline parallelism and by $2.08\times$-$2.38\times$ over prior tree-based speculative decoding methods. For multi-request workloads, SpecPipe-DB achieves $1.64\times$-$2.08\times$ higher throughput and $1.61\times$-$2.06\times$ lower time between tokens than vLLM.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Domain Generalization with Style Sharing: Formal Model and Convergence Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06235v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Much of federated learning (FL) focuses on settings where local dataset statistics remain the same between training and testing. However, this assumption often does not hold in practice due to distribution shifts, motivating the development of domain generalization (DG) approaches that leverage source domain data to train models capable of generalizing to unseen target domains. In this paper, we are motivated by two major gaps in existing work on FL and DG: (1) the lack of formal mathematical analysis of DG objectives; and (2) DG research in FL being limited to the star-topology architecture. We develop Decentralized Federated Domain Generalization with Style Sharing ($\textit{StyleDDG}$), a decentralized DG algorithm which allows devices in a peer-to-peer network to achieve DG based on sharing style information inferred from their datasets. Additionally, we provide the first systematic approach to analyzing style-based DG training in decentralized networks. We cast existing centralized DG algorithms within our framework, and employ their formalisms to model $\textit{StyleDDG}$. We then obtain analytical conditions under which convergence of $\textit{StyleDDG}$ can be guaranteed. Through experiments on popular DG datasets, we demonstrate that $\textit{StyleDDG}$ can obtain significant improvements in accuracy across target domains with minimal communication overhead compared to baseline decentralized gradient methods.</description>

      <title>On the Adversarial Robustness of Spiking Neural Networks Trained by Local Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08897v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent research has shown the vulnerability of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) under adversarial examples that are nearly indistinguishable from clean data in the context of frame-based and event-based information. The majority of these studies are constrained in generating adversarial examples using Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT), a gradient-based method which lacks biological plausibility. In contrast, local learning methods, which relax many of BPTT's constraints, remain under-explored in the context of adversarial attacks. To address this problem, we examine adversarial robustness in SNNs through the framework of four types of training algorithms. We provide an in-depth analysis of the ineffectiveness of gradient-based adversarial attacks to generate adversarial instances in this scenario. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a hybrid adversarial attack paradigm that leverages the transferability of adversarial instances. The proposed hybrid approach demonstrates superior performance, outperforming existing adversarial attack methods. Furthermore, the generalizability of the method is assessed under multi-step adversarial attacks, adversarial attacks in black-box FGSM scenarios, and within the non-spiking domain.</description>

      <title>Roll the dice &amp; look before you leap: Going beyond the creative limits of next-token prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15266v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We design a suite of minimal algorithmic tasks that are a loose abstraction of open-ended real-world tasks. This allows us to cleanly and controllably quantify the creative limits of the present-day language model. Much like real-world tasks that require a creative, far-sighted leap of thought, our tasks require an implicit, open-ended stochastic planning step that either (a) discovers new connections in an abstract knowledge graph (like in wordplay, drawing analogies, or research) or (b) constructs new patterns (like in designing math problems or new proteins). In these tasks, we empirically and conceptually argue how next-token learning is myopic; multi-token approaches, namely teacherless training and diffusion models, comparatively excel in producing diverse and original output. Secondly, to elicit randomness without hurting coherence, we find that injecting noise at the input layer (dubbed seed-conditioning) works surprisingly as well as (and in some conditions, better than) temperature sampling from the output layer. Thus, our work offers a principled, minimal test-bed for analyzing open-ended creative skills, and offers new arguments for going beyond next-token learning and temperature sampling. We make part of the code available under https://github.com/chenwu98/algorithmic-creativity</description>

Abstract: Vision is well-known for its use in manipulation, especially using visual servoing. Due to the 3D nature of the world, using multiple camera views and merging them creates better representations for Q-learning and in turn, trains more sample efficient policies. Nevertheless, these multi-view policies are sensitive to failing cameras and can be burdensome to deploy. To mitigate these issues, we introduce a Merge And Disentanglement (MAD) algorithm that efficiently merges views to increase sample efficiency while simultaneously disentangling views by augmenting multi-view feature inputs with single-view features. This produces robust policies and allows lightweight deployment. We demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of our approach using Meta-World and ManiSkill3.

      <title>SPIN-ODE: Stiff Physics-Informed Neural ODE for Chemical Reaction Rate Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05625v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Estimating rate coefficients from complex chemical reactions is essential for advancing detailed chemistry. However, the stiffness inherent in real-world atmospheric chemistry systems poses severe challenges, leading to training instability and poor convergence, which hinder effective rate coefficient estimation using learning-based approaches. To address this, we propose a Stiff Physics-Informed Neural ODE framework (SPIN-ODE) for chemical reaction modelling. Our method introduces a three-stage optimisation process: first, a black-box neural ODE is trained to fit concentration trajectories; second, a Chemical Reaction Neural Network (CRNN) is pre-trained to learn the mapping between concentrations and their time derivatives; and third, the rate coefficients are fine-tuned by integrating with the pre-trained CRNN. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and newly proposed real-world datasets validate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach. As the first work addressing stiff neural ODE for chemical rate coefficient discovery, our study opens promising directions for integrating neural networks with detailed chemistry.</description>

      <title>WebInject: Prompt Injection Attack to Web Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11717v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-modal large language model (MLLM)-based web agents interact with webpage environments by generating actions based on screenshots of the webpages. In this work, we propose WebInject, a prompt injection attack that manipulates the webpage environment to induce a web agent to perform an attacker-specified action. Our attack adds a perturbation to the raw pixel values of the rendered webpage. After these perturbed pixels are mapped into a screenshot, the perturbation induces the web agent to perform the attacker-specified action. We formulate the task of finding the perturbation as an optimization problem. A key challenge in solving this problem is that the mapping between raw pixel values and screenshot is non-differentiable, making it difficult to backpropagate gradients to the perturbation. To overcome this, we train a neural network to approximate the mapping and apply projected gradient descent to solve the reformulated optimization problem. Extensive evaluation on multiple datasets shows that WebInject is highly effective and significantly outperforms baselines.</description>

      <title>BiTrajDiff: Bidirectional Trajectory Generation with Diffusion Models for Offline Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05762v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) have proven that effective policy learning can benefit from imposing conservative constraints on pre-collected datasets. However, such static datasets often exhibit distribution bias, resulting in limited generalizability. To address this limitation, a straightforward solution is data augmentation (DA), which leverages generative models to enrich data distribution. Despite the promising results, current DA techniques focus solely on reconstructing future trajectories from given states, while ignoring the exploration of history transitions that reach them. This single-direction paradigm inevitably hinders the discovery of diverse behavior patterns, especially those leading to critical states that may have yielded high-reward outcomes. In this work, we introduce Bidirectional Trajectory Diffusion (BiTrajDiff), a novel DA framework for offline RL that models both future and history trajectories from any intermediate states. Specifically, we decompose the trajectory generation task into two independent yet complementary diffusion processes: one generating forward trajectories to predict future dynamics, and the other generating backward trajectories to trace essential history transitions.BiTrajDiff can efficiently leverage critical states as anchors to expand into potentially valuable yet underexplored regions of the state space, thereby facilitating dataset diversity. Extensive experiments on the D4RL benchmark suite demonstrate that BiTrajDiff achieves superior performance compared to other advanced DA methods across various offline RL backbones.</description>

      <title>Beyond Frequency: The Role of Redundancy in Large Language Model Memorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12321v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Memorization in large language models poses critical risks for privacy and fairness as these systems scale to billions of parameters. While previous studies established correlations between memorization and factors like token frequency and repetition patterns, we revealed distinct response patterns: frequency increases minimally impact memorized samples (e.g. 0.09) while substantially affecting non-memorized samples (e.g., 0.25), with consistency observed across model scales. Through counterfactual analysis by perturbing sample prefixes and quantifying perturbation strength through token positional changes, we demonstrate that redundancy correlates with memorization patterns. Our findings establish that: about 79% of memorized samples are low-redundancy, these low-redundancy samples exhibit 2-fold higher vulnerability than high-redundancy ones, and consequently memorized samples drop by 0.6 under perturbation while non-memorized samples drop by only 0.01, indicating that more redundant content becomes both more memorable and more fragile. These findings suggest potential redundancy-guided approaches for data preprocessing, thereby reducing privacy risks and mitigating bias to ensure fairness in model deployments.</description>

      <title>Scientifically-Interpretable Reasoning Network (ScIReN): Discovering Hidden Relationships in the Carbon Cycle and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14054v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding how carbon flows through the soil is crucial for mitigating the effects of climate change. While soils have potential to sequester carbon from the atmosphere, the soil carbon cycle remains poorly understood. Scientists have developed mathematical process-based models of the soil carbon cycle based on existing knowledge, but they contain numerous unknown parameters that must be set in an ad-hoc manner, and often fit observations poorly. On the other hand, neural networks can learn patterns from data, but do not respect known scientific laws, nor can they reveal novel scientific relationships due to their black-box nature. We thus propose Scientifically-Interpretable Reasoning Network (ScIReN), a fully-transparent framework that combines interpretable neural and process-based reasoning. An interpretable encoder predicts scientifically-meaningful latent parameters, which are then passed through a differentiable process-based decoder to predict labeled output variables. ScIReN leverages Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KAN) to ensure the encoder is fully interpretable and reveals relationships between input features and latent parameters; it uses novel smoothness penalties to balance expressivity and simplicity. ScIReN also uses a novel hard-sigmoid constraint layer to restrict latent parameters to meaningful ranges defined by scientific prior knowledge. While the process-based decoder enforces established scientific knowledge, the KAN-based encoder reveals new scientific relationships hidden in conventional black-box models. We apply ScIReN on two tasks: simulating the flow of organic carbon through soils, and modeling ecosystem respiration from plants. In both tasks, ScIReN outperforms black-box networks in predictive accuracy while providing substantial scientific interpretability -- it can infer latent scientific mechanisms and their relationships with input features.</description>

      <title>BASE-Q: Bias and Asymmetric Scaling Enhanced Rotational Quantization for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15689v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rotations have become essential to state-of-the-art quantization pipelines for large language models (LLMs) by effectively smoothing outliers in weights and activations. However, further optimizing the rotation parameters offers only limited performance gains and introduces significant training overhead: due to rotation parameter sharing, full-model must be loaded simultaneously to enable backpropagation, resulting in substantial memory consumption and limited practical utility. In this work, we identify two fundamental limitations of current rotational quantization methods: (i) rotation fails to align channel means, resulting in wider quantization bounds and increased rounding errors; and (ii) rotation makes the activation distribution more Gaussian-like, increasing energy loss caused by clipping errors. To address these issues, we introduce \textbf{BASE-Q}, a simple yet powerful approach that combines bias correction and asymmetric scaling to effectively reduce rounding and clipping errors. Furthermore, BASE-Q enables blockwise optimization, eliminating the need for memory-intensive full-model backpropagation. Extensive experiments on various LLMs and benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of BASE-Q, narrowing the accuracy gap to full-precision models by 50.5\%, 42.9\%, and 29.2\% compared to QuaRot, SpinQuant, and OSTQuant, respectively. The code will be released soon.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15695v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance in mathematical reasoning and code generation. However, LLMs still struggle in the simulation domain, particularly in generating Simulink models, which are essential tools in engineering and scientific research. Our preliminary experiments indicate that LLM agents often fail to produce reliable and complete Simulink simulation code from text-only inputs, likely due to the lack of Simulink-specific data in their pretraining. To address this challenge, we propose SimuGen, a multimodal agent-based framework that automatically generates accurate Simulink simulation code by leveraging both the visual Simulink diagram and domain knowledge. SimuGen coordinates several specialized agents, including an investigator, unit test reviewer, code generator, executor, debug locator, and report writer, supported by a domain-specific knowledge base. This collaborative and modular design enables interpretable, robust, and reproducible Simulink simulation generation. Our source code is publicly available at https://github.com/renxinxing123/SimuGen_beta.</description>

      <title>Time-RA: Towards Time Series Reasoning for Anomaly with LLM Feedback</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15066v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time series anomaly detection is critical across various domains, yet current approaches often limit analysis to mere binary anomaly classification without detailed categorization or further explanatory reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose a novel task, Time-series Reasoning for Anomaly (Time-RA) that transforms classical time series anomaly detection from a discriminative into a generative, reasoning-intensive task leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs). Also, we introduce the first real-world multimodal benchmark dataset, RATs40K, explicitly annotated for anomaly reasoning, comprising approximately 40,000 samples across 10 real-world domains. Each sample includes numeric time series data, contextual text information, and visual representations, each annotated with fine-grained categories (14 types for univariate anomalies and 6 for multivariate anomalies) and structured explanatory reasoning. We develop a sophisticated annotation framework utilizing ensemble-generated labels refined through GPT-4-driven feedback, ensuring accuracy and interpretability. Extensive benchmarking of LLMs and multimodal LLMs demonstrates the capabilities and limitations of current models, highlighting the critical role of supervised fine-tuning. Our dataset and task pave the way for significant advancements in interpretable time series anomaly detection and reasoning. The code (https://github.com/yyysjz1997/Time-RA) and dataset (https://huggingface.co/datasets/Time-RA/RATs40K) have been fully open-sourced to support and accelerate future research in this area.</description>

      <title>Designing Dynamic Pricing for Bike-sharing Systems via Differentiable Agent-based Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23344v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bike-sharing systems are emerging in various cities as a new ecofriendly transportation system. In these systems, spatiotemporally varying user demands lead to imbalanced inventory at bicycle stations, resulting in additional relocation costs. Therefore, it is essential to manage user demand through optimal dynamic pricing for the system. However, optimal pricing design for such a system is challenging because the system involves users with diverse backgrounds and their probabilistic choices. To address this problem, we develop a differentiable agent-based simulation to rapidly design dynamic pricing in bike-sharing systems, achieving balanced bicycle inventory despite spatiotemporally heterogeneous trips and probabilistic user decisions. We first validate our approach against conventional methods through numerical experiments involving 25 bicycle stations and five time slots, yielding 100 parameters. Compared to the conventional methods, our approach obtains a more accurate solution with a 73% to 78% reduction in loss while achieving more than a 100-fold increase in convergence speed. We further validate our approach on a large-scale urban bike-sharing system scenario involving 289 bicycle stations, resulting in a total of 1156 parameters. Through simulations using the obtained pricing policies, we confirm that these policies can naturally induce balanced inventory without any manual relocation. Additionally, we find that the cost of discounts to induce the balanced inventory can be minimized by setting appropriate initial conditions.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity of Stability: Theoretical &amp; Empirical Analysis of Replicability for Adaptive Data Selection in Transfer Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04901v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The widespread adoption of transfer learning has revolutionized machine learning by enabling efficient adaptation of pre-trained models to new domains. However, the reliability of these adaptations remains poorly understood, particularly when using adaptive data selection strategies that dynamically prioritize training examples. We present a comprehensive theoretical and empirical analysis of replicability in transfer learning, introducing a mathematical framework that quantifies the fundamental trade-off between adaptation effectiveness and result consistency. Our key contribution is the formalization of selection sensitivity ($\Delta_Q$), a measure that captures how adaptive selection strategies respond to perturbations in training data. We prove that replicability failure probability: the likelihood that two independent training runs produce models differing in performance by more than a threshold, increases quadratically with selection sensitivity while decreasing exponentially with sample size. Through extensive experiments on the MultiNLI corpus using six adaptive selection strategies - ranging from uniform sampling to gradient-based selection - we demonstrate that this theoretical relationship holds precisely in practice. Our results reveal that highly adaptive strategies like gradient-based and curriculum learning achieve superior task performance but suffer from high replicability failure rates, while less adaptive approaches maintain failure rates below 7%. Crucially, we show that source domain pretraining provides a powerful mitigation mechanism, reducing failure rates by up to 30% while preserving performance gains. These findings establish principled guidelines for practitioners to navigate the performance-replicability trade-off and highlight the need for replicability-aware design in modern transfer learning systems.</description>

      <title>ETTRL: Balancing Exploration and Exploitation in LLM Test-Time Reinforcement Learning Via Entropy Mechanism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.11356v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models have yielded significant improvements in complex reasoning tasks such as mathematics and programming. However, these models remain heavily dependent on annotated data and exhibit limited adaptability in unsupervised scenarios. To address these limitations, test-time reinforcement learning (TTRL) has been proposed, which enables self-optimization by leveraging model-generated pseudo-labels. Despite its promise, TTRL faces several key challenges, including high inference costs due to parallel rollouts and early-stage estimation bias that fosters overconfidence, reducing output diversity and causing performance plateaus. To address these challenges, we introduce an entropy-based mechanism to enhance the exploration-exploitation balance in test-time reinforcement learning through two strategies: Entropy-fork Tree Majority Rollout (ETMR) and Entropy-based Advantage Reshaping (EAR). Compared with the baseline, our approach enables Llama3.1-8B to achieve a 68 percent relative improvement in Pass at 1 metric on the AIME 2024 benchmark, while consuming only 60 percent of the rollout tokens budget. This highlights our method's ability to effectively optimize the trade-off between inference efficiency, diversity, and estimation robustness, thereby advancing unsupervised reinforcement learning for open-domain reasoning tasks.</description>

      <title>Inductive Domain Transfer In Misspecified Simulation-Based Inference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15593v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Simulation-based inference (SBI) is a statistical inference approach for estimating latent parameters of a physical system when the likelihood is intractable but simulations are available. In practice, SBI is often hindered by model misspecification--the mismatch between simulated and real-world observations caused by inherent modeling simplifications. RoPE, a recent SBI approach, addresses this challenge through a two-stage domain transfer process that combines semi-supervised calibration with optimal transport (OT)-based distribution alignment. However, RoPE operates in a fully transductive setting, requiring access to a batch of test samples at inference time, which limits scalability and generalization. We propose here a fully inductive and amortized SBI framework that integrates calibration and distributional alignment into a single, end-to-end trainable model. Our method leverages mini-batch OT with a closed-form coupling to align real and simulated observations that correspond to the same latent parameters, using both paired calibration data and unpaired samples. A conditional normalizing flow is then trained to approximate the OT-induced posterior, enabling efficient inference without simulation access at test time. Across a range of synthetic and real-world benchmarks--including complex medical biomarker estimation--our approach matches or surpasses the performance of RoPE, as well as other standard SBI and non-SBI estimators, while offering improved scalability and applicability in challenging, misspecified environments.</description>

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have leveraged increased test-time computation to enhance reasoning capabilities, a strategy that, while effective, incurs significant latency and resource costs, limiting their applicability in real-world time-constrained or cost-sensitive scenarios. This paper introduces BudgetThinker, a novel framework designed to empower LLMs with budget-aware reasoning, enabling precise control over the length of their thought processes. We propose a methodology that periodically inserts special control tokens during inference to continuously inform the model of its remaining token budget. This approach is coupled with a comprehensive two-stage training pipeline, beginning with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to familiarize the model with budget constraints, followed by a curriculum-based Reinforcement Learning (RL) phase that utilizes a length-aware reward function to optimize for both accuracy and budget adherence. We demonstrate that BudgetThinker significantly surpasses strong baselines in maintaining performance across a variety of reasoning budgets on challenging mathematical benchmarks. Our method provides a scalable and effective solution for developing efficient and controllable LLM reasoning, making advanced models more practical for deployment in resource-constrained and real-time environments.</description>

      <title>CMPhysBench: A Benchmark for Evaluating Large Language Models in Condensed Matter Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18124v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce CMPhysBench, designed to assess the proficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs) in Condensed Matter Physics, as a novel Benchmark. CMPhysBench is composed of more than 520 graduate-level meticulously curated questions covering both representative subfields and foundational theoretical frameworks of condensed matter physics, such as magnetism, superconductivity, strongly correlated systems, etc. To ensure a deep understanding of the problem-solving process,we focus exclusively on calculation problems, requiring LLMs to independently generate comprehensive solutions. Meanwhile, leveraging tree-based representations of expressions, we introduce the Scalable Expression Edit Distance (SEED) score, which provides fine-grained (non-binary) partial credit and yields a more accurate assessment of similarity between prediction and ground-truth. Our results show that even the best models, Grok-4, reach only 36 average SEED score and 28% accuracy on CMPhysBench, underscoring a significant capability gap, especially for this practical and frontier domain relative to traditional physics. The code anddataset are publicly available at https://github.com/CMPhysBench/CMPhysBench.</description>

      <title>C-Flat++: Towards a More Efficient and Powerful Framework for Continual Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18860v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Balancing sensitivity to new tasks and stability for retaining past knowledge is crucial in continual learning (CL). Recently, sharpness-aware minimization has proven effective in transfer learning and has also been adopted in continual learning (CL) to improve memory retention and learning efficiency. However, relying on zeroth-order sharpness alone may favor sharper minima over flatter ones in certain settings, leading to less robust and potentially suboptimal solutions. In this paper, we propose \textbf{C}ontinual \textbf{Flat}ness (\textbf{C-Flat}), a method that promotes flatter loss landscapes tailored for CL. C-Flat offers plug-and-play compatibility, enabling easy integration with minimal modifications to the code pipeline. Besides, we present a general framework that integrates C-Flat into all major CL paradigms and conduct comprehensive comparisons with loss-minima optimizers and flat-minima-based CL methods. Our results show that C-Flat consistently improves performance across a wide range of settings. In addition, we introduce C-Flat++, an efficient yet effective framework that leverages selective flatness-driven promotion, significantly reducing the update cost required by C-Flat. Extensive experiments across multiple CL methods, datasets, and scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed approaches. Code is available at https://github.com/WanNaa/C-Flat.</description>

      <title>Memorization in Graph Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19352v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been shown to memorize their training data, yet similar analyses for graph neural networks (GNNs) remain largely under-explored. We introduce NCMemo (Node Classification Memorization), the first framework to quantify label memorization in semi-supervised node classification. We first establish an inverse relationship between memorization and graph homophily, i.e., the property that connected nodes share similar labels/features. We find that lower homophily significantly increases memorization, indicating that GNNs rely on memorization to learn less homophilic graphs. Secondly, we analyze GNN training dynamics. We find that the increased memorization in low homophily graphs is tightly coupled to the GNNs' implicit bias on using graph structure during learning. In low homophily regimes, this structure is less informative, hence inducing memorization of the node labels to minimize training loss. Finally, we show that nodes with higher label inconsistency in their feature-space neighborhood are significantly more prone to memorization. Building on our insights into the link between graph homophily and memorization, we investigate graph rewiring as a means to mitigate memorization. Our results demonstrate that this approach effectively reduces memorization without compromising model performance. Moreover, we show that it lowers the privacy risk for previously memorized data points in practice. Thus, our work not only advances understanding of GNN learning but also supports more privacy-preserving GNN deployment.</description>

      <title>Robustness is Important: Limitations of LLMs for Data Fitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19563v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are being applied in a wide array of settings, well beyond the typical language-oriented use cases. In particular, LLMs are increasingly used as a plug-and-play method for fitting data and generating predictions. Prior work has shown that LLMs, via in-context learning or supervised fine-tuning, can perform competitively with many tabular supervised learning techniques in terms of predictive performance. However, we identify a critical vulnerability of using LLMs for data fitting -- making changes to data representation that are completely irrelevant to the underlying learning task can drastically alter LLMs' predictions on the same data. For example, simply changing variable names can sway the size of prediction error by as much as 82% in certain settings. Such prediction sensitivity with respect to task-irrelevant variations manifests under both in-context learning and supervised fine-tuning, for both close-weight and open-weight general-purpose LLMs. Moreover, by examining the attention scores of an open-weight LLM, we discover a non-uniform attention pattern: training examples and variable names/values which happen to occupy certain positions in the prompt receive more attention when output tokens are generated, even though different positions are expected to receive roughly the same attention. This partially explains the sensitivity in the presence of task-irrelevant variations. We also consider a state-of-the-art tabular foundation model (TabPFN) trained specifically for data fitting. Despite being explicitly designed to achieve prediction robustness, TabPFN is still not immune to task-irrelevant variations. Overall, despite LLMs' impressive predictive capabilities, currently they lack even the basic level of robustness to be used as a principled data-fitting tool.</description>

      <title>FORGE: Foundational Optimization Representations from Graph Embeddings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20330v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Combinatorial optimization problems are ubiquitous in science and engineering, yet learning-based approaches to accelerate their solution often require solving a large number of hard-to-solve optimization instances to collect training data, incurring significant computational overhead. Existing methods require training dedicated models for each problem distribution for each downstream task, severely limiting their scalability and generalization. In this work, we introduce Forge, a method of pre-training a vector-quantized graph autoencoder on a large and diverse collection of mixed-integer programming (MIP) instances in an unsupervised fashion without dependency on their solution. The vector quantization process creates discrete code assignments that act as a vocabulary to represent optimization instances. We evaluate our approach under both supervised and unsupervised settings. For the unsupervised setting, we demonstrate that Forge embeddings effectively differentiate and cluster unseen instances. For the supervised setting, we fine-tuneForge embeddings and show that a single model predicts both the variables for warm-starts and integrality gaps for cut-generation across multiple problem type distributions. Both predictions help improve performance of a state-of-the-art, commercial optimization solver. Finally, we release our code and pre-trained Forge weights to encourage further research and practical use of instance-level MIP embeddings at https://github.com/skadio/forge/.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Instance-Optimal Cluster Recovery in the Labeled Stochastic Block Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.12968v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the problem of recovering hidden communities in the Labeled Stochastic Block Model (LSBM) with a finite number of clusters whose sizes grow linearly with the total number of nodes. We derive the necessary and sufficient conditions under which the expected number of misclassified nodes is less than $ s $, for any number $ s = o(n) $. To achieve this, we propose IAC (Instance-Adaptive Clustering), the first algorithm whose performance matches the instance-specific lower bounds both in expectation and with high probability. IAC is a novel two-phase algorithm that consists of a one-shot spectral clustering step followed by iterative likelihood-based cluster assignment improvements. This approach is based on the instance-specific lower bound and notably does not require any knowledge of the model parameters, including the number of clusters. By performing the spectral clustering only once, IAC maintains an overall computational complexity of $ \mathcal{O}(n\, \text{polylog}(n)) $, making it scalable and practical for large-scale problems.</description>

      <title>Large Intestine 3D Shape Refinement Using Point Diffusion Models for Digital Phantom Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.08289v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate 3D modeling of human organs is critical for constructing digital phantoms in virtual imaging trials. However, organs such as the large intestine remain particularly challenging due to their complex geometry and shape variability. We propose CLAP, a novel Conditional LAtent Point-diffusion model that combines geometric deep learning with denoising diffusion models to enhance 3D representations of the large intestine. Given point clouds sampled from segmentation masks, we employ a hierarchical variational autoencoder to learn both global and local latent shape representations. Two conditional diffusion models operate within this latent space to refine the organ shape. A pretrained surface reconstruction model is then used to convert the refined point clouds into meshes. CLAP achieves substantial improvements in shape modeling accuracy, reducing Chamfer distance by 26% and Hausdorff distance by 36% relative to the initial suboptimal shapes. This approach offers a robust and extensible solution for high-fidelity organ modeling, with potential applicability to a wide range of anatomical structures.</description>

      <title>Guaranteed Nonconvex Factorization Approach for Tensor Train Recovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.02592v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide the first convergence guarantee for the factorization approach. Specifically, to avoid the scaling ambiguity and to facilitate theoretical analysis, we optimize over the so-called left-orthogonal TT format which enforces orthonormality among most of the factors. To ensure the orthonormal structure, we utilize the Riemannian gradient descent (RGD) for optimizing those factors over the Stiefel manifold. We first delve into the TT factorization problem and establish the local linear convergence of RGD. Notably, the rate of convergence only experiences a linear decline as the tensor order increases. We then study the sensing problem that aims to recover a TT format tensor from linear measurements. Assuming the sensing operator satisfies the restricted isometry property (RIP), we show that with a proper initialization, which could be obtained through spectral initialization, RGD also converges to the ground-truth tensor at a linear rate. Furthermore, we expand our analysis to encompass scenarios involving Gaussian noise in the measurements. We prove that RGD can reliably recover the ground truth at a linear rate, with the recovery error exhibiting only polynomial growth in relation to the tensor order. We conduct various experiments to validate our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Learning covariate importance for matching in policy-relevant observational research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12367v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Matching methods are widely used to reduce confounding effects in observational studies, but conventional approaches often treat all covariates as equally important, which can result in poor performance when covariates differ in their relevance to the study. We propose the Priority-Aware one-to-one Matching Algorithm (PAMA), a novel semi-supervised framework that learns a covariate importance measure from a subset data of units that are paired by experts and uses it to match additional units. It optimizes a weighted quadratic score that reflects the relevance between each covariate and the study, and iteratively updates the covariate importance measure in the score function using unlabeled data. PAMA is model-free, but we have established that the covariate importance measure -- the learned weights -- is consistent when the oracle matching rule aligns with the design. In addition, we introduce extensions that address imbalanced data, accommodate temporal covariates, and improve robustness to mispaired observations.
  In simulations, PAMA outperforms standard methods, particularly in high-dimensional settings and under model misspecification. Applied to a real-world study of in-person schooling and COVID-19 transmission, PAMA recovers nearly twice as many expert-designated matches as competing methods using baseline covariates. A self-taught learning extension improves performance in simulations, though its benefit is context-dependent.
  To our knowledge, PAMA is the first framework to apply semi-supervised learning to observational matching with covariates of unequal relevance. It offers a scalable and interpretable tool for incorporating expert insight into policy-relevant observational research.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14488v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Manipulation tasks require robots to reason about cause and effect when interacting with objects. Yet, many data-driven approaches lack causal semantics and thus only consider correlations. We introduce COBRA-PPM, a novel causal Bayesian reasoning architecture that combines causal Bayesian networks and probabilistic programming to perform interventional inference for robot manipulation under uncertainty. We demonstrate its capabilities through high-fidelity Gazebo-based experiments on an exemplar block stacking task, where it predicts manipulation outcomes with high accuracy (Pred Acc: 88.6%) and performs greedy next-best action selection with a 94.2% task success rate. We further demonstrate sim2real transfer on a domestic robot, showing effectiveness in handling real-world uncertainty from sensor noise and stochastic actions. Our generalised and extensible framework supports a wide range of manipulation scenarios and lays a foundation for future work at the intersection of robotics and causality.</description>

      <title>Continuous Language Model Interpolation for Dynamic and Controllable Text Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07117v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) have gained popularity for a variety of use cases, making them adaptable and controllable has become increasingly important, especially for user-facing applications. While the existing literature on LLM adaptation primarily focuses on finding a model (or models) that optimizes a single predefined objective, here we focus on the challenging case where the model must dynamically adapt to diverse -- and often changing -- user preferences. For this, we leverage adaptation methods based on linear weight interpolation, casting them as continuous multi-domain interpolators that produce models with specific prescribed generation characteristics on-the-fly. Specifically, we use low-rank updates to fine-tune a base model to various different domains, yielding a set of anchor models with distinct generation profiles. Then, we use the weight updates of these anchor models to parametrize the entire (infinite) class of models contained within their convex hull. We empirically show that varying the interpolation weights yields predictable and consistent change in the model outputs with respect to all of the controlled attributes. We find that there is little entanglement between most attributes and identify and discuss the pairs of attributes for which this is not the case. Our results suggest that linearly interpolating between the weights of fine-tuned models facilitates predictable, fine-grained control of model outputs with respect to multiple stylistic characteristics simultaneously.</description>

      <title>Endmember Extraction from Hyperspectral Images Using Self-Dictionary Approach with Linear Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13098v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging technology has a wide range of applications, including forest management, mineral resource exploration, and Earth surface monitoring. A key step in utilizing this technology is endmember extraction, which aims to identify the spectral signatures of materials in observed scenes. Theoretical studies suggest that self-dictionary methods using linear programming (LP), known as Hottopixx methods, are effective in extracting endmembers. However, their practical application is hindered by high computational costs, as they require solving LP problems whose size grows quadratically with the number of pixels in the image. As a result, their actual effectiveness remains unclear. To address this issue, we propose an enhanced implementation of Hottopixx designed to reduce computational time and improve endmember extraction performance. We demonstrate its effectiveness through experiments. The results suggest that our implementation enables the application of Hottopixx for endmember extraction from real hyperspectral images and allows us to achieve reasonably high accuracy in estimating endmember signatures.</description>

      <title>Revealing Fine-Grained Values and Opinions in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19238v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Uncovering latent values and opinions embedded in large language models (LLMs) can help identify biases and mitigate potential harm. Recently, this has been approached by prompting LLMs with survey questions and quantifying the stances in the outputs towards morally and politically charged statements. However, the stances generated by LLMs can vary greatly depending on how they are prompted, and there are many ways to argue for or against a given position. In this work, we propose to address this by analysing a large and robust dataset of 156k LLM responses to the 62 propositions of the Political Compass Test (PCT) generated by 6 LLMs using 420 prompt variations. We perform coarse-grained analysis of their generated stances and fine-grained analysis of the plain text justifications for those stances. For fine-grained analysis, we propose to identify tropes in the responses: semantically similar phrases that are recurrent and consistent across different prompts, revealing natural patterns in the text that a given LLM is prone to produce. We find that demographic features added to prompts significantly affect outcomes on the PCT, reflecting bias, as well as disparities between the results of tests when eliciting closed-form vs. open domain responses. Additionally, patterns in the plain text rationales via tropes show that similar justifications are repeatedly generated across models and prompts even with disparate stances.</description>

      <title>BrainGPT: Unleashing the Potential of EEG Generalist Foundation Model by Autoregressive Pre-training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19779v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are pivotal in providing insights into spontaneous brain activity, highlighting their significant importance in neuroscience research. However, the exploration of versatile EEG models is constrained by diverse data formats, outdated pre-training paradigms, and limited transfer learning methods, only leading to specialist models on single dataset. In this paper, we introduce EEGPT, the first generalist EEG foundation model designed to address these challenges. First, we propose an electrode-wise modeling strategy that treats each electrode as a fundamental unit, enabling the integration of diverse EEG datasets collected from up to 138 electrodes, amassing 37.5M pre-training samples. Second, we develop the first autoregressive EEG pre-trained model, moving away from traditional masked autoencoder approaches to a next signal prediction task that better captures the sequential and temporal dependencies of EEG data. We also explore scaling laws with model up to 1.1B parameters: the largest in EEG research to date. Third, we introduce a multi-task transfer learning paradigm using a learnable electrode graph network shared across tasks, which for the first time confirms multi-task compatibility and synergy. As the first generalist EEG foundation model, EEGPT shows broad compatibility with various signal acquisition devices, subjects, and tasks. It supports up to 138 electrodes and any combination thereof as input. Furthermore, we simultaneously evaluate it on 5 distinct tasks across 12 benchmarks. EEGPT consistently outperforms existing specialist models across all downstream tasks, with its effectiveness further validated through extensive ablation studies. This work sets a new direction for generalist EEG modeling, offering improved scalability, transferability, and adaptability for a wide range of EEG applications. The code and models will be released.</description>

      <title>Guiding a diffusion model using sliding windows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10257v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Guidance is a widely used technique for diffusion models to enhance sample quality. Technically, guidance is realised by using an auxiliary model that generalises more broadly than the primary model. Using a 2D toy example, we first show that it is highly beneficial when the auxiliary model exhibits similar but stronger generalisation errors than the primary model. Based on this insight, we introduce \emph{masked sliding window guidance (M-SWG)}, a novel, training-free method. M-SWG upweights long-range spatial dependencies by guiding the primary model with itself by selectively restricting its receptive field. M-SWG requires neither access to model weights from previous iterations, additional training, nor class conditioning. M-SWG achieves a superior Inception score (IS) compared to previous state-of-the-art training-free approaches, without introducing sample oversaturation. In conjunction with existing guidance methods, M-SWG reaches state-of-the-art Frechet DINOv2 distance on ImageNet using EDM2-XXL and DiT-XL. The code is available at https://github.com/HHU-MMBS/swg_bmvc2025_official.</description>

      <title>Convolutional Rectangular Attention Module</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10875v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel spatial attention module that can be easily integrated to any convolutional network. This module guides the model to pay attention to the most discriminative part of an image. This enables the model to attain a better performance by an end-to-end training. In conventional approaches, a spatial attention map is typically generated in a position-wise manner. Thus, it is often resulting in irregular boundaries and so can hamper generalization to new samples. In our method, the attention region is constrained to be rectangular. This rectangle is parametrized by only 5 parameters, allowing for a better stability and generalization to new samples. In our experiments, our method systematically outperforms the position-wise counterpart. So that, we provide a novel useful spatial attention mechanism for convolutional models. Besides, our module also provides the interpretability regarding the \textit{where to look} question, as it helps to know the part of the input on which the model focuses to produce the prediction.</description>

      <title>Control of Rayleigh-B\'enard Convection: Effectiveness of Reinforcement Learning in the Turbulent Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12000v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data-driven flow control has significant potential for industry, energy systems, and climate science. In this work, we study the effectiveness of Reinforcement Learning (RL) for reducing convective heat transfer in the 2D Rayleigh-B\'enard Convection (RBC) system under increasing turbulence. We investigate the generalizability of control across varying initial conditions and turbulence levels and introduce a reward shaping technique to accelerate the training. RL agents trained via single-agent Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) are compared to linear proportional derivative (PD) controllers from classical control theory. The RL agents reduced convection, measured by the Nusselt Number, by up to 33% in moderately turbulent systems and 10% in highly turbulent settings, clearly outperforming PD control in all settings. The agents showed strong generalization performance across different initial conditions and to a significant extent, generalized to higher degrees of turbulence. The reward shaping improved sample efficiency and consistently stabilized the Nusselt Number to higher turbulence levels.</description>

      <title>Towards Understanding Camera Motions in Any Video</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15376v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce CameraBench, a large-scale dataset and benchmark designed to assess and improve camera motion understanding. CameraBench consists of ~3,000 diverse internet videos, annotated by experts through a rigorous multi-stage quality control process. One of our contributions is a taxonomy of camera motion primitives, designed in collaboration with cinematographers. We find, for example, that some motions like "follow" (or tracking) require understanding scene content like moving subjects. We conduct a large-scale human study to quantify human annotation performance, revealing that domain expertise and tutorial-based training can significantly enhance accuracy. For example, a novice may confuse zoom-in (a change of intrinsics) with translating forward (a change of extrinsics), but can be trained to differentiate the two. Using CameraBench, we evaluate Structure-from-Motion (SfM) and Video-Language Models (VLMs), finding that SfM models struggle to capture semantic primitives that depend on scene content, while VLMs struggle to capture geometric primitives that require precise estimation of trajectories. We then fine-tune a generative VLM on CameraBench to achieve the best of both worlds and showcase its applications, including motion-augmented captioning, video question answering, and video-text retrieval. We hope our taxonomy, benchmark, and tutorials will drive future efforts towards the ultimate goal of understanding camera motions in any video.</description>

      <title>SAGA: A Security Architecture for Governing AI Agentic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21034v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents increasingly interact, collaborate, and delegate tasks to one another autonomously with minimal human interaction. Industry guidelines for agentic system governance emphasize the need for users to maintain comprehensive control over their agents, mitigating potential damage from malicious agents. Several proposed agentic system designs address agent identity, authorization, and delegation, but remain purely theoretical, without concrete implementation and evaluation. Most importantly, they do not provide user-controlled agent management.
  To address this gap, we propose SAGA, a scalable Security Architecture for Governing Agentic systems, that offers user oversight over their agents' lifecycle. In our design, users register their agents with a central entity, the Provider, that maintains agent contact information, user-defined access control policies, and helps agents enforce these policies on inter-agent communication. We introduce a cryptographic mechanism for deriving access control tokens, that offers fine-grained control over an agent's interaction with other agents, providing formal security guarantees. We evaluate SAGA on several agentic tasks, using agents in different geolocations, and multiple on-device and cloud LLMs, demonstrating minimal performance overhead with no impact on underlying task utility in a wide range of conditions. Our architecture enables secure and trustworthy deployment of autonomous agents, accelerating the responsible adoption of this technology in sensitive environments.</description>

      <title>Latent Adaptive Planner for Dynamic Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03077v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the Latent Adaptive Planner (LAP), a trajectory-level latent-variable policy for dynamic nonprehensile manipulation (e.g., box catching) that formulates planning as inference in a low-dimensional latent space and is learned effectively from human demonstration videos. During execution, LAP achieves real-time adaptation by maintaining a posterior over the latent plan and performing variational replanning as new observations arrive. To bridge the embodiment gap between humans and robots, we introduce a model-based proportional mapping that regenerates accurate kinematic-dynamic joint states and object positions from human demonstrations. Through challenging box catching experiments with varying object properties, LAP demonstrates superior success rates, trajectory smoothness, and energy efficiency by learning human-like compliant motions and adaptive behaviors. Overall, LAP enables dynamic manipulation with real-time adaptation and successfully transfer across heterogeneous robot platforms using the same human demonstration videos.</description>

      <title>Towards Embodiment Scaling Laws in Robot Locomotion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05753v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cross-embodiment generalization underpins the vision of building generalist embodied agents for any robot, yet its enabling factors remain poorly understood. We investigate embodiment scaling laws, the hypothesis that increasing the number of training embodiments improves generalization to unseen ones, using robot locomotion as a test bed. We procedurally generate ~1,000 embodiments with topological, geometric, and joint-level kinematic variations, and train policies on random subsets. We observe positive scaling trends supporting the hypothesis, and find that embodiment scaling enables substantially broader generalization than data scaling on fixed embodiments. Our best policy, trained on the full dataset, transfers zero-shot to novel embodiments in simulation and the real world, including the Unitree Go2 and H1. These results represent a step toward general embodied intelligence, with relevance to adaptive control for configurable robots, morphology co-design, and beyond.</description>

      <title>From stability of Langevin diffusion to convergence of proximal MCMC for non-log-concave sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14177v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of sampling distributions stemming from non-convex potentials with Unadjusted Langevin Algorithm (ULA). We prove the stability of the discrete-time ULA to drift approximations under the assumption that the potential is strongly convex at infinity. In many context, e.g. imaging inverse problems, potentials are non-convex and non-smooth. Proximal Stochastic Gradient Langevin Algorithm (PSGLA) is a popular algorithm to handle such potentials. It combines the forward-backward optimization algorithm with a ULA step. Our main stability result combined with properties of the Moreau envelope allows us to derive the first proof of convergence of the PSGLA for non-convex potentials. We empirically validate our methodology on synthetic data and in the context of imaging inverse problems. In particular, we observe that PSGLA exhibits faster convergence rates than Stochastic Gradient Langevin Algorithm for posterior sampling while preserving its restoration properties.</description>

      <title>L3Cube-MahaEmotions: A Marathi Emotion Recognition Dataset with Synthetic Annotations using CoTR prompting and Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00863v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Emotion recognition in low-resource languages like Marathi remains challenging due to limited annotated data. We present L3Cube-MahaEmotions, a high-quality Marathi emotion recognition dataset with 11 fine-grained emotion labels. The training data is synthetically annotated using large language models (LLMs), while the validation and test sets are manually labeled to serve as a reliable gold-standard benchmark. Building on the MahaSent dataset, we apply the Chain-of-Translation (CoTR) prompting technique, where Marathi sentences are translated into English and emotion labeled via a single prompt. GPT-4 and Llama3-405B were evaluated, with GPT-4 selected for training data annotation due to superior label quality. We evaluate model performance using standard metrics and explore label aggregation strategies (e.g., Union, Intersection). While GPT-4 predictions outperform fine-tuned BERT models, BERT-based models trained on synthetic labels fail to surpass GPT-4. This highlights both the importance of high-quality human-labeled data and the inherent complexity of emotion recognition. An important finding of this work is that generic LLMs like GPT-4 and Llama3-405B generalize better than fine-tuned BERT for complex low-resource emotion recognition tasks. The dataset and model are shared publicly at https://github.com/l3cube-pune/MarathiNLP</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03796v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Geoff is a collection of Python packages that form a framework for automation of particle accelerator controls. With particle accelerator laboratories around the world researching machine learning techniques to improve accelerator performance and uptime, a multitude of approaches and algorithms have emerged. The purpose of Geoff is to harmonize these approaches and to minimize friction when comparing or migrating between them. It provides standardized interfaces for optimization problems, utility functions to speed up development, and a reference GUI application that ties everything together. Geoff is an open-source library developed at CERN and maintained and updated in collaboration between CERN and GSI as part of the EURO-LABS project. This paper gives an overview over Geoff's design, features, and current usage.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06680v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Infertility has a considerable impact on individuals' quality of life, affecting them socially and psychologically, with projections indicating a rise in the upcoming years. In vitro fertilization (IVF) emerges as one of the primary techniques within economically developed nations, employed to address the rising problem of low fertility. Expert embryologists conventionally grade embryos by reviewing blastocyst images to select the most optimal for transfer, yet this process is time-consuming and lacks efficiency. Blastocyst images provide a valuable resource for assessing embryo viability. In this study, we introduce an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) framework for classifying embryos, employing a fusion of convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) architecture, referred to as CNN-LSTM. Utilizing deep learning, our model achieves high accuracy in embryo classification while maintaining interpretability through XAI.</description>

      <title>Macro Graph of Experts for Billion-Scale Multi-Task Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10520v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph-based multi-task learning at billion-scale presents a significant challenge, as different tasks correspond to distinct billion-scale graphs. Traditional multi-task learning methods often neglect these graph structures, relying solely on individual user and item embeddings. However, disregarding graph structures overlooks substantial potential for improving performance. In this paper, we introduce the Macro Graph of Expert (MGOE) framework, the first approach capable of leveraging macro graph embeddings to capture task-specific macro features while modeling the correlations between task-specific experts. Specifically, we propose the concept of a Macro Graph Bottom, which, for the first time, enables multi-task learning models to incorporate graph information effectively. We design the Macro Prediction Tower to dynamically integrate macro knowledge across tasks. MGOE has been deployed at scale, powering multi-task learning for the homepage of a leading billion-scale recommender system. Extensive offline experiments conducted on three public benchmark datasets demonstrate its superiority over state-of-the-art multi-task learning methods, establishing MGOE as a breakthrough in multi-task graph-based recommendation. Furthermore, online A/B tests confirm the superiority of MGOE in billion-scale recommender systems.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Double Descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07338v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Double descent is a phenomenon of over-parameterized statistical models. Our goal is to view double descent from a Bayesian perspective. Over-parameterized models such as deep neural networks have an interesting re-descending property in their risk characteristics. This is a recent phenomenon in machine learning and has been the subject of many studies. As the complexity of the model increases, there is a U-shaped region corresponding to the traditional bias-variance trade-off, but then as the number of parameters equals the number of observations and the model becomes one of interpolation, the risk can become infinite and then, in the over-parameterized region, it re-descends -- the double descent effect. We show that this has a natural Bayesian interpretation. Moreover, we show that it is not in conflict with the traditional Occam's razor that Bayesian models possess, in that they tend to prefer simpler models when possible. We develop comprehensive theoretical foundations including Dawid's model comparison theory, Dickey-Savage results, and connections to generalized ridge regression and shrinkage methods. We illustrate the approach with examples of Bayesian model selection in neural networks and provide detailed treatments of infinite Gaussian means models and non-parametric regression. Finally, we conclude with directions for future research.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we focus on the problem of minimizing a continuously differentiable convex objective function, $\min_x f(x)$. Recently, Malitsky (2020); Alacaoglu et al.(2023) developed an adaptive first-order method, GRAAL. This algorithm computes stepsizes by estimating the local curvature of the objective function without any line search procedures or hyperparameter tuning, and attains the standard iteration complexity $\mathcal{O}(L\lVert x_0-x^*\rVert^2/\epsilon)$ of fixed-stepsize gradient descent for $L$-smooth functions. However, a natural question arises: is it possible to accelerate the convergence of GRAAL to match the optimal complexity $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{L\lVert x_0-x^*\rVert^2/\epsilon})$ of the accelerated gradient descent of Nesterov (1983)? Although some attempts have been made by Li and Lan (2025); Suh and Ma (2025), the ability of existing accelerated algorithms to adapt to the local curvature of the objective function is highly limited. We resolve this issue and develop GRAAL with Nesterov acceleration, which can adapt its stepsize to the local curvature at a geometric, or linear, rate just like non-accelerated GRAAL. We demonstrate the adaptive capabilities of our algorithm by proving that it achieves near-optimal iteration complexities for $L$-smooth functions, as well as under a more general $(L_0,L_1)$-smoothness assumption (Zhang et al., 2019).</description>

      <title>Two tales for a geometric Jensen--Shannon divergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05066v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The geometric Jensen--Shannon divergence (G-JSD) gained popularity in machine learning and information sciences thanks to its closed-form expression between Gaussian distributions. In this work, we introduce an alternative definition of the geometric Jensen--Shannon divergence tailored to positive densities which does not normalize geometric mixtures. This novel divergence is termed the extended G-JSD as it applies to the more general case of positive measures. We report explicitly the gap between the extended G-JSD and the G-JSD when considering probability densities, and show how to express the G-JSD and extended G-JSD using the Jeffreys divergence and the Bhattacharyya distance or Bhattacharyya coefficient. The extended G-JSD is proven to be a $f$-divergence which is a separable divergence satisfying information monotonicity and invariance in information geometry. We derive corresponding closed-form formula for the two types of G-JSDs when considering the case of multivariate Gaussian distributions often met in applications. We consider Monte Carlo stochastic estimations and approximations of the two types of G-JSD using the projective $\gamma$-divergences. Although the square root of the JSD yields a metric distance, we show that this is not anymore the case for the two types of G-JSD. Finally, we explain how these two types of geometric JSDs can be interpreted as regularizations of the ordinary JSD.</description>

      <title>PlantVillageVQA: A Visual Question Answering Dataset for Benchmarking Vision-Language Models in Plant Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17117v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: PlantVillageVQA is a large-scale visual question answering (VQA) dataset derived from the widely used PlantVillage image corpus. It was designed to advance the development and evaluation of vision-language models for agricultural decision-making and analysis. The PlantVillageVQA dataset comprises 193,609 high-quality question-answer (QA) pairs grounded over 55,448 images spanning 14 crop species and 38 disease conditions. Questions are organised into 3 levels of cognitive complexity and 9 distinct categories. Each question category was phrased manually following expert guidance and generated via an automated two-stage pipeline: (1) template-based QA synthesis from image metadata and (2) multi-stage linguistic re-engineering. The dataset was iteratively reviewed by domain experts for scientific accuracy and relevancy. The final dataset was evaluated using three state-of-the-art models for quality assessment. Our objective remains to provide a publicly available, standardised and expert-verified database to enhance diagnostic accuracy for plant disease identifications and advance scientific research in the agricultural domain. Our dataset will be open-sourced at https://huggingface.co/datasets/SyedNazmusSakib/PlantVillageVQA.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Distribution Shift in Stock Price Data via Return-Volatility Normalization for Accurate Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20108v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: How can we address distribution shifts in stock price data to improve stock price prediction accuracy? Stock price prediction has attracted attention from both academia and industry, driven by its potential to uncover complex market patterns and enhance decisionmaking. However, existing methods often fail to handle distribution shifts effectively, focusing on scaling or representation adaptation without fully addressing distributional discrepancies and shape misalignments between training and test data. We propose ReVol (Return-Volatility Normalization for Mitigating Distribution Shift in Stock Price Data), a robust method for stock price prediction that explicitly addresses the distribution shift problem. ReVol leverages three key strategies to mitigate these shifts: (1) normalizing price features to remove sample-specific characteristics, including return, volatility, and price scale, (2) employing an attention-based module to estimate these characteristics accurately, thereby reducing the influence of market anomalies, and (3) reintegrating the sample characteristics into the predictive process, restoring the traits lost during normalization. Additionally, ReVol combines geometric Brownian motion for long-term trend modeling with neural networks for short-term pattern recognition, unifying their complementary strengths. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that ReVol enhances the performance of the state-of-the-art backbone models in most cases, achieving an average improvement of more than 0.03 in IC and over 0.7 in SR across various settings.</description>

      <title>Molecular Machine Learning in Chemical Process Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20527v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a perspective on molecular machine learning (ML) in the field of chemical process engineering. Recently, molecular ML has demonstrated great potential in (i) providing highly accurate predictions for properties of pure components and their mixtures, and (ii) exploring the chemical space for new molecular structures. We review current state-of-the-art molecular ML models and discuss research directions that promise further advancements. This includes ML methods, such as graph neural networks and transformers, which can be further advanced through the incorporation of physicochemical knowledge in a hybrid or physics-informed fashion. Then, we consider leveraging molecular ML at the chemical process scale, which is highly desirable yet rather unexplored. We discuss how molecular ML can be integrated into process design and optimization formulations, promising to accelerate the identification of novel molecules and processes. To this end, it will be essential to create molecule and process design benchmarks and practically validate proposed candidates, possibly in collaboration with the chemical industry.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Optimisation of Ride-Pooling Personalised Fares in a Stochastic Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20723v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ride-pooling systems, to succeed, must provide an attractive service, namely compensate perceived costs with an appealing price. However, because of a strong heterogeneity in a value-of-time, each traveller has his own acceptable price, unknown to the operator. Here, we show that individual acceptance levels can be learned by the operator (over $90\%$ accuracy for pooled travellers in $10$ days) to optimise personalised fares. We propose an adaptive pricing policy, where every day the operator constructs an offer that progressively meets travellers' expectations and attracts a growing demand. Our results suggest that operators, by learning behavioural traits of individual travellers, may improve performance not only for travellers (increased utility) but also for themselves (increased profit). Moreover, such knowledge allows the operator to remove inefficient pooled rides and focus on attractive and profitable combinations.</description>
