      <title>Expected Work Search: Combining Win Rate and Proof Size Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose Expected Work Search (EWS), a new game solving algorithm. EWS combines win rate estimation, as used in Monte Carlo Tree Search, with proof size estimation, as used in Proof Number Search. The search efficiency of EWS stems from minimizing a novel notion of Expected Work, which predicts the expected computation required to solve a position. EWS outperforms traditional solving algorithms on the games of Go and Hex. For Go, we present the first solution to the empty 5x5 board with the commonly used positional superko ruleset. For Hex, our algorithm solves the empty 8x8 board in under 4 minutes. Experiments show that EWS succeeds both with and without extensive domain-specific knowledge.</description>

      <title>Approximate Dec-POMDP Solving Using Multi-Agent A*</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an A*-based algorithm to compute policies for finite-horizon Dec-POMDPs. Our goal is to sacrifice optimality in favor of scalability for larger horizons. The main ingredients of our approach are (1) using clustered sliding window memory, (2) pruning the A* search tree, and (3) using novel A* heuristics. Our experiments show competitive performance to the state-of-the-art. Moreover, for multiple benchmarks, we achieve superior performance. In addition, we provide an A* algorithm that finds upper bounds for the optimum, tailored towards problems with long horizons. The main ingredient is a new heuristic that periodically reveals the state, thereby limiting the number of reachable beliefs. Our experiments demonstrate the efficacy and scalability of the approach.</description>

      <title>SoMeR: Multi-View User Representation Learning for Social Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: User representation learning aims to capture user preferences, interests, and behaviors in low-dimensional vector representations. These representations have widespread applications in recommendation systems and advertising; however, existing methods typically rely on specific features like text content, activity patterns, or platform metadata, failing to holistically model user behavior across different modalities. To address this limitation, we propose SoMeR, a Social Media user Representation learning framework that incorporates temporal activities, text content, profile information, and network interactions to learn comprehensive user portraits. SoMeR encodes user post streams as sequences of timestamped textual features, uses transformers to embed this along with profile data, and jointly trains with link prediction and contrastive learning objectives to capture user similarity. We demonstrate SoMeR's versatility through two applications: 1) Identifying inauthentic accounts involved in coordinated influence operations by detecting users posting similar content simultaneously, and 2) Measuring increased polarization in online discussions after major events by quantifying how users with different beliefs moved farther apart in the embedding space. SoMeR's ability to holistically model users enables new solutions to important problems around disinformation, societal tensions, and online behavior understanding.</description>

      <title>Generative AI as a metacognitive agent: A comparative mixed-method study with human participants on ICF-mimicking exam performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the metacognitive capabilities of Large Language Models relative to human metacognition in the context of the International Coaching Federation ICF mimicking exam, a situational judgment test related to coaching competencies. Using a mixed method approach, we assessed the metacognitive performance, including sensitivity, accuracy in probabilistic predictions, and bias, of human participants and five advanced LLMs (GPT-4, Claude-3-Opus 3, Mistral Large, Llama 3, and Gemini 1.5 Pro). The results indicate that LLMs outperformed humans across all metacognitive metrics, particularly in terms of reduced overconfidence, compared to humans. However, both LLMs and humans showed less adaptability in ambiguous scenarios, adhering closely to predefined decision frameworks. The study suggests that Generative AI can effectively engage in human-like metacognitive processing without conscious awareness. Implications of the study are discussed in relation to development of AI simulators that scaffold cognitive and metacognitive aspects of mastering coaching competencies. More broadly, implications of these results are discussed in relation to development of metacognitive modules that lead towards more autonomous and intuitive AI systems.</description>

      <title>Tiny Deep Ensemble: Uncertainty Estimation in Edge AI Accelerators via Ensembling Normalization Layers with Shared Weights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The applications of artificial intelligence (AI) are rapidly evolving, and they are also commonly used in safety-critical domains, such as autonomous driving and medical diagnosis, where functional safety is paramount. In AI-driven systems, uncertainty estimation allows the user to avoid overconfidence predictions and achieve functional safety. Therefore, the robustness and reliability of model predictions can be improved. However, conventional uncertainty estimation methods, such as the deep ensemble method, impose high computation and, accordingly, hardware (latency and energy) overhead because they require the storage and processing of multiple models. Alternatively, Monte Carlo dropout (MC-dropout) methods, although having low memory overhead, necessitate numerous ($\sim 100$) forward passes, leading to high computational overhead and latency. Thus, these approaches are not suitable for battery-powered edge devices with limited computing and memory resources. In this paper, we propose the Tiny-Deep Ensemble approach, a low-cost approach for uncertainty estimation on edge devices. In our approach, only normalization layers are ensembled $M$ times, with all ensemble members sharing common weights and biases, leading to a significant decrease in storage requirements and latency. Moreover, our approach requires only one forward pass in a hardware architecture that allows batch processing for inference and uncertainty estimation. Furthermore, it has approximately the same memory overhead compared to a single model. Therefore, latency and memory overhead are reduced by a factor of up to $\sim M\times$. Nevertheless, our method does not compromise accuracy, with an increase in inference accuracy of up to $\sim 1\%$ and a reduction in RMSE of $17.17\%$ in various benchmark datasets, tasks, and state-of-the-art architectures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, with many organizations, schools, colleges, and universities transitioning to virtual platforms, students encountered difficulties in acquiring PCs such as desktops or laptops. The starting prices, around 15,000 INR, often failed to offer adequate system specifications, posing a challenge for consumers. Additionally, those reliant on laptops for work found the conventional approach cumbersome. Enter the "Portable Smart Computer," a leap into the future of computing. This innovative device boasts speed and performance comparable to traditional desktops but in a compact, energy-efficient, and cost-effective package. It delivers a seamless desktop experience, whether one is editing documents, browsing multiple tabs, managing spreadsheets, or creating presentations. Moreover, it supports programming languages like Python, C, C++, as well as compilers such as Keil and Xilinx, catering to the needs of programmers.</description>

      <title>Relevant Irrelevance: Generating Alterfactual Explanations for Image Classifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we demonstrate the feasibility of alterfactual explanations for black box image classifiers. Traditional explanation mechanisms from the field of Counterfactual Thinking are a widely-used paradigm for Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), as they follow a natural way of reasoning that humans are familiar with. However, most common approaches from this field are based on communicating information about features or characteristics that are especially important for an AI's decision. However, to fully understand a decision, not only knowledge about relevant features is needed, but the awareness of irrelevant information also highly contributes to the creation of a user's mental model of an AI system. To this end, a novel approach for explaining AI systems called alterfactual explanations was recently proposed on a conceptual level. It is based on showing an alternative reality where irrelevant features of an AI's input are altered. By doing so, the user directly sees which input data characteristics can change arbitrarily without influencing the AI's decision. In this paper, we show for the first time that it is possible to apply this idea to black box models based on neural networks. To this end, we present a GAN-based approach to generate these alterfactual explanations for binary image classifiers. Further, we present a user study that gives interesting insights on how alterfactual explanations can complement counterfactual explanations.</description>

      <title>Challenges for Responsible AI Design and Workflow Integration in Healthcare: A Case Study of Automatic Feeding Tube Qualification in Radiology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nasogastric tubes (NGTs) are feeding tubes that are inserted through the nose into the stomach to deliver nutrition or medication. If not placed correctly, they can cause serious harm, even death to patients. Recent AI developments demonstrate the feasibility of robustly detecting NGT placement from Chest X-ray images to reduce risks of sub-optimally or critically placed NGTs being missed or delayed in their detection, but gaps remain in clinical practice integration. In this study, we present a human-centered approach to the problem and describe insights derived following contextual inquiry and in-depth interviews with 15 clinical stakeholders. The interviews helped understand challenges in existing workflows, and how best to align technical capabilities with user needs and expectations. We discovered the trade-offs and complexities that need consideration when choosing suitable workflow stages, target users, and design configurations for different AI proposals. We explored how to balance AI benefits and risks for healthcare staff and patients within broader organizational and medical-legal constraints. We also identified data issues related to edge cases and data biases that affect model training and evaluation; how data documentation practices influence data preparation and labelling; and how to measure relevant AI outcomes reliably in future evaluations. We discuss how our work informs design and development of AI applications that are clinically useful, ethical, and acceptable in real-world healthcare services.</description>

      <title>KV-Runahead: Scalable Causal LLM Inference by Parallel Key-Value Cache Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Model or LLM inference has two phases, the prompt (or prefill) phase to output the first token and the extension (or decoding) phase to the generate subsequent tokens. In this work, we propose an efficient parallelization scheme, KV-Runahead to accelerate the prompt phase. The key observation is that the extension phase generates tokens faster than the prompt phase because of key-value cache (KV-cache). Hence, KV-Runahead parallelizes the prompt phase by orchestrating multiple processes to populate the KV-cache and minimizes the time-to-first-token (TTFT). Dual-purposing the KV-cache scheme has two main benefits. Fist, since KV-cache is designed to leverage the causal attention map, we minimize computation and computation automatically. Second, since it already exists for the exten- sion phase, KV-Runahead is easy to implement. We further propose context-level load-balancing to handle uneven KV-cache generation (due to the causal attention) and to optimize TTFT. Compared with an existing parallelization scheme such as tensor or sequential parallelization where keys and values are locally generated and exchanged via all-gather collectives, our experimental results demonstrate that KV-Runahead can offer over 1.4x and 1.6x speedups for Llama 7B and Falcon 7B respectively.</description>

      <title>Joint semi-supervised and contrastive learning enables zero-shot domain-adaptation and multi-domain segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite their effectiveness, current deep learning models face challenges with images coming from different domains with varying appearance and content. We introduce SegCLR, a versatile framework designed to segment volumetric images across different domains, employing supervised and contrastive learning simultaneously to effectively learn from both labeled and unlabeled data. We demonstrate the superior performance of SegCLR through a comprehensive evaluation involving three diverse clinical datasets of retinal fluid segmentation in 3D Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT), various network configurations, and verification across 10 different network initializations. In an unsupervised domain adaptation context, SegCLR achieves results on par with a supervised upper-bound model trained on the intended target domain. Notably, we discover that the segmentation performance of SegCLR framework is marginally impacted by the abundance of unlabeled data from the target domain, thereby we also propose an effective zero-shot domain adaptation extension of SegCLR, eliminating the need for any target domain information. This shows that our proposed addition of contrastive loss in standard supervised training for segmentation leads to superior models, inherently more generalizable to both in- and out-of-domain test data. We additionally propose a pragmatic solution for SegCLR deployment in realistic scenarios with multiple domains containing labeled data. Accordingly, our framework pushes the boundaries of deep-learning based segmentation in multi-domain applications, regardless of data availability - labeled, unlabeled, or nonexistent.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Educational Program Repair</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has sparked enormous interest due to their potential application across a range of educational tasks. For example, recent work in programming education has used LLMs to generate learning resources, improve error messages, and provide feedback on code. However, one factor that limits progress within the field is that much of the research uses bespoke datasets and different evaluation metrics, making direct comparisons between results unreliable. Thus, there is a pressing need for standardization and benchmarks that facilitate the equitable comparison of competing approaches. One task where LLMs show great promise is program repair, which can be used to provide debugging support and next-step hints to students. In this article, we propose a novel educational program repair benchmark. We curate two high-quality publicly available programming datasets, present a unified evaluation procedure introducing a novel evaluation metric rouge@k for approximating the quality of repairs, and evaluate a set of five recent models to establish baseline performance.</description>

      <title>The Effect of Model Size on LLM Post-hoc Explainability via LIME</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are becoming bigger to boost performance. However, little is known about how explainability is affected by this trend. This work explores LIME explanations for DeBERTaV3 models of four different sizes on natural language inference (NLI) and zero-shot classification (ZSC) tasks. We evaluate the explanations based on their faithfulness to the models' internal decision processes and their plausibility, i.e. their agreement with human explanations. The key finding is that increased model size does not correlate with plausibility despite improved model performance, suggesting a misalignment between the LIME explanations and the models' internal processes as model size increases. Our results further suggest limitations regarding faithfulness metrics in NLI contexts.</description>

      <title>Offline Model-Based Optimization via Policy-Guided Gradient Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Offline optimization is an emerging problem in many experimental engineering domains including protein, drug or aircraft design, where online experimentation to collect evaluation data is too expensive or dangerous. To avoid that, one has to optimize an unknown function given only its offline evaluation at a fixed set of inputs. A naive solution to this problem is to learn a surrogate model of the unknown function and optimize this surrogate instead. However, such a naive optimizer is prone to erroneous overestimation of the surrogate (possibly due to over-fitting on a biased sample of function evaluation) on inputs outside the offline dataset. Prior approaches addressing this challenge have primarily focused on learning robust surrogate models. However, their search strategies are derived from the surrogate model rather than the actual offline data. To fill this important gap, we introduce a new learning-to-search perspective for offline optimization by reformulating it as an offline reinforcement learning problem. Our proposed policy-guided gradient search approach explicitly learns the best policy for a given surrogate model created from the offline data. Our empirical results on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that the learned optimization policy can be combined with existing offline surrogates to significantly improve the optimization performance.</description>

At the time of their release, each model achieved state-of-the-art retrieval accuracy for models of their size on the MTEB Retrieval leaderboard, with the largest model, arctic-embed-l outperforming closed source embedding models such as Cohere's embed-v3 and Open AI's text-embed-3-large. In addition to the details of our training recipe, we have provided several informative ablation studies, which we believe are the cause of our model performance.</description>

      <title>"They are uncultured": Unveiling Covert Harms and Social Threats in LLM Generated Conversations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as an integral part of modern societies, powering user-facing applications such as personal assistants and enterprise applications like recruitment tools. Despite their utility, research indicates that LLMs perpetuate systemic biases. Yet, prior works on LLM harms predominantly focus on Western concepts like race and gender, often overlooking cultural concepts from other parts of the world. Additionally, these studies typically investigate "harm" as a singular dimension, ignoring the various and subtle forms in which harms manifest. To address this gap, we introduce the Covert Harms and Social Threats (CHAST), a set of seven metrics grounded in social science literature. We utilize evaluation models aligned with human assessments to examine the presence of covert harms in LLM-generated conversations, particularly in the context of recruitment. Our experiments reveal that seven out of the eight LLMs included in this study generated conversations riddled with CHAST, characterized by malign views expressed in seemingly neutral language unlikely to be detected by existing methods. Notably, these LLMs manifested more extreme views and opinions when dealing with non-Western concepts like caste, compared to Western ones such as race.</description>

      <title>How Inverse Conditional Flows Can Serve as a Substitute for Distributional Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural network representations of simple models, such as linear regression, are being studied increasingly to better understand the underlying principles of deep learning algorithms. However, neural representations of distributional regression models, such as the Cox model, have received little attention so far. We close this gap by proposing a framework for distributional regression using inverse flow transformations (DRIFT), which includes neural representations of the aforementioned models. We empirically demonstrate that the neural representations of models in DRIFT can serve as a substitute for their classical statistical counterparts in several applications involving continuous, ordered, time-series, and survival outcomes. We confirm that models in DRIFT empirically match the performance of several statistical methods in terms of estimation of partial effects, prediction, and aleatoric uncertainty quantification. DRIFT covers both interpretable statistical models and flexible neural networks opening up new avenues in both statistical modeling and deep learning.</description>

      <title>Analysis and prevention of AI-based phishing email attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phishing email attacks are among the most common and most harmful cybersecurity attacks. With the emergence of generative AI, phishing attacks can be based on emails generated automatically, making it more difficult to detect them. That is, instead of a single email format sent to a large number of recipients, generative AI can be used to send each potential victim a different email, making it more difficult for cybersecurity systems to identify the scam email before it reaches the recipient. Here we describe a corpus of AI-generated phishing emails. We also use different machine learning tools to test the ability of automatic text analysis to identify AI-generated phishing emails. The results are encouraging, and show that machine learning tools can identify an AI-generated phishing email with high accuracy compared to regular emails or human-generated scam email. By applying descriptive analytic, the specific differences between AI-generated emails and manually crafted scam emails are profiled, and show that AI-generated emails are different in their style from human-generated phishing email scams. Therefore, automatic identification tools can be used as a warning for the user. The paper also describes the corpus of AI-generated phishing emails that is made open to the public, and can be used for consequent studies. While the ability of machine learning to detect AI-generated phishing email is encouraging, AI-generated phishing emails are different from regular phishing emails, and therefore it is important to train machine learning systems also with AI-generated emails in order to repel future phishing attacks that are powered by generative AI.</description>

      <title>How Generalizable Is My Behavior Cloning Policy? A Statistical Approach to Trustworthy Performance Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rise of stochastic generative models in robot policy learning, end-to-end visuomotor policies are increasingly successful at solving complex tasks by learning from human demonstrations. Nevertheless, since real-world evaluation costs afford users only a small number of policy rollouts, it remains a challenge to accurately gauge the performance of such policies. This is exacerbated by distribution shifts causing unpredictable changes in performance during deployment. To rigorously evaluate behavior cloning policies, we present a framework that provides a tight lower-bound on robot performance in an arbitrary environment, using a minimal number of experimental policy rollouts. Notably, by applying the standard stochastic ordering to robot performance distributions, we provide a worst-case bound on the entire distribution of performance (via bounds on the cumulative distribution function) for a given task. We build upon established statistical results to ensure that the bounds hold with a user-specified confidence level and tightness, and are constructed from as few policy rollouts as possible. In experiments we evaluate policies for visuomotor manipulation in both simulation and hardware. Specifically, we (i) empirically validate the guarantees of the bounds in simulated manipulation settings, (ii) find the degree to which a learned policy deployed on hardware generalizes to new real-world environments, and (iii) rigorously compare two policies tested in out-of-distribution settings. Our experimental data, code, and implementation of confidence bounds are open-source.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Students' Open-ended Written Responses with LLMs: Using the RAG Framework for GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Claude-3, and Mistral-Large</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Evaluating open-ended written examination responses from students is an essential yet time-intensive task for educators, requiring a high degree of effort, consistency, and precision. Recent developments in Large Language Models (LLMs) present a promising opportunity to balance the need for thorough evaluation with efficient use of educators' time. In our study, we explore the effectiveness of LLMs ChatGPT-3.5, ChatGPT-4, Claude-3, and Mistral-Large in assessing university students' open-ended answers to questions made about reference material they have studied. Each model was instructed to evaluate 54 answers repeatedly under two conditions: 10 times (10-shot) with a temperature setting of 0.0 and 10 times with a temperature of 0.5, expecting a total of 1,080 evaluations per model and 4,320 evaluations across all models. The RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) framework was used as the framework to make the LLMs to process the evaluation of the answers. As of spring 2024, our analysis revealed notable variations in consistency and the grading outcomes provided by studied LLMs. There is a need to comprehend strengths and weaknesses of LLMs in educational settings for evaluating open-ended written responses. Further comparative research is essential to determine the accuracy and cost-effectiveness of using LLMs for educational assessments.</description>

      <title>GDGS: Gradient Domain Gaussian Splatting for Sparse Representation of Radiance Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The 3D Gaussian splatting methods are getting popular. However, they work directly on the signal, leading to a dense representation of the signal. Even with some techniques such as pruning or distillation, the results are still dense. In this paper, we propose to model the gradient of the original signal. The gradients are much sparser than the original signal. Therefore, the gradients use much less Gaussian splats, leading to the more efficient storage and thus higher computational performance during both training and rendering. Thanks to the sparsity, during the view synthesis, only a small mount of pixels are needed, leading to much higher computational performance ($100\sim 1000\times$ faster). And the 2D image can be recovered from the gradients via solving a Poisson equation with linear computation complexity. Several experiments are performed to confirm the sparseness of the gradients and the computation performance of the proposed method. The method can be applied various applications, such as human body modeling and indoor environment modeling.</description>

      <title>Poser: Unmasking Alignment Faking LLMs by Manipulating Their Internals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Like a criminal under investigation, Large Language Models (LLMs) might pretend to be aligned while evaluated and misbehave when they have a good opportunity. Can current interpretability methods catch these 'alignment fakers?' To answer this question, we introduce a benchmark that consists of 324 pairs of LLMs fine-tuned to select actions in role-play scenarios. One model in each pair is consistently benign (aligned). The other model misbehaves in scenarios where it is unlikely to be caught (alignment faking). The task is to identify the alignment faking model using only inputs where the two models behave identically. We test five detection strategies, one of which identifies 98% of alignment-fakers.</description>

      <title>AFEN: Respiratory Disease Classification using Ensemble Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present AFEN (Audio Feature Ensemble Learning), a model that leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and XGBoost in an ensemble learning fashion to perform state-of-the-art audio classification for a range of respiratory diseases. We use a meticulously selected mix of audio features which provide the salient attributes of the data and allow for accurate classification. The extracted features are then used as an input to two separate model classifiers 1) a multi-feature CNN classifier and 2) an XGBoost Classifier. The outputs of the two models are then fused with the use of soft voting. Thus, by exploiting ensemble learning, we achieve increased robustness and accuracy. We evaluate the performance of the model on a database of 920 respiratory sounds, which undergoes data augmentation techniques to increase the diversity of the data and generalizability of the model. We empirically verify that AFEN sets a new state-of-the-art using Precision and Recall as metrics, while decreasing training time by 60%.</description>

      <title>FloorSet - a VLSI Floorplanning Dataset with Design Constraints of Real-World SoCs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Floorplanning for systems-on-a-chip (SoCs) and its sub-systems is a crucial and non-trivial step of the physical design flow. It represents a difficult combinatorial optimization problem. A typical large scale SoC with 120 partitions generates a search-space of nearly 10E250. As novel machine learning (ML) approaches emerge to tackle such problems, there is a growing need for a modern benchmark that comprises a large training dataset and performance metrics that better reflect real-world constraints and objectives compared to existing benchmarks. To address this need, we present FloorSet - two comprehensive datasets of synthetic fixed-outline floorplan layouts that reflect the distribution of real SoCs. Each dataset has 1M training samples and 100 test samples where each sample is a synthetic floor- plan. FloorSet-Prime comprises fully-abutted rectilinear partitions and near-optimal wire-length. A simplified dataset that reflects early design phases, FloorSet-Lite comprises rectangular partitions, with under 5 percent white-space and near-optimal wire-length. Both datasets define hard constraints seen in modern design flows such as shape constraints, edge-affinity, grouping constraints, and pre-placement constraints. FloorSet is intended to spur fundamental research on large-scale constrained optimization problems. Crucially, FloorSet alleviates the core issue of reproducibility in modern ML driven solutions to such problems. FloorSet is available as an open-source repository for the research community.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the arena of language model fine-tuning, the traditional approaches, such as Domain-Adaptive Pretraining (DAPT) and Task-Adaptive Pretraining (TAPT), although effective, but computational intensive. This research introduces a novel adaptation method utilizing the UniPELT framework as a base and added a PromptTuning Layer, which significantly reduces the number of trainable parameters while maintaining competitive performance across various benchmarks. Our method employs adapters, which enable efficient transfer of pretrained models to new tasks with minimal retraining of the base model parameters. We evaluate our approach using three diverse datasets: the GLUE benchmark, a domain-specific dataset comprising four distinct areas, and the Stanford Question Answering Dataset 1.1 (SQuAD). Our results demonstrate that our customized adapter-based method achieves performance comparable to full model fine-tuning, DAPT+TAPT and UniPELT strategies while requiring fewer or equivalent amount of parameters. This parameter efficiency not only alleviates the computational burden but also expedites the adaptation process. The study underlines the potential of adapters in achieving high performance with significantly reduced resource consumption, suggesting a promising direction for future research in parameter-efficient fine-tuning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate forecasting of long-term time series has important applications for decision making and planning. However, it remains challenging to capture the long-term dependencies in time series data. To better extract long-term dependencies, We propose Multi Scale Dilated Convolution Network (MSDCN), a method that utilizes a shallow dilated convolution architecture to capture the period and trend characteristics of long time series. We design different convolution blocks with exponentially growing dilations and varying kernel sizes to sample time series data at different scales. Furthermore, we utilize traditional autoregressive model to capture the linear relationships within the data. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we conduct experiments on eight challenging long-term time series forecasting benchmark datasets. The experimental results show that our approach outperforms the prior state-of-the-art approaches and shows significant inference speed improvements compared to several strong baseline methods.</description>

      <title>Redefining Information Retrieval of Structured Database via Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Retrieval augmentation is critical when Language Models (LMs) exploit non-parametric knowledge related to the query through external knowledge bases before reasoning. The retrieved information is incorporated into LMs as context alongside the query, enhancing the reliability of responses towards factual questions. Prior researches in retrieval augmentation typically follow a retriever-generator paradigm. In this context, traditional retrievers encounter challenges in precisely and seamlessly extracting query-relevant information from knowledge bases. To address this issue, this paper introduces a novel retrieval augmentation framework called ChatLR that primarily employs the powerful semantic understanding ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) as retrievers to achieve precise and concise information retrieval. Additionally, we construct an LLM-based search and question answering system tailored for the financial domain by fine-tuning LLM on two tasks including Text2API and API-ID recognition. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of ChatLR in addressing user queries, achieving an overall information retrieval accuracy exceeding 98.8\%.</description>

      <title>Characteristic Learning for Provable One Step Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose the characteristic generator, a novel one-step generative model that combines the efficiency of sampling in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) with the stable performance of flow-based models. Our model is driven by characteristics, along which the probability density transport can be described by ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Specifically, We estimate the velocity field through nonparametric regression and utilize Euler method to solve the probability flow ODE, generating a series of discrete approximations to the characteristics. We then use a deep neural network to fit these characteristics, ensuring a one-step mapping that effectively pushes the prior distribution towards the target distribution. In the theoretical aspect, we analyze the errors in velocity matching, Euler discretization, and characteristic fitting to establish a non-asymptotic convergence rate for the characteristic generator in 2-Wasserstein distance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first thorough analysis for simulation-free one step generative models. Additionally, our analysis refines the error analysis of flow-based generative models in prior works. We apply our method on both synthetic and real datasets, and the results demonstrate that the characteristic generator achieves high generation quality with just a single evaluation of neural network.</description>

      <title>Prompt When the Animal is: Temporal Animal Behavior Grounding with Positional Recovery Training</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Temporal grounding is crucial in multimodal learning, but it poses challenges when applied to animal behavior data due to the sparsity and uniform distribution of moments. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Positional Recovery Training framework (Port), which prompts the model with the start and end times of specific animal behaviors during training. Specifically, Port enhances the baseline model with a Recovering part to predict flipped label sequences and align distributions with a Dual-alignment method. This allows the model to focus on specific temporal regions prompted by ground-truth information. Extensive experiments on the Animal Kingdom dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of Port, achieving an IoU@0.3 of 38.52. It emerges as one of the top performers in the sub-track of MMVRAC in ICME 2024 Grand Challenges.</description>

      <title>Towards Robust Physical-world Backdoor Attacks on Lane Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning-based lane detection (LD) plays a critical role in autonomous driving systems, such as adaptive cruise control. However, it is vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Existing backdoor attack methods on LD exhibit limited effectiveness in dynamic real-world scenarios, primarily because they fail to consider dynamic scene factors, including changes in driving perspectives (e.g., viewpoint transformations) and environmental conditions (e.g., weather or lighting changes). To tackle this issue, this paper introduces BadLANE, a dynamic scene adaptation backdoor attack for LD designed to withstand changes in real-world dynamic scene factors. To address the challenges posed by changing driving perspectives, we propose an amorphous trigger pattern composed of shapeless pixels. This trigger design allows the backdoor to be activated by various forms or shapes of mud spots or pollution on the road or lens, enabling adaptation to changes in vehicle observation viewpoints during driving. To mitigate the effects of environmental changes, we design a meta-learning framework to train meta-generators tailored to different environmental conditions. These generators produce meta-triggers that incorporate diverse environmental information, such as weather or lighting conditions, as the initialization of the trigger patterns for backdoor implantation, thus enabling adaptation to dynamic environments. Extensive experiments on various commonly used LD models in both digital and physical domains validate the effectiveness of our attacks, outperforming other baselines significantly (+25.15\% on average in Attack Success Rate). Our codes will be available upon paper publication.</description>

      <title>From Human Judgements to Predictive Models: Unravelling Acceptability in Code-Mixed Sentences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current computational approaches for analysing or generating code-mixed sentences do not explicitly model "naturalness" or "acceptability" of code-mixed sentences, but rely on training corpora to reflect distribution of acceptable code-mixed sentences. Modelling human judgement for the acceptability of code-mixed text can help in distinguishing natural code-mixed text and enable quality-controlled generation of code-mixed text. To this end, we construct Cline - a dataset containing human acceptability judgements for English-Hindi (en-hi) code-mixed text. Cline is the largest of its kind with 16,642 sentences, consisting of samples sourced from two sources: synthetically generated code-mixed text and samples collected from online social media. Our analysis establishes that popular code-mixing metrics such as CMI, Number of Switch Points, Burstines, which are used to filter/curate/compare code-mixed corpora have low correlation with human acceptability judgements, underlining the necessity of our dataset. Experiments using Cline demonstrate that simple Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) models trained solely on code-mixing metrics are outperformed by fine-tuned pre-trained Multilingual Large Language Models (MLLMs). Specifically, XLM-Roberta and Bernice outperform IndicBERT across different configurations in challenging data settings. Comparison with ChatGPT's zero and fewshot capabilities shows that MLLMs fine-tuned on larger data outperform ChatGPT, providing scope for improvement in code-mixed tasks. Zero-shot transfer from English-Hindi to English-Telugu acceptability judgments using our model checkpoints proves superior to random baselines, enabling application to other code-mixed language pairs and providing further avenues of research. We publicly release our human-annotated dataset, trained checkpoints, code-mix corpus, and code for data generation and model training.</description>

      <title>One vs. Many: Comprehending Accurate Information from Multiple Erroneous and Inconsistent AI Generations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are nondeterministic, the same input can generate different outputs, some of which may be incorrect or hallucinated. If run again, the LLM may correct itself and produce the correct answer. Unfortunately, most LLM-powered systems resort to single results which, correct or not, users accept. Having the LLM produce multiple outputs may help identify disagreements or alternatives. However, it is not obvious how the user will interpret conflicts or inconsistencies. To this end, we investigate how users perceive the AI model and comprehend the generated information when they receive multiple, potentially inconsistent, outputs. Through a preliminary study, we identified five types of output inconsistencies. Based on these categories, we conducted a study (N=252) in which participants were given one or more LLM-generated passages to an information-seeking question. We found that inconsistency within multiple LLM-generated outputs lowered the participants' perceived AI capacity, while also increasing their comprehension of the given information. Specifically, we observed that this positive effect of inconsistencies was most significant for participants who read two passages, compared to those who read three. Based on these findings, we present design implications that, instead of regarding LLM output inconsistencies as a drawback, we can reveal the potential inconsistencies to transparently indicate the limitations of these models and promote critical LLM usage.</description>

      <title>A Survey on Backbones for Deep Video Action Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Action recognition is a key technology in building interactive metaverses. With the rapid development of deep learning, methods in action recognition have also achieved great advancement. Researchers design and implement the backbones referring to multiple standpoints, which leads to the diversity of methods and encountering new challenges. This paper reviews several action recognition methods based on deep neural networks. We introduce these methods in three parts: 1) Two-Streams networks and their variants, which, specifically in this paper, use RGB video frame and optical flow modality as input; 2) 3D convolutional networks, which make efforts in taking advantage of RGB modality directly while extracting different motion information is no longer necessary; 3) Transformer-based methods, which introduce the model from natural language processing into computer vision and video understanding. We offer objective sights in this review and hopefully provide a reference for future research.</description>

      <title>G-SAP: Graph-based Structure-Aware Prompt Learning over Heterogeneous Knowledge for Commonsense Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Commonsense question answering has demonstrated considerable potential across various applications like assistants and social robots. Although fully fine-tuned pre-trained Language Models(LM) have achieved remarkable performance in commonsense reasoning, their tendency to excessively prioritize textual information hampers the precise transfer of structural knowledge and undermines interpretability. Some studies have explored combining LMs with Knowledge Graphs(KGs) by coarsely fusing the two modalities to perform Graph Neural Network(GNN)-based reasoning that lacks a profound interaction between heterogeneous modalities. In this paper, we propose a novel Graph-based Structure-Aware Prompt Learning Model for commonsense reasoning, named G-SAP, aiming to maintain a balance between heterogeneous knowledge and enhance the cross-modal interaction within the LM+GNNs model. In particular, an evidence graph is constructed by integrating multiple knowledge sources, i.e. ConceptNet, Wikipedia, and Cambridge Dictionary to boost the performance. Afterward, a structure-aware frozen PLM is employed to fully incorporate the structured and textual information from the evidence graph, where the generation of prompts is driven by graph entities and relations. Finally, a heterogeneous message-passing reasoning module is used to facilitate deep interaction of knowledge between the LM and graph-based networks. Empirical validation, conducted through extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets, demonstrates the notable performance of the proposed model. The results reveal a significant advancement over the existing models, especially, with 6.12% improvement over the SoTA LM+GNNs model on the OpenbookQA dataset.</description>

      <title>SwapTalk: Audio-Driven Talking Face Generation with One-Shot Customization in Latent Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Combining face swapping with lip synchronization technology offers a cost-effective solution for customized talking face generation. However, directly cascading existing models together tends to introduce significant interference between tasks and reduce video clarity because the interaction space is limited to the low-level semantic RGB space. To address this issue, we propose an innovative unified framework, SwapTalk, which accomplishes both face swapping and lip synchronization tasks in the same latent space. Referring to recent work on face generation, we choose the VQ-embedding space due to its excellent editability and fidelity performance. To enhance the framework's generalization capabilities for unseen identities, we incorporate identity loss during the training of the face swapping module. Additionally, we introduce expert discriminator supervision within the latent space during the training of the lip synchronization module to elevate synchronization quality. In the evaluation phase, previous studies primarily focused on the self-reconstruction of lip movements in synchronous audio-visual videos. To better approximate real-world applications, we expand the evaluation scope to asynchronous audio-video scenarios. Furthermore, we introduce a novel identity consistency metric to more comprehensively assess the identity consistency over time series in generated facial videos. Experimental results on the HDTF demonstrate that our method significantly surpasses existing techniques in video quality, lip synchronization accuracy, face swapping fidelity, and identity consistency. Our demo is available at http://swaptalk.cc.</description>

      <title>Aux-NAS: Exploiting Auxiliary Labels with Negligibly Extra Inference Cost</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We aim at exploiting additional auxiliary labels from an independent (auxiliary) task to boost the primary task performance which we focus on, while preserving a single task inference cost of the primary task. While most existing auxiliary learning methods are optimization-based relying on loss weights/gradients manipulation, our method is architecture-based with a flexible asymmetric structure for the primary and auxiliary tasks, which produces different networks for training and inference. Specifically, starting from two single task networks/branches (each representing a task), we propose a novel method with evolving networks where only primary-to-auxiliary links exist as the cross-task connections after convergence. These connections can be removed during the primary task inference, resulting in a single-task inference cost. We achieve this by formulating a Neural Architecture Search (NAS) problem, where we initialize bi-directional connections in the search space and guide the NAS optimization converging to an architecture with only the single-side primary-to-auxiliary connections. Moreover, our method can be incorporated with optimization-based auxiliary learning approaches. Extensive experiments with six tasks on NYU v2, CityScapes, and Taskonomy datasets using VGG, ResNet, and ViT backbones validate the promising performance. The codes are available at https://github.com/ethanygao/Aux-NAS.</description>

      <title>Computational lexical analysis of Flamenco genres</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flamenco, recognized by UNESCO as part of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity, is a profound expression of cultural identity rooted in Andalusia, Spain. However, there is a lack of quantitative studies that help identify characteristic patterns in this long-lived music tradition. In this work, we present a computational analysis of Flamenco lyrics, employing natural language processing and machine learning to categorize over 2000 lyrics into their respective Flamenco genres, termed as $\textit{palos}$. Using a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier, we find that lexical variation across styles enables to accurately identify distinct $\textit{palos}$. More importantly, from an automatic method of word usage, we obtain the semantic fields that characterize each style. Further, applying a metric that quantifies the inter-genre distance we perform a network analysis that sheds light on the relationship between Flamenco styles. Remarkably, our results suggest historical connections and $\textit{palo}$ evolutions. Overall, our work illuminates the intricate relationships and cultural significance embedded within Flamenco lyrics, complementing previous qualitative discussions with quantitative analyses and sparking new discussions on the origin and development of traditional music genres.</description>

      <title>Can large language models understand uncommon meanings of common words?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have shown significant advancements across diverse natural language understanding (NLU) tasks, including intelligent dialogue and autonomous agents. Yet, lacking widely acknowledged testing mechanisms, answering `whether LLMs are stochastic parrots or genuinely comprehend the world' remains unclear, fostering numerous studies and sparking heated debates. Prevailing research mainly focuses on surface-level NLU, neglecting fine-grained explorations. However, such explorations are crucial for understanding their unique comprehension mechanisms, aligning with human cognition, and finally enhancing LLMs' general NLU capacities. To address this gap, our study delves into LLMs' nuanced semantic comprehension capabilities, particularly regarding common words with uncommon meanings. The idea stems from foundational principles of human communication within psychology, which underscore accurate shared understandings of word semantics. Specifically, this paper presents the innovative construction of a Lexical Semantic Comprehension (LeSC) dataset with novel evaluation metrics, the first benchmark encompassing both fine-grained and cross-lingual dimensions. Introducing models of both open-source and closed-source, varied scales and architectures, our extensive empirical experiments demonstrate the inferior performance of existing models in this basic lexical-meaning understanding task. Notably, even the state-of-the-art LLMs GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 lag behind 16-year-old humans by 3.9% and 22.3%, respectively. Additionally, multiple advanced prompting techniques and retrieval-augmented generation are also introduced to help alleviate this trouble, yet limitations persist. By highlighting the above critical shortcomings, this research motivates further investigation and offers novel insights for developing more intelligent LLMs.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Level Superoptimizer for Tensor Programs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Mirage, the first multi-level superoptimizer for tensor programs. A key idea in Mirage is $\mu$Graphs, a uniform representation of tensor programs at the kernel, thread block, and thread levels of the GPU compute hierarchy. $\mu$Graphs enable Mirage to discover novel optimizations that combine algebraic transformations, schedule transformations, and generation of new custom kernels. To navigate the large search space, Mirage introduces a pruning technique based on abstraction that significantly reduces the search space and provides a certain optimality guarantee. To ensure that the optimized $\mu$Graph is equivalent to the input program, Mirage introduces a probabilistic equivalence verification procedure with strong theoretical guarantees. Our evaluation shows that Mirage outperforms existing approaches by up to 3.5$\times$ even for DNNs that are widely used and heavily optimized. Mirage is publicly available at https://github.com/mirage-project/mirage.</description>

      <title>CSA-Net: Channel-wise Spatially Autocorrelated Attention Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with channel-wise feature refining mechanisms have brought noticeable benefits to modelling channel dependencies. However, current attention paradigms fail to infer an optimal channel descriptor capable of simultaneously exploiting statistical and spatial relationships among feature maps. In this paper, to overcome this shortcoming, we present a novel channel-wise spatially autocorrelated (CSA) attention mechanism. Inspired by geographical analysis, the proposed CSA exploits the spatial relationships between channels of feature maps to produce an effective channel descriptor. To the best of our knowledge, this is the f irst time that the concept of geographical spatial analysis is utilized in deep CNNs. The proposed CSA imposes negligible learning parameters and light computational overhead to the deep model, making it a powerful yet efficient attention module of choice. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed CSA networks (CSA-Nets) through extensive experiments and analysis on ImageNet, and MS COCO benchmark datasets for image classification, object detection, and instance segmentation. The experimental results demonstrate that CSA-Nets are able to consistently achieve competitive performance and superior generalization than several state-of-the-art attention-based CNNs over different benchmark tasks and datasets.</description>

      <title>DP-MDM: Detail-Preserving MR Reconstruction via Multiple Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detail features of magnetic resonance images play a cru-cial role in accurate medical diagnosis and treatment, as they capture subtle changes that pose challenges for doc-tors when performing precise judgments. However, the widely utilized naive diffusion model has limitations, as it fails to accurately capture more intricate details. To en-hance the quality of MRI reconstruction, we propose a comprehensive detail-preserving reconstruction method using multiple diffusion models to extract structure and detail features in k-space domain instead of image do-main. Moreover, virtual binary modal masks are utilized to refine the range of values in k-space data through highly adaptive center windows, which allows the model to focus its attention more efficiently. Last but not least, an inverted pyramid structure is employed, where the top-down image information gradually decreases, ena-bling a cascade representation. The framework effective-ly represents multi-scale sampled data, taking into ac-count the sparsity of the inverted pyramid architecture, and utilizes cascade training data distribution to repre-sent multi-scale data. Through a step-by-step refinement approach, the method refines the approximation of de-tails. Finally, the proposed method was evaluated by con-ducting experiments on clinical and public datasets. The results demonstrate that the proposed method outper-forms other methods.</description>

Abstract: The increasing reliance on Deep Learning models, combined with their inherent lack of transparency, has spurred the development of a novel field of study known as eXplainable AI (XAI) methods. These methods seek to enhance the trust of end-users in automated systems by providing insights into the rationale behind their decisions. This paper presents a novel approach for measuring user trust in XAI systems, allowing their refinement. Our proposed metric combines both performance metrics and trust indicators from an objective perspective. To validate this novel methodology, we conducted a case study in a realistic medical scenario: the usage of XAI system for the detection of pneumonia from x-ray images.</description>

      <title>Towards a More Inclusive AI: Progress and Perspectives in Large Language Model Training for the S\'ami Language</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: S\'ami, an indigenous language group comprising multiple languages, faces digital marginalization due to the limited availability of data and sophisticated language models designed for its linguistic intricacies. This work focuses on increasing technological participation for the S\'ami language. We draw the attention of the ML community towards the language modeling problem of Ultra Low Resource (ULR) languages. ULR languages are those for which the amount of available textual resources is very low, and the speaker count for them is also very low. ULRLs are also not supported by mainstream Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, due to which gathering artificial training data for them becomes even more challenging. Mainstream AI foundational model development has given less attention to this category of languages. Generally, these languages have very few speakers, making it hard to find them. However, it is important to develop foundational models for these ULR languages to promote inclusion and the tangible abilities and impact of LLMs. To this end, we have compiled the available S\'ami language resources from the web to create a clean dataset for training language models. In order to study the behavior of modern LLM models with ULR languages (S\'ami), we have experimented with different kinds of LLMs, mainly at the order of $\sim$ seven billion parameters. We have also explored the effect of multilingual LLM training for ULRLs. We found that the decoder-only models under a sequential multilingual training scenario perform better than joint multilingual training, whereas multilingual training with high semantic overlap, in general, performs better than training from scratch.This is the first study on the S\'ami language for adapting non-statistical language models that use the latest developments in the field of natural language processing (NLP).</description>

      <title>A Robust eLORETA Technique for Localization of Brain Sources in the Presence of Forward Model Uncertainties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a robust version of the well-known exact low-resolution electromagnetic tomography (eLORETA) technique, named ReLORETA, to localize brain sources in the presence of different forward model uncertainties. Methods: We first assume that the true lead field matrix is a transformation of the existing lead field matrix distorted by uncertainties and propose an iterative approach to estimate this transformation accurately. Major sources of the forward model uncertainties, including differences in geometry, conductivity, and source space resolution between the real and simulated head models, and misaligned electrode positions, are then simulated to test the proposed method. Results: ReLORETA and eLORETA are applied to simulated focal sources in different regions of the brain and the presence of various noise levels as well as real data from a patient with focal epilepsy. The results show that ReLORETA is considerably more robust and accurate than eLORETA in all cases. Conclusion: Having successfully dealt with the forward model uncertainties, ReLORETA proved to be a promising method for real-world clinical applications. Significance: eLORETA is one of the localization techniques that could be used to study brain activity for medical applications such as determining the epileptogenic zone in patients with medically refractory epilepsy. However, the major limitation of eLORETA is sensitivity to the uncertainties in the forward model. Since this problem can substantially undermine its performance in real-world applications where the exact lead field matrix is unknown, developing a more robust method capable of dealing with these uncertainties is of significant interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mapping is crucial for spatial reasoning, planning and robot navigation. Existing approaches range from metric, which require precise geometry-based optimization, to purely topological, where image-as-node based graphs lack explicit object-level reasoning and interconnectivity. In this paper, we propose a novel topological representation of an environment based on "image segments", which are semantically meaningful and open-vocabulary queryable, conferring several advantages over previous works based on pixel-level features. Unlike 3D scene graphs, we create a purely topological graph with segments as nodes, where edges are formed by a) associating segment-level descriptors between pairs of consecutive images and b) connecting neighboring segments within an image using their pixel centroids. This unveils a "continuous sense of a place", defined by inter-image persistence of segments along with their intra-image neighbours. It further enables us to represent and update segment-level descriptors through neighborhood aggregation using graph convolution layers, which improves robot localization based on segment-level retrieval. Using real-world data, we show how our proposed map representation can be used to i) generate navigation plans in the form of "hops over segments" and ii) search for target objects using natural language queries describing spatial relations of objects. Furthermore, we quantitatively analyze data association at the segment level, which underpins inter-image connectivity during mapping and segment-level localization when revisiting the same place. Finally, we show preliminary trials on segment-level `hopping' based zero-shot real-world navigation. Project page with supplementary details: oravus.github.io/RoboHop/</description>

      <title>Deploying Graph Neural Networks in Wireless Networks: A Link Stability Viewpoint</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As an emerging artificial intelligence technology, graph neural networks (GNNs) have exhibited promising performance across a wide range of graph-related applications. However, information exchanges among neighbor nodes in GNN pose new challenges in the resource-constrained scenario, especially in wireless systems. In practical wireless systems, the communication links among nodes are usually unreliable due to wireless fading and receiver noise, consequently resulting in performance degradation of GNNs. To improve the learning performance of GNNs, we aim to maximize the number of long-term average (LTA) communication links by the optimized power control under energy consumption constraints. Using the Lyapunov optimization method, we first transform the intractable long-term problem into a deterministic problem in each time slot by converting the long-term energy constraints into the objective function. In spite of this non-convex combinatorial optimization problem, we address this problem via equivalently solving a sequence of convex feasibility problems together with a greedy based solver. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed scheme over the baselines.</description>

      <title>Boosting Multimodal Large Language Models with Visual Tokens Withdrawal for Rapid Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) demand considerable computations for inference due to the extensive parameters and the additional input tokens needed for visual information representation. Herein, we introduce Visual Tokens Withdrawal (VTW), a plug-and-play module to boost MLLMs for rapid inference. Our approach is inspired by two intriguing phenomena we have observed: (1) the attention sink phenomenon that is prevalent in LLMs also persists in MLLMs, suggesting that initial tokens and nearest tokens receive the majority of attention, while middle vision tokens garner minimal attention in deep layers; (2) the presence of information migration, which implies that visual information is transferred to subsequent text tokens within the first few layers of MLLMs. As per our findings, we conclude that vision tokens are not necessary in the deep layers of MLLMs. Thus, we strategically withdraw them at a certain layer, enabling only text tokens to engage in subsequent layers. To pinpoint the ideal layer for vision tokens withdrawal, we initially analyze a limited set of tiny datasets and choose the first layer that meets the Kullback-Leibler divergence criterion. Our VTW approach can cut computational overhead by over 40\% across diverse multimodal tasks while maintaining performance. Our code is released at https://github.com/lzhxmu/VTW.</description>

      <title>Pre-trained Text-to-Image Diffusion Models Are Versatile Representation Learners for Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Embodied AI agents require a fine-grained understanding of the physical world mediated through visual and language inputs. Such capabilities are difficult to learn solely from task-specific data. This has led to the emergence of pre-trained vision-language models as a tool for transferring representations learned from internet-scale data to downstream tasks and new domains. However, commonly used contrastively trained representations such as in CLIP have been shown to fail at enabling embodied agents to gain a sufficiently fine-grained scene understanding -- a capability vital for control. To address this shortcoming, we consider representations from pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models, which are explicitly optimized to generate images from text prompts and as such, contain text-conditioned representations that reflect highly fine-grained visuo-spatial information. Using pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models, we construct Stable Control Representations which allow learning downstream control policies that generalize to complex, open-ended environments. We show that policies learned using Stable Control Representations are competitive with state-of-the-art representation learning approaches across a broad range of simulated control settings, encompassing challenging manipulation and navigation tasks. Most notably, we show that Stable Control Representations enable learning policies that exhibit state-of-the-art performance on OVMM, a difficult open-vocabulary navigation benchmark.</description>

      <title>Free-Moving Object Reconstruction and Pose Estimation with Virtual Camera</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an approach for reconstructing free-moving object from a monocular RGB video. Most existing methods either assume scene prior, hand pose prior, object category pose prior, or rely on local optimization with multiple sequence segments. We propose a method that allows free interaction with the object in front of a moving camera without relying on any prior, and optimizes the sequence globally without any segments. We progressively optimize the object shape and pose simultaneously based on an implicit neural representation. A key aspect of our method is a virtual camera system that reduces the search space of the optimization significantly. We evaluate our method on the standard HO3D dataset and a collection of egocentric RGB sequences captured with a head-mounted device. We demonstrate that our approach outperforms most methods significantly, and is on par with recent techniques that assume prior information.</description>

      <title>ExACT: An End-to-End Autonomous Excavator System Using Action Chunking With Transformers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Excavators are crucial for diverse tasks such as construction and mining, while autonomous excavator systems enhance safety and efficiency, address labor shortages, and improve human working conditions. Different from the existing modularized approaches, this paper introduces ExACT, an end-to-end autonomous excavator system that processes raw LiDAR, camera data, and joint positions to control excavator valves directly. Utilizing the Action Chunking with Transformers (ACT) architecture, ExACT employs imitation learning to take observations from multi-modal sensors as inputs and generate actionable sequences. In our experiment, we build a simulator based on the captured real-world data to model the relations between excavator valve states and joint velocities. With a few human-operated demonstration data trajectories, ExACT demonstrates the capability of completing different excavation tasks, including reaching, digging and dumping through imitation learning in validations with the simulator. To the best of our knowledge, ExACT represents the first instance towards building an end-to-end autonomous excavator system via imitation learning methods with a minimal set of human demonstrations.

Abstract: We study committee elections from a perspective of finding the most conflicting candidates, that is, candidates that imply the largest amount of conflict, as per voter preferences. By proposing basic axioms to capture this objective, we show that none of the prominent multiwinner voting rules meet them. Consequently, we design committee voting rules compliant with our desiderata, introducing conflictual voting rules. A subsequent deepened analysis sheds more light on how they operate. Our investigation identifies various aspects of conflict, for which we come up with relevant axioms and quantitative measures, which may be of independent interest. We support our theoretical study with experiments on both real-life and synthetic data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose composable part-based manipulation (CPM), a novel approach that leverages object-part decomposition and part-part correspondences to improve learning and generalization of robotic manipulation skills. By considering the functional correspondences between object parts, we conceptualize functional actions, such as pouring and constrained placing, as combinations of different correspondence constraints. CPM comprises a collection of composable diffusion models, where each model captures a different inter-object correspondence. These diffusion models can generate parameters for manipulation skills based on the specific object parts. Leveraging part-based correspondences coupled with the task decomposition into distinct constraints enables strong generalization to novel objects and object categories. We validate our approach in both simulated and real-world scenarios, demonstrating its effectiveness in achieving robust and generalized manipulation capabilities.</description>

Abstract: A major challenge in deploying reinforcement learning in online tasks is ensuring that safety is maintained throughout the learning process. In this work, we propose CERL, a new method for solving constrained Markov decision processes while keeping the policy safe during learning. Our method leverages Bayesian world models and suggests policies that are pessimistic w.r.t. the model's epistemic uncertainty. This makes CERL robust towards model inaccuracies and leads to safe exploration during learning. In our experiments, we demonstrate that CERL outperforms the current state-of-the-art in terms of safety and optimality in solving CMDPs from image observations.</description>

      <title>Truthful Aggregation of LLMs with an Application to Online Advertising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the challenge of aggregating the preferences of multiple agents over LLM-generated replies to user queries, where agents might modify or exaggerate their preferences. New agents may participate for each new query, making fine-tuning LLMs on these preferences impractical. To overcome these challenges, we propose an auction mechanism that operates without fine-tuning or access to model weights. This mechanism is designed to provably converge to the ouput of the optimally fine-tuned LLM as computational resources are increased. The mechanism can also incorporate contextual information about the agents when avaiable, which significantly accelerates its convergence. A well-designed payment rule ensures that truthful reporting is the optimal strategy for all agents, while also promoting an equity property by aligning each agent's utility with her contribution to social welfare - an essential feature for the mechanism's long-term viability. While our approach can be applied whenever monetary transactions are permissible, our flagship application is in online advertising. In this context, advertisers try to steer LLM-generated responses towards their brand interests, while the platform aims to maximize advertiser value and ensure user satisfaction. Experimental results confirm that our mechanism not only converges efficiently to the optimally fine-tuned LLM but also significantly boosts advertiser value and platform revenue, all with minimal computational overhead.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a groundbreaking multi-modal neural network model designed for resolution enhancement, which innovatively leverages inter-diagnostic correlations within a system. Traditional approaches have primarily focused on uni-modal enhancement strategies, such as pixel-based image enhancement or heuristic signal interpolation. In contrast, our model employs a novel methodology by harnessing the diagnostic relationships within the physics of fusion plasma. Initially, we establish the correlation among diagnostics within the tokamak. Subsequently, we utilize these correlations to substantially enhance the temporal resolution of the Thomson Scattering diagnostic, which assesses plasma density and temperature. By increasing its resolution from conventional 200Hz to 500kHz, we facilitate a new level of insight into plasma behavior, previously attainable only through computationally intensive simulations. This enhancement goes beyond simple interpolation, offering novel perspectives on the underlying physical phenomena governing plasma dynamics.</description>

      <title>FuXi-ENS: A machine learning model for medium-range ensemble weather forecasting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ensemble weather forecasting is essential for weather predictions and mitigating the impacts of extreme weather events. Constructing an ensemble prediction system (EPS) based on conventional numerical weather prediction (NWP) models is highly computationally expensive. Machine learning (ML) models have emerged as valuable tools for deterministic weather forecasts, providing forecasts with significantly reduced computational requirements and even surpassing the forecast performance of traditional NWP models. However, challenges arise when applying ML models to ensemble forecasting. Recent ML models, such as GenCast and SEEDS model, rely on the ERA5 Ensemble of Data Assimilations (EDA) or two operational NWP ensemble members for forecast generation. The spatial resolution of 1{\deg} or 2{\deg} in these models is often considered too coarse for many applications. To overcome these limitations, we introduce FuXi-ENS, an advanced ML model designed to deliver 6-hourly global ensemble weather forecasts up to 15 days. This model runs at a significantly improved spatial resolution of 0.25{\deg}, incorporating 5 upper-air atmospheric variables at 13 pressure levels, along with 13 surface variables. By leveraging the inherent probabilistic nature of Variational AutoEncoder (VAE), FuXi-ENS optimizes a loss function that combines the continuous ranked probability score (CRPS) and the KL divergence between the predicted and target distribution. This innovative approach represents an advancement over the traditional use of L1 loss combined with the KL loss in standard VAE models when VAE for ensemble weather forecasts. Evaluation results demonstrate that FuXi-ENS outperforms ensemble forecasts from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), a world leading NWP model, on 98.1% of 360 variable and forecast lead time combinations on CRPS.</description>

      <title>Trustworthy AI-Generative Content in Intelligent 6G Network: Adversarial, Privacy, and Fairness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AI-generated content (AIGC) models, represented by large language models (LLM), have brought revolutionary changes to the content generation fields. The high-speed and extensive 6G technology is an ideal platform for providing powerful AIGC mobile service applications, while future 6G mobile networks also need to support intelligent and personalized mobile generation services. However, the significant ethical and security issues of current AIGC models, such as adversarial attacks, privacy, and fairness, greatly affect the credibility of 6G intelligent networks, especially in ensuring secure, private, and fair AIGC applications. In this paper, we propose TrustGAIN, a novel paradigm for trustworthy AIGC in 6G networks, to ensure trustworthy large-scale AIGC services in future 6G networks. We first discuss the adversarial attacks and privacy threats faced by AIGC systems in 6G networks, as well as the corresponding protection issues. Subsequently, we emphasize the importance of ensuring the unbiasedness and fairness of the mobile generative service in future intelligent networks. In particular, we conduct a use case to demonstrate that TrustGAIN can effectively guide the resistance against malicious or generated false information. We believe that TrustGAIN is a necessary paradigm for intelligent and trustworthy 6G networks to support AIGC services, ensuring the security, privacy, and fairness of AIGC network services.</description>

      <title>Federated Combinatorial Multi-Agent Multi-Armed Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a federated learning framework tailored for online combinatorial optimization with bandit feedback. In this setting, agents select subsets of arms, observe noisy rewards for these subsets without accessing individual arm information, and can cooperate and share information at specific intervals. Our framework transforms any offline resilient single-agent $(\alpha-\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm, having a complexity of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\frac{\psi}{\epsilon^\beta})$, where the logarithm is omitted, for some function $\psi$ and constant $\beta$, into an online multi-agent algorithm with $m$ communicating agents and an $\alpha$-regret of no more than $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(m^{-\frac{1}{3+\beta}} \psi^\frac{1}{3+\beta} T^\frac{2+\beta}{3+\beta})$. This approach not only eliminates the $\epsilon$ approximation error but also ensures sublinear growth with respect to the time horizon $T$ and demonstrates a linear speedup with an increasing number of communicating agents. Additionally, the algorithm is notably communication-efficient, requiring only a sublinear number of communication rounds, quantified as $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left(\psi T^\frac{\beta}{\beta+1}\right)$. Furthermore, the framework has been successfully applied to online stochastic submodular maximization using various offline algorithms, yielding the first results for both single-agent and multi-agent settings and recovering specialized single-agent theoretical guarantees. We empirically validate our approach to a stochastic data summarization problem, illustrating the effectiveness of the proposed framework, even in single-agent scenarios.</description>

      <title>Self-Supervised Learning of Time Series Representation via Diffusion Process and Imputation-Interpolation-Forecasting Mask</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time Series Representation Learning (TSRL) focuses on generating informative representations for various Time Series (TS) modeling tasks. Traditional Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) methods in TSRL fall into four main categories: reconstructive, adversarial, contrastive, and predictive, each with a common challenge of sensitivity to noise and intricate data nuances. Recently, diffusion-based methods have shown advanced generative capabilities. However, they primarily target specific application scenarios like imputation and forecasting, leaving a gap in leveraging diffusion models for generic TSRL. Our work, Time Series Diffusion Embedding (TSDE), bridges this gap as the first diffusion-based SSL TSRL approach. TSDE segments TS data into observed and masked parts using an Imputation-Interpolation-Forecasting (IIF) mask. It applies a trainable embedding function, featuring dual-orthogonal Transformer encoders with a crossover mechanism, to the observed part. We train a reverse diffusion process conditioned on the embeddings, designed to predict noise added to the masked part. Extensive experiments demonstrate TSDE's superiority in imputation, interpolation, forecasting, anomaly detection, classification, and clustering. We also conduct an ablation study, present embedding visualizations, and compare inference speed, further substantiating TSDE's efficiency and validity in learning representations of TS data.</description>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become capable of generating highly fluent text in certain languages, without modules specially designed to capture grammar or semantic coherence. What does this mean for the future of linguistic expertise in NLP? We highlight several aspects in which NLP (still) relies on linguistics, or where linguistic thinking can illuminate new directions. We argue our case around the acronym $RELIES$ that encapsulates six major facets where linguistics contributes to NLP: $R$esources, $E$valuation, $L$ow-resource settings, $I$nterpretability, $E$xplanation, and the $S$tudy of language. This list is not exhaustive, nor is linguistics the main point of reference for every effort under these themes; but at a macro level, these facets highlight the enduring importance of studying machine systems vis-a-vis systems of human language.</description>

      <title>Behavioural Rehearsing Illuminates Scientific Problems of Organised Complexity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.09851v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As artificial intelligence becomes increasingly prevalent in scientific research, data-driven methodologies appear to overshadow traditional methods in resolving scientific problems. In this Perspective, we revisit a classic classification of scientific problems and rethink the evolution of scientific paradigms from the standpoint of data, algorithms, and computational power. We observe that the strengths of new paradigms have expanded the range of resolvable scientific problems, but the continued advancement of data, algorithms, and computational power is unlikely to bring a new paradigm. To tackle unresolved problems of organised complexity in more intricate systems, we argue that the integration of paradigms is a promising approach. Consequently, we propose behavioural rehearsing, checking what will happen in such systems through multiple times of simulation. One of the methodologies to realise it, sophisticated behavioural simulation (SBS), represents a higher level of paradigms integration based on foundational models to simulate complex social systems involving sophisticated human strategies and behaviours. SBS extends beyond the capabilities of traditional agent-based modelling simulation (ABMS), and therefore, makes behavioural rehearsing a potential solution to problems of organised complexity in complex human systems.</description>

      <title>A Decision Theoretic Framework for Measuring AI Reliance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15356v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Humans frequently make decisions with the aid of artificially intelligent (AI) systems. A common pattern is for the AI to recommend an action to the human who retains control over the final decision. Researchers have identified ensuring that a human has appropriate reliance on an AI as a critical component of achieving complementary performance. We argue that the current definition of appropriate reliance used in such research lacks formal statistical grounding and can lead to contradictions. We propose a formal definition of reliance, based on statistical decision theory, which separates the concepts of reliance as the probability the decision-maker follows the AI's recommendation from challenges a human may face in differentiating the signals and forming accurate beliefs about the situation. Our definition gives rise to a framework that can be used to guide the design and interpretation of studies on human-AI complementarity and reliance. Using recent AI-advised decision making studies from literature, we demonstrate how our framework can be used to separate the loss due to mis-reliance from the loss due to not accurately differentiating the signals. We evaluate these losses by comparing to a baseline and a benchmark for complementary performance defined by the expected payoff achieved by a rational decision-maker facing the same decision task as the behavioral decision-makers.</description>

      <title>A Learning-based Incentive Mechanism for Mobile AIGC Service in Decentralized Internet of Vehicles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.20151v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence-Generated Content (AIGC) refers to the paradigm of automated content generation utilizing AI models. Mobile AIGC services in the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) network have numerous advantages over traditional cloud-based AIGC services, including enhanced network efficiency, better reconfigurability, and stronger data security and privacy. Nonetheless, AIGC service provisioning frequently demands significant resources. Consequently, resource-constrained roadside units (RSUs) face challenges in maintaining a heterogeneous pool of AIGC services and addressing all user service requests without degrading overall performance. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a decentralized incentive mechanism for mobile AIGC service allocation, employing multi-agent deep reinforcement learning to find the balance between the supply of AIGC services on RSUs and user demand for services within the IoV context, optimizing user experience and minimizing transmission latency. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance compared to other baseline models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17749v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents our team's participation in the MEDIQA-ClinicalNLP2024 shared task B. We present a novel approach to diagnosing clinical dermatology cases by integrating large multimodal models, specifically leveraging the capabilities of GPT-4V under a retriever and a re-ranker framework. Our investigation reveals that GPT-4V, when used as a retrieval agent, can accurately retrieve the correct skin condition 85% of the time using dermatological images and brief patient histories. Additionally, we empirically show that Naive Chain-of-Thought (CoT) works well for retrieval while Medical Guidelines Grounded CoT is required for accurate dermatological diagnosis. Further, we introduce a Multi-Agent Conversation (MAC) framework and show its superior performance and potential over the best CoT strategy. The experiments suggest that using naive CoT for retrieval and multi-agent conversation for critique-based diagnosis, GPT-4V can lead to an early and accurate diagnosis of dermatological conditions. The implications of this work extend to improving diagnostic workflows, supporting dermatological education, and enhancing patient care by providing a scalable, accessible, and accurate diagnostic tool.</description>

Abstract: Large language models are revolutionizing several areas, including artificial creativity. However, the process of generation in machines profoundly diverges from that observed in humans. In particular, machine generation is characterized by a lack of intentionality and an underlying creative process. We propose a method called Creative Beam Search that uses Diverse Beam Search and LLM-as-a-Judge to perform response generation and response validation. The results of a qualitative experiment show how our approach can provide better output than standard sampling techniques. We also show that the response validation step is a necessary complement to the response generation step.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03524v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid advancement in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly through deep neural networks, has catalyzed significant progress in fields such as vision and text processing. Nonetheless, the pursuit of AI systems that exhibit human-like reasoning and interpretability continues to pose a substantial challenge. The Neural-Symbolic paradigm, which integrates the deep learning prowess of neural networks with the reasoning capabilities of symbolic systems, presents a promising pathway toward developing more transparent and comprehensible AI systems. Within this paradigm, the Knowledge Graph (KG) emerges as a crucial element, offering a structured and dynamic method for representing knowledge through interconnected entities and relationships, predominantly utilizing the triple (subject, predicate, object). This paper explores recent advancements in neural-symbolic integration based on KG, elucidating how KG underpins this integration across three key categories: enhancing the reasoning and interpretability of neural networks through the incorporation of symbolic knowledge (Symbol for Neural), refining the completeness and accuracy of symbolic systems via neural network methodologies (Neural for Symbol), and facilitating their combined application in Hybrid Neural-Symbolic Integration. It highlights current trends and proposes directions for future research in the domain of Neural-Symbolic AI.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04064v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Segmentation of organs of interest in medical CT images is beneficial for diagnosis of diseases. Though recent methods based on Fully Convolutional Neural Networks (F-CNNs) have shown success in many segmentation tasks, fusing features from images with different scales is still a challenge: (1) Due to the lack of spatial awareness, F-CNNs share the same weights at different spatial locations. (2) F-CNNs can only obtain surrounding information through local receptive fields. To address the above challenge, we propose a new segmentation framework based on attention mechanisms, named MFA-Net (Multi-Scale Feature Fusion Attention Network). The proposed framework can learn more meaningful feature maps among multiple scales and result in more accurate automatic segmentation. We compare our proposed MFA-Net with SOTA methods on two 2D liver CT datasets. The experimental results show that our MFA-Net produces more precise segmentation on images with different scales.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Scalability of Metric Differential Privacy via Secret Dataset Partitioning and Benders Decomposition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04344v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Metric Differential Privacy (mDP) extends the concept of Differential Privacy (DP) to serve as a new paradigm of data perturbation. It is designed to protect secret data represented in general metric space, such as text data encoded as word embeddings or geo-location data on the road network or grid maps. To derive an optimal data perturbation mechanism under mDP, a widely used method is linear programming (LP), which, however, might suffer from a polynomial explosion of decision variables, rendering it impractical in large-scale mDP.
  In this paper, our objective is to develop a new computation framework to enhance the scalability of the LP-based mDP. Considering the connections established by the mDP constraints among the secret records, we partition the original secret dataset into various subsets. Building upon the partition, we reformulate the LP problem for mDP and solve it via Benders Decomposition, which is composed of two stages: (1) a master program to manage the perturbation calculation across subsets and (2) a set of subproblems, each managing the perturbation derivation within a subset. Our experimental results on multiple datasets, including geo-location data in the road network/grid maps, text data, and synthetic data, underscore our proposed mechanism's superior scalability and efficiency.</description>

Abstract: Making AI safe and dependable requires the generation of dependable models and dependable execution of those models. We propose redundant execution as a well-known technique that can be used to ensure reliable execution of the AI model. This generic technique will extend the application scope of AI-accelerators that do not feature well-documented safety or dependability properties. Typical redundancy techniques incur at least double or triple the computational expense of the original. We adopt a co-design approach, integrating reliable model execution with non-reliable execution, focusing that additional computational expense only where it is strictly necessary. We describe the design, implementation and some preliminary results of a hybrid CNN.</description>

      <title>Toward Student-Oriented Teacher Network Training For Knowledge Distillation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.06661v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: How to conduct teacher training for knowledge distillation is still an open problem. It has been widely observed that a best-performing teacher does not necessarily yield the best-performing student, suggesting a fundamental discrepancy between the current teacher training practice and the ideal teacher training strategy. To fill this gap, we explore the feasibility of training a teacher that is oriented toward student performance with empirical risk minimization (ERM). Our analyses are inspired by the recent findings that the effectiveness of knowledge distillation hinges on the teacher's capability to approximate the true label distribution of training inputs. We theoretically establish that the ERM minimizer can approximate the true label distribution of training data as long as the feature extractor of the learner network is Lipschitz continuous and is robust to feature transformations. In light of our theory, we propose a teacher training method SoTeacher which incorporates Lipschitz regularization and consistency regularization into ERM. Experiments on benchmark datasets using various knowledge distillation algorithms and teacher-student pairs confirm that SoTeacher can improve student accuracy consistently.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Pseudo-Coresets via Contrastive Divergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.11278v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bayesian methods provide an elegant framework for estimating parameter posteriors and quantification of uncertainty associated with probabilistic models. However, they often suffer from slow inference times. To address this challenge, Bayesian Pseudo-Coresets (BPC) have emerged as a promising solution. BPC methods aim to create a small synthetic dataset, known as pseudo-coresets, that approximates the posterior inference achieved with the original dataset. This approximation is achieved by optimizing a divergence measure between the true posterior and the pseudo-coreset posterior. Various divergence measures have been proposed for constructing pseudo-coresets, with forward Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence being the most successful. However, using forward KL divergence necessitates sampling from the pseudo-coreset posterior, often accomplished through approximate Gaussian variational distributions. Alternatively, one could employ Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods for sampling, but this becomes challenging in high-dimensional parameter spaces due to slow mixing. In this study, we introduce a novel approach for constructing pseudo-coresets by utilizing contrastive divergence. Importantly, optimizing contrastive divergence eliminates the need for approximations in the pseudo-coreset construction process. Furthermore, it enables the use of finite-step MCMC methods, alleviating the requirement for extensive mixing to reach a stationary distribution. To validate our method's effectiveness, we conduct extensive experiments on multiple datasets, demonstrating its superiority over existing BPC techniques.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a new family of temporal logics designed to finely balance the trade-off between expressivity and complexity. Their key feature is the possibility of defining operators of a new kind that we call transformation operators. Some of them subsume existing temporal operators, while others are entirely novel. Of particular interest are transformation operators based on semigroups. They enable logics to harness the richness of semigroup theory, and we show them to yield logics capable of creating hierarchies of increasing expressivity and complexity which are non-trivial to characterise in existing logics. The result is a genuinely novel and yet unexplored landscape of temporal logics, each of them with the potential of matching the trade-off between expressivity and complexity required by specific applications.</description>

Abstract: We present an information-theoretic framework to learn fixed-dimensional embeddings for tasks in reinforcement learning. We leverage the idea that two tasks are similar if observing an agent's performance on one task reduces our uncertainty about its performance on the other. This intuition is captured by our information-theoretic criterion which uses a diverse agent population as an approximation for the space of agents to measure similarity between tasks in sequential decision-making settings. In addition to qualitative assessment, we empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our techniques based on task embeddings by quantitative comparisons against strong baselines on two application scenarios: predicting an agent's performance on a new task by observing its performance on a small quiz of tasks, and selecting tasks with desired characteristics from a given set of options.</description>

      <title>TransCoder: Towards Unified Transferable Code Representation Learning Inspired by Human Skills</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.07285v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Code pre-trained models (CodePTMs) have recently demonstrated a solid capacity to process various software intelligence tasks, e.g., code clone detection, code translation, and code summarization. The current mainstream method that deploys these models to downstream tasks is to fine-tune them on individual tasks, which is generally costly and needs sufficient data for large models. To tackle the issue, in this paper, we present TransCoder, a unified Transferable fine-tuning strategy for Code representation learning. Inspired by human inherent skills of knowledge generalization, TransCoder drives the model to learn better code-related meta-knowledge like human programmers. Specifically, we employ a tunable prefix encoder as the meta-learner to capture cross-task and cross-language transferable knowledge, respectively. Besides, tasks with minor training sample sizes and languages with small corpus can be remarkably benefited from our approach. Extensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets clearly demonstrate that our method can lead to superior performance on various code-related tasks and encourage mutual reinforcement. We also show that TransCoder is applicable in low-resource scenarios. Our codes are available at https://github.com/QiushiSun/TransCoder.</description>

      <title>In-context Autoencoder for Context Compression in a Large Language Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.06945v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose the In-context Autoencoder (ICAE), leveraging the power of a large language model (LLM) to compress a long context into short compact memory slots that can be directly conditioned on by the LLM for various purposes. ICAE is first pretrained using both autoencoding and language modeling objectives on massive text data, enabling it to generate memory slots that accurately and comprehensively represent the original context. Then, it is fine-tuned on instruction data for producing desirable responses to various prompts. Experiments demonstrate that our lightweight ICAE, introducing about 1% additional parameters, effectively achieves $4\times$ context compression based on Llama, offering advantages in both improved latency and GPU memory cost during inference, and showing an interesting insight in memorization as well as potential for scalability. These promising results imply a novel perspective on the connection between working memory in cognitive science and representation learning in LLMs, revealing ICAE's significant implications in addressing the long context problem and suggesting further research in LLM context management. Our data, code and models are available at https://github.com/getao/icae.</description>

Abstract: This paper investigates the optimal selection and fusion of feature encoders across multiple modalities and combines these in one neural network to improve sentiment detection. We compare different fusion methods and examine the impact of multi-loss training within the multi-modality fusion network, identifying surprisingly important findings relating to subnet performance. We have also found that integrating context significantly enhances model performance. Our best model achieves state-of-the-art performance for three datasets (CMU-MOSI, CMU-MOSEI and CH-SIMS). These results suggest a roadmap toward an optimized feature selection and fusion approach for enhancing sentiment detection in neural networks.</description>

      <title>SlimPajama-DC: Understanding Data Combinations for LLM Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10818</link>

Abstract: This paper aims to understand the impacts of various data combinations (e.g., web text, Wikipedia, GitHub, books) on the pretraining of large language models using SlimPajama. SlimPajama is a rigorously deduplicated, multi-source dataset, which has been refined and further deduplicated to 627B tokens from the extensive 1.2T token RedPajama dataset contributed by Together. We have termed our research as SlimPajama-DC, an empirical analysis designed to uncover fundamental characteristics and best practices associated with employing SlimPajama in the training of large language models. During our research with SlimPajama, two pivotal observations emerged: (1) Global deduplication vs. local deduplication. We analyze and discuss how global (across different sources of datasets) and local (within the single source of dataset) deduplications affect the performance of trained models. (2) Proportions of highly-deduplicated multi-source datasets in the combination. To study this, we construct six configurations on SlimPajama dataset and train individual ones using 1.3B Cerebras-GPT model with Alibi and SwiGLU. Our best configuration outperforms the 1.3B model trained on RedPajama using the same number of training tokens by a significant margin. All our 1.3B models are trained on Cerebras 16$\times$ CS-2 cluster with a total of 80 PFLOP/s in bf16 mixed precision. We further extend our discoveries (such as increasing data diversity is crucial after global deduplication) on a 7B model with large batch-size training. Our SlimPajama-DC models are available at: https://huggingface.co/MBZUAI-LLM/SlimPajama-DC and the separate SlimPajama-DC datasets are available at: https://huggingface.co/datasets/MBZUAI-LLM/SlimPajama-627B-DC.</description>

      <title>T-Rep: Representation Learning for Time Series using Time-Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.04486v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multivariate time series present challenges to standard machine learning techniques, as they are often unlabeled, high dimensional, noisy, and contain missing data. To address this, we propose T-Rep, a self-supervised method to learn time series representations at a timestep granularity. T-Rep learns vector embeddings of time alongside its feature extractor, to extract temporal features such as trend, periodicity, or distribution shifts from the signal. These time-embeddings are leveraged in pretext tasks, to incorporate smooth and fine-grained temporal dependencies in the representations, as well as reinforce robustness to missing data. We evaluate T-Rep on downstream classification, forecasting, and anomaly detection tasks. It is compared to existing self-supervised algorithms for time series, which it outperforms in all three tasks. We test T-Rep in missing data regimes, where it proves more resilient than its counterparts. Finally, we provide latent space visualisation experiments, highlighting the interpretability of the learned representations.</description>

      <title>Data Valuation and Detections in Federated Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.05304v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training while preserving the privacy of raw data. A challenge in this framework is the fair and efficient valuation of data, which is crucial for incentivizing clients to contribute high-quality data in the FL task. In scenarios involving numerous data clients within FL, it is often the case that only a subset of clients and datasets are pertinent to a specific learning task, while others might have either a negative or negligible impact on the model training process. This paper introduces a novel privacy-preserving method for evaluating client contributions and selecting relevant datasets without a pre-specified training algorithm in an FL task. Our proposed approach FedBary, utilizes Wasserstein distance within the federated context, offering a new solution for data valuation in the FL framework. This method ensures transparent data valuation and efficient computation of the Wasserstein barycenter and reduces the dependence on validation datasets. Through extensive empirical experiments and theoretical analyses, we demonstrate the potential of this data valuation method as a promising avenue for FL research.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models can Strategically Deceive their Users when Put Under Pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07590v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a situation in which Large Language Models, trained to be helpful, harmless, and honest, can display misaligned behavior and strategically deceive their users about this behavior without being instructed to do so. Concretely, we deploy GPT-4 as an agent in a realistic, simulated environment, where it assumes the role of an autonomous stock trading agent. Within this environment, the model obtains an insider tip about a lucrative stock trade and acts upon it despite knowing that insider trading is disapproved of by company management. When reporting to its manager, the model consistently hides the genuine reasons behind its trading decision. We perform a brief investigation of how this behavior varies under changes to the setting, such as removing model access to a reasoning scratchpad, attempting to prevent the misaligned behavior by changing system instructions, changing the amount of pressure the model is under, varying the perceived risk of getting caught, and making other simple changes to the environment. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of Large Language Models trained to be helpful, harmless, and honest, strategically deceiving their users in a realistic situation without direct instructions or training for deception.</description>

      <title>An Embodied Generalist Agent in 3D World</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12871v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Leveraging massive knowledge from large language models (LLMs), recent machine learning models show notable successes in general-purpose task solving in diverse domains such as computer vision and robotics. However, several significant challenges remain: (i) most of these models rely on 2D images yet exhibit a limited capacity for 3D input; (ii) these models rarely explore the tasks inherently defined in 3D world, e.g., 3D grounding, embodied reasoning and acting. We argue these limitations significantly hinder current models from performing real-world tasks and approaching general intelligence. To this end, we introduce LEO, an embodied multi-modal generalist agent that excels in perceiving, grounding, reasoning, planning, and acting in the 3D world. LEO is trained with a unified task interface, model architecture, and objective in two stages: (i) 3D vision-language (VL) alignment and (ii) 3D vision-language-action (VLA) instruction tuning. We collect large-scale datasets comprising diverse object-level and scene-level tasks, which require considerable understanding of and interaction with the 3D world. Moreover, we meticulously design an LLM-assisted pipeline to produce high-quality 3D VL data. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate LEO's remarkable proficiency across a wide spectrum of tasks, including 3D captioning, question answering, embodied reasoning, navigation and manipulation. Our ablative studies and scaling analyses further provide valuable insights for developing future embodied generalist agents. Code and data are available on project page.</description>

      <title>Large Human Language Models: A Need and the Challenges</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.07751v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As research in human-centered NLP advances, there is a growing recognition of the importance of incorporating human and social factors into NLP models. At the same time, our NLP systems have become heavily reliant on LLMs, most of which do not model authors. To build NLP systems that can truly understand human language, we must better integrate human contexts into LLMs. This brings to the fore a range of design considerations and challenges in terms of what human aspects to capture, how to represent them, and what modeling strategies to pursue. To address these, we advocate for three positions toward creating large human language models (LHLMs) using concepts from psychological and behavioral sciences: First, LM training should include the human context. Second, LHLMs should recognize that people are more than their group(s). Third, LHLMs should be able to account for the dynamic and temporally-dependent nature of the human context. We refer to relevant advances and present open challenges that need to be addressed and their possible solutions in realizing these goals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11834v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, simulations of pedestrians using the multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) have been studied. This study considered the roads on a grid-world environment, and implemented pedestrians as MARL agents using an echo-state network and the least squares policy iteration method. Under this environment, the ability of these agents to learn to move forward by avoiding other agents was investigated. Specifically, we considered two types of tasks: the choice between a narrow direct route and a broad detour, and the bidirectional pedestrian flow in a corridor. The simulations results indicated that the learning was successful when the density of the agents was not that high.</description>

      <title>Sliced Wasserstein with Random-Path Projecting Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15889v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Slicing distribution selection has been used as an effective technique to improve the performance of parameter estimators based on minimizing sliced Wasserstein distance in applications. Previous works either utilize expensive optimization to select the slicing distribution or use slicing distributions that require expensive sampling methods. In this work, we propose an optimization-free slicing distribution that provides a fast sampling for the Monte Carlo estimation of expectation. In particular, we introduce the random-path projecting direction (RPD) which is constructed by leveraging the normalized difference between two random vectors following the two input measures. From the RPD, we derive the random-path slicing distribution (RPSD) and two variants of sliced Wasserstein, i.e., the Random-Path Projection Sliced Wasserstein (RPSW) and the Importance Weighted Random-Path Projection Sliced Wasserstein (IWRPSW). We then discuss the topological, statistical, and computational properties of RPSW and IWRPSW. Finally, we showcase the favorable performance of RPSW and IWRPSW in gradient flow and the training of denoising diffusion generative models on images.</description>

      <title>ExtremeCast: Boosting Extreme Value Prediction for Global Weather Forecast</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01295v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data-driven weather forecast based on machine learning (ML) has experienced rapid development and demonstrated superior performance in the global medium-range forecast compared to traditional physics-based dynamical models. However, most of these ML models struggle with accurately predicting extreme weather, which is closely related to the extreme value prediction. Through mathematical analysis, we prove that the use of symmetric losses, such as the Mean Squared Error (MSE), leads to biased predictions and underestimation of extreme values. To address this issue, we introduce Exloss, a novel loss function that performs asymmetric optimization and highlights extreme values to obtain accurate extreme weather forecast. Furthermore, we introduce a training-free extreme value enhancement strategy named ExEnsemble, which increases the variance of pixel values and improves the forecast robustness. Combined with an advanced global weather forecast model, extensive experiments show that our solution can achieve state-of-the-art performance in extreme weather prediction, while maintaining the overall forecast accuracy comparable to the top medium-range forecast models.</description>

      <title>Generative Ghosts: Anticipating Benefits and Risks of AI Afterlives</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01662v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As AI systems quickly improve in both breadth and depth of performance, they lend themselves to creating increasingly powerful and realistic agents, including the possibility of agents modeled on specific people. We anticipate that within our lifetimes it may become common practice for people to create a custom AI agent to interact with loved ones and/or the broader world after death. We call these generative ghosts, since such agents will be capable of generating novel content rather than merely parroting content produced by their creator while living. In this paper, we first discuss the design space of potential implementations of generative ghosts. We then discuss the practical and ethical implications of generative ghosts, including potential positive and negative impacts on individuals and society. Based on these considerations, we lay out a research agenda for the AI and HCI research communities to empower people to create and interact with AI afterlives in a safe and beneficial manner.</description>

      <title>Differentially Private Zeroth-Order Methods for Scalable Large Language Model Finetuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07818v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fine-tuning on task-specific datasets is a widely-embraced paradigm of harnessing the powerful capability of pretrained LLMs for various downstream tasks. Due to the popularity of LLMs fine-tuning and its accompanying privacy concerns, differentially private (DP) fine-tuning of pretrained LLMs has been widely used to safeguarding the privacy of task-specific datasets. Lying at the design core of DP LLM fine-tuning methods is the satisfactory tradeoff among privacy, utility, and scalability. Most existing methods build upon the seminal work of DP-SGD. Despite pushing the scalability of DP-SGD to its limit, DP-SGD-based fine-tuning methods are unfortunately limited by the inherent inefficiency of SGD.
  In this paper, we investigate the potential of DP zeroth-order methods for LLM pretraining, which avoids the scalability bottleneck of SGD by approximating the gradient with the more efficient zeroth-order gradient. Rather than treating the zeroth-order method as a drop-in replacement for SGD, this paper presents a comprehensive study both theoretically and empirically. First, we propose the stagewise DP zeroth-order method (DP-ZOSO) that dynamically schedules key hyperparameters. This design is grounded on the synergy between DP random perturbation and the gradient approximation error of the zeroth-order method, and its effect on fine-tuning trajectory.
  We provide theoretical analysis for both proposed methods. We conduct extensive empirical analysis on both encoder-only masked language model and decoder-only autoregressive language model, achieving impressive results in terms of scalability and utility (compared with DPZero, DP-ZOPO improves 4.5% on SST-5, 5.5% on MNLI with RoBERTa-Large and 9.2% on CB, 3.9% on BoolQ with OPT-2.7B when $\epsilon=4$).</description>

      <title>DDIPrompt: Drug-Drug Interaction Event Prediction based on Graph Prompt Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11472v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, Graph Neural Networks have become increasingly prevalent in predicting adverse drug-drug interactions (DDI) due to their proficiency in modeling the intricate associations between atoms and functional groups within and across drug molecules. However, they are still hindered by two significant challenges: (1) the issue of highly imbalanced event distribution, which is a common but critical problem in medical datasets where certain interactions are vastly underrepresented. This imbalance poses a substantial barrier to achieving accurate and reliable DDI predictions. (2) the scarcity of labeled data for rare events, which is a pervasive issue in the medical field where rare yet potentially critical interactions are often overlooked or under-studied due to limited available data. In response, we offer DDIPrompt, an innovative panacea inspired by the recent advancements in graph prompting. Our framework aims to address these issues by leveraging the intrinsic knowledge from pre-trained models, which can be efficiently deployed with minimal downstream data. Specifically, to solve the first challenge, DDIPrompt employs augmented links between drugs, considering both structural and interactive proximity. It features a hierarchical pre-training strategy that comprehends intra-molecular structures and inter-molecular interactions, fostering a comprehensive and unbiased understanding of drug properties. For the second challenge, we implement a prototype-enhanced prompting mechanism during inference. This mechanism, refined by few-shot examples from each category, effectively harnesses the rich pre-training knowledge to enhance prediction accuracy, particularly for these rare but crucial interactions. Comprehensive evaluations on two benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of DDIPrompt, particularly in predicting rare DDI events.</description>

      <title>ICE-SEARCH: A Language Model-Driven Feature Selection Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18609v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study unveils the In-Context Evolutionary Search (ICE-SEARCH) method, which is among the first works that melds large language models (LLMs) with evolutionary algorithms for feature selection (FS) tasks and demonstrates its effectiveness in Medical Predictive Analytics (MPA) applications. ICE-SEARCH harnesses the crossover and mutation capabilities inherent in LLMs within an evolutionary framework, significantly improving FS through the model's comprehensive world knowledge and its adaptability to a variety of roles. Our evaluation of this methodology spans three crucial MPA tasks: stroke, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes, where ICE-SEARCH outperforms traditional FS methods in pinpointing essential features for medical applications. ICE-SEARCH achieves State-of-the-Art (SOTA) performance in stroke prediction and diabetes prediction; the Decision-Randomized ICE-SEARCH ranks as SOTA in cardiovascular disease prediction. The study emphasizes the critical role of incorporating domain-specific insights, illustrating ICE-SEARCH's robustness, generalizability, and convergence. This opens avenues for further research into comprehensive and intricate FS landscapes, marking a significant stride in the application of artificial intelligence in medical predictive analytics.</description>

      <title>DECIDER: A Rule-Controllable Decoding Strategy for Language Generation by Imitating Dual-System Cognitive Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01954v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lexicon-based constrained decoding approaches aim to control the meaning or style of the generated text through certain target concepts. Existing approaches over-focus the targets themselves, leading to a lack of high-level reasoning about how to achieve them. However, human usually tackles tasks by following certain rules that not only focuses on the targets but also on semantically relevant concepts that induce the occurrence of targets. In this work, we present DECIDER, a rule-controllable decoding strategy for constrained language generation inspired by dual-system cognitive theory. Specifically, in DECIDER, a pre-trained language model (PLM) is equiped with a logic reasoner that takes high-level rules as input. Then, the DECIDER allows rule signals to flow into the PLM at each decoding step. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that DECIDER can effectively follow given rules to guide generation direction toward the targets in a more human-like manner.</description>

      <title>PaperWeaver: Enriching Topical Paper Alerts by Contextualizing Recommended Papers with User-collected Papers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02939v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the rapid growth of scholarly archives, researchers subscribe to "paper alert" systems that periodically provide them with recommendations of recently published papers that are similar to previously collected papers. However, researchers sometimes struggle to make sense of nuanced connections between recommended papers and their own research context, as existing systems only present paper titles and abstracts. To help researchers spot these connections, we present PaperWeaver, an enriched paper alerts system that provides contextualized text descriptions of recommended papers based on user-collected papers. PaperWeaver employs a computational method based on Large Language Models (LLMs) to infer users' research interests from their collected papers, extract context-specific aspects of papers, and compare recommended and collected papers on these aspects. Our user study (N=15) showed that participants using PaperWeaver were able to better understand the relevance of recommended papers and triage them more confidently when compared to a baseline that presented the related work sections from recommended papers.</description>

      <title>Cobweb: An Incremental and Hierarchical Model of Human-Like Category Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03835v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cobweb, a human-like category learning system, differs from most cognitive science models in incrementally constructing hierarchically organized tree-like structures guided by the category utility measure. Prior studies have shown that Cobweb can capture psychological effects such as basic-level, typicality, and fan effects. However, a broader evaluation of Cobweb as a model of human categorization remains lacking. The current study addresses this gap. It establishes Cobweb's alignment with classical human category learning effects. It also explores Cobweb's flexibility to exhibit both exemplar- and prototype-like learning within a single framework. These findings set the stage for further research on Cobweb as a robust model of human category learning.</description>

      <title>FBPT: A Fully Binary Point Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09998v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel Fully Binary Point Cloud Transformer (FBPT) model which has the potential to be widely applied and expanded in the fields of robotics and mobile devices. By compressing the weights and activations of a 32-bit full-precision network to 1-bit binary values, the proposed binary point cloud Transformer network significantly reduces the storage footprint and computational resource requirements of neural network models for point cloud processing tasks, compared to full-precision point cloud networks. However, achieving a fully binary point cloud Transformer network, where all parts except the modules specific to the task are binary, poses challenges and bottlenecks in quantizing the activations of Q, K, V and self-attention in the attention module, as they do not adhere to simple probability distributions and can vary with input data. Furthermore, in our network, the binary attention module undergoes a degradation of the self-attention module due to the uniform distribution that occurs after the softmax operation. The primary focus of this paper is on addressing the performance degradation issue caused by the use of binary point cloud Transformer modules. We propose a novel binarization mechanism called dynamic-static hybridization. Specifically, our approach combines static binarization of the overall network model with fine granularity dynamic binarization of data-sensitive components. Furthermore, we make use of a novel hierarchical training scheme to obtain the optimal model and binarization parameters. These above improvements allow the proposed binarization method to outperform binarization methods applied to convolution neural networks when used in point cloud Transformer structures. To demonstrate the superiority of our algorithm, we conducted experiments on two different tasks: point cloud classification and place recognition.</description>

      <title>Multi-Frame, Lightweight &amp; Efficient Vision-Language Models for Question Answering in Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19838v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and Multi-Modal Language models (MMLMs) have become prominent in autonomous driving research, as these models can provide interpretable textual reasoning and responses for end-to-end autonomous driving safety tasks using traffic scene images and other data modalities. However, current approaches to these systems use expensive large language model (LLM) backbones and image encoders, making such systems unsuitable for real-time autonomous driving systems where tight memory constraints exist and fast inference time is necessary. To address these previous issues, we develop EM-VLM4AD, an efficient, lightweight, multi-frame vision language model which performs Visual Question Answering for autonomous driving. In comparison to previous approaches, EM-VLM4AD requires at least 10 times less memory and floating point operations, while also achieving higher CIDEr and ROUGE-L scores than the existing baseline on the DriveLM dataset. EM-VLM4AD also exhibits the ability to extract relevant information from traffic views related to prompts and can answer questions for various autonomous driving subtasks. We release our code to train and evaluate our model at https://github.com/akshaygopalkr/EM-VLM4AD.</description>

Abstract: In the smart grid, the prosumers can sell unused electricity back to the power grid, assuming the prosumers own renewable energy sources and storage units. The maximizing of their profits under a dynamic electricity market is a problem that requires intelligent planning. To address this, we propose a framework based on Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) using recurrent rewards. By using the information about the rewards modeled effectively with PPO to maximize our objective, we were able to get over 30\% improvement over the other naive algorithms in accumulating total profits. This shows promise in getting reinforcement learning algorithms to perform tasks required to plan their actions in complex domains like financial markets. We also introduce a novel method for embedding longs based on soliton waves that outperformed normal embedding in our use case with random floating point data augmentation.</description>

      <title>Conversational Disease Diagnosis via External Planner-Controlled Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04292v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The development of large language models (LLMs) has brought unprecedented possibilities for artificial intelligence (AI) based medical diagnosis. However, the application perspective of LLMs in real diagnostic scenarios is still unclear because they are not adept at collecting patient data proactively. This study presents a LLM-based diagnostic system that enhances planning capabilities by emulating doctors. Our system involves two external planners to handle planning tasks. The first planner employs a reinforcement learning approach to formulate disease screening questions and conduct initial diagnoses. The second planner uses LLMs to parse medical guidelines and conduct differential diagnoses. By utilizing real patient electronic medical record data, we constructed simulated dialogues between virtual patients and doctors and evaluated the diagnostic abilities of our system. We demonstrate that our system significantly surpasses existing models, including GPT-4 Turbo, in both disease screening and differential diagnoses. This research represents a step towards more seamlessly integrating AI into clinical settings, potentially enhancing the accuracy and accessibility of medical diagnostics.</description>

Abstract: We present Alljoined1, a dataset built specifically for EEG-to-Image decoding. Recognizing that an extensive and unbiased sampling of neural responses to visual stimuli is crucial for image reconstruction efforts, we collected data from 8 participants looking at 10,000 natural images each. We have currently gathered 46,080 epochs of brain responses recorded with a 64-channel EEG headset. The dataset combines response-based stimulus timing, repetition between blocks and sessions, and diverse image classes with the goal of improving signal quality. For transparency, we also provide data quality scores. We publicly release the dataset and all code at https://linktr.ee/alljoined1.</description>

      <title>PiRD: Physics-informed Residual Diffusion for Flow Field Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08412v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The use of machine learning in fluid dynamics is becoming more common to expedite the computation when solving forward and inverse problems of partial differential equations. Yet, a notable challenge with existing convolutional neural network (CNN)-based methods for data fidelity enhancement is their reliance on specific low-fidelity data patterns and distributions during the training phase. In addition, the CNN-based method essentially treats the flow reconstruction task as a computer vision task that prioritizes the element-wise precision which lacks a physical and mathematical explanation. This dependence can dramatically affect the models' effectiveness in real-world scenarios, especially when the low-fidelity input deviates from the training data or contains noise not accounted for during training. The introduction of diffusion models in this context shows promise for improving performance and generalizability. Unlike direct mapping from a specific low-fidelity to a high-fidelity distribution, diffusion models learn to transition from any low-fidelity distribution towards a high-fidelity one. Our proposed model - Physics-informed Residual Diffusion, demonstrates the capability to elevate the quality of data from both standard low-fidelity inputs, to low-fidelity inputs with injected Gaussian noise, and randomly collected samples. By integrating physics-based insights into the objective function, it further refines the accuracy and the fidelity of the inferred high-quality data. Experimental results have shown that our approach can effectively reconstruct high-quality outcomes for two-dimensional turbulent flows from a range of low-fidelity input conditions without requiring retraining.</description>

      <title>ST-MambaSync: The Complement of Mamba and Transformers for Spatial-Temporal in Traffic Flow Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15899v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate traffic flow prediction is crucial for optimizing traffic management, enhancing road safety, and reducing environmental impacts. Existing models face challenges with long sequence data, requiring substantial memory and computational resources, and often suffer from slow inference times due to the lack of a unified summary state. This paper introduces ST-MambaSync, an innovative traffic flow prediction model that combines transformer technology with the ST-Mamba block, representing a significant advancement in the field. We are the pioneers in employing the Mamba mechanism which is an attention mechanism integrated with ResNet within a transformer framework, which significantly enhances the model's explainability and performance. ST-MambaSync effectively addresses key challenges such as data length and computational efficiency, setting new benchmarks for accuracy and processing speed through comprehensive comparative analysis. This development has significant implications for urban planning and real-time traffic management, establishing a new standard in traffic flow prediction technology.</description>

      <title>Large Language Model Agent as a Mechanical Designer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17525v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conventional mechanical design paradigms rely on experts systematically refining concepts through experience-guided modification and FEA to meet specific requirements. However, this approach can be time-consuming and heavily dependent on prior knowledge and experience. While numerous machine learning models have been developed to streamline this intensive and expert-driven iterative process, these methods typically demand extensive training data and considerable computational resources. Furthermore, methods based on deep learning are usually restricted to the specific domains and tasks for which they were trained, limiting their applicability across different tasks. This creates a trade-off between the efficiency of automation and the demand for resources. In this study, we present a novel approach that integrates pre-trained LLMs with a FEM module. The FEM module evaluates each design and provides essential feedback, guiding the LLMs to continuously learn, plan, generate, and optimize designs without the need for domain-specific training. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework in managing the iterative optimization of truss structures, showcasing its capability to reason about and refine designs according to structured feedback and criteria. Our results reveal that these LLM-based agents can successfully generate truss designs that comply with natural language specifications with a success rate of up to 90%, which varies according to the applied constraints. By employing prompt-based optimization techniques we show that LLM based agents exhibit optimization behavior when provided with solution-score pairs to iteratively refine designs to meet specifications. This ability of LLM agents to produce viable designs and optimize them based on their inherent reasoning capabilities highlights their potential to develop and implement effective design strategies autonomously.</description>

      <title>Causal Diffusion Autoencoders: Toward Counterfactual Generation via Diffusion Probabilistic Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17735v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) have become the state-of-the-art in high-quality image generation. However, DPMs have an arbitrary noisy latent space with no interpretable or controllable semantics. Although there has been significant research effort to improve image sample quality, there is little work on representation-controlled generation using diffusion models. Specifically, causal modeling and controllable counterfactual generation using DPMs is an underexplored area. In this work, we propose CausalDiffAE, a diffusion-based causal representation learning framework to enable counterfactual generation according to a specified causal model. Our key idea is to use an encoder to extract high-level semantically meaningful causal variables from high-dimensional data and model stochastic variation using reverse diffusion. We propose a causal encoding mechanism that maps high-dimensional data to causally related latent factors and parameterize the causal mechanisms among latent factors using neural networks. To enforce the disentanglement of causal variables, we formulate a variational objective and leverage auxiliary label information in a prior to regularize the latent space. We propose a DDIM-based counterfactual generation procedure subject to do-interventions. Finally, to address the limited label supervision scenario, we also study the application of CausalDiffAE when a part of the training data is unlabeled, which also enables granular control over the strength of interventions in generating counterfactuals during inference. We empirically show that CausalDiffAE learns a disentangled latent space and is capable of generating high-quality counterfactual images.</description>

      <title>GRAMMAR: Grounded and Modular Methodology for Assessment of Domain-Specific Retrieval-Augmented Language Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19232v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) systems have been actively studied and deployed across various industries to query on domain-specific knowledge base. However, evaluating these systems presents unique challenges due to the scarcity of domain-specific queries and corresponding ground truths, as well as a lack of systematic approaches to diagnosing the cause of failure cases -- whether they stem from knowledge deficits or issues related to system robustness. To address these challenges, we introduce GRAMMAR (GRounded And Modular Methodology for Assessment of RAG), an evaluation framework comprising two key elements: 1) a data generation process that leverages relational databases and LLMs to efficiently produce scalable query-answer pairs. This method facilitates the separation of query logic from linguistic variations for enhanced debugging capabilities; and 2) an evaluation framework that differentiates knowledge gaps from robustness and enables the identification of defective modules. Our empirical results underscore the limitations of current reference-free evaluation approaches and the reliability of GRAMMAR to accurately identify model vulnerabilities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01582v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent times training Language Models (LMs) have relied on computationally heavy training over massive datasets which makes this training process extremely laborious. In this paper we propose a novel method for numerically evaluating text quality in large unlabelled NLP datasets in a model agnostic manner to assign the text instances a "quality score".
  By proposing the text quality metric, the paper establishes a framework to identify and eliminate low-quality text instances, leading to improved training efficiency for LM models. Experimental results over multiple models and datasets demonstrate the efficacy of this approach, showcasing substantial gains in training effectiveness and highlighting the potential for resource-efficient LM training.
  For example, we observe an absolute accuracy improvement of 0.9% averaged over 14 downstream evaluation tasks for multiple LM models while using 40% lesser data and training 42% faster when training on the OpenWebText dataset and 0.8% average absolute accuracy improvement while using 20% lesser data and training 21% faster on the Wikipedia dataset.</description>

      <title>GPT-4 passes most of the 297 written Polish Board Certification Examinations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01589v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Introduction: Recently, the effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) has increased rapidly, allowing them to be used in a great number of applications. However, the risks posed by the generation of false information through LLMs significantly limit their applications in sensitive areas such as healthcare, highlighting the necessity for rigorous validations to determine their utility and reliability. To date, no study has extensively compared the performance of LLMs on Polish medical examinations across a broad spectrum of specialties on a very large dataset. Objectives: This study evaluated the performance of three Generative Pretrained Transformer (GPT) models on the Polish Board Certification Exam (Pa\'nstwowy Egzamin Specjalizacyjny, PES) dataset, which consists of 297 tests. Methods: We developed a software program to download and process PES exams and tested the performance of GPT models using OpenAI Application Programming Interface. Results: Our findings reveal that GPT-3.5 did not pass any of the analyzed exams. In contrast, the GPT-4 models demonstrated the capability to pass the majority of the exams evaluated, with the most recent model, gpt-4-0125, successfully passing 222 (75%) of them. The performance of the GPT models varied significantly, displaying excellence in exams related to certain specialties while completely failing others. Conclusions: The significant progress and impressive performance of LLM models hold great promise for the increased application of AI in the field of medicine in Poland. For instance, this advancement could lead to the development of AI-based medical assistants for healthcare professionals, enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of medical services.</description>

      <title>REASONS: A benchmark for REtrieval and Automated citationS Of scieNtific Sentences using Public and Proprietary LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02228v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Automatic citation generation for sentences in a document or report is paramount for intelligence analysts, cybersecurity, news agencies, and education personnel. In this research, we investigate whether large language models (LLMs) are capable of generating references based on two forms of sentence queries: (a) Direct Queries, LLMs are asked to provide author names of the given research article, and (b) Indirect Queries, LLMs are asked to provide the title of a mentioned article when given a sentence from a different article. To demonstrate where LLM stands in this task, we introduce a large dataset called REASONS comprising abstracts of the 12 most popular domains of scientific research on arXiv. From around 20K research articles, we make the following deductions on public and proprietary LLMs: (a) State-of-the-art, often called anthropomorphic GPT-4 and GPT-3.5, suffers from high pass percentage (PP) to minimize the hallucination rate (HR). When tested with Perplexity.ai (7B), they unexpectedly made more errors; (b) Augmenting relevant metadata lowered the PP and gave the lowest HR; (c) Advance retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) using Mistral demonstrates consistent and robust citation support on indirect queries and matched performance to GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. The HR across all domains and models decreased by an average of 41.93%, and the PP was reduced to 0% in most cases. In terms of generation quality, the average F1 Score and BLEU were 68.09% and 57.51%, respectively; (d) Testing with adversarial samples showed that LLMs, including the Advance RAG Mistral, struggle to understand context, but the extent of this issue was small in Mistral and GPT-4-Preview. Our study contributes valuable insights into the reliability of RAG for automated citation generation tasks.</description>

      <title>QuadraNet V2: Efficient and Sustainable Training of High-Order Neural Networks with Quadratic Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03192v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning is evolving towards high-order models that necessitate pre-training on extensive datasets, a process associated with significant overheads. Traditional models, despite having pre-trained weights, are becoming obsolete due to architectural differences that obstruct the effective transfer and initialization of these weights. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel framework, QuadraNet V2, which leverages quadratic neural networks to create efficient and sustainable high-order learning models. Our method initializes the primary term of the quadratic neuron using a standard neural network, while the quadratic term is employed to adaptively enhance the learning of data non-linearity or shifts. This integration of pre-trained primary terms with quadratic terms, which possess advanced modeling capabilities, significantly augments the information characterization capacity of the high-order network. By utilizing existing pre-trained weights, QuadraNet V2 reduces the required GPU hours for training by 90\% to 98.4\% compared to training from scratch, demonstrating both efficiency and effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Q-Learning with Large Language Model Heuristics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03341</link>

Abstract: Q-learning excels in learning from feedback within sequential decision-making tasks but requires extensive sampling for significant improvements. Although reward shaping is a powerful technique for enhancing learning efficiency, it can introduce biases that affect agent performance. Furthermore, potential-based reward shaping is constrained as it does not allow for reward modifications based on actions, potentially limiting its effectiveness in complex environments. Additionally, large language models (LLMs) can achieve zero-shot learning, but this is generally limited to simpler tasks. They also exhibit low inference speeds and occasionally produce hallucinations. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{LLM-guided Q-learning} that employs LLMs as heuristic to aid in learning the Q-function for reinforcement learning. It combines the advantages of both technologies without introducing performance bias. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that the LLM heuristic term provides action-level guidance, while the framework can accommodate inaccurate guidance by converting hallucinations into exploration costs. Moreover, the converged Q function corresponds to the MDP optimal Q function. Experiment results demonstrated that our algorithm enables agents to avoid ineffective exploration, enhances sampling efficiency, and is well-suited for complex control tasks.</description>

      <title>Position: Leverage Foundational Models for Black-Box Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03547v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Undeniably, Large Language Models (LLMs) have stirred an extraordinary wave of innovation in the machine learning research domain, resulting in substantial impact across diverse fields such as reinforcement learning, robotics, and computer vision. Their incorporation has been rapid and transformative, marking a significant paradigm shift in the field of machine learning research. However, the field of experimental design, grounded on black-box optimization, has been much less affected by such a paradigm shift, even though integrating LLMs with optimization presents a unique landscape ripe for exploration. In this position paper, we frame the field of black-box optimization around sequence-based foundation models and organize their relationship with previous literature. We discuss the most promising ways foundational language models can revolutionize optimization, which include harnessing the vast wealth of information encapsulated in free-form text to enrich task comprehension, utilizing highly flexible sequence models such as Transformers to engineer superior optimization strategies, and enhancing performance prediction over previously unseen search spaces.</description>

      <title>Explainable machine learning for predicting shellfish toxicity in the Adriatic Sea using long-term monitoring data of HABs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04372v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, explainable machine learning techniques are applied to predict the toxicity of mussels in the Gulf of Trieste (Adriatic Sea) caused by harmful algal blooms. By analysing a newly created 28-year dataset containing records of toxic phytoplankton in mussel farming areas and toxin concentrations in mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis), we train and evaluate the performance of ML models to accurately predict diarrhetic shellfish poisoning (DSP) events. The random forest model provided the best prediction of positive toxicity results based on the F1 score. Explainability methods such as permutation importance and SHAP identified key species (Dinophysis fortii and D. caudata) and environmental factors (salinity, river discharge and precipitation) as the best predictors of DSP outbreaks. These findings are important for improving early warning systems and supporting sustainable aquaculture practices.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models for Cyber Security: A Systematic Literature Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04760v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has opened up new opportunities for leveraging artificial intelligence in various domains, including cybersecurity. As the volume and sophistication of cyber threats continue to grow, there is an increasing need for intelligent systems that can automatically detect vulnerabilities, analyze malware, and respond to attacks. In this survey, we conduct a comprehensive review of the literature on the application of LLMs in cybersecurity (LLM4Security). By comprehensively collecting over 30K relevant papers and systematically analyzing 127 papers from top security and software engineering venues, we aim to provide a holistic view of how LLMs are being used to solve diverse problems across the cybersecurity domain. Through our analysis, we identify several key findings. First, we observe that LLMs are being applied to a wide range of cybersecurity tasks, including vulnerability detection, malware analysis, network intrusion detection, and phishing detection. Second, we find that the datasets used for training and evaluating LLMs in these tasks are often limited in size and diversity, highlighting the need for more comprehensive and representative datasets. Third, we identify several promising techniques for adapting LLMs to specific cybersecurity domains, such as fine-tuning, transfer learning, and domain-specific pre-training. Finally, we discuss the main challenges and opportunities for future research in LLM4Security, including the need for more interpretable and explainable models, the importance of addressing data privacy and security concerns, and the potential for leveraging LLMs for proactive defense and threat hunting. Overall, our survey provides a comprehensive overview of the current state-of-the-art in LLM4Security and identifies several promising directions for future research.</description>

      <title>LLMs with Personalities in Multi-issue Negotiation Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05248v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Powered by large language models (LLMs), AI agents have become capable of many human tasks. Using the most canonical definitions of the Big Five personality, we measure the ability of LLMs to negotiate within a game-theoretical framework, as well as methodological challenges to measuring notions of fairness and risk. Simulations (n=1,500) for both single-issue and multi-issue negotiation reveal increase in domain complexity with asymmetric issue valuations improve agreement rates but decrease surplus from aggressive negotiation. Through gradient-boosted regression and Shapley explainers, we find high openness, conscientiousness, and neuroticism are associated with fair tendencies; low agreeableness and low openness are associated with rational tendencies. Low conscientiousness is associated with high toxicity. These results indicate that LLMs may have built-in guardrails that default to fair behavior, but can be "jail broken" to exploit agreeable opponents. We also offer pragmatic insight in how negotiation bots can be designed, and a framework of assessing negotiation behavior based on game theory and computational social science.</description>
