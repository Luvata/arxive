      <title>Make LLMs better zero-shot reasoners: Structure-orientated autonomous reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zero-shot reasoning methods with Large Language Models (LLMs) offer significant advantages including great generalization to novel tasks and reduced dependency on human-crafted examples. However, the current zero-shot methods still have limitations in complex tasks, e.g., answering questions that require multi-step reasoning. In this paper, we address this limitation by introducing a novel structure-oriented analysis method to help LLMs better understand the question and guide the problem-solving process of LLMs. We first demonstrate how the existing reasoning strategies, Chain-of-Thought and ReAct, can benefit from our structure-oriented analysis. In addition to empirical investigations, we leverage the probabilistic graphical model to theoretically explain why our structure-oriented analysis can improve the LLM reasoning process. To further improve the reliability in complex question-answering tasks, we propose a multi-agent reasoning system, Structure-oriented Autonomous Reasoning Agents (SARA), that can better enforce the reasoning process following our structure-oriented analysis by refinement techniques and is equipped with external knowledge retrieval capability to reduce factual errors. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of the proposed reasoning system. Surprisingly, in some cases, the system even surpasses few-shot methods. Finally, the system not only improves reasoning accuracy in complex tasks but also demonstrates robustness against potential attacks that corrupt the reasoning process.</description>

      <title>Whither Bias Goes, I Will Go: An Integrative, Systematic Review of Algorithmic Bias Mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models are increasingly used for personnel assessment and selection (e.g., resume screeners, automatically scored interviews). However, concerns have been raised throughout society that ML assessments may be biased and perpetuate or exacerbate inequality. Although organizational researchers have begun investigating ML assessments from traditional psychometric and legal perspectives, there is a need to understand, clarify, and integrate fairness operationalizations and algorithmic bias mitigation methods from the computer science, data science, and organizational research literatures. We present a four-stage model of developing ML assessments and applying bias mitigation methods, including 1) generating the training data, 2) training the model, 3) testing the model, and 4) deploying the model. When introducing the four-stage model, we describe potential sources of bias and unfairness at each stage. Then, we systematically review definitions and operationalizations of algorithmic bias, legal requirements governing personnel selection from the United States and Europe, and research on algorithmic bias mitigation across multiple domains and integrate these findings into our framework. Our review provides insights for both research and practice by elucidating possible mechanisms of algorithmic bias while identifying which bias mitigation methods are legal and effective. This integrative framework also reveals gaps in the knowledge of algorithmic bias mitigation that should be addressed by future collaborative research between organizational researchers, computer scientists, and data scientists. We provide recommendations for developing and deploying ML assessments, as well as recommendations for future research into algorithmic bias and fairness.</description>

      <title>Dual Space Training for GANs: A Pathway to Efficient and Creative Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have demonstrated remarkable advancements in generative modeling; however, their training is often resource-intensive, requiring extensive computational time and hundreds of thousands of epochs. This paper proposes a novel optimization approach that transforms the training process by operating within a dual space of the initial data using invertible mappings, specifically autoencoders. By training GANs on the encoded representations in the dual space, which encapsulate the most salient features of the data, the generative process becomes significantly more efficient and potentially reveals underlying patterns beyond human recognition. This approach not only enhances training speed and resource usage but also explores the philosophical question of whether models can generate insights that transcend the human intelligence while being limited by the human-generated data.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneous Random Forest</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Random forest (RF) stands out as a highly favored machine learning approach for classification problems. The effectiveness of RF hinges on two key factors: the accuracy of individual trees and the diversity among them. In this study, we introduce a novel approach called heterogeneous RF (HRF), designed to enhance tree diversity in a meaningful way. This diversification is achieved by deliberately introducing heterogeneity during the tree construction. Specifically, features used for splitting near the root node of previous trees are assigned lower weights when constructing the feature sub-space of the subsequent trees. As a result, dominant features in the prior trees are less likely to be employed in the next iteration, leading to a more diverse set of splitting features at the nodes. Through simulation studies, it was confirmed that the HRF method effectively mitigates the selection bias of trees within the ensemble, increases the diversity of the ensemble, and demonstrates superior performance on datasets with fewer noise features. To assess the comparative performance of HRF against other widely adopted ensemble methods, we conducted tests on 52 datasets, comprising both real-world and synthetic data. HRF consistently outperformed other ensemble methods in terms of accuracy across the majority of datasets.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models for Financial Aid in Financial Time-series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Considering the difficulty of financial time series forecasting in financial aid, much of the current research focuses on leveraging big data analytics in financial services. One modern approach is to utilize "predictive analysis", analogous to forecasting financial trends. However, many of these time series data in Financial Aid (FA) pose unique challenges due to limited historical datasets and high dimensional financial information, which hinder the development of effective predictive models that balance accuracy with efficient runtime and memory usage. Pre-trained foundation models are employed to address these challenging tasks. We use state-of-the-art time series models including pre-trained LLMs (GPT-2 as the backbone), transformers, and linear models to demonstrate their ability to outperform traditional approaches, even with minimal ("few-shot") or no fine-tuning ("zero-shot"). Our benchmark study, which includes financial aid with seven other time series tasks, shows the potential of using LLMs for scarce financial datasets.</description>

      <title>Mixture of Parrots: Experts improve memorization more than reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture enables a significant increase in the total number of model parameters with minimal computational overhead. However, it is not clear what performance tradeoffs, if any, exist between MoEs and standard dense transformers. In this paper, we show that as we increase the number of experts (while fixing the number of active parameters), the memorization performance consistently increases while the reasoning capabilities saturate. We begin by analyzing the theoretical limitations of MoEs at reasoning. We prove that there exist graph problems that cannot be solved by any number of experts of a certain width; however, the same task can be easily solved by a dense model with a slightly larger width. On the other hand, we find that on memory-intensive tasks, MoEs can effectively leverage a small number of active parameters with a large number of experts to memorize the data. We empirically validate these findings on synthetic graph problems and memory-intensive closed book retrieval tasks. Lastly, we pre-train a series of MoEs and dense transformers and evaluate them on commonly used benchmarks in math and natural language. We find that increasing the number of experts helps solve knowledge-intensive tasks, but fails to yield the same benefits for reasoning tasks.</description>

      <title>Newton Losses: Using Curvature Information for Learning with Differentiable Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When training neural networks with custom objectives, such as ranking losses and shortest-path losses, a common problem is that they are, per se, non-differentiable. A popular approach is to continuously relax the objectives to provide gradients, enabling learning. However, such differentiable relaxations are often non-convex and can exhibit vanishing and exploding gradients, making them (already in isolation) hard to optimize. Here, the loss function poses the bottleneck when training a deep neural network. We present Newton Losses, a method for improving the performance of existing hard to optimize losses by exploiting their second-order information via their empirical Fisher and Hessian matrices. Instead of training the neural network with second-order techniques, we only utilize the loss function's second-order information to replace it by a Newton Loss, while training the network with gradient descent. This makes our method computationally efficient. We apply Newton Losses to eight differentiable algorithms for sorting and shortest-paths, achieving significant improvements for less-optimized differentiable algorithms, and consistent improvements, even for well-optimized differentiable algorithms.</description>

      <title>An Investigation on Machine Learning Predictive Accuracy Improvement and Uncertainty Reduction using VAE-based Data Augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The confluence of ultrafast computers with large memory, rapid progress in Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, and the availability of large datasets place multiple engineering fields at the threshold of dramatic progress. However, a unique challenge in nuclear engineering is data scarcity because experimentation on nuclear systems is usually more expensive and time-consuming than most other disciplines. One potential way to resolve the data scarcity issue is deep generative learning, which uses certain ML models to learn the underlying distribution of existing data and generate synthetic samples that resemble the real data. In this way, one can significantly expand the dataset to train more accurate predictive ML models. In this study, our objective is to evaluate the effectiveness of data augmentation using variational autoencoder (VAE)-based deep generative models. We investigated whether the data augmentation leads to improved accuracy in the predictions of a deep neural network (DNN) model trained using the augmented data. Additionally, the DNN prediction uncertainties are quantified using Bayesian Neural Networks (BNN) and conformal prediction (CP) to assess the impact on predictive uncertainty reduction. To test the proposed methodology, we used TRACE simulations of steady-state void fraction data based on the NUPEC Boiling Water Reactor Full-size Fine-mesh Bundle Test (BFBT) benchmark. We found that augmenting the training dataset using VAEs has improved the DNN model's predictive accuracy, improved the prediction confidence intervals, and reduced the prediction uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Target Strangeness: A Novel Conformal Prediction Difficulty Estimator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces Target Strangeness, a novel difficulty estimator for conformal prediction (CP) that offers an alternative approach for normalizing prediction intervals (PIs). By assessing how atypical a prediction is within the context of its nearest neighbours' target distribution, Target Strangeness can surpass the current state-of-the-art performance. This novel difficulty estimator is evaluated against others in the context of several conformal regression experiments.</description>

      <title>FastSurvival: Hidden Computational Blessings in Training Cox Proportional Hazards Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Survival analysis is an important research topic with applications in healthcare, business, and manufacturing. One essential tool in this area is the Cox proportional hazards (CPH) model, which is widely used for its interpretability, flexibility, and predictive performance. However, for modern data science challenges such as high dimensionality (both $n$ and $p$) and high feature correlations, current algorithms to train the CPH model have drawbacks, preventing us from using the CPH model at its full potential. The root cause is that the current algorithms, based on the Newton method, have trouble converging due to vanishing second order derivatives when outside the local region of the minimizer. To circumvent this problem, we propose new optimization methods by constructing and minimizing surrogate functions that exploit hidden mathematical structures of the CPH model. Our new methods are easy to implement and ensure monotonic loss decrease and global convergence. Empirically, we verify the computational efficiency of our methods. As a direct application, we show how our optimization methods can be used to solve the cardinality-constrained CPH problem, producing very sparse high-quality models that were not previously practical to construct. We list several extensions that our breakthrough enables, including optimization opportunities, theoretical questions on CPH's mathematical structure, as well as other CPH-related applications.</description>

      <title>Provable Tempered Overfitting of Minimal Nets and Typical Nets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the overfitting behavior of fully connected deep Neural Networks (NNs) with binary weights fitted to perfectly classify a noisy training set. We consider interpolation using both the smallest NN (having the minimal number of weights) and a random interpolating NN. For both learning rules, we prove overfitting is tempered. Our analysis rests on a new bound on the size of a threshold circuit consistent with a partial function. To the best of our knowledge, ours are the first theoretical results on benign or tempered overfitting that: (1) apply to deep NNs, and (2) do not require a very high or very low input dimension.</description>

      <title>TesseraQ: Ultra Low-Bit LLM Post-Training Quantization with Block Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing, albeit at the cost of immense memory and computation requirements. Post-training quantization (PTQ) is becoming the de facto method to reduce the memory footprint and improve the inference throughput of LLMs. In this work, we aim to push the upper limit of LLM PTQ by optimizing the weight rounding parameters with the block reconstruction technique, a predominant method in previous vision models. We propose TesseraQ, a new state-of-the-art PTQ technique, to quantize the weights of LLMs to ultra-low bits. To effectively optimize the rounding in LLMs and stabilize the reconstruction process, we introduce progressive adaptive rounding. This approach iteratively transits the soft rounding variables to hard variables during the reconstruction process. Additionally, we optimize the dequantization scale parameters to fully leverage the block reconstruction technique. We demonstrate that TesseraQ can be seamlessly integrated with existing scaling or clipping-based PTQ algorithms such as AWQ and OmniQuant, significantly enhancing their performance and establishing a new state-of-the-art. For instance, when compared to AWQ, TesseraQ improves the wikitext2 perplexity from 14.65 to 6.82 and average downstream accuracy from 50.52 to 59.27 with 2-bit weight-only quantization of LLaMA-2-7B. Across a range of quantization schemes, including W2A16, W3A16, W3A3, and W4A4, TesseraQ consistently exhibits superior performance.</description>

      <title>Bio2Token: All-atom tokenization of any biomolecular structure with Mamba</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient encoding and representation of large 3D molecular structures with high fidelity is critical for biomolecular design applications. Despite this, many representation learning approaches restrict themselves to modeling smaller systems or use coarse-grained approximations of the systems, for example modeling proteins at the resolution of amino acid residues rather than at the level of individual atoms. To address this, we develop quantized auto-encoders that learn atom-level tokenizations of complete proteins, RNA and small molecule structures with reconstruction accuracies below and around 1 Angstrom. We demonstrate that the Mamba state space model architecture employed is comparatively efficient, requiring a fraction of the training data, parameters and compute needed to reach competitive accuracies and can scale to systems with almost 100,000 atoms. The learned structure tokens of bio2token may serve as the input for all-atom language models in the future.</description>

      <title>LanFL: Differentially Private Federated Learning with Large Language Models using Synthetic Samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a collaborative, privacy-preserving machine learning framework that enables multiple participants to train a single global model. However, the recent advent of powerful Large Language Models (LLMs) with tens to hundreds of billions of parameters makes the naive application of traditional FL methods to LLMs impractical due to high computational and communication costs. Furthermore, end users of LLMs often lack access to full architectures and weights of the models, making it impossible for participants to fine-tune these models directly. This paper introduces a novel FL scheme for LLMs, named LanFL, which is purely prompt-based and treats the underlying LLMs as black boxes. We have developed a differentially private synthetic sample generation mechanism to facilitate knowledge sharing among participants, along with a prompt optimization scheme that enables learning from synthetic samples. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that LanFL successfully facilitates learning among participants while preserving the privacy of local datasets across various tasks.</description>

      <title>Research on Key Technologies for Cross-Cloud Federated Training of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid development of natural language processing technology, large language models have demonstrated exceptional performance in various application scenarios. However, training these models requires significant computational resources and data processing capabilities. Cross-cloud federated training offers a new approach to addressing the resource bottlenecks of a single cloud platform, allowing the computational resources of multiple clouds to collaboratively complete the training tasks of large models. This study analyzes the key technologies of cross-cloud federated training, including data partitioning and distribution, communication optimization, model aggregation algorithms, and the compatibility of heterogeneous cloud platforms. Additionally, the study examines data security and privacy protection strategies in cross-cloud training, particularly the application of data encryption and differential privacy techniques. Through experimental validation, the proposed technical framework demonstrates enhanced training efficiency, ensured data security, and reduced training costs, highlighting the broad application prospects of cross-cloud federated training.</description>

      <title>Context-Aware Trajectory Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trajectory anomaly detection is crucial for effective decision-making in urban and human mobility management. Existing methods of trajectory anomaly detection generally focus on training a trajectory generative model and evaluating the likelihood of reconstructing a given trajectory. However, previous work often lacks important contextual information on the trajectory, such as the agent's information (e.g., agent ID) or geographic information (e.g., Points of Interest (POI)), which could provide additional information on accurately capturing anomalous behaviors. To fill this gap, we propose a context-aware anomaly detection approach that models contextual information related to trajectories. The proposed method is based on a trajectory reconstruction framework guided by contextual factors such as agent ID and contextual POI embedding. The injection of contextual information aims to improve the performance of anomaly detection. We conducted experiments in two cities and demonstrated that the proposed approach significantly outperformed existing methods by effectively modeling contextual information. Overall, this paper paves a new direction for advancing trajectory anomaly detection.</description>

      <title>Initialization Matters: On the Benign Overfitting of Two-Layer ReLU CNN with Fully Trainable Layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Benign overfitting refers to how over-parameterized neural networks can fit training data perfectly and generalize well to unseen data. While this has been widely investigated theoretically, existing works are limited to two-layer networks with fixed output layers, where only the hidden weights are trained. We extend the analysis to two-layer ReLU convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with fully trainable layers, which is closer to the practice. Our results show that the initialization scaling of the output layer is crucial to the training dynamics: large scales make the model training behave similarly to that with the fixed output, the hidden layer grows rapidly while the output layer remains largely unchanged; in contrast, small scales result in more complex layer interactions, the hidden layer initially grows to a specific ratio relative to the output layer, after which both layers jointly grow and maintain that ratio throughout training. Furthermore, in both settings, we provide nearly matching upper and lower bounds on the test errors, identifying the sharp conditions on the initialization scaling and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in which the benign overfitting can be achieved or not. Numerical experiments back up the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Structured Diffusion Models with Mixture of Gaussians as Prior Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a class of structured diffusion models, in which the prior distribution is chosen as a mixture of Gaussians, rather than a standard Gaussian distribution. The specific mixed Gaussian distribution, as prior, can be chosen to incorporate certain structured information of the data. We develop a simple-to-implement training procedure that smoothly accommodates the use of mixed Gaussian as prior. Theory is provided to quantify the benefits of our proposed models, compared to the classical diffusion models. Numerical experiments with synthetic, image and operational data are conducted to show comparative advantages of our model. Our method is shown to be robust to mis-specifications and in particular suits situations where training resources are limited or faster training in real time is desired.</description>

      <title>Learning Coupled Subspaces for Multi-Condition Spike Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In neuroscience, researchers typically conduct experiments under multiple conditions to acquire neural responses in the form of high-dimensional spike train datasets. Analysing high-dimensional spike data is a challenging statistical problem. To this end, Gaussian process factor analysis (GPFA), a popular class of latent variable models has been proposed. GPFA extracts smooth, low-dimensional latent trajectories underlying high-dimensional spike train datasets. However, such analyses are often done separately for each experimental condition, contrary to the nature of neural datasets, which contain recordings under multiple experimental conditions. Exploiting the parametric nature of these conditions, we propose a multi-condition GPFA model and inference procedure to learn the underlying latent structure in the corresponding datasets in sample-efficient manner. In particular, we propose a non-parametric Bayesian approach to learn a smooth tuning function over the experiment condition space. Our approach not only boosts model accuracy and is faster, but also improves model interpretability compared to approaches that separately fit models for each experimental condition.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Attacks on Large Language Models Using Regularized Relaxation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As powerful Large Language Models (LLMs) are now widely used for numerous practical applications, their safety is of critical importance. While alignment techniques have significantly improved overall safety, LLMs remain vulnerable to carefully crafted adversarial inputs. Consequently, adversarial attack methods are extensively used to study and understand these vulnerabilities. However, current attack methods face significant limitations. Those relying on optimizing discrete tokens suffer from limited efficiency, while continuous optimization techniques fail to generate valid tokens from the model's vocabulary, rendering them impractical for real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a novel technique for adversarial attacks that overcomes these limitations by leveraging regularized gradients with continuous optimization methods. Our approach is two orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art greedy coordinate gradient-based method, significantly improving the attack success rate on aligned language models. Moreover, it generates valid tokens, addressing a fundamental limitation of existing continuous optimization methods. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our attack on five state-of-the-art LLMs using four datasets.</description>

      <title>Indication Finding: a novel use case for representation learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many therapies are effective in treating multiple diseases. We present an approach that leverages methods developed in natural language processing and real-world data to prioritize potential, new indications for a mechanism of action (MoA). We specifically use representation learning to generate embeddings of indications and prioritize them based on their proximity to the indications with the strongest available evidence for the MoA. We demonstrate the successful deployment of our approach for anti-IL-17A using embeddings generated with SPPMI and present an evaluation framework to determine the quality of indication finding results and the derived embeddings.</description>

      <title>Perturbation-based Graph Active Learning for Weakly-Supervised Belief Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of optimizing the allocation of labeling resources for semi-supervised belief representation learning in social networks. The objective is to strategically identify valuable messages on social media graphs that are worth labeling within a constrained budget, ultimately maximizing the task's performance. Despite the progress in unsupervised or semi-supervised methods in advancing belief and ideology representation learning on social networks and the remarkable efficacy of graph learning techniques, the availability of high-quality curated labeled social data can greatly benefit and further improve performances. Consequently, allocating labeling efforts is a critical research problem in scenarios where labeling resources are limited. This paper proposes a graph data augmentation-inspired perturbation-based active learning strategy (PerbALGraph) that progressively selects messages for labeling according to an automatic estimator, obviating human guidance. This estimator is based on the principle that messages in the network that exhibit heightened sensitivity to structural features of the observational data indicate landmark quality that significantly influences semi-supervision processes. We design the estimator to be the prediction variance under a set of designed graph perturbations, which is model-agnostic and application-independent. Extensive experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy for belief representation learning tasks.</description>

      <title>TEAM: Topological Evolution-aware Framework for Traffic Forecasting--Extended Version</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the global trend towards urbanization, people increasingly move to and live in cities that then continue to grow. Traffic forecasting plays an important role in the intelligent transportation systems of cities as well as in spatio-temporal data mining. State-of-the-art forecasting is achieved by deep-learning approaches due to their ability to contend with complex spatio-temporal dynamics. However, existing methods assume the input is fixed-topology road networks and static traffic time series. These assumptions fail to align with urbanization, where time series are collected continuously and road networks evolve over time. In such settings, deep-learning models require frequent re-initialization and re-training, imposing high computational costs. To enable much more efficient training without jeopardizing model accuracy, we propose the Topological Evolution-aware Framework (TEAM) for traffic forecasting that incorporates convolution and attention. This combination of mechanisms enables better adaptation to newly collected time series, while being able to maintain learned knowledge from old time series. TEAM features a continual learning module based on the Wasserstein metric that acts as a buffer that can identify the most stable and the most changing network nodes. Then, only data related to stable nodes is employed for re-training when consolidating a model. Further, only data of new nodes and their adjacent nodes as well as data pertaining to changing nodes are used to re-train the model. Empirical studies with two real-world traffic datasets offer evidence that TEAM is capable of much lower re-training costs than existing methods are, without jeopardizing forecasting accuracy.</description>

      <title>Binary Classification: Is Boosting stronger than Bagging?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Random Forests have been one of the most popular bagging methods in the past few decades, especially due to their success at handling tabular datasets. They have been extensively studied and compared to boosting models, like XGBoost, which are generally considered more performant. Random Forests adopt several simplistic assumptions, such that all samples and all trees that form the forest are equally important for building the final model. We introduce Enhanced Random Forests, an extension of vanilla Random Forests with extra functionalities and adaptive sample and model weighting. We develop an iterative algorithm for adapting the training sample weights, by favoring the hardest examples, and an approach for finding personalized tree weighting schemes for each new sample. Our method significantly improves upon regular Random Forests across 15 different binary classification datasets and considerably outperforms other tree methods, including XGBoost, when run with default hyperparameters, which indicates the robustness of our approach across datasets, without the need for extensive hyperparameter tuning. Our tree-weighting methodology results in enhanced or comparable performance to the uniformly weighted ensemble, and is, more importantly, leveraged to define importance scores for trees based on their contributions to classifying each new sample. This enables us to only focus on a small number of trees as the main models that define the outcome of a new sample and, thus, to partially recover interpretability, which is critically missing from both bagging and boosting methods. In binary classification problems, the proposed extensions and the corresponding results suggest the equivalence of bagging and boosting methods in performance, and the edge of bagging in interpretability by leveraging a few learners of the ensemble, which is not an option in the less explainable boosting methods.</description>

      <title>Inference time LLM alignment in single and multidomain preference spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aligning Large Language Models (LLM) to address subjectivity and nuanced preference levels requires adequate flexibility and control, which can be a resource-intensive and time-consuming procedure. Existing training-time alignment methods require full re-training when a change is needed and inference-time ones typically require access to the reward model at each inference step. To address these limitations, we introduce inference-time model alignment method that learns encoded representations of preference dimensions, called \textit{Alignment Vectors} (AV). These representations are computed by subtraction of the base model from the aligned model as in model editing enabling dynamically adjusting the model behavior during inference through simple linear operations. Even though the preference dimensions can span various granularity levels, here we focus on three gradual response levels across three specialized domains: medical, legal, and financial, exemplifying its practical potential. This new alignment paradigm introduces adjustable preference knobs during inference, allowing users to tailor their LLM outputs while reducing the inference cost by half compared to the prompt engineering approach. Additionally, we find that AVs are transferable across different fine-tuning stages of the same model, demonstrating their flexibility. AVs also facilitate multidomain, diverse preference alignment, making the process 12x faster than the retraining approach.</description>

      <title>Equitable Federated Learning with Activation Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated learning is a prominent distributed learning paradigm that incorporates collaboration among diverse clients, promotes data locality, and thus ensures privacy. These clients have their own technological, cultural, and other biases in the process of data generation. However, the present standard often ignores this bias/heterogeneity, perpetuating bias against certain groups rather than mitigating it. In response to this concern, we propose an equitable clustering-based framework where the clients are categorized/clustered based on how similar they are to each other. We propose a unique way to construct the similarity matrix that uses activation vectors. Furthermore, we propose a client weighing mechanism to ensure that each cluster receives equal importance and establish $O(1/\sqrt{K})$ rate of convergence to reach an $\epsilon-$stationary solution. We assess the effectiveness of our proposed strategy against common baselines, demonstrating its efficacy in terms of reducing the bias existing amongst various client clusters and consequently ameliorating algorithmic bias against specific groups.</description>

      <title>Predicting Liquidity Coverage Ratio with Gated Recurrent Units: A Deep Learning Model for Risk Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the global economic integration and the high interconnection of financial markets, financial institutions are facing unprecedented challenges, especially liquidity risk. This paper proposes a liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) prediction model based on the gated recurrent unit (GRU) network to help financial institutions manage their liquidity risk more effectively. By utilizing the GRU network in deep learning technology, the model can automatically learn complex patterns from historical data and accurately predict LCR for a period of time in the future. The experimental results show that compared with traditional methods, the GRU model proposed in this study shows significant advantages in mean absolute error (MAE), proving its higher accuracy and robustness. This not only provides financial institutions with a more reliable liquidity risk management tool but also provides support for regulators to formulate more scientific and reasonable policies, which helps to improve the stability of the entire financial system.</description>

      <title>No Free Lunch: Fundamental Limits of Learning Non-Hallucinating Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative models have shown impressive capabilities in synthesizing high-quality outputs across various domains. However, a persistent challenge is the occurrence of "hallucinations", where the model produces outputs that are plausible but invalid. While empirical strategies have been explored to mitigate this issue, a rigorous theoretical understanding remains elusive. In this paper, we develop a theoretical framework to analyze the learnability of non-hallucinating generative models from a learning-theoretic perspective. Our results reveal that non-hallucinating learning is statistically impossible when relying solely on the training dataset, even for a hypothesis class of size two and when the entire training set is truthful. To overcome these limitations, we show that incorporating inductive biases aligned with the actual facts into the learning process is essential. We provide a systematic approach to achieve this by restricting the facts set to a concept class of finite VC-dimension and demonstrate its effectiveness under various learning paradigms. Although our findings are primarily conceptual, they represent a first step towards a principled approach to addressing hallucinations in learning generative models.</description>

      <title>Peptide-GPT: Generative Design of Peptides using Generative Pre-trained Transformers and Bio-informatic Supervision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, natural language processing (NLP) models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in various domains beyond traditional text generation. In this work, we introduce PeptideGPT, a protein language model tailored to generate protein sequences with distinct properties: hemolytic activity, solubility, and non-fouling characteristics. To facilitate a rigorous evaluation of these generated sequences, we established a comprehensive evaluation pipeline consisting of ideas from bioinformatics to retain valid proteins with ordered structures. First, we rank the generated sequences based on their perplexity scores, then we filter out those lying outside the permissible convex hull of proteins. Finally, we predict the structure using ESMFold and select the proteins with pLDDT values greater than 70 to ensure ordered structure. The properties of generated sequences are evaluated using task-specific classifiers - PeptideBERT and HAPPENN. We achieved an accuracy of 76.26% in hemolytic, 72.46% in non-hemolytic, 78.84% in non-fouling, and 68.06% in solubility protein generation. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of PeptideGPT in de novo protein design and underscore the potential of leveraging NLP-based approaches for paving the way for future innovations and breakthroughs in synthetic biology and bioinformatics.

      <title>Hierarchical Mixture of Experts: Generalizable Learning for High-Level Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-level synthesis (HLS) is a widely used tool in designing Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). HLS enables FPGA design with software programming languages by compiling the source code into an FPGA circuit. The source code includes a program (called ``kernel'') and several pragmas that instruct hardware synthesis, such as parallelization, pipeline, etc. While it is relatively easy for software developers to design the program, it heavily relies on hardware knowledge to design the pragmas, posing a big challenge for software developers. Recently, different machine learning algorithms, such as GNNs, have been proposed to automate the pragma design via performance prediction. However, when applying the trained model on new kernels, the significant domain shift often leads to unsatisfactory performance. We propose a more domain-generalizable model structure: a two-level hierarchical Mixture of Experts (MoE), that can be flexibly adapted to any GNN model. Different expert networks can learn to deal with different regions in the representation space, and they can utilize similar patterns between the old kernels and new kernels. In the low-level MoE, we apply MoE on three natural granularities of a program: node, basic block, and graph. The high-level MoE learns to aggregate the three granularities for the final decision. To stably train the hierarchical MoE, we further propose a two-stage training method. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of the hierarchical MoE.</description>

      <title>Humanizing the Machine: Proxy Attacks to Mislead LLM Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advent of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized the field of text generation, producing outputs that closely mimic human-like writing. Although academic and industrial institutions have developed detectors to prevent the malicious usage of LLM-generated texts, other research has doubt about the robustness of these systems. To stress test these detectors, we introduce a proxy-attack strategy that effortlessly compromises LLMs, causing them to produce outputs that align with human-written text and mislead detection systems. Our method attacks the source model by leveraging a reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuned humanized small language model (SLM) in the decoding phase. Through an in-depth analysis, we demonstrate that our attack strategy is capable of generating responses that are indistinguishable to detectors, preventing them from differentiating between machine-generated and human-written text. We conduct systematic evaluations on extensive datasets using proxy-attacked open-source models, including Llama2-13B, Llama3-70B, and Mixtral-8*7B in both white- and black-box settings. Our findings show that the proxy-attack strategy effectively deceives the leading detectors, resulting in an average AUROC drop of 70.4% across multiple datasets, with a maximum drop of 90.3% on a single dataset. Furthermore, in cross-discipline scenarios, our strategy also bypasses these detectors, leading to a significant relative decrease of up to 90.9%, while in cross-language scenario, the drop reaches 91.3%. Despite our proxy-attack strategy successfully bypassing the detectors with such significant relative drops, we find that the generation quality of the attacked models remains preserved, even within a modest utility budget, when compared to the text produced by the original, unattacked source model.</description>

      <title>SHAP zero Explains All-order Feature Interactions in Black-box Genomic Models with Near-zero Query Cost</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid growth of black-box models in machine learning, Shapley values have emerged as a popular method for model explanations due to their theoretical guarantees. Shapley values locally explain a model to an input query using additive features. Yet, in genomics, extracting biological knowledge from black-box models hinges on explaining nonlinear feature interactions globally to hundreds to thousands of input query sequences. Herein, we develop SHAP zero, an algorithm that estimates all-order Shapley feature interactions with a near-zero cost per queried sequence after paying a one-time fee for model sketching. SHAP zero achieves this by establishing a surprisingly underexplored connection between the Shapley interactions and the Fourier transform of the model. Explaining two genomic models, one trained to predict guide RNA binding and the other to predict DNA repair outcomes, we demonstrate that SHAP zero achieves orders of magnitude reduction in amortized computational cost compared to state-of-the-art algorithms. SHAP zero reveals all microhomologous motifs that are predictive of DNA repair outcome, a finding previously inaccessible due to the combinatorial space of possible high-order feature interactions.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Exchange Rate Forecasting with Explainable Deep Learning Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate exchange rate prediction is fundamental to financial stability and international trade, positioning it as a critical focus in economic and financial research. Traditional forecasting models often falter when addressing the inherent complexities and non-linearities of exchange rate data. This study explores the application of advanced deep learning models, including LSTM, CNN, and transformer-based architectures, to enhance the predictive accuracy of the RMB/USD exchange rate. Utilizing 40 features across 6 categories, the analysis identifies TSMixer as the most effective model for this task. A rigorous feature selection process emphasizes the inclusion of key economic indicators, such as China-U.S. trade volumes and exchange rates of other major currencies like the euro-RMB and yen-dollar pairs. The integration of grad-CAM visualization techniques further enhances model interpretability, allowing for clearer identification of the most influential features and bolstering the credibility of the predictions. These findings underscore the pivotal role of fundamental economic data in exchange rate forecasting and highlight the substantial potential of machine learning models to deliver more accurate and reliable predictions, thereby serving as a valuable tool for financial analysis and decision-making.</description>

      <title>CHESTNUT: A QoS Dataset for Mobile Edge Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quality of Service (QoS) is an important metric to measure the performance of network services. Nowadays, it is widely used in mobile edge environments to evaluate the quality of service when mobile devices request services from edge servers. QoS usually involves multiple dimensions, such as bandwidth, latency, jitter, and data packet loss rate. However, most existing QoS datasets, such as the common WS-Dream dataset, focus mainly on static QoS metrics of network services and ignore dynamic attributes such as time and geographic location. This means they should have detailed the mobile device's location at the time of the service request or the chronological order in which the request was made. However, these dynamic attributes are crucial for understanding and predicting the actual performance of network services, as QoS performance typically fluctuates with time and geographic location. To this end, we propose a novel dataset that accurately records temporal and geographic location information on quality of service during the collection process, aiming to provide more accurate and reliable data to support future QoS prediction in mobile edge environments.</description>

      <title>Spatioformer: A Geo-encoded Transformer for Large-Scale Plant Species Richness Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Earth observation data have shown promise in predicting species richness of vascular plants ($\alpha$-diversity), but extending this approach to large spatial scales is challenging because geographically distant regions may exhibit different compositions of plant species ($\beta$-diversity), resulting in a location-dependent relationship between richness and spectral measurements. In order to handle such geolocation dependency, we propose Spatioformer, where a novel geolocation encoder is coupled with the transformer model to encode geolocation context into remote sensing imagery. The Spatioformer model compares favourably to state-of-the-art models in richness predictions on a large-scale ground-truth richness dataset (HAVPlot) that consists of 68,170 in-situ richness samples covering diverse landscapes across Australia. The results demonstrate that geolocational information is advantageous in predicting species richness from satellite observations over large spatial scales. With Spatioformer, plant species richness maps over Australia are compiled from Landsat archive for the years from 2015 to 2023. The richness maps produced in this study reveal the spatiotemporal dynamics of plant species richness in Australia, providing supporting evidence to inform effective planning and policy development for plant diversity conservation. Regions of high richness prediction uncertainties are identified, highlighting the need for future in-situ surveys to be conducted in these areas to enhance the prediction accuracy.</description>

      <title>A Survey of Deep Graph Learning under Distribution Shifts: from Graph Out-of-Distribution Generalization to Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distribution shifts on graphs -- the discrepancies in data distribution between training and employing a graph machine learning model -- are ubiquitous and often unavoidable in real-world scenarios. These shifts may severely deteriorate model performance, posing significant challenges for reliable graph machine learning. Consequently, there has been a surge in research on graph machine learning under distribution shifts, aiming to train models to achieve satisfactory performance on out-of-distribution (OOD) test data. In our survey, we provide an up-to-date and forward-looking review of deep graph learning under distribution shifts. Specifically, we cover three primary scenarios: graph OOD generalization, training-time graph OOD adaptation, and test-time graph OOD adaptation. We begin by formally formulating the problems and discussing various types of distribution shifts that can affect graph learning, such as covariate shifts and concept shifts. To provide a better understanding of the literature, we systematically categorize the existing models based on our proposed taxonomy and investigate the adopted techniques behind. We also summarize commonly used datasets in this research area to facilitate further investigation. Finally, we point out promising research directions and the corresponding challenges to encourage further study in this vital domain. Additionally, we provide a continuously updated reading list at https://github.com/kaize0409/Awesome-Graph-OOD.</description>

      <title>Coordinated Reply Attacks in Influence Operations: Characterization and Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coordinated reply attacks are a tactic observed in online influence operations and other coordinated campaigns to support or harass targeted individuals, or influence them or their followers. Despite its potential to influence the public, past studies have yet to analyze or provide a methodology to detect this tactic. In this study, we characterize coordinated reply attacks in the context of influence operations on Twitter. Our analysis reveals that the primary targets of these attacks are influential people such as journalists, news media, state officials, and politicians.
  We propose two supervised machine-learning models, one to classify tweets to determine whether they are targeted by a reply attack, and one to classify accounts that reply to a targeted tweet to determine whether they are part of a coordinated attack. The classifiers achieve AUC scores of 0.88 and 0.97, respectively. These results indicate that accounts involved in reply attacks can be detected, and the targeted accounts themselves can serve as sensors for influence operation detection.</description>

      <title>Ripple: Accelerating LLM Inference on Smartphones with Correlation-Aware Neuron Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across various domains, yet deploying them on mobile devices remains an arduous challenge due to their extensive computational and memory demands. While lightweight LLMs have been developed to fit mobile environments, they suffer from degraded model accuracy. In contrast, sparsity-based techniques minimize DRAM usage by selectively transferring only relevant neurons to DRAM while retaining the full model in external storage, such as flash. However, such approaches are critically limited by numerous I/O operations, particularly on smartphones with severe IOPS constraints.
  In this paper, we propose Ripple, a novel approach that accelerates LLM inference on smartphones by optimizing neuron placement in flash memory. Ripple leverages the concept of Neuron Co-Activation, where neurons frequently activated together are linked to facilitate continuous read access and optimize data transfer efficiency. Our approach incorporates a two-stage solution: an offline stage that reorganizes neuron placement based on co-activation patterns, and an online stage that employs tailored data access and caching strategies to align well with hardware characteristics. Evaluations conducted on a variety of smartphones and LLMs demonstrate that Ripple achieves up to 5.93x improvements in I/O latency compared to the state-of-the-art. As the first solution to optimize storage placement under sparsity, Ripple explores a new optimization space at the intersection of sparsity-driven algorithm and storage-level system co-design in LLM inference.</description>

      <title>Applying sparse autoencoders to unlearn knowledge in language models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate whether sparse autoencoders (SAEs) can be used to remove knowledge from language models. We use the biology subset of the Weapons of Mass Destruction Proxy dataset and test on the gemma-2b-it and gemma-2-2b-it language models. We demonstrate that individual interpretable biology-related SAE features can be used to unlearn biology-related knowledge with minimal side-effects. Our results suggest that negative scaling of feature activations is necessary and that zero ablating features is ineffective. We find that intervening using multiple SAE features simultaneously can unlearn multiple different topics, but with similar or larger unwanted side-effects than the existing Representation Misdirection for Unlearning technique. Current SAE quality or intervention techniques would need to improve to make SAE-based unlearning comparable to the existing fine-tuning based techniques.</description>

      <title>A Stock Price Prediction Approach Based on Time Series Decomposition and Multi-Scale CNN using OHLCT Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stock price fluctuations are influenced by a variety of factors, including macroeconomic conditions, government policies, and market sentiment, which together make price movements complex and difficult to predict. Despite many studies aimed at enhancing stock price prediction models, challenges such as data noise, model overfitting, and lack of interpretability are still encountered. To address these issues and improve prediction accuracy, this paper proposes a novel method, named Sequence-based Multiscale Fusion Regression Convolutional Neural Network (SMSFR-CNN), for predicting stock price movements in the China A-share market. By utilizing CNN to learn sequential features and combining them with image features, we improve the accuracy of stock trend prediction on the A-share market stock dataset. This approach reduces the search space for image features, stabilizes, and accelerates the training process. Extensive comparative experiments on 4,454 A-share stocks show that the proposed model achieves 61.15% for positive predictive value and 63.37% for negative predictive value of the stock price trend over the next 5 days, resulting in a total profit of 165.09%.</description>

      <title>Golden Ratio-Based Sufficient Dimension Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many machine learning applications deal with high dimensional data. To make computations feasible and learning more efficient, it is often desirable to reduce the dimensionality of the input variables by finding linear combinations of the predictors that can retain as much original information as possible in the relationship between the response and the original predictors. We propose a neural network based sufficient dimension reduction method that not only identifies the structural dimension effectively, but also estimates the central space well. It takes advantages of approximation capabilities of neural networks for functions in Barron classes and leads to reduced computation cost compared to other dimension reduction methods in the literature. Additionally, the framework can be extended to fit practical dimension reduction, making the methodology more applicable in practical settings.</description>

      <title>COAT: Compressing Optimizer states and Activation for Memory-Efficient FP8 Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: FP8 training has emerged as a promising method for improving training efficiency. Existing frameworks accelerate training by applying FP8 computation to linear layers while leaving optimizer states and activations in higher precision, which fails to fully optimize memory usage. This paper introduces COAT (Compressing Optimizer States and Activations for FP8 Training), a novel FP8 training framework designed to significantly reduce memory footprint when training large models. COAT addresses current limitations through two key innovations: (1) Dynamic Range Expansion, which aligns optimizer state distributions more closely with the FP8 representation range, thereby reducing quantization error, and (2) Mixed-Granularity Activation Quantization, which optimizes activation memory using a combination of per-tensor and per-group quantization strategies. Experiments demonstrate that COAT effectively reduces end-to-end training memory footprint by 1.54x compared to BF16 while achieving nearly lossless performance across various tasks, such as Large Language Model pretraining and fine-tuning and Vision Language Model training. COAT also achieves a 1.43x end-to-end training speedup compared to BF16, performing on par with or surpassing TransformerEngine's speedup. COAT enables efficient full-parameter training of large models on fewer GPUs, and facilitates doubling the batch size in distributed training settings, providing a practical solution for scaling large-scale model training. The code is available at https://github.com/NVlabs/COAT.</description>

      <title>Interpreting Neural Networks through Mahalanobis Distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a theoretical framework that connects neural network linear layers with the Mahalanobis distance, offering a new perspective on neural network interpretability. While previous studies have explored activation functions primarily for performance optimization, our work interprets these functions through statistical distance measures, a less explored area in neural network research. By establishing this connection, we provide a foundation for developing more interpretable neural network models, which is crucial for applications requiring transparency. Although this work is theoretical and does not include empirical data, the proposed distance-based interpretation has the potential to enhance model robustness, improve generalization, and provide more intuitive explanations of neural network decisions.</description>

      <title>FeBiM: Efficient and Compact Bayesian Inference Engine Empowered with Ferroelectric In-Memory Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In scenarios with limited training data or where explainability is crucial, conventional neural network-based machine learning models often face challenges. In contrast, Bayesian inference-based algorithms excel in providing interpretable predictions and reliable uncertainty estimation in these scenarios. While many state-of-the-art in-memory computing (IMC) architectures leverage emerging non-volatile memory (NVM) technologies to offer unparalleled computing capacity and energy efficiency for neural network workloads, their application in Bayesian inference is limited. This is because the core operations in Bayesian inference differ significantly from the multiplication-accumulation (MAC) operations common in neural networks, rendering them generally unsuitable for direct implementation in most existing IMC designs. In this paper, we propose FeBiM, an efficient and compact Bayesian inference engine powered by multi-bit ferroelectric field-effect transistor (FeFET)-based IMC. FeBiM effectively encodes the trained probabilities of a Bayesian inference model within a compact FeFET-based crossbar. It maps quantized logarithmic probabilities to discrete FeFET states. As a result, the accumulated outputs of the crossbar naturally represent the posterior probabilities, i.e., the Bayesian inference model's output given a set of observations. This approach enables efficient in-memory Bayesian inference without the need for additional calculation circuitry. As the first FeFET-based in-memory Bayesian inference engine, FeBiM achieves an impressive storage density of 26.32 Mb/mm$^{2}$ and a computing efficiency of 581.40 TOPS/W in a representative Bayesian classification task. These results demonstrate 10.7$\times$/43.4$\times$ improvement in compactness/efficiency compared to the state-of-the-art hardware implementation of Bayesian inference.</description>

      <title>BitPipe: Bidirectional Interleaved Pipeline Parallelism for Accelerating Large Models Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the increasing scale of models, the need for efficient distributed training has become increasingly urgent. Recently, many synchronous pipeline parallelism approaches have been proposed to improve training throughput. However, these approaches still suffer from two major issues, i.e., pipeline bubbles caused by periodic flushing and extra communication due to the increasing number of pipeline stages. To this end, we propose BitPipe, a bidirectional interleaved pipeline parallelism for accelerating large models training. Specifically, a hybrid scheme of fusing interleaved pipelines with bidirectional pipelines is proposed to reduce the computational time of each single micro-batch and multiply the number of devices executing simultaneously. A V-shaped schedule with eager gradient synchronization is introduced to reduce and overlap the communication between devices. Experiments conducted on up to 32 GPUs show that BitPipe improves the training throughput of GPT-style and BERT-style models by 1.05x-1.28x compared to the state-of-the-art synchronous approaches. The code of our implementation is available at https://github.com/wuhouming/BitPipe.</description>

      <title>Toward Finding Strong Pareto Optimal Policies in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the problem of finding Pareto optimal policies in multi-agent reinforcement learning problems with cooperative reward structures. We show that any algorithm where each agent only optimizes their reward is subject to suboptimal convergence. Therefore, to achieve Pareto optimality, agents have to act altruistically by considering the rewards of others. This observation bridges the multi-objective optimization framework and multi-agent reinforcement learning together. We first propose a framework for applying the Multiple Gradient Descent algorithm (MGDA) for learning in multi-agent settings. We further show that standard MGDA is subjected to weak Pareto convergence, a problem that is often overlooked in other learning settings but is prevalent in multi-agent reinforcement learning. To mitigate this issue, we propose MGDA++, an improvement of the existing algorithm to handle the weakly optimal convergence of MGDA properly. Theoretically, we prove that MGDA++ converges to strong Pareto optimal solutions in convex, smooth bi-objective problems. We further demonstrate the superiority of our MGDA++ in cooperative settings in the Gridworld benchmark. The results highlight that our proposed method can converge efficiently and outperform the other methods in terms of the optimality of the convergent policies.

Abstract: The Transformer model has demonstrated success across a wide range of domains, including in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) where the Multi-Agent Transformer (MAT) has emerged as a leading algorithm in the field. The Transformer model has demonstrated success across a wide range of domains, including in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) where the Multi-Agent Transformer (MAT) has emerged as a leading algorithm in the field. However, a significant drawback of Transformer models is their quadratic computational complexity relative to input size, making them computationally expensive when scaling to larger inputs. This limitation restricts MAT's scalability in environments with many agents. Recently, State-Space Models (SSMs) have gained attention due to their computational efficiency, but their application in MARL remains unexplored. In this work, we investigate the use of Mamba, a recent SSM, in MARL and assess whether it can match the performance of MAT while providing significant improvements in efficiency. We introduce a modified version of MAT that incorporates standard and bi-directional Mamba blocks, as well as a novel "cross-attention" Mamba block. Extensive testing shows that our Multi-Agent Mamba (MAM) matches the performance of MAT across multiple standard multi-agent environments, while offering superior scalability to larger agent scenarios. This is significant for the MARL community, because it indicates that SSMs could replace Transformers without compromising performance, whilst also supporting more effective scaling to higher numbers of agents.

      <title>Analysis of Financial Risk Behavior Prediction Using Deep Learning and Big Data Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the complexity and dynamism of financial markets continue to grow, traditional financial risk prediction methods increasingly struggle to handle large datasets and intricate behavior patterns. This paper explores the feasibility and effectiveness of using deep learning and big data algorithms for financial risk behavior prediction. First, the application and advantages of deep learning and big data algorithms in the financial field are analyzed. Then, a deep learning-based big data risk prediction framework is designed and experimentally validated on actual financial datasets. The experimental results show that this method significantly improves the accuracy of financial risk behavior prediction and provides valuable support for risk management in financial institutions. Challenges in the application of deep learning are also discussed, along with potential directions for future research.</description>

      <title>Offline Reinforcement Learning with OOD State Correction and OOD Action Suppression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In offline reinforcement learning (RL), addressing the out-of-distribution (OOD) action issue has been a focus, but we argue that there exists an OOD state issue that also impairs performance yet has been underexplored. Such an issue describes the scenario when the agent encounters states out of the offline dataset during the test phase, leading to uncontrolled behavior and performance degradation. To this end, we propose SCAS, a simple yet effective approach that unifies OOD state correction and OOD action suppression in offline RL. Technically, SCAS achieves value-aware OOD state correction, capable of correcting the agent from OOD states to high-value in-distribution states. Theoretical and empirical results show that SCAS also exhibits the effect of suppressing OOD actions. On standard offline RL benchmarks, SCAS achieves excellent performance without additional hyperparameter tuning. Moreover, benefiting from its OOD state correction feature, SCAS demonstrates enhanced robustness against environmental perturbations.</description>

      <title>An Auditing Test To Detect Behavioral Shift in Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As language models (LMs) approach human-level performance, a comprehensive understanding of their behavior becomes crucial. This includes evaluating capabilities, biases, task performance, and alignment with societal values. Extensive initial evaluations, including red teaming and diverse benchmarking, can establish a model's behavioral profile. However, subsequent fine-tuning or deployment modifications may alter these behaviors in unintended ways. We present a method for continual Behavioral Shift Auditing (BSA) in LMs. Building on recent work in hypothesis testing, our auditing test detects behavioral shifts solely through model generations. Our test compares model generations from a baseline model to those of the model under scrutiny and provides theoretical guarantees for change detection while controlling false positives. The test features a configurable tolerance parameter that adjusts sensitivity to behavioral changes for different use cases. We evaluate our approach using two case studies: monitoring changes in (a) toxicity and (b) translation performance. We find that the test is able to detect meaningful changes in behavior distributions using just hundreds of examples.</description>

      <title>Robust Time Series Causal Discovery for Agent-Based Model Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Agent-Based Model (ABM) validation is crucial as it helps ensuring the reliability of simulations, and causal discovery has become a powerful tool in this context. However, current causal discovery methods often face accuracy and robustness challenges when applied to complex and noisy time series data, which is typical in ABM scenarios. This study addresses these issues by proposing a Robust Cross-Validation (RCV) approach to enhance causal structure learning for ABM validation. We develop RCV-VarLiNGAM and RCV-PCMCI, novel extensions of two prominent causal discovery algorithms. These aim to reduce the impact of noise better and give more reliable causal relation results, even with high-dimensional, time-dependent data. The proposed approach is then integrated into an enhanced ABM validation framework, which is designed to handle diverse data and model structures.
  The approach is evaluated using synthetic datasets and a complex simulated fMRI dataset. The results demonstrate greater reliability in causal structure identification. The study examines how various characteristics of datasets affect the performance of established causal discovery methods. These characteristics include linearity, noise distribution, stationarity, and causal structure density. This analysis is then extended to the RCV method to see how it compares in these different situations. This examination helps confirm whether the results are consistent with existing literature and also reveals the strengths and weaknesses of the novel approaches.
  By tackling key methodological challenges, the study aims to enhance ABM validation with a more resilient valuation framework presented. These improvements increase the reliability of model-driven decision making processes in complex systems analysis.</description>

      <title>Analyzing Generative Models by Manifold Entropic Metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Good generative models should not only synthesize high quality data, but also utilize interpretable representations that aid human understanding of their behavior. However, it is difficult to measure objectively if and to what degree desirable properties of disentangled representations have been achieved. Inspired by the principle of independent mechanisms, we address this difficulty by introducing a novel set of tractable information-theoretic evaluation metrics. We demonstrate the usefulness of our metrics on illustrative toy examples and conduct an in-depth comparison of various normalizing flow architectures and $\beta$-VAEs on the EMNIST dataset. Our method allows to sort latent features by importance and assess the amount of residual correlations of the resulting concepts. The most interesting finding of our experiments is a ranking of model architectures and training procedures in terms of their inductive bias to converge to aligned and disentangled representations during training.</description>

      <title>Generative Diffusion Models for Sequential Recommendations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative models such as Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have shown promise in sequential recommendation tasks. However, they face challenges, including posterior collapse and limited representation capacity. The work by Li et al. (2023) introduces a novel approach that leverages diffusion models to address these challenges by representing item embeddings as distributions rather than fixed vectors. This approach allows for a more adaptive reflection of users' diverse interests and various item aspects. During the diffusion phase, the model converts the target item embedding into a Gaussian distribution by adding noise, facilitating the representation of sequential item distributions and the injection of uncertainty. An Approximator then processes this noisy item representation to reconstruct the target item. In the reverse phase, the model utilizes users' past interactions to reverse the noise and finalize the item prediction through a rounding operation. This research introduces enhancements to the DiffuRec architecture, particularly by adding offset noise in the diffusion process to improve robustness and incorporating a cross-attention mechanism in the Approximator to better capture relevant user-item interactions. These contributions led to the development of a new model, DiffuRecSys, which improves performance. Extensive experiments conducted on three public benchmark datasets demonstrate that these modifications enhance item representation, effectively capture diverse user preferences, and outperform existing baselines in sequential recommendation research.</description>

      <title>Gradient Descent Efficiency Index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gradient descent is a widely used iterative algorithm for finding local minima in multivariate functions. However, the final iterations often either overshoot the minima or make minimal progress, making it challenging to determine an optimal stopping point. This study introduces a new efficiency metric, Ek, designed to quantify the effectiveness of each iteration. The proposed metric accounts for both the relative change in error and the stability of the loss function across iterations. This measure is particularly valuable in resource-constrained environments, where costs are closely tied to training time. Experimental validation across multiple datasets and models demonstrates that Ek provides valuable insights into the convergence behavior of gradient descent, complementing traditional performance metrics. The index has the potential to guide more informed decisions in the selection and tuning of optimization algorithms in machine learning applications and be used to compare the "effectiveness" of models relative to each other.</description>

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) dominate the AI landscape, Small-scale large Language Models (SLMs) are gaining attention due to cost and efficiency demands from consumers. However, there is limited research on the training behavior and computational requirements of SLMs. In this study, we explore the computational bottlenecks of training SLMs (up to 2B parameters) by examining the effects of various hyperparameters and configurations, including GPU type, batch size, model size, communication protocol, attention type, and the number of GPUs. We assess these factors on popular cloud services using metrics such as loss per dollar and tokens per second. Our findings aim to support the broader adoption and optimization of language model training for low-resource AI research institutes.</description>

Abstract: We present a novel approach for accelerating AI performance by leveraging Anderson extrapolation, a vector-to-vector mapping technique based on a window of historical iterations. By identifying the crossover point where a mixing penalty is incurred, the method focuses on reducing iterations to convergence, with fewer more compute-intensive but generally cacheable iterations, balancing speed and memory usage with accuracy and algorithmic stability, respectively. We demonstrate significant improvements, in both training and inference, motivated by scalability and efficiency extensions to the realm of high-performance computing (HPC).</description>

      <title>LOCAL: Learning with Orientation Matrix to Infer Causal Structure from Time Series Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discovering the underlying Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) from time series observational data is highly challenging due to the dynamic nature and complex nonlinear interactions between variables. Existing methods often struggle with inefficiency and the handling of high-dimensional data. To address these research gap, we propose LOCAL, a highly efficient, easy-to-implement, and constraint-free method for recovering dynamic causal structures. LOCAL is the first attempt to formulate a quasi-maximum likelihood-based score function for learning the dynamic DAG equivalent to the ground truth. On this basis, we propose two adaptive modules for enhancing the algebraic characterization of acyclicity with new capabilities: Asymptotic Causal Mask Learning (ACML) and Dynamic Graph Parameter Learning (DGPL). ACML generates causal masks using learnable priority vectors and the Gumbel-Sigmoid function, ensuring the creation of DAGs while optimizing computational efficiency. DGPL transforms causal learning into decomposed matrix products, capturing the dynamic causal structure of high-dimensional data and enhancing interpretability. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that LOCAL significantly outperforms existing methods, and highlight LOCAL's potential as a robust and efficient method for dynamic causal discovery. Our code will be available soon.</description>

      <title>Improving Inverse Folding for Peptide Design with Diversity-regularized Direct Preference Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inverse folding models play an important role in structure-based design by predicting amino acid sequences that fold into desired reference structures. Models like ProteinMPNN, a message-passing encoder-decoder model, are trained to reliably produce new sequences from a reference structure. However, when applied to peptides, these models are prone to generating repetitive sequences that do not fold into the reference structure. To address this, we fine-tune ProteinMPNN to produce diverse and structurally consistent peptide sequences via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). We derive two enhancements to DPO: online diversity regularization and domain-specific priors. Additionally, we develop a new understanding on improving diversity in decoder models. When conditioned on OpenFold generated structures, our fine-tuned models achieve state-of-the-art structural similarity scores, improving base ProteinMPNN by at least 8%. Compared to standard DPO, our regularized method achieves up to 20% higher sequence diversity with no loss in structural similarity score.</description>

Current methods to measure memorization rates of LLMs, primarily discoverable extraction (Carlini et al., 2022), rely on single-sequence greedy sampling, potentially underestimating the true extent of memorization. This paper introduces a probabilistic relaxation of discoverable extraction that quantifies the probability of extracting a target sequence within a set of generated samples, considering various sampling schemes and multiple attempts. This approach addresses the limitations of reporting memorization rates through discoverable extraction by accounting for the probabilistic nature of LLMs and user interaction patterns. Our experiments demonstrate that this probabilistic measure can reveal cases of higher memorization rates compared to rates found through discoverable extraction. We further investigate the impact of different sampling schemes on extractability, providing a more comprehensive and realistic assessment of LLM memorization and its associated risks. Our contributions include a new probabilistic memorization definition, empirical evidence of its effectiveness, and a thorough evaluation across different models, sizes, sampling schemes, and training data repetitions.</description>

      <title>TRADE: Transfer of Distributions between External Conditions with Normalizing Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling distributions that depend on external control parameters is a common scenario in diverse applications like molecular simulations, where system properties like temperature affect molecular configurations. Despite the relevance of these applications, existing solutions are unsatisfactory as they require severely restricted model architectures or rely on backward training, which is prone to unstable training. We introduce TRADE, which overcomes these limitations by formulating the learning process as a boundary value problem. By initially training the model for a specific condition using either i.i.d. samples or backward KL training, we establish a boundary distribution. We then propagate this information across other conditions using the gradient of the unnormalized density with respect to the external parameter. This formulation, akin to the principles of physics-informed neural networks, allows us to efficiently learn parameter-dependent distributions without restrictive assumptions. Experimentally, we demonstrate that TRADE achieves excellent results in a wide range of applications, ranging from Bayesian inference and molecular simulations to physical lattice models.</description>

      <title>A neural network approach for solving the Monge-Amp\`ere equation with transport boundary condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel neural network-based approach to solving the Monge-Amp\`ere equation with the transport boundary condition, specifically targeted towards optical design applications. We leverage multilayer perceptron networks to learn approximate solutions by minimizing a loss function that encompasses the equation's residual, boundary conditions, and convexity constraints. Our main results demonstrate the efficacy of this method, optimized using L-BFGS, through a series of test cases encompassing symmetric and asymmetric circle-to-circle, square-to-circle, and circle-to-flower reflector mapping problems. Comparative analysis with a conventional least-squares finite-difference solver reveals the competitive, and often superior, performance of our neural network approach on the test cases examined here. A comprehensive hyperparameter study further illuminates the impact of factors such as sampling density, network architecture, and optimization algorithm. While promising, further investigation is needed to verify the method's robustness for more complicated problems and to ensure consistent convergence. Nonetheless, the simplicity and adaptability of this neural network-based approach position it as a compelling alternative to specialized partial differential equation solvers.</description>

      <title>DMT-HI: MOE-based Hyperbolic Interpretable Deep Manifold Transformation for Unspervised Dimensionality Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dimensionality reduction (DR) plays a crucial role in various fields, including data engineering and visualization, by simplifying complex datasets while retaining essential information. However, the challenge of balancing DR accuracy and interpretability remains crucial, particularly for users dealing with high-dimensional data. Traditional DR methods often face a trade-off between precision and transparency, where optimizing for performance can lead to reduced interpretability, and vice versa. This limitation is especially prominent in real-world applications such as image, tabular, and text data analysis, where both accuracy and interpretability are critical. To address these challenges, this work introduces the MOE-based Hyperbolic Interpretable Deep Manifold Transformation (DMT-HI). The proposed approach combines hyperbolic embeddings, which effectively capture complex hierarchical structures, with Mixture of Experts (MOE) models, which dynamically allocate tasks based on input features. DMT-HI enhances DR accuracy by leveraging hyperbolic embeddings to represent the hierarchical nature of data, while also improving interpretability by explicitly linking input data, embedding outcomes, and key features through the MOE structure. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DMT-HI consistently achieves superior performance in both DR accuracy and model interpretability, making it a robust solution for complex data analysis.

      <title>Marked Temporal Bayesian Flow Point Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Marked event data captures events by recording their continuous-valued occurrence timestamps along with their corresponding discrete-valued types. They have appeared in various real-world scenarios such as social media, financial transactions, and healthcare records, and have been effectively modeled through Marked Temporal Point Process (MTPP) models. Recently, developing generative models for these MTPP models have seen rapid development due to their powerful generative capability and less restrictive functional forms. However, existing generative MTPP models are usually challenged in jointly modeling events' timestamps and types since: (1) mainstream methods design the generative mechanisms for timestamps only and do not include event types; (2) the complex interdependence between the timestamps and event types are overlooked. In this paper, we propose a novel generative MTPP model called BMTPP. Unlike existing generative MTPP models, BMTPP flexibly models marked temporal joint distributions using a parameter-based approach. Additionally, by adding joint noise to the marked temporal data space, BMTPP effectively captures and explicitly reveals the interdependence between timestamps and event types. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of our approach over other state-of-the-art models and its ability to effectively capture marked-temporal interdependence.</description>

      <title>AgentForge: A Flexible Low-Code Platform for Reinforcement Learning Agent Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developing a reinforcement learning (RL) agent often involves identifying effective values for a large number of parameters, covering the policy, reward function, environment, and the agent's internal architecture, such as parameters controlling how the peripheral vision and memory modules work. Critically, since these parameters are interrelated in complex ways, optimizing them can be viewed as a black box optimization problem, which is especially challenging for non-experts. Although existing optimization-as-a-service platforms (e.g., Vizier, Optuna) can handle such problems, they are impractical for RL systems, as users must manually map each parameter to different components, making the process cumbersome and error-prone. They also require deep understanding of the optimization process, limiting their application outside ML experts and restricting access for fields like cognitive science, which models human decision-making. To tackle these challenges, we present AgentForge, a flexible low-code framework to optimize any parameter set across an RL system. AgentForge allows the user to perform individual or joint optimization of parameter sets. An optimization problem can be defined in a few lines of code and handed to any of the interfaced optimizers. We evaluated its performance in a challenging vision-based RL problem. AgentForge enables practitioners to develop RL agents without requiring extensive coding or deep expertise in optimization.</description>

      <title>Utilizing Image Transforms and Diffusion Models for Generative Modeling of Short and Long Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lately, there has been a surge in interest surrounding generative modeling of time series data. Most existing approaches are designed either to process short sequences or to handle long-range sequences. This dichotomy can be attributed to gradient issues with recurrent networks, computational costs associated with transformers, and limited expressiveness of state space models. Towards a unified generative model for varying-length time series, we propose in this work to transform sequences into images. By employing invertible transforms such as the delay embedding and the short-time Fourier transform, we unlock three main advantages: i) We can exploit advanced diffusion vision models; ii) We can remarkably process short- and long-range inputs within the same framework; and iii) We can harness recent and established tools proposed in the time series to image literature. We validate the effectiveness of our method through a comprehensive evaluation across multiple tasks, including unconditional generation, interpolation, and extrapolation. We show that our approach achieves consistently state-of-the-art results against strong baselines. In the unconditional generation tasks, we show remarkable mean improvements of 58.17% over previous diffusion models in the short discriminative score and 132.61% in the (ultra-)long classification scores.

      <title>FLiP: Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning based on the Principle of Least Privileg</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) allows users to share knowledge instead of raw data to train a model with high accuracy. Unfortunately, during the training, users lose control over the knowledge shared, which causes serious data privacy issues. We hold that users are only willing and need to share the essential knowledge to the training task to obtain the FL model with high accuracy. However, existing efforts cannot help users minimize the shared knowledge according to the user intention in the FL training procedure. This work proposes FLiP, which aims to bring the principle of least privilege (PoLP) to FL training. The key design of FLiP is applying elaborate information reduction on the training data through a local-global dataset distillation design. We measure the privacy performance through attribute inference and membership inference attacks. Extensive experiments show that FLiP strikes a good balance between model accuracy and privacy protection.</description>

      <title>Neuromorphic IoT Architecture for Efficient Water Management: A Smart Village Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exponential growth of IoT networks necessitates a paradigm shift towards architectures that offer high flexibility and learning capabilities while maintaining low energy consumption, minimal communication overhead, and low latency. Traditional IoT systems, particularly when integrated with machine learning approaches, often suffer from high communication overhead and significant energy consumption. This work addresses these challenges by proposing a neuromorphic architecture inspired by biological systems. To illustrate the practical application of our proposed architecture, we present a case study focusing on water management in the Carinthian community of Neuhaus. Preliminary results regarding water consumption prediction and anomaly detection in this community are presented. We also introduce a novel neuromorphic IoT architecture that integrates biological principles into the design of IoT systems. This architecture is specifically tailored for edge computing scenarios, where low power and high efficiency are crucial. Our approach leverages the inherent advantages of neuromorphic computing, such as asynchronous processing and event-driven communication, to create an IoT framework that is both energy-efficient and responsive. This case study demonstrates how the neuromorphic IoT architecture can be deployed in a real-world scenario, highlighting its benefits in terms of energy savings, reduced communication overhead, and improved system responsiveness.</description>

      <title>Analyzing Neural Network Robustness Using Graph Curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a new look at the neural network (NN) robustness problem, from the point of view of graph theory analysis, specifically graph curvature. Graph curvature (e.g., Ricci curvature) has been used to analyze system dynamics and identify bottlenecks in many domains, including road traffic analysis and internet routing. We define the notion of neural Ricci curvature and use it to identify bottleneck NN edges that are heavily used to ``transport data" to the NN outputs. We provide an evaluation on MNIST that illustrates that such edges indeed occur more frequently for inputs where NNs are less robust. These results will serve as the basis for an alternative method of robust training, by minimizing the number of bottleneck edges.</description>

      <title>Efficient Biological Data Acquisition through Inference Set Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In drug discovery, highly automated high-throughput laboratories are used to screen a large number of compounds in search of effective drugs. These experiments are expensive, so we might hope to reduce their cost by experimenting on a subset of the compounds, and predicting the outcomes of the remaining experiments. In this work, we model this scenario as a sequential subset selection problem: we aim to select the smallest set of candidates in order to achieve some desired level of accuracy for the system as a whole. Our key observation is that, if there is heterogeneity in the difficulty of the prediction problem across the input space, selectively obtaining the labels for the hardest examples in the acquisition pool will leave only the relatively easy examples to remain in the inference set, leading to better overall system performance. We call this mechanism inference set design, and propose the use of an uncertainty-based active learning solution to prune out these challenging examples. Our algorithm includes an explicit stopping criterion that stops running the experiments when it is sufficiently confident that the system has reached the target performance. Our empirical studies on image and molecular datasets, as well as a real-world large-scale biological assay, show that deploying active learning for inference set design leads to significant reduction in experimental cost while obtaining high system performance.</description>

      <title>Impact of Leakage on Data Harmonization in Machine Learning Pipelines in Class Imbalance Across Sites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models benefit from large datasets. Collecting data in biomedical domains is costly and challenging, hence, combining datasets has become a common practice. However, datasets obtained under different conditions could present undesired site-specific variability. Data harmonization methods aim to remove site-specific variance while retaining biologically relevant information. This study evaluates the effectiveness of popularly used ComBat-based methods for harmonizing data in scenarios where the class balance is not equal across sites. We find that these methods struggle with data leakage issues. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel approach PrettYharmonize, designed to harmonize data by pretending the target labels. We validate our approach using controlled datasets designed to benchmark the utility of harmonization. Finally, using real-world MRI and clinical data, we compare leakage-prone methods with PrettYharmonize and show that it achieves comparable performance while avoiding data leakage, particularly in site-target-dependence scenarios.</description>

      <title>Deep learning-based identification of patients at increased risk of cancer using routine laboratory markers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Early screening for cancer has proven to improve the survival rate and spare patients from intensive and costly treatments due to late diagnosis. Cancer screening in the healthy population involves an initial risk stratification step to determine the screening method and frequency, primarily to optimize resource allocation by targeting screening towards individuals who draw most benefit. For most screening programs, age and clinical risk factors such as family history are part of the initial risk stratification algorithm. In this paper, we focus on developing a blood marker-based risk stratification approach, which could be used to identify patients with elevated cancer risk to be encouraged for taking a diagnostic test or participate in a screening program. We demonstrate that the combination of simple, widely available blood tests, such as complete blood count and complete metabolic panel, could potentially be used to identify patients at risk for colorectal, liver, and lung cancers with areas under the ROC curve of 0.76, 0.85, 0.78, respectively. Furthermore, we hypothesize that such an approach could not only be used as pre-screening risk assessment for individuals but also as population health management tool, for example to better interrogate the cancer risk in certain sub-populations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces multimodal conformal regression. Traditionally confined to scenarios with solely numerical input features, conformal prediction is now extended to multimodal contexts through our methodology, which harnesses internal features from complex neural network architectures processing images and unstructured text. Our findings highlight the potential for internal neural network features, extracted from convergence points where multimodal information is combined, to be used by conformal prediction to construct prediction intervals (PIs). This capability paves new paths for deploying conformal prediction in domains abundant with multimodal data, enabling a broader range of problems to benefit from guaranteed distribution-free uncertainty quantification.</description>

      <title>MetaTrading: An Immersion-Aware Model Trading Framework for Vehicular Metaverse Services</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Updates of extensive Internet of Things (IoT) data are critical to the immersion of vehicular metaverse services. However, providing high-quality and sustainable data in unstable and resource-constrained vehicular networks remains a significant challenge. To address this problem, we put forth a novel immersion-aware model trading framework that incentivizes metaverse users (MUs) to contribute learning models trained by their latest local data for augmented reality (AR) services in the vehicular metaverse, while preserving their privacy through federated learning. To comprehensively evaluate the contribution of locally trained learning models provided by MUs to AR services, we design a new immersion metric that captures service immersion by considering the freshness and accuracy of learning models, as well as the amount and potential value of raw data used for training. We model the trading interactions between metaverse service providers (MSPs) and MUs as an equilibrium problem with equilibrium constraints (EPEC) to analyze and balance their costs and gains. Moreover, considering dynamic network conditions and privacy concerns, we formulate the reward decisions of MSPs as a multi-agent Markov decision process. Then, a fully distributed dynamic reward method based on deep reinforcement learning is presented, which operates without any private information about MUs and other MSPs. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework can effectively provide higher-value models for object detection and classification in AR services on real AR-related vehicle datasets compared to benchmark schemes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We incorporate prior graph topology information into a Neural Controlled Differential Equation (NCDE) to predict the future states of a dynamical system defined on a graph. The informed NCDE infers the future dynamics at the vertices of simulated advection data on graph edges with a known causal graph, observed only at vertices during training. We investigate different positions in the model architecture to inform the NCDE with graph information and identify an outer position between hidden state and control as theoretically and empirically favorable. Our such informed NCDE requires fewer parameters to reach a lower Mean Absolute Error (MAE) compared to previous methods that do not incorporate additional graph topology information.</description>

      <title>Learning the Regularization Strength for Deep Fine-Tuning via a Data-Emphasized Variational Objective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A number of popular transfer learning methods rely on grid search to select regularization hyperparameters that control over-fitting. This grid search requirement has several key disadvantages: the search is computationally expensive, requires carving out a validation set that reduces the size of available data for model training, and requires practitioners to specify candidate values. In this paper, we propose an alternative to grid search: directly learning regularization hyperparameters on the full training set via model selection techniques based on the evidence lower bound ("ELBo") objective from variational methods. For deep neural networks with millions of parameters, we specifically recommend a modified ELBo that upweights the influence of the data likelihood relative to the prior while remaining a valid bound on the evidence for Bayesian model selection. Our proposed technique overcomes all three disadvantages of grid search. We demonstrate effectiveness on image classification tasks on several datasets, yielding heldout accuracy comparable to existing approaches with far less compute time.</description>

      <title>Robust Thompson Sampling Algorithms Against Reward Poisoning Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thompson sampling is one of the most popular learning algorithms for online sequential decision-making problems and has rich real-world applications. However, current Thompson sampling algorithms are limited by the assumption that the rewards received are uncorrupted, which may not be true in real-world applications where adversarial reward poisoning exists. To make Thompson sampling more reliable, we want to make it robust against adversarial reward poisoning. The main challenge is that one can no longer compute the actual posteriors for the true reward, as the agent can only observe the rewards after corruption. In this work, we solve this problem by computing pseudo-posteriors that are less likely to be manipulated by the attack. We propose robust algorithms based on Thompson sampling for the popular stochastic and contextual linear bandit settings in both cases where the agent is aware or unaware of the budget of the attacker. We theoretically show that our algorithms guarantee near-optimal regret under any attack strategy.</description>

      <title>Super Gradient Descent: Global Optimization requires Global Gradient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Global minimization is a fundamental challenge in optimization, especially in machine learning, where finding the global minimum of a function directly impacts model performance and convergence. This report introduces a novel optimization method that we called Super Gradient Descent, designed specifically for one-dimensional functions, guaranteeing convergence to the global minimum for any k-Lipschitz function defined on a closed interval [a, b]. Our approach addresses the limitations of traditional optimization algorithms, which often get trapped in local minima. In particular, we introduce the concept of global gradient which offers a robust solution for precise and well-guided global optimization. By focusing on the global minimization problem, this work bridges a critical gap in optimization theory, offering new insights and practical advancements in different optimization problems in particular Machine Learning problems like line search.</description>

      <title>Water and Electricity Consumption Forecasting at an Educational Institution using Machine Learning models with Metaheuristic Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Educational institutions are essential for economic and social development. Budget cuts in Brazil in recent years have made it difficult to carry out their activities and projects. In the case of expenses with water and electricity, unexpected situations can occur, such as leaks and equipment failures, which make their management challenging. This study proposes a comparison between two machine learning models, Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Regression (SVR), for water and electricity consumption forecasting at the Federal Institute of Paran\'a-Campus Palmas, with a 12-month forecasting horizon, as well as evaluating the influence of the application of climatic variables as exogenous features. The data were collected over the past five years, combining details pertaining to invoices with exogenous and endogenous variables. The two models had their hyperpa-rameters optimized using the Genetic Algorithm (GA) to select the individuals with the best fitness to perform the forecasting with and without climatic variables. The absolute percentage errors and root mean squared error were used as performance measures to evaluate the forecasting accuracy. The results suggest that in forecasting water and electricity consumption over a 12-step horizon, the Random Forest model exhibited the most superior performance. The integration of climatic variables often led to diminished forecasting accuracy, resulting in higher errors. Both models still had certain difficulties in predicting water consumption, indicating that new studies with different models or variables are welcome.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Environment Design via Regret-Guided Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Training agents that are robust to environmental changes remains a significant challenge in deep reinforcement learning (RL). Unsupervised environment design (UED) has recently emerged to address this issue by generating a set of training environments tailored to the agent's capabilities. While prior works demonstrate that UED has the potential to learn a robust policy, their performance is constrained by the capabilities of the environment generation. To this end, we propose a novel UED algorithm, adversarial environment design via regret-guided diffusion models (ADD). The proposed method guides the diffusion-based environment generator with the regret of the agent to produce environments that the agent finds challenging but conducive to further improvement. By exploiting the representation power of diffusion models, ADD can directly generate adversarial environments while maintaining the diversity of training environments, enabling the agent to effectively learn a robust policy. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method successfully generates an instructive curriculum of environments, outperforming UED baselines in zero-shot generalization across novel, out-of-distribution environments.

      <title>Sparse Decomposition of Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNN) exhibit superior performance in graph representation learning, but their inference cost can be high, due to an aggregation operation that can require a memory fetch for a very large number of nodes. This inference cost is the major obstacle to deploying GNN models with \emph{online prediction} to reflect the potentially dynamic node features. To address this, we propose an approach to reduce the number of nodes that are included during aggregation. We achieve this through a sparse decomposition, learning to approximate node representations using a weighted sum of linearly transformed features of a carefully selected subset of nodes within the extended neighbourhood. The approach achieves linear complexity with respect to the average node degree and the number of layers in the graph neural network. We introduce an algorithm to compute the optimal parameters for the sparse decomposition, ensuring an accurate approximation of the original GNN model, and present effective strategies to reduce the training time and improve the learning process. We demonstrate via extensive experiments that our method outperforms other baselines designed for inference speedup, achieving significant accuracy gains with comparable inference times for both node classification and spatio-temporal forecasting tasks.</description>

      <title>Scaling Law with Learning Rate Annealing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11029v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We find that the cross-entropy loss curves of neural language models empirically adhere to a scaling law with learning rate (LR) annealing over training steps: $$L(s) = L_0 + A\cdot S_1^{-\alpha} - C\cdot S_2,$$ where $L(s)$ is the validation loss at step $s$, $S_1$ is the area under the LR curve, $S_2$ is the LR annealing area, and $L_0$, $A$, $C$, $\alpha$ are constant parameters. This formulation takes into account two factors: (1) power-law scaling over data size, and (2) the additional loss reduction during LR annealing. Therefore, this formulation can describe the full loss curve at each step, rather than the single loss point at the end of training. Applying the scaling law with LR annealing and fitting only one or two training curves, we can accurately predict the loss at any given step across any learning rate scheduler (LRS). This approach significantly reduces computational cost in formulating scaling laws while providing more accuracy and expressiveness for training dynamics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our findings hold across a range of hyper-parameters and model architectures, and our equation can extend to scaling effect of model sizes. Moreover, our formulation provides accurate theoretical verification and explanation for empirical results observed in numerous previous studies, particularly those focusing on LR schedule and annealing. We believe that this work is promising to enhance the understanding of LLM training dynamics while greatly democratizing scaling laws, and it can guide researchers in refining training strategies (e.g. critical LRS) for further LLMs.</description>

      <title>rECGnition_v1.0: Arrhythmia detection using cardiologist-inspired multi-modal architecture incorporating demographic attributes in ECG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A substantial amount of variability in ECG manifested due to patient characteristics hinders the adoption of automated analysis algorithms in clinical practice. None of the ECG annotators developed till date consider the characteristics of the patients in a multi-modal architecture. We employed the XGBoost model to analyze the UCI Arrhythmia dataset, linking patient characteristics to ECG morphological changes. The model accurately classified patient gender using discriminative ECG features with 87.75% confidence. We propose a novel multi-modal methodology for ECG analysis and arrhythmia classification that can help defy the variability in ECG related to patient-specific conditions. This deep learning algorithm, named rECGnition_v1.0 (robust ECG abnormality detection Version 1), fuses Beat Morphology with Patient Characteristics to create a discriminative feature map that understands the internal correlation between both modalities. A Squeeze and Excitation based Patient characteristic Encoding Network (SEPcEnet) has been introduced, considering the patient's demographics. The trained model outperformed the various existing algorithms by achieving the overall F1-score of 0.986 for the ten arrhythmia class classification in the MITDB and achieved near perfect prediction scores of ~0.99 for LBBB, RBBB, Premature ventricular contraction beat, Atrial premature beat and Paced beat. Subsequently, the methodology was validated across INCARTDB, EDB and different class groups of MITDB using transfer learning. The generalizability test provided F1-scores of 0.980, 0.946, 0.977, and 0.980 for INCARTDB, EDB, MITDB AAMI, and MITDB Normal vs. Abnormal Classification, respectively. Therefore, with a more enhanced and comprehensive understanding of the patient being examined and their ECG for diverse CVD manifestations, the proposed rECGnition_v1.0 algorithm paves the way for its deployment in clinics.</description>

      <title>VehicleSDF: A 3D generative model for constrained engineering design via surrogate modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A main challenge in mechanical design is to efficiently explore the design space while satisfying engineering constraints. This work explores the use of 3D generative models to explore the design space in the context of vehicle development, while estimating and enforcing engineering constraints. Specifically, we generate diverse 3D models of cars that meet a given set of geometric specifications, while also obtaining quick estimates of performance parameters such as aerodynamic drag. For this, we employ a data-driven approach (using the ShapeNet dataset) to train VehicleSDF, a DeepSDF based model that represents potential designs in a latent space witch can be decoded into a 3D model. We then train surrogate models to estimate engineering parameters from this latent space representation, enabling us to efficiently optimize latent vectors to match specifications. Our experiments show that we can generate diverse 3D models while matching the specified geometric parameters. Finally, we demonstrate that other performance parameters such as aerodynamic drag can be estimated in a differentiable pipeline.</description>

Abstract: The Euler Characteristic Transform (ECT) is a powerful invariant for assessing geometrical and topological characteristics of a large variety of objects, including graphs and embedded simplicial complexes. Although the ECT is invertible in theory, no explicit algorithm for general data sets exists. In this paper, we address this lack and demonstrate that it is possible to learn the inversion, permitting us to develop a novel framework for shape generation tasks on point clouds. Our model exhibits high quality in reconstruction and generation tasks, affords efficient latent-space interpolation, and is orders of magnitude faster than existing methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Fokker-Planck equation can be reformulated as a continuity equation, which naturally suggests using the associated velocity field in particle flow methods. While the resulting probability flow ODE offers appealing properties - such as defining a gradient flow of the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the current and target densities with respect to the 2-Wasserstein distance - it relies on evaluating the current probability density, which is intractable in most practical applications. By closely examining the drawbacks of approximating this density via kernel density estimation, we uncover opportunities to turn these limitations into advantages in contexts such as variational inference, kernel mean embeddings, and sequential Monte Carlo.</description>

      <title>Privacy-Computation trade-offs in Private Repetition and Metaselection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A Private Repetition algorithm takes as input a differentially private algorithm with constant success probability and boosts it to one that succeeds with high probability. These algorithms are closely related to private metaselection algorithms that compete with the best of many private algorithms, and private hyperparameter tuning algorithms that compete with the best hyperparameter settings for a private learning algorithm. Existing algorithms for these tasks pay either a large overhead in privacy cost, or a large overhead in computational cost. In this work, we show strong lower bounds for problems of this kind, showing in particular that for any algorithm that preserves the privacy cost up to a constant factor, the failure probability can only fall polynomially in the computational overhead. This is in stark contrast with the non-private setting, where the failure probability falls exponentially in the computational overhead. By carefully combining existing algorithms for metaselection, we prove computation-privacy tradeoffs that nearly match our lower bounds.</description>

      <title>Less Discriminatory Alternative and Interpretable XGBoost Framework for Binary Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fair lending practices and model interpretability are crucial concerns in the financial industry, especially given the increasing use of complex machine learning models. In response to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's (CFPB) requirement to protect consumers against unlawful discrimination, we introduce LDA-XGB1, a novel less discriminatory alternative (LDA) machine learning model for fair and interpretable binary classification. LDA-XGB1 is developed through biobjective optimization that balances accuracy and fairness, with both objectives formulated using binning and information value. It leverages the predictive power and computational efficiency of XGBoost while ensuring inherent model interpretability, including the enforcement of monotonic constraints. We evaluate LDA-XGB1 on two datasets: SimuCredit, a simulated credit approval dataset, and COMPAS, a real-world recidivism prediction dataset. Our results demonstrate that LDA-XGB1 achieves an effective balance between predictive accuracy, fairness, and interpretability, often outperforming traditional fair lending models. This approach equips financial institutions with a powerful tool to meet regulatory requirements for fair lending while maintaining the advantages of advanced machine learning techniques.</description>

      <title>A Generalized Framework for Multiscale State-Space Modeling with Nested Nonlinear Dynamics: An Application to Bayesian Learning under Switching Regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce a generalized framework for multiscale state-space modeling that incorporates nested nonlinear dynamics, with a specific focus on Bayesian learning under switching regimes. Our framework captures the complex interactions between fast and slow processes within systems, allowing for the analysis of how these dynamics influence each other across various temporal scales. We model these interactions through a hierarchical structure in which finer time-scale dynamics are nested within coarser ones, while facilitating feedback between the scales. To promote the practical application of our framework, we address the problem of identifying switching regimes and transient dynamics. In particular, we develop a Bayesian learning approach to estimate latent states and indicators corresponding to switching dynamics, enabling the model to adapt effectively to regime changes. We employ Sequential Monte Carlo, or particle filtering, for inference. We illustrate the utility of our framework through simulations. The results demonstrate that our Bayesian learning approach effectively tracks state transitions and achieves accurate identification of switching dynamics in multiscale systems.</description>

      <title>BIFR\"OST: 3D-Aware Image compositing with Language Instructions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces Bifr\"ost, a novel 3D-aware framework that is built upon diffusion models to perform instruction-based image composition. Previous methods concentrate on image compositing at the 2D level, which fall short in handling complex spatial relationships ($\textit{e.g.}$, occlusion). Bifr\"ost addresses these issues by training MLLM as a 2.5D location predictor and integrating depth maps as an extra condition during the generation process to bridge the gap between 2D and 3D, which enhances spatial comprehension and supports sophisticated spatial interactions. Our method begins by fine-tuning MLLM with a custom counterfactual dataset to predict 2.5D object locations in complex backgrounds from language instructions. Then, the image-compositing model is uniquely designed to process multiple types of input features, enabling it to perform high-fidelity image compositions that consider occlusion, depth blur, and image harmonization. Extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that Bifr\"ost significantly outperforms existing methods, providing a robust solution for generating realistically composed images in scenarios demanding intricate spatial understanding. This work not only pushes the boundaries of generative image compositing but also reduces reliance on expensive annotated datasets by effectively utilizing existing resources in innovative ways.</description>

      <title>Inherently Interpretable Tree Ensemble Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tree ensemble models like random forests and gradient boosting machines are widely used in machine learning due to their excellent predictive performance. However, a high-performance ensemble consisting of a large number of decision trees lacks sufficient transparency and explainability. In this paper, we demonstrate that when shallow decision trees are used as base learners, the ensemble learning algorithms can not only become inherently interpretable subject to an equivalent representation as the generalized additive models but also sometimes lead to better generalization performance. First, an interpretation algorithm is developed that converts the tree ensemble into the functional ANOVA representation with inherent interpretability. Second, two strategies are proposed to further enhance the model interpretability, i.e., by adding constraints in the model training stage and post-hoc effect pruning. Experiments on simulations and real-world datasets show that our proposed methods offer a better trade-off between model interpretation and predictive performance, compared with its counterpart benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Conditional diffusions for neural posterior estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural posterior estimation (NPE), a simulation-based computational approach for Bayesian inference, has shown great success in situations where posteriors are intractable or likelihood functions are treated as "black boxes." Existing NPE methods typically rely on normalizing flows, which transform a base distributions into a complex posterior by composing many simple, invertible transformations. But flow-based models, while state of the art for NPE, are known to suffer from several limitations, including training instability and sharp trade-offs between representational power and computational cost. In this work, we demonstrate the effectiveness of conditional diffusions as an alternative to normalizing flows for NPE. Conditional diffusions address many of the challenges faced by flow-based methods. Our results show that, across a highly varied suite of benchmarking problems for NPE architectures, diffusions offer improved stability, superior accuracy, and faster training times, even with simpler, shallower models. These gains persist across a variety of different encoder or "summary network" architectures, as well as in situations where no summary network is required. The code will be publicly available at \url{https://github.com/TianyuCodings/cDiff}.</description>

      <title>Distributed Blind Source Separation based on FastICA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the emergence of wireless sensor networks (WSNs), many traditional signal processing tasks are required to be computed in a distributed fashion, without transmissions of the raw data to a centralized processing unit, due to the limited energy and bandwidth resources available to the sensors. In this paper, we propose a distributed independent component analysis (ICA) algorithm, which aims at identifying the original signal sources based on observations of their mixtures measured at various sensor nodes. One of the most commonly used ICA algorithms is known as FastICA, which requires a spatial pre-whitening operation in the first step of the algorithm. Such a pre-whitening across all nodes of a WSN is impossible in a bandwidth-constrained distributed setting as it requires to correlate each channel with each other channel in the WSN. We show that an explicit network-wide pre-whitening step can be circumvented by leveraging the properties of the so-called Distributed Adaptive Signal Fusion (DASF) framework. Despite the lack of such a network-wide pre-whitening, we can still obtain the $Q$ least Gaussian independent components of the centralized ICA solution, where $Q$ scales linearly with the required communication load.</description>

      <title>LLM Tree Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This project aims to investigate a novel sequence generation method inspired by the AlphaGo paradigm, adapting it for use with large language models (LLMs). The proposed approach involves creating search trees of different possible completions and evaluating these completions based on model confidence. By considering various paths in the search tree and scoring them according to the model's confidence in each completion, we can generate diverse and high-quality sequences. This research explores the implementation of this paradigm by using confidence as a proxy for response quality akin to beam search \citep{vijayakumar2016diverse}. The primary goal of this paper is to outline the paradigm and demonstrate its potential, rather than focusing on achieving perfect results. The paper will outline the reasons why we believe this paradigm has the potential to improve LLMs in the following manners: 1) increase output quality, 2) decrease errors, 3) eliminate or reduce the compound error problems, 4) generate diverse and creative completions, 5) allow for iterative problem-solving, and 6) self-training. We expect this approach to yield a set of diverse and coherent sequences, offering insights into balancing exploration and exploitation in sequence generation. Potential applications include creative text generation tasks, such as storytelling and content creation, as well as other natural language processing domains, like machine translation and automated summarization. The goal is that the model will be far more effective as it will be able to consider many possible variations allowing it to find the ideal completion. This research aims to contribute to the understanding of effective search strategies in sequence generation and their impact on generating high-quality, varied textual outputs.</description>

      <title>Read-ME: Refactorizing LLMs as Router-Decoupled Mixture of Experts with System Co-Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The proliferation of large language models (LLMs) has led to the adoption of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures that dynamically leverage specialized subnetworks for improved efficiency and performance. Despite their benefits, MoE models face significant challenges during inference, including inefficient memory management and suboptimal batching, due to misaligned design choices between the model architecture and the system policies. Furthermore, the conventional approach of training MoEs from scratch is increasingly prohibitive in terms of cost. In this paper, we propose a novel framework Read-ME that transforms pre-trained dense LLMs into smaller MoE models (in contrast to "upcycling" generalist MoEs), avoiding the high costs of ground-up training. Our approach employs activation sparsity to extract experts. To compose experts, we examine the widely-adopted layer-wise router design and show its redundancy, and thus we introduce the pre-gating router decoupled from the MoE backbone that facilitates system-friendly pre-computing and lookahead scheduling, enhancing expert-aware batching and caching. Our codesign therefore addresses critical gaps on both the algorithmic and system fronts, establishing a scalable and efficient alternative for LLM inference in resource-constrained settings. Read-ME outperforms other popular open-source dense models of similar scales, achieving improvements of up to 10.1% on MMLU, and improving mean end-to-end latency up to 6.1%.

      <title>A spectral method for multi-view subspace learning using the product of projections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-view data provides complementary information on the same set of observations, with multi-omics and multimodal sensor data being common examples. Analyzing such data typically requires distinguishing between shared (joint) and unique (individual) signal subspaces from noisy, high-dimensional measurements. Despite many proposed methods, the conditions for reliably identifying joint and individual subspaces remain unclear. We rigorously quantify these conditions, which depend on the ratio of the signal rank to the ambient dimension, principal angles between true subspaces, and noise levels. Our approach characterizes how spectrum perturbations of the product of projection matrices, derived from each view's estimated subspaces, affect subspace separation. Using these insights, we provide an easy-to-use and scalable estimation algorithm. In particular, we employ rotational bootstrap and random matrix theory to partition the observed spectrum into joint, individual, and noise subspaces. Diagnostic plots visualize this partitioning, providing practical and interpretable insights into the estimation performance. In simulations, our method estimates joint and individual subspaces more accurately than existing approaches. Applications to multi-omics data from colorectal cancer patients and nutrigenomic study of mice demonstrate improved performance in downstream predictive tasks.</description>

      <title>Maximum a Posteriori Inference for Factor Graphs via Benders' Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many Bayesian statistical inference problems come down to computing a maximum a-posteriori (MAP) assignment of latent variables. Yet, standard methods for estimating the MAP assignment do not have a finite time guarantee that the algorithm has converged to a fixed point. Previous research has found that MAP inference can be represented in dual form as a linear programming problem with a non-polynomial number of constraints. A Lagrangian relaxation of the dual yields a statistical inference algorithm as a linear programming problem. However, the decision as to which constraints to remove in the relaxation is often heuristic. We present a method for maximum a-posteriori inference in general Bayesian factor models that sequentially adds constraints to the fully relaxed dual problem using Benders' decomposition. Our method enables the incorporation of expressive integer and logical constraints in clustering problems such as must-link, cannot-link, and a minimum number of whole samples allocated to each cluster. Using this approach, we derive MAP estimation algorithms for the Bayesian Gaussian mixture model and latent Dirichlet allocation. Empirical results show that our method produces a higher optimal posterior value compared to Gibbs sampling and variational Bayes methods for standard data sets and provides certificate of convergence.</description>

      <title>Visual Text Matters: Improving Text-KVQA with Visual Text Entity Knowledge-aware Large Multimodal Assistant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit knowledge-aware text-based visual question answering, also known as Text-KVQA, in the light of modern advancements in large multimodal models (LMMs), and make the following contributions: (i) We propose VisTEL - a principled approach to perform visual text entity linking. The proposed VisTEL module harnesses a state-of-the-art visual text recognition engine and the power of a large multimodal model to jointly reason using textual and visual context obtained using surrounding cues in the image to link the visual text entity to the correct knowledge base entity. (ii) We present KaLMA - a knowledge-aware large multimodal assistant that augments an LMM with knowledge associated with visual text entity in the image to arrive at an accurate answer. Further, we provide a comprehensive experimental analysis and comparison of our approach with traditional visual question answering, pre-large multimodal models, and large multimodal models, as well as prior top-performing approaches. Averaging over three splits of Text-KVQA, our proposed approach surpasses the previous best approach by a substantial 23.3% on an absolute scale and establishes a new state of the art. We make our implementation publicly available.</description>

      <title>Functional Brain Network Identification in Opioid Use Disorder Using Machine Learning Analysis of Resting-State fMRI BOLD Signals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the neurobiology of opioid use disorder (OUD) using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) may help inform treatment strategies to improve patient outcomes. Recent literature suggests temporal characteristics of rs-fMRI blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signals may offer complementary information to functional connectivity analysis. However, existing studies of OUD analyze BOLD signals using measures computed across all time points. This study, for the first time in the literature, employs data-driven machine learning (ML) modeling of rs-fMRI BOLD features representing multiple time points to identify region(s) of interest that differentiate OUD subjects from healthy controls (HC). Following the triple network model, we obtain rs-fMRI BOLD features from the default mode network (DMN), salience network (SN), and executive control network (ECN) for 31 OUD and 45 HC subjects. Then, we use the Boruta ML algorithm to identify statistically significant BOLD features that differentiate OUD from HC, identifying the DMN as the most salient functional network for OUD. Furthermore, we conduct brain activity mapping, showing heightened neural activity within the DMN for OUD. We perform 5-fold cross-validation classification (OUD vs. HC) experiments to study the discriminative power of functional network features with and without fusing demographic features. The DMN shows the most discriminative power, achieving mean AUC and F1 scores of 80.91% and 73.97%, respectively, when fusing BOLD and demographic features. Follow-up Boruta analysis using BOLD features extracted from the medial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, and left and right temporoparietal junctions reveals significant features for all four functional hubs within the DMN.</description>

      <title>Cross Spline Net and a Unified World</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In today's machine learning world for tabular data, XGBoost and fully connected neural network (FCNN) are two most popular methods due to their good model performance and convenience to use. However, they are highly complicated, hard to interpret, and can be overfitted. In this paper, we propose a new modeling framework called cross spline net (CSN) that is based on a combination of spline transformation and cross-network (Wang et al. 2017, 2021). We will show CSN is as performant and convenient to use, and is less complicated, more interpretable and robust. Moreover, the CSN framework is flexible, as the spline layer can be configured differently to yield different models. With different choices of the spline layer, we can reproduce or approximate a set of non-neural network models, including linear and spline-based statistical models, tree, rule-fit, tree-ensembles (gradient boosting trees, random forest), oblique tree/forests, multi-variate adaptive regression spline (MARS), SVM with polynomial kernel, etc. Therefore, CSN provides a unified modeling framework that puts the above set of non-neural network models under the same neural network framework. By using scalable and powerful gradient descent algorithms available in neural network libraries, CSN avoids some pitfalls (such as being ad-hoc, greedy or non-scalable) in the case-specific optimization methods used in the above non-neural network models. We will use a special type of CSN, TreeNet, to illustrate our point. We will compare TreeNet with XGBoost and FCNN to show the benefits of TreeNet. We believe CSN will provide a flexible and convenient framework for practitioners to build performant, robust and more interpretable models.</description>

      <title>Cascading Failure Prediction via Causal Inference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Causal inference provides an analytical framework to identify and quantify cause-and-effect relationships among a network of interacting agents. This paper offers a novel framework for analyzing cascading failures in power transmission networks. This framework generates a directed latent graph in which the nodes represent the transmission lines and the directed edges encode the cause-effect relationships. This graph has a structure distinct from the system's topology, signifying the intricate fact that both local and non-local interdependencies exist among transmission lines, which are more general than only the local interdependencies that topological graphs can present. This paper formalizes a causal inference framework for predicting how an emerging anomaly propagates throughout the system. Using this framework, two algorithms are designed, providing an analytical framework to identify the most likely and most costly cascading scenarios. The framework's effectiveness is evaluated compared to the pertinent literature on the IEEE 14-bus, 39-bus, and 118-bus systems.</description>

Abstract: In a context where the Brazilian judiciary system, the largest in the world, faces a crisis due to the slow processing of millions of cases, it becomes imperative to develop efficient methods for analyzing legal texts. We introduce uBERT, a hybrid model that combines Transformer and Recurrent Neural Network architectures to effectively handle long legal texts. Our approach processes the full text regardless of its length while maintaining reasonable computational overhead. Our experiments demonstrate that uBERT achieves superior performance compared to BERT+LSTM when overlapping input is used and is significantly faster than ULMFiT for processing long legal documents.</description>

      <title>Enriching GNNs with Text Contextual Representations for Detecting Disinformation Campaigns on Social Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Disinformation on social media poses both societal and technical challenges. While previous studies have integrated textual information into propagation networks, they have yet to fully leverage the advancements in Transformer-based language models for high-quality contextual text representations. This work investigates the impact of incorporating textual features into Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for fake news detection. Our experiments demonstrate that contextual representations improve performance by 9.3% in Macro F1 over static ones and 33.8% over GNNs without textual features. However, noisy data augmentation degrades performance and increases instability. We expect our methodology to open avenues for further research, and all code is made publicly available.</description>

      <title>MAP: Multi-Human-Value Alignment Palette</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ensuring that generative AI systems align with human values is essential but challenging, especially when considering multiple human values and their potential trade-offs. Since human values can be personalized and dynamically change over time, the desirable levels of value alignment vary across different ethnic groups, industry sectors, and user cohorts. Within existing frameworks, it is hard to define human values and align AI systems accordingly across different directions simultaneously, such as harmlessness, helpfulness, and positiveness. To address this, we develop a novel, first-principle approach called Multi-Human-Value Alignment Palette (MAP), which navigates the alignment across multiple human values in a structured and reliable way. MAP formulates the alignment problem as an optimization task with user-defined constraints, which define human value targets. It can be efficiently solved via a primal-dual approach, which determines whether a user-defined alignment target is achievable and how to achieve it. We conduct a detailed theoretical analysis of MAP by quantifying the trade-offs between values, the sensitivity to constraints, the fundamental connection between multi-value alignment and sequential alignment, and proving that linear weighted rewards are sufficient for multi-value alignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate MAP's ability to align multiple values in a principled manner while delivering strong empirical performance across various tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces the inverse modeling constrained multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (IM-C-MOEA/D) for addressing constrained real-world optimization problems. Our research builds upon the advancements made in evolutionary computing-based inverse modeling, and it strategically bridges the gaps in applying inverse models based on decomposition to problem domains with constraints. The proposed approach is experimentally evaluated on diverse real-world problems (RWMOP1-35), showing superior performance to state-of-the-art constrained multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (CMOEAs). The experimental results highlight the robustness of the algorithm and its applicability in real-world constrained optimization scenarios.</description>

      <title>Can Stories Help LLMs Reason? Curating Information Space Through Narrative</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Narratives are widely recognized as a powerful tool for structuring information and facilitating comprehension of complex ideas in various domains such as science communication. This paper investigates whether incorporating narrative elements can assist Large Language Models (LLMs) in solving complex problems more effectively. We propose a novel approach, Story of Thought (SoT), integrating narrative structures into prompting techniques for problem-solving. This approach involves constructing narratives around problem statements and creating a framework to identify and organize relevant information. Our experiments show that using various LLMs with SoT consistently surpasses using them with other techniques on physics, chemistry, math, and biology questions in both the GPQA and JEEBench datasets. The narrative-based information curation process in SoT enhances problem comprehension by contextualizing critical in-domain information and highlighting causal relationships within the problem space.</description>

      <title>Non-rigid Relative Placement through 3D Dense Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The task of "relative placement" is to predict the placement of one object in relation to another, e.g. placing a mug onto a mug rack. Through explicit object-centric geometric reasoning, recent methods for relative placement have made tremendous progress towards data-efficient learning for robot manipulation while generalizing to unseen task variations. However, they have yet to represent deformable transformations, despite the ubiquity of non-rigid bodies in real world settings. As a first step towards bridging this gap, we propose ``cross-displacement" - an extension of the principles of relative placement to geometric relationships between deformable objects - and present a novel vision-based method to learn cross-displacement through dense diffusion. To this end, we demonstrate our method's ability to generalize to unseen object instances, out-of-distribution scene configurations, and multimodal goals on multiple highly deformable tasks (both in simulation and in the real world) beyond the scope of prior works.

      <title>A Flow-based Truncated Denoising Diffusion Model for Super-resolution Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopic Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopic Imaging (MRSI) is a non-invasive imaging technique for studying metabolism and has become a crucial tool for understanding neurological diseases, cancers and diabetes. High spatial resolution MRSI is needed to characterize lesions, but in practice MRSI is acquired at low resolution due to time and sensitivity restrictions caused by the low metabolite concentrations. Therefore, there is an imperative need for a post-processing approach to generate high-resolution MRSI from low-resolution data that can be acquired fast and with high sensitivity. Deep learning-based super-resolution methods provided promising results for improving the spatial resolution of MRSI, but they still have limited capability to generate accurate and high-quality images. Recently, diffusion models have demonstrated superior learning capability than other generative models in various tasks, but sampling from diffusion models requires iterating through a large number of diffusion steps, which is time-consuming. This work introduces a Flow-based Truncated Denoising Diffusion Model (FTDDM) for super-resolution MRSI, which shortens the diffusion process by truncating the diffusion chain, and the truncated steps are estimated using a normalizing flow-based network. The network is conditioned on upscaling factors to enable multi-scale super-resolution. To train and evaluate the deep learning models, we developed a 1H-MRSI dataset acquired from 25 high-grade glioma patients. We demonstrate that FTDDM outperforms existing generative models while speeding up the sampling process by over 9-fold compared to the baseline diffusion model. Neuroradiologists' evaluations confirmed the clinical advantages of our method, which also supports uncertainty estimation and sharpness adjustment, extending its potential clinical applications.</description>

      <title>TEARS: Textual Representations for Scrutable Recommendations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional recommender systems rely on high-dimensional (latent) embeddings for modeling user-item interactions, often resulting in opaque representations that lack interpretability. Moreover, these systems offer limited control to users over their recommendations. Inspired by recent work, we introduce TExtuAl Representations for Scrutable recommendations (TEARS) to address these challenges. Instead of representing a user's interests through a latent embedding, TEARS encodes them in natural text, providing transparency and allowing users to edit them. To do so, TEARS uses a modern LLM to generate user summaries based on user preferences. We find the summaries capture user preferences uniquely. Using these summaries, we take a hybrid approach where we use an optimal transport procedure to align the summaries' representation with the learned representation of a standard VAE for collaborative filtering. We find this approach can surpass the performance of three popular VAE models while providing user-controllable recommendations. We also analyze the controllability of TEARS through three simulated user tasks to evaluate the effectiveness of a user editing its summary.</description>

      <title>Flow Generator Matching</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the realm of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC), flow-matching models have emerged as a powerhouse, achieving success due to their robust theoretical underpinnings and solid ability for large-scale generative modeling. These models have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance, but their brilliance comes at a cost. The process of sampling from these models is notoriously demanding on computational resources, as it necessitates the use of multi-step numerical ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Against this backdrop, this paper presents a novel solution with theoretical guarantees in the form of Flow Generator Matching (FGM), an innovative approach designed to accelerate the sampling of flow-matching models into a one-step generation, while maintaining the original performance. On the CIFAR10 unconditional generation benchmark, our one-step FGM model achieves a new record Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) score of 3.08 among few-step flow-matching-based models, outperforming original 50-step flow-matching models. Furthermore, we use the FGM to distill the Stable Diffusion 3, a leading text-to-image flow-matching model based on the MM-DiT architecture. The resulting MM-DiT-FGM one-step text-to-image model demonstrates outstanding industry-level performance. When evaluated on the GenEval benchmark, MM-DiT-FGM has delivered remarkable generating qualities, rivaling other multi-step models in light of the efficiency of a single generation step.</description>

      <title>A prescriptive theory for brain-like inference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) is a widely used objective for training deep generative models, such as Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). In the neuroscience literature, an identical objective is known as the variational free energy, hinting at a potential unified framework for brain function and machine learning. Despite its utility in interpreting generative models, including diffusion models, ELBO maximization is often seen as too broad to offer prescriptive guidance for specific architectures in neuroscience or machine learning. In this work, we show that maximizing ELBO under Poisson assumptions for general sequence data leads to a spiking neural network that performs Bayesian posterior inference through its membrane potential dynamics. The resulting model, the iterative Poisson VAE (iP-VAE), has a closer connection to biological neurons than previous brain-inspired predictive coding models based on Gaussian assumptions. Compared to amortized and iterative VAEs, iP-VAElearns sparser representations and exhibits superior generalization to out-of-distribution samples. These findings suggest that optimizing ELBO, combined with Poisson assumptions, provides a solid foundation for developing prescriptive theories in NeuroAI.</description>

      <title>Two are better than one: Context window extension with multi-grained self-injection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The limited context window of contemporary large language models (LLMs) remains a huge barrier to their broader application across various domains. While continual pre-training on long-context data is a straightforward and effective solution, it incurs substantial costs in terms of data acquisition and computational resources. To alleviate this issue, we propose SharedLLM, a novel approach grounded in the design philosophy of multi-grained context compression and query-aware information retrieval. SharedLLM is composed of two short-context LLMs such as LLaMA-2, termed upper model and lower model. The lower model functions as a compressor while the upper model acts as a decoder. The upper model receives compressed, multi-grained context information from the lower model and performs context-aware modeling on the running text. Information transfer between the compressor and decoder occurs only at the lowest layers to refrain from long forward paths in the lower model and redundant cross-attention modules in the upper model. Based on this architecture, we introduce a specialized tree-style data structure to efficiently encode, store and retrieve multi-grained contextual information for text chunks. This structure, combined with a search algorithm, enables rapid encoding and retrieval of relevant information from various levels of the tree based on the input query. This entire process, wherein the sender and receiver are derived from the same LLM layer, is referred to as self-injection.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper focuses on decentralized stochastic bilevel optimization (DSBO) where agents only communicate with their neighbors. We propose Decentralized Stochastic Gradient Descent and Ascent with Gradient Tracking (DSGDA-GT), a novel algorithm that only requires first-order oracles that are much cheaper than second-order oracles widely adopted in existing works. We further provide a finite-time convergence analysis showing that for $n$ agents collaboratively solving the DSBO problem, the sample complexity of finding an $\epsilon$-stationary point in our algorithm is $\mathcal{O}(n^{-1}\epsilon^{-7})$, which matches the currently best-known results of the single-agent counterpart with linear speedup. The numerical experiments demonstrate both the communication and training efficiency of our algorithm.</description>

      <title>Free-Rider and Conflict Aware Collaboration Formation for Cross-Silo Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a machine learning paradigm that allows multiple FL participants (FL-PTs) to collaborate on training models without sharing private data. Due to data heterogeneity, negative transfer may occur in the FL training process. This necessitates FL-PT selection based on their data complementarity. In cross-silo FL, organizations that engage in business activities are key sources of FL-PTs. The resulting FL ecosystem has two features: (i) self-interest, and (ii) competition among FL-PTs. This requires the desirable FL-PT selection strategy to simultaneously mitigate the problems of free riders and conflicts of interest among competitors. To this end, we propose an optimal FL collaboration formation strategy -- FedEgoists -- which ensures that: (1) a FL-PT can benefit from FL if and only if it benefits the FL ecosystem, and (2) a FL-PT will not contribute to its competitors or their supporters. It provides an efficient clustering solution to group FL-PTs into coalitions, ensuring that within each coalition, FL-PTs share the same interest. We theoretically prove that the FL-PT coalitions formed are optimal since no coalitions can collaborate together to improve the utility of any of their members. Extensive experiments on widely adopted benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of FedEgoists compared to nine state-of-the-art baseline methods, and its ability to establish efficient collaborative networks in cross-silos FL with FL-PTs that engage in business activities.</description>

      <title>Double Difference Earthquake Location with Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Double difference earthquake relocation is an essential component of many earthquake catalog development workflows. This technique produces high-resolution relative relocations between events by minimizing differential measurements of the arrival times of waves from nearby sources, which highlights the resolution of faults and improves interpretation of seismic activity. The inverse problem is typically solved iteratively using conjugate-gradient minimization, however the cost scales significantly with the total number of sources and stations considered. Here we propose a Graph Neural Network (GNN) based earthquake double-difference relocation framework, Graph Double Difference (GraphDD), that is trained to minimize the double-difference residuals of a catalog to locate earthquakes. Through batching and sampling the method can scale to arbitrarily large catalogs. Our architecture uses one graph to represent the stations, a second graph to represent the sources, and creates the Cartesian product graph between the two graphs to capture the relationships between the stations and sources (e.g., the residuals and travel time partial derivatives). This key feature allows a natural architecture that can be used to minimize the double-difference residuals. We implement our model on several distinct test cases including seismicity from northern California, Turkiye, and northern Chile, which have highly variable data quality, and station and source distributions. We obtain high resolution relocations in these tests, and our model shows adaptability to variable types of loss functions and location objectives, including learning station corrections and mapping into the reference frame of a different catalog. Our results suggest that a GNN approach to double-difference relocation is a promising direction for scaling to very large catalogs and gaining new insights into the relocation problem.</description>

      <title>Simpler Diffusion (SiD2): 1.5 FID on ImageNet512 with pixel-space diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Latent diffusion models have become the popular choice for scaling up diffusion models for high resolution image synthesis. Compared to pixel-space models that are trained end-to-end, latent models are perceived to be more efficient and to produce higher image quality at high resolution. Here we challenge these notions, and show that pixel-space models can in fact be very competitive to latent approaches both in quality and efficiency, achieving 1.5 FID on ImageNet512 and new SOTA results on ImageNet128 and ImageNet256.
  We present a simple recipe for scaling end-to-end pixel-space diffusion models to high resolutions. 1: Use the sigmoid loss (Kingma &amp; Gao, 2023) with our prescribed hyper-parameters. 2: Use our simplified memory-efficient architecture with fewer skip-connections. 3: Scale the model to favor processing the image at high resolution with fewer parameters, rather than using more parameters but at a lower resolution. When combining these three steps with recently proposed tricks like guidance intervals, we obtain a family of pixel-space diffusion models we call Simple Diffusion v2 (SiD2).</description>

      <title>High Resolution Seismic Waveform Generation using Denoising Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate prediction and synthesis of seismic waveforms are crucial for seismic hazard assessment and earthquake-resistant infrastructure design. Existing prediction methods, such as Ground Motion Models and physics-based simulations, often fail to capture the full complexity of seismic wavefields, particularly at higher frequencies. This study introduces a novel, efficient, and scalable generative model for high-frequency seismic waveform generation. Our approach leverages a spectrogram representation of seismic waveform data, which is reduced to a lower-dimensional submanifold via an autoencoder. A state-of-the-art diffusion model is trained to generate this latent representation, conditioned on key input parameters: earthquake magnitude, recording distance, site conditions, and faulting type. The model generates waveforms with frequency content up to 50 Hz. Any scalar ground motion statistic, such as peak ground motion amplitudes and spectral accelerations, can be readily derived from the synthesized waveforms. We validate our model using commonly used seismological metrics, and performance metrics from image generation studies. Our results demonstrate that our openly available model can generate distributions of realistic high-frequency seismic waveforms across a wide range of input parameters, even in data-sparse regions. For the scalar ground motion statistics commonly used in seismic hazard and earthquake engineering studies, we show that the model accurately reproduces both the median trends of the real data and its variability. To evaluate and compare the growing number of this and similar 'Generative Waveform Models' (GWM), we argue that they should generally be openly available and that they should be included in community efforts for ground motion model evaluations.</description>

      <title>Capsule Endoscopy Multi-classification via Gated Attention and Wavelet Transformations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Abnormalities in the gastrointestinal tract significantly influence the patient's health and require a timely diagnosis for effective treatment. With such consideration, an effective automatic classification of these abnormalities from a video capsule endoscopy (VCE) frame is crucial for improvement in diagnostic workflows.
  The work presents the process of developing and evaluating a novel model designed to classify gastrointestinal anomalies from a VCE video frame. Integration of Omni Dimensional Gated Attention (OGA) mechanism and Wavelet transformation techniques into the model's architecture allowed the model to focus on the most critical areas in the endoscopy images, reducing noise and irrelevant features. This is particularly advantageous in capsule endoscopy, where images often contain a high degree of variability in texture and color. Wavelet transformations contributed by efficiently capturing spatial and frequency-domain information, improving feature extraction, especially for detecting subtle features from the VCE frames. Furthermore, the features extracted from the Stationary Wavelet Transform and Discrete Wavelet Transform are concatenated channel-wise to capture multiscale features, which are essential for detecting polyps, ulcerations, and bleeding. This approach improves classification accuracy on imbalanced capsule endoscopy datasets. The proposed model achieved 92.76% and 91.19% as training and validation accuracies respectively. At the same time, Training and Validation losses are 0.2057 and 0.2700. The proposed model achieved a Balanced Accuracy of 94.81%, AUC of 87.49%, F1-score of 91.11%, precision of 91.17%, recall of 91.19% and specificity of 98.44%. Additionally, the model's performance is benchmarked against two base models, VGG16 and ResNet50, demonstrating its enhanced ability to identify and classify a range of gastrointestinal abnormalities accurately.</description>

      <title>Noise-Aware Differentially Private Variational Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) provides robust privacy guarantees for statistical inference, but this can lead to unreliable results and biases in downstream applications. While several noise-aware approaches have been proposed which integrate DP perturbation into the inference, they are limited to specific types of simple probabilistic models. In this work, we propose a novel method for noise-aware approximate Bayesian inference based on stochastic gradient variational inference which can also be applied to high-dimensional and non-conjugate models. We also propose a more accurate evaluation method for noise-aware posteriors. Empirically, our inference method has similar performance to existing methods in the domain where they are applicable. Outside this domain, we obtain accurate coverages on high-dimensional Bayesian linear regression and well-calibrated predictive probabilities on Bayesian logistic regression with the UCI Adult dataset.</description>

      <title>COMSPLIT: A Communication-Aware Split Learning Design for Heterogeneous IoT Platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The significance of distributed learning and inference algorithms in Internet of Things (IoT) network is growing since they flexibly distribute computation load between IoT devices and the infrastructure, enhance data privacy, and minimize latency. However, a notable challenge stems from the influence of communication channel conditions on their performance. In this work, we introduce COMSPLIT: a novel communication-aware design for split learning (SL) and inference paradigm tailored to processing time series data in IoT networks. COMSPLIT provides a versatile framework for deploying adaptable SL in IoT networks affected by diverse channel conditions. In conjunction with the integration of an early-exit strategy, and addressing IoT scenarios containing devices with heterogeneous computational capabilities, COMSPLIT represents a comprehensive design solution for communication-aware SL in IoT networks. Numerical results show superior performance of COMSPLIT compared to vanilla SL approaches (that assume ideal communication channel), demonstrating its ability to offer both design simplicity and adaptability to different channel conditions.</description>

      <title>Unified Cross-Modal Image Synthesis with Hierarchical Mixture of Product-of-Experts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a deep mixture of multimodal hierarchical variational auto-encoders called MMHVAE that synthesizes missing images from observed images in different modalities. MMHVAE's design focuses on tackling four challenges: (i) creating a complex latent representation of multimodal data to generate high-resolution images; (ii) encouraging the variational distributions to estimate the missing information needed for cross-modal image synthesis; (iii) learning to fuse multimodal information in the context of missing data; (iv) leveraging dataset-level information to handle incomplete data sets at training time. Extensive experiments are performed on the challenging problem of pre-operative brain multi-parametric magnetic resonance and intra-operative ultrasound imaging.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate localization in indoor environments is a challenge due to the Non Line of Sight (NLoS) nature of the signaling. In this paper, we explore the use of AI/ML techniques for positioning accuracy enhancement in Indoor Factory (InF) scenarios. The proposed neural network, which we term LocNet, is trained on measurements such as Channel Impulse Response (CIR) and Reference Signal Received Power (RSRP) from multiple Transmit Receive Points (TRPs). Simulation results show that when using measurements from 18 TRPs, LocNet achieves a 9 cm positioning accuracy at the 90th percentile. Additionally, we demonstrate that the same model generalizes effectively even when measurements from some TRPs randomly become unavailable. Lastly, we provide insights on the robustness of the trained model to the errors in ground truth labels used for training.</description>

      <title>Balancing the Scales: Enhancing Fairness in Facial Expression Recognition with Latent Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automatically recognizing emotional intent using facial expression has been a thoroughly investigated topic in the realm of computer vision. Facial Expression Recognition (FER), being a supervised learning task, relies heavily on substantially large data exemplifying various socio-cultural demographic attributes. Over the past decade, several real-world in-the-wild FER datasets that have been proposed were collected through crowd-sourcing or web-scraping. However, most of these practically used datasets employ a manual annotation methodology for labeling emotional intent, which inherently propagates individual demographic biases. Moreover, these datasets also lack an equitable representation of various socio-cultural demographic groups, thereby inducing a class imbalance. Bias analysis and its mitigation have been investigated across multiple domains and problem settings, however, in the FER domain, this is a relatively lesser explored area. This work leverages representation learning based on latent spaces to mitigate bias in facial expression recognition systems, thereby enhancing a deep learning model's fairness and overall accuracy.</description>

      <title>Learned Reference-based Diffusion Sampling for multi-modal distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the past few years, several approaches utilizing score-based diffusion have been proposed to sample from probability distributions, that is without having access to exact samples and relying solely on evaluations of unnormalized densities. The resulting samplers approximate the time-reversal of a noising diffusion process, bridging the target distribution to an easy-to-sample base distribution. In practice, the performance of these methods heavily depends on key hyperparameters that require ground truth samples to be accurately tuned. Our work aims to highlight and address this fundamental issue, focusing in particular on multi-modal distributions, which pose significant challenges for existing sampling methods. Building on existing approaches, we introduce Learned Reference-based Diffusion Sampler (LRDS), a methodology specifically designed to leverage prior knowledge on the location of the target modes in order to bypass the obstacle of hyperparameter tuning. LRDS proceeds in two steps by (i) learning a reference diffusion model on samples located in high-density space regions and tailored for multimodality, and (ii) using this reference model to foster the training of a diffusion-based sampler. We experimentally demonstrate that LRDS best exploits prior knowledge on the target distribution compared to competing algorithms on a variety of challenging distributions.</description>

      <title>Unified Causality Analysis Based on the Degrees of Freedom</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Temporally evolving systems are typically modeled by dynamic equations. A key challenge in accurate modeling is understanding the causal relationships between subsystems, as well as identifying the presence and influence of unobserved hidden drivers on the observed dynamics. This paper presents a unified method capable of identifying fundamental causal relationships between pairs of systems, whether deterministic or stochastic. Notably, the method also uncovers hidden common causes beyond the observed variables. By analyzing the degrees of freedom in the system, our approach provides a more comprehensive understanding of both causal influence and hidden confounders. This unified framework is validated through theoretical models and simulations, demonstrating its robustness and potential for broader application.</description>

      <title>Conditional Hallucinations for Image Compression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In lossy image compression, models face the challenge of either hallucinating details or generating out-of-distribution samples due to the information bottleneck. This implies that at times, introducing hallucinations is necessary to generate in-distribution samples. The optimal level of hallucination varies depending on image content, as humans are sensitive to small changes that alter the semantic meaning. We propose a novel compression method that dynamically balances the degree of hallucination based on content. We collect data and train a model to predict user preferences on hallucinations. By using this prediction to adjust the perceptual weight in the reconstruction loss, we develop a Conditionally Hallucinating compression model (ConHa) that outperforms state-of-the-art image compression methods. Code and images are available at https://polybox.ethz.ch/index.php/s/owS1k5JYs4KD4TA.</description>

      <title>Graph Linearization Methods for Reasoning on Graphs with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models have evolved to process multiple modalities beyond text, such as images and audio, which motivates us to explore how to effectively leverage them for graph machine learning tasks. The key question, therefore, is how to transform graphs into linear sequences of tokens, a process we term graph linearization, so that LLMs can handle graphs naturally. We consider that graphs should be linearized meaningfully to reflect certain properties of natural language text, such as local dependency and global alignment, in order to ease contemporary LLMs, trained on trillions of textual tokens, better understand graphs. To achieve this, we developed several graph linearization methods based on graph centrality, degeneracy, and node relabeling schemes. We then investigated their effect on LLM performance in graph reasoning tasks. Experimental results on synthetic graphs demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods compared to random linearization baselines. Our work introduces novel graph representations suitable for LLMs, contributing to the potential integration of graph machine learning with the trend of multi-modal processing using a unified transformer model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study introduces an approach for modeling unsteady transonic aerodynamics within a parametric space, using Volterra series to capture aerodynamic responses and machine learning to enable interpolation. The first- and second-order Volterra kernels are derived from indicial aerodynamic responses obtained through computational fluid dynamics, with the second-order kernel calculated as a correction to the dominant linear response. Machine learning algorithms, specifically artificial neural network and Gaussian process regression, are used to interpolate kernel coefficients within a parameter space defined by Mach number and angle of attack. The methodology is applied to two and three dimensional test cases in the transonic regime. Results underscore the benefit of including the second-order kernel to address strong nonlinearity and demonstrate the effectiveness of neural networks. The approach achieves a level of accuracy that appears sufficient for use in conceptual design.</description>

Abstract: The rise of social media has amplified the spread of fake news, now further complicated by large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, which ease the generation of highly convincing, error-free misinformation, making it increasingly challenging for the public to discern truth from falsehood. Traditional fake news detection methods relying on linguistic cues also becomes less effective. Moreover, current detectors primarily focus on binary classification and English texts, often overlooking the distinction between machine-generated true vs. fake news and the detection in low-resource languages. To this end, we updated detection schema to include machine-generated news with focus on the Urdu language. We further propose a hierarchical detection strategy to improve the accuracy and robustness. Experiments show its effectiveness across four datasets in various settings.</description>

      <title>Bongard in Wonderland: Visual Puzzles that Still Make AI Go Mad?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, newly developed Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as OpenAI's GPT-4o, have emerged, seemingly demonstrating advanced reasoning capabilities across text and image modalities. Yet, the depth of these advances in language-guided perception and abstract reasoning remains underexplored, and it is unclear whether these models can truly live up to their ambitious promises. To assess the progress and identify shortcomings, we enter the wonderland of Bongard problems, a set of classical visual reasoning puzzles that require human-like abilities of pattern recognition and abstract reasoning. While VLMs occasionally succeed in identifying discriminative concepts and solving some of the problems, they frequently falter, failing to understand and reason about visual concepts. Surprisingly, even elementary concepts that may seem trivial to humans, such as simple spirals, pose significant challenges. Moreover, even when asked to explicitly focus on and analyze these concepts, they continue to falter, suggesting not only a lack of understanding of these elementary visual concepts but also an inability to generalize to unseen concepts. These observations underscore the current limitations of VLMs, emphasize that a significant gap remains between human-like visual reasoning and machine cognition, and highlight the ongoing need for innovation in this area.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent advancements in unsupervised visual representation learning, the Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA) has emerged as a significant method for extracting visual features from unlabeled imagery through an innovative masking strategy. Despite its success, two primary limitations have been identified: the inefficacy of Exponential Moving Average (EMA) from I-JEPA in preventing entire collapse and the inadequacy of I-JEPA prediction in accurately learning the mean of patch representations. Addressing these challenges, this study introduces a novel framework, namely C-JEPA (Contrastive-JEPA), which integrates the Image-based Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture with the Variance-Invariance-Covariance Regularization (VICReg) strategy. This integration is designed to effectively learn the variance/covariance for preventing entire collapse and ensuring invariance in the mean of augmented views, thereby overcoming the identified limitations. Through empirical and theoretical evaluations, our work demonstrates that C-JEPA significantly enhances the stability and quality of visual representation learning. When pre-trained on the ImageNet-1K dataset, C-JEPA exhibits rapid and improved convergence in both linear probing and fine-tuning performance metrics.</description>

      <title>How Critical is Site-Specific RAN Optimization? 5G Open-RAN Uplink Air Interface Performance Test and Optimization from Macro-Cell CIR Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the importance of channel measurement data from specific sites and its impact on air interface optimization and test. Currently, a range of statistical channel models including 3GPP 38.901 tapped delay line (TDL), clustered delay line (CDL), urban microcells (UMi) and urban macrocells (UMa) type channels are widely used for air interface performance testing and simulation. However, there remains a gap in the realism of these models for air interface testing and optimization when compared with real world measurement based channels. To address this gap, we compare the performance impacts of training neural receivers with 1) statistical 3GPP TDL models, and 2) measured macro-cell channel impulse response (CIR) data. We leverage our OmniPHY-5G neural receiver for NR PUSCH uplink simulation, with a training procedure that uses statistical TDL channel models for pre-training, and fine-tuning based on measured site specific MIMO CIR data. The proposed fine-tuning method achieves a 10% block error rate (BLER) at a 1.85 dB lower signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) compared to pre-training only on simulated TDL channels, illustrating a rough magnitude of the gap that can be closed by site-specific training, and gives the first answer to the question "how much can fine-tuning the RAN for site-specific channels help?"</description>

      <title>Considerations for Distribution Shift Robustness of Diagnostic Models in Healthcare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider robustness to distribution shifts in the context of diagnostic models in healthcare, where the prediction target $Y$, e.g., the presence of a disease, is causally upstream of the observations $X$, e.g., a biomarker. Distribution shifts may occur, for instance, when the training data is collected in a domain with patients having particular demographic characteristics while the model is deployed on patients from a different demographic group. In the domain of applied ML for health, it is common to predict $Y$ from $X$ without considering further information about the patient. However, beyond the direct influence of the disease $Y$ on biomarker $X$, a predictive model may learn to exploit confounding dependencies (or shortcuts) between $X$ and $Y$ that are unstable under certain distribution shifts. In this work, we highlight a data generating mechanism common to healthcare settings and discuss how recent theoretical results from the causality literature can be applied to build robust predictive models. We theoretically show why ignoring covariates as well as common invariant learning approaches will in general not yield robust predictors in the studied setting, while including certain covariates into the prediction model will. In an extensive simulation study, we showcase the robustness (or lack thereof) of different predictors under various data generating processes. Lastly, we analyze the performance of the different approaches using the PTB-XL dataset, a public dataset of annotated ECG recordings.</description>

      <title>Mask-Weighted Spatial Likelihood Coding for Speaker-Independent Joint Localization and Mask Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to their robustness and flexibility, neural-driven beamformers are a popular choice for speech separation in challenging environments with a varying amount of simultaneous speakers alongside noise and reverberation. Time-frequency masks and relative directions of the speakers regarding a fixed spatial grid can be used to estimate the beamformer's parameters. To some degree, speaker-independence is achieved by ensuring a greater amount of spatial partitions than speech sources. In this work, we analyze how to encode both mask and positioning into such a grid to enable joint estimation of both quantities. We propose mask-weighted spatial likelihood coding and show that it achieves considerable performance in both tasks compared to baseline encodings optimized for either localization or mask estimation. In the same setup, we demonstrate superiority for joint estimation of both quantities. Conclusively, we propose a universal approach which can replace an upstream sound source localization system solely by adapting the training framework, making it highly relevant in performance-critical scenarios.</description>

      <title>Improving Stochastic Cubic Newton with Momentum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study stochastic second-order methods for solving general non-convex optimization problems. We propose using a special version of momentum to stabilize the stochastic gradient and Hessian estimates in Newton's method. We show that momentum provably improves the variance of stochastic estimates and allows the method to converge for any noise level. Using the cubic regularization technique, we prove a global convergence rate for our method on general non-convex problems to a second-order stationary point, even when using only a single stochastic data sample per iteration. This starkly contrasts with all existing stochastic second-order methods for non-convex problems, which typically require large batches. Therefore, we are the first to demonstrate global convergence for batches of arbitrary size in the non-convex case for the Stochastic Cubic Newton. Additionally, we show improved speed on convex stochastic problems for our regularized Newton methods with momentum.</description>

      <title>Electromechanical Dynamics of the Heart: A Study of Cardiac Hysteresis During Physical Stress Test</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases are best diagnosed using multiple modalities that assess both the heart's electrical and mechanical functions. While effective, imaging techniques like echocardiography and nuclear imaging are costly and not widely accessible. More affordable technologies, such as simultaneous electrocardiography (ECG) and phonocardiography (PCG), may provide valuable insights into electromechanical coupling and could be useful for prescreening in low-resource settings.
  Using physical stress test data from the EPHNOGRAM ECG-PCG dataset, collected from 23 healthy male subjects (age: 25.4+/-1.9 yrs), we investigated electromechanical intervals (RR, QT, systolic, and diastolic) and their interactions during exercise, along with hysteresis between cardiac electrical activity and mechanical responses.
  Time delay analysis revealed distinct temporal relationships between QT, systolic, and diastolic intervals, with RR as the primary driver. The diastolic interval showed near-synchrony with RR, while QT responded to RR interval changes with an average delay of 10.5s, and the systolic interval responded more slowly, with an average delay of 28.3s. We examined QT-RR, systolic-RR, and diastolic-RR hysteresis, finding narrower loops for diastolic RR and wider loops for systolic RR. Significant correlations (average:0.75) were found between heart rate changes and hysteresis loop areas, suggesting the equivalent circular area diameter as a promising biomarker for cardiac function under exercise stress.
  Deep learning models, including Long Short-Term Memory and Convolutional Neural Networks, estimated the QT, systolic, and diastolic intervals from RR data, confirming the nonlinear relationship between RR and other intervals. Findings highlight a significant cardiac memory effect, linking ECG and PCG morphology and timing to heart rate history.</description>

      <title>MILES: Making Imitation Learning Easy with Self-Supervision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data collection in imitation learning often requires significant, laborious human supervision, such as numerous demonstrations, and/or frequent environment resets for methods that incorporate reinforcement learning. In this work, we propose an alternative approach, MILES: a fully autonomous, self-supervised data collection paradigm, and we show that this enables efficient policy learning from just a single demonstration and a single environment reset. MILES autonomously learns a policy for returning to and then following the single demonstration, whilst being self-guided during data collection, eliminating the need for additional human interventions. We evaluated MILES across several real-world tasks, including tasks that require precise contact-rich manipulation such as locking a lock with a key. We found that, under the constraints of a single demonstration and no repeated environment resetting, MILES significantly outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives like imitation learning methods that leverage reinforcement learning. Videos of our experiments and code can be found on our webpage: www.robot-learning.uk/miles.</description>

      <title>Less is More: Extreme Gradient Boost Rank-1 Adaption for Efficient Finetuning of LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) has become a crucial technique for adapting pre-trained models to downstream tasks. However, the enormous size of LLMs poses significant challenges in terms of computational complexity and resource requirements. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a promising solution. However, there exists a gap between the practical performance of low-rank adaptations and its theoretical optimum. In this work, we propose eXtreme Gradient Boosting LoRA (XGBLoRA), a novel framework that bridges this gap by leveraging the power of ensemble learning. Inspired by gradient boosting, XGBLoRA iteratively learns and merges a sequence of LoRA adaptations to refine model predictions. It achieves better performance than the standard LoRA, while enjoying the computational efficiency of rank-1 adaptations. We provide theoretical analysis to show the convergence and optimality of our approach, and conduct extensive experiments on a range of natural language processing tasks. The results demonstrate that XGBLoRA consistently outperforms standard LoRA and achieves performance comparable to full fine-tuning with significantly fewer trainable parameters. This work advances parameter-efficient fine-tuning for LLMs, and offers a promising solution for adapting LLMs to downstream tasks while optimizing performance and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Resilience and Scalability in Travel Booking Systems: A Microservices Approach to Fault Tolerance, Load Balancing, and Service Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the inclusion of microservices architecture in the development of scalable and reliable airline reservation systems. Most of the traditional reservation systems are very rigid and centralized which makes them prone to bottlenecks and a single point of failure. As such, systems do not meet the requirements of modern airlines which are dynamic. Microservices offer better resiliency and scalability because the services do not depend on one another and can be deployed independently. The approach is grounded on the Circuit Breaker Pattern to maintain fault tolerance while consuming foreign resources such as flight APIs and payment systems. This avoided the failure propagation to the systems by 60% enabling the systems to function under external failures. Traffic rerouting also bolstered this with a guarantee of above 99.95% uptime in systems where high availability was demanded. To address this, load balancing was used, particularly the Round-Robin method which managed to enhance performance by 35% through the equal distribution of user requests among the service instances. Health checks, as well as monitoring in real-time, helped as well with failure management as they helped to contain failures before the users of the system were affected. The results suggest that the use of microservices led to a 40% increase in system scalability, a 50% decrease in downtime and a support for 30% more concurrent users than the use of monolithic architectures. These findings affirm the capability of microservices in the development of robust and flexible airline ticket booking systems that are responsive to change and recover from external system unavailability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Foundation models applied to bio-molecular space hold promise to accelerate drug discovery. Molecular representation is key to building such models. Previous works have typically focused on a single representation or view of the molecules. Here, we develop a multi-view foundation model approach, that integrates molecular views of graph, image and text. Single-view foundation models are each pre-trained on a dataset of up to 200M molecules and then aggregated into combined representations. Our multi-view model is validated on a diverse set of 18 tasks, encompassing ligand-protein binding, molecular solubility, metabolism and toxicity. We show that the multi-view models perform robustly and are able to balance the strengths and weaknesses of specific views. We then apply this model to screen compounds against a large (&gt;100 targets) set of G Protein-Coupled receptors (GPCRs). From this library of targets, we identify 33 that are related to Alzheimer's disease. On this subset, we employ our model to identify strong binders, which are validated through structure-based modeling and identification of key binding motifs.</description>

Abstract: The early detection of potential failures in industrial machinery components is paramount for ensuring the reliability and safety of operations, thereby preserving Machine Condition Monitoring (MCM). This research addresses this imperative by introducing an innovative approach to Real-Time Acoustic Anomaly Detection. Our method combines semi-supervised temporal convolution with representation learning and a hybrid model strategy with Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN) to handle various intricate anomaly patterns found in acoustic data effectively. The proposed model demonstrates superior performance compared to established research in the field, underscoring the effectiveness of this approach. Not only do we present quantitative evidence of its superiority, but we also employ visual representations, such as t-SNE plots, to further substantiate the model's efficacy.</description>

      <title>On the Benefits of Active Data Collection in Operator Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate active data collection strategies for operator learning when the target operator is linear and the input functions are drawn from a mean-zero stochastic process with continuous covariance kernels. With an active data collection strategy, we establish an error convergence rate in terms of the decay rate of the eigenvalues of the covariance kernel. Thus, with sufficiently rapid eigenvalue decay of the covariance kernels, arbitrarily fast error convergence rates can be achieved. This contrasts with the passive (i.i.d.) data collection strategies, where the convergence rate is never faster than $\sim n^{-1}$. In fact, for our setting, we establish a \emph{non-vanishing} lower bound for any passive data collection strategy, regardless of the eigenvalues decay rate of the covariance kernel. Overall, our results show the benefit of active over passive data collection strategies in operator learning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Financial intelligence generation from vast data sources has typically relied on traditional methods of knowledge-graph construction or database engineering. Recently, fine-tuned financial domain-specific Large Language Models (LLMs), have emerged. While these advancements are promising, limitations such as high inference costs, hallucinations, and the complexity of concurrently analyzing high-dimensional financial data, emerge. This motivates our invention FISHNET (Financial Intelligence from Sub-querying, Harmonizing, Neural-Conditioning, Expert swarming, and Task planning), an agentic architecture that accomplishes highly complex analytical tasks for more than 98,000 regulatory filings that vary immensely in terms of semantics, data hierarchy, or format. FISHNET shows remarkable performance for financial insight generation (61.8% success rate over 5.0% Routing, 45.6% RAG R-Precision). We conduct rigorous ablations to empirically prove the success of FISHNET, each agent's importance, and the optimized performance of assembling all agents. Our modular architecture can be leveraged for a myriad of use-cases, enabling scalability, flexibility, and data integrity that are critical for financial tasks.</description>

Abstract: A central question in deep learning is to understand the functions learned by deep networks. What is their approximation class? Do the learned weights and representations depend on initialization? Previous empirical work has evidenced that kernels defined by network activations are similar across initializations. For shallow networks, this has been theoretically studied with random feature models, but an extension to deep networks has remained elusive. Here, we provide a deep extension of such random feature models, which we call the rainbow model. We prove that rainbow networks define deterministic (hierarchical) kernels in the infinite-width limit. The resulting functions thus belong to a data-dependent RKHS which does not depend on the weight randomness. We also verify numerically our modeling assumptions on deep CNNs trained on image classification tasks, and show that the trained networks approximately satisfy the rainbow hypothesis. In particular, rainbow networks sampled from the corresponding random feature model achieve similar performance as the trained networks. Our results highlight the central role played by the covariances of network weights at each layer, which are observed to be low-rank as a result of feature learning.</description>

      <title>Generalizing Differentially Private Decentralized Deep Learning with Multi-Agent Consensus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.13892v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cooperative decentralized learning relies on direct information exchange between communicating agents, each with access to locally available datasets. The goal is to agree on model parameters that are optimal over all data. However, sharing parameters with untrustworthy neighbors can incur privacy risks by leaking exploitable information. To enable trustworthy cooperative learning, we propose a framework that embeds differential privacy into decentralized deep learning and secures each agent's local dataset during and after cooperative training. We prove convergence guarantees for algorithms derived from this framework and demonstrate its practical utility when applied to subgradient and ADMM decentralized approaches, finding accuracies approaching the centralized baseline while ensuring individual data samples are resilient to inference attacks. Furthermore, we study the relationships between accuracy, privacy budget, and networks' graph properties on collaborative classification tasks, discovering a useful invariance to the communication graph structure beyond a threshold.</description>

      <title>Maintaining Plasticity in Continual Learning via Regenerative Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.11958v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In continual learning, plasticity refers to the ability of an agent to quickly adapt to new information. Neural networks are known to lose plasticity when processing non-stationary data streams. In this paper, we propose L2 Init, a simple approach for maintaining plasticity by incorporating in the loss function L2 regularization toward initial parameters. This is very similar to standard L2 regularization (L2), the only difference being that L2 regularizes toward the origin. L2 Init is simple to implement and requires selecting only a single hyper-parameter. The motivation for this method is the same as that of methods that reset neurons or parameter values. Intuitively, when recent losses are insensitive to particular parameters, these parameters should drift toward their initial values. This prepares parameters to adapt quickly to new tasks. On problems representative of different types of nonstationarity in continual supervised learning, we demonstrate that L2 Init most consistently mitigates plasticity loss compared to previously proposed approaches.</description>

      <title>Relational Concept Bottleneck Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.11991v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The design of interpretable deep learning models working in relational domains poses an open challenge: interpretable deep learning methods, such as Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs), are not designed to solve relational problems, while relational deep learning models, such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), are not as interpretable as CBMs. To overcome these limitations, we propose Relational Concept Bottleneck Models (R-CBMs), a family of relational deep learning methods providing interpretable task predictions. As special cases, we show that R-CBMs are capable of both representing standard CBMs and message-passing GNNs. To evaluate the effectiveness and versatility of these models, we designed a class of experimental problems, ranging from image classification to link prediction in knowledge graphs. In particular we show that R-CBMs (i) match generalization performance of existing relational black-boxes, (ii) support the generation of quantified concept-based explanations, (iii) effectively respond to test-time interventions, and (iv) withstand demanding settings including out-of-distribution scenarios, limited training data regimes, and scarce concept supervisions.</description>

      <title>Imputation using training labels and classification via label imputation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.16877v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Missing data is a common problem in practical data science settings. Various imputation methods have been developed to deal with missing data. However, even though the labels are available in the training data in many situations, the common practice of imputation usually only relies on the input and ignores the label. We propose Classification Based on MissForest Imputation (CBMI), a classification strategy that initializes the predicted test label with missing values and stacks the label with the input for imputation, allowing the label and the input to be imputed simultaneously. In addition, we propose the imputation using labels (IUL) algorithm, an imputation strategy that stacks the label into the input and illustrates how it can significantly improve the imputation quality. Experiments show that CBMI has classification accuracy when the test set contains missing data, especially for imbalanced data and categorical data. Moreover, for both the regression and classification, IUL consistently shows significantly better results than imputation based on only the input data.</description>

      <title>Two-Step Offline Preference-Based Reinforcement Learning with Constrained Actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00330v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Preference-based reinforcement learning (PBRL) in the offline setting has succeeded greatly in industrial applications such as chatbots. A two-step learning framework where one applies a reinforcement learning step after a reward modeling step has been widely adopted for the problem. However, such a method faces challenges from the risk of reward hacking and the complexity of reinforcement learning. To overcome the challenge, our insight is that both challenges come from the state-actions not supported in the dataset. Such state-actions are unreliable and increase the complexity of the reinforcement learning problem at the second step. Based on the insight, we develop a novel two-step learning method called PRC: preference-based reinforcement learning with constrained actions. The high-level idea is to limit the reinforcement learning agent to optimize over a constrained action space that excludes the out-of-distribution state-actions. We empirically verify that our method has high learning efficiency on various datasets in robotic control environments.</description>

Abstract: We introduce the CarSpeedNet, a deep learning model designed to estimate car speed using three-axis accelerometer data from smartphones. Using 13 hours of data collected from a smartphone in cars across various roads, CarSpeedNet accurately models the relationship between smartphone acceleration and car speed. Ground truth speed data was collected at 1 [Hz] from GPS receivers. The model provides high-frequency speed estimation by incorporating historical data and achieves a precision of less than 0.72 [m/s] during extended driving tests, relying solely on smartphone accelerometer data without any connection to the car.</description>

      <title>Assessing the Brittleness of Safety Alignment via Pruning and Low-Rank Modifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05162v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show inherent brittleness in their safety mechanisms, as evidenced by their susceptibility to jailbreaking and even non-malicious fine-tuning. This study explores this brittleness of safety alignment by leveraging pruning and low-rank modifications. We develop methods to identify critical regions that are vital for safety guardrails, and that are disentangled from utility-relevant regions at both the neuron and rank levels. Surprisingly, the isolated regions we find are sparse, comprising about $3\%$ at the parameter level and $2.5\%$ at the rank level. Removing these regions compromises safety without significantly impacting utility, corroborating the inherent brittleness of the model's safety mechanisms. Moreover, we show that LLMs remain vulnerable to low-cost fine-tuning attacks even when modifications to the safety-critical regions are restricted. These findings underscore the urgent need for more robust safety strategies in LLMs.</description>

      <title>Explaining Probabilistic Models with Distributional Values</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09947v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A large branch of explainable machine learning is grounded in cooperative game theory. However, research indicates that game-theoretic explanations may mislead or be hard to interpret. We argue that often there is a critical mismatch between what one wishes to explain (e.g. the output of a classifier) and what current methods such as SHAP explain (e.g. the scalar probability of a class). This paper addresses such gap for probabilistic models by generalising cooperative games and value operators. We introduce the distributional values, random variables that track changes in the model output (e.g. flipping of the predicted class) and derive their analytic expressions for games with Gaussian, Bernoulli and Categorical payoffs. We further establish several characterising properties, and show that our framework provides fine-grained and insightful explanations with case studies on vision and language models.</description>

      <title>ACE : Off-Policy Actor-Critic with Causality-Aware Entropy Regularization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14528v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The varying significance of distinct primitive behaviors during the policy learning process has been overlooked by prior model-free RL algorithms. Leveraging this insight, we explore the causal relationship between different action dimensions and rewards to evaluate the significance of various primitive behaviors during training. We introduce a causality-aware entropy term that effectively identifies and prioritizes actions with high potential impacts for efficient exploration. Furthermore, to prevent excessive focus on specific primitive behaviors, we analyze the gradient dormancy phenomenon and introduce a dormancy-guided reset mechanism to further enhance the efficacy of our method. Our proposed algorithm, ACE: Off-policy Actor-critic with Causality-aware Entropy regularization, demonstrates a substantial performance advantage across 29 diverse continuous control tasks spanning 7 domains compared to model-free RL baselines, which underscores the effectiveness, versatility, and efficient sample efficiency of our approach. Benchmark results and videos are available at https://ace-rl.github.io/.</description>

Abstract: Recent research has made significant progress in optimizing diffusion models for downstream objectives, which is an important pursuit in fields such as graph generation for drug design. However, directly applying these models to graph presents challenges, resulting in suboptimal performance. This paper introduces graph diffusion policy optimization (GDPO), a novel approach to optimize graph diffusion models for arbitrary (e.g., non-differentiable) objectives using reinforcement learning. GDPO is based on an eager policy gradient tailored for graph diffusion models, developed through meticulous analysis and promising improved performance. Experimental results show that GDPO achieves state-of-the-art performance in various graph generation tasks with complex and diverse objectives. Code is available at https://github.com/sail-sg/GDPO.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17699v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Discrete distributions, particularly in high-dimensional deep models, are often highly multimodal due to inherent discontinuities. While gradient-based discrete sampling has proven effective, it is susceptible to becoming trapped in local modes due to the gradient information. To tackle this challenge, we propose an automatic cyclical scheduling, designed for efficient and accurate sampling in multimodal discrete distributions. Our method contains three key components: (1) a cyclical step size schedule where large steps discover new modes and small steps exploit each mode; (2) a cyclical balancing schedule, ensuring "balanced" proposals for given step sizes and high efficiency of the Markov chain; and (3) an automatic tuning scheme for adjusting the hyperparameters in the cyclical schedules, allowing adaptability across diverse datasets with minimal tuning. We prove the non-asymptotic convergence and inference guarantee for our method in general discrete distributions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method in sampling complex multimodal discrete distributions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18153v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transfer learning has gained significant attention in recent deep learning research due to its ability to accelerate convergence and enhance performance on new tasks. However, its success is often contingent on the similarity between source and target data, and training on numerous datasets can be costly, leading to blind selection of pretrained models with limited insight into their effectiveness. To address these challenges, we introduce D2NWG, a diffusion-based neural network weights generation technique that efficiently produces high-performing weights for transfer learning, conditioned on the target dataset. Our method extends generative hyper-representation learning to recast the latent diffusion paradigm for neural network weights generation, learning the weight distributions of models pretrained on various datasets. This allows for automatic generation of weights that generalize well across both seen and unseen tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art meta-learning methods and pretrained models. Moreover, our approach is scalable to large architectures such as large language models (LLMs), overcoming the limitations of current parameter generation techniques that rely on task-specific model collections or access to original training data. By modeling the parameter distribution of LLMs, D2NWG enables task-specific parameter generation without requiring additional fine-tuning or large collections of model variants. Extensive experiments show that our method consistently enhances the performance of diverse base models, regardless of their size or complexity, positioning it as a robust solution for scalable transfer learning.</description>

      <title>Learning Heuristics for Transit Network Design and Improvement with Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05894v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transit agencies world-wide face tightening budgets. To maintain quality of service while cutting costs, efficient transit network design is essential. But planning a network of public transit routes is a challenging optimization problem. The most successful approaches to date use metaheuristic algorithms to search through the space of possible transit networks by applying low-level heuristics that randomly alter routes in a network. The design of these low-level heuristics has a major impact on the quality of the result. In this paper we use deep reinforcement learning with graph neural nets to learn low-level heuristics for an evolutionary algorithm, instead of designing them manually. These learned heuristics improve the algorithm's results on benchmark synthetic cities with 70 nodes or more, and obtain state-of-the-art results when optimizing operating costs. They also improve upon a simulation of the real transit network in the city of Laval, Canada, by as much as 54% and 18% on two key metrics, and offer cost savings of up to 12% over the city's existing transit network.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16159v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents AFU, an off-policy deep RL algorithm addressing in a new way the challenging "max-Q problem" in Q-learning for continuous action spaces, with a solution based on regression and conditional gradient scaling. AFU has an actor but its critic updates are entirely independent from it. As a consequence, the actor can be chosen freely. In the initial version, AFU-alpha, we employ the same stochastic actor as in Soft Actor-Critic (SAC), but we then study a simple failure mode of SAC and show how AFU can be modified to make actor updates less likely to become trapped in local optima, resulting in a second version of the algorithm, AFU-beta. Experimental results demonstrate the sample efficiency of both versions of AFU, marking it as the first model-free off-policy algorithm competitive with state-of-the-art actor-critic methods while departing from the actor-critic perspective.</description>

Abstract: While Machine Learning has become crucial for Industry 4.0, its opaque nature hinders trust and impedes the transformation of valuable insights into actionable decision, a challenge exacerbated in the evolving Industry 5.0 with its human-centric focus. This paper addresses this need by testing the applicability of AcME-AD in industrial settings. This recently developed framework facilitates fast and user-friendly explanations for anomaly detection. AcME-AD is model-agnostic, offering flexibility, and prioritizes real-time efficiency. Thus, it seems suitable for seamless integration with industrial Decision Support Systems. We present the first industrial application of AcME-AD, showcasing its effectiveness through experiments. These tests demonstrate AcME-AD's potential as a valuable tool for explainable AD and feature-based root cause analysis within industrial environments, paving the way for trustworthy and actionable insights in the age of Industry 5.0.</description>

Abstract: Wildfires have significant impacts on global vegetation, wildlife, and humans. They destroy plant communities and wildlife habitats and contribute to increased emissions of carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides, methane, and other pollutants. The prediction of wildfires relies on various independent variables combined with regression or machine learning methods. In this technical review, we describe the options for independent variables, data processing techniques, models, independent variables collinearity and importance estimation methods, and model performance evaluation metrics. First, we divide the independent variables into 4 aspects, including climate and meteorology conditions, socio-economical factors, terrain and hydrological features, and wildfire historical records. Second, preprocessing methods are described for different magnitudes, different spatial-temporal resolutions, and different formats of data. Third, the collinearity and importance evaluation methods of independent variables are also considered. Fourth, we discuss the application of statistical models, traditional machine learning models, and deep learning models in wildfire risk prediction. In this subsection, compared with other reviews, this manuscript particularly discusses the evaluation metrics and recent advancements in deep learning methods. Lastly, addressing the limitations of current research, this paper emphasizes the need for more effective deep learning time series forecasting algorithms, the utilization of three-dimensional data including ground and trunk fuel, extraction of more accurate historical fire point data, and improved model evaluation metrics.</description>

Abstract: Schr\"odinger bridge (SB) has emerged as the go-to method for optimizing transportation plans in diffusion models. However, SB requires estimating the intractable forward score functions, inevitably resulting in the costly implicit training loss based on simulated trajectories. To improve the scalability while preserving efficient transportation plans, we leverage variational inference to linearize the forward score functions (variational scores) of SB and restore simulation-free properties in training backward scores. We propose the variational Schr\"odinger diffusion model (VSDM), where the forward process is a multivariate diffusion and the variational scores are adaptively optimized for efficient transport. Theoretically, we use stochastic approximation to prove the convergence of the variational scores and show the convergence of the adaptively generated samples based on the optimal variational scores. Empirically, we test the algorithm in simulated examples and observe that VSDM is efficient in generations of anisotropic shapes and yields straighter sample trajectories compared to the single-variate diffusion. We also verify the scalability of the algorithm in real-world data and achieve competitive unconditional generation performance in CIFAR10 and conditional generation in time series modeling. Notably, VSDM no longer depends on warm-up initializations and has become tuning-friendly in training large-scale experiments.</description>

Abstract: Generating videos with realistic and physically plausible motion is one of the main recent challenges in computer vision. While diffusion models are achieving compelling results in image generation, video diffusion models are limited by heavy training and huge models, resulting in videos that are still biased to the training dataset. In this work we propose MotionCraft, a new zero-shot video generator to craft physics-based and realistic videos. MotionCraft is able to warp the noise latent space of an image diffusion model, such as Stable Diffusion, by applying an optical flow derived from a physics simulation. We show that warping the noise latent space results in coherent application of the desired motion while allowing the model to generate missing elements consistent with the scene evolution, which would otherwise result in artefacts or missing content if the flow was applied in the pixel space. We compare our method with the state-of-the-art Text2Video-Zero reporting qualitative and quantitative improvements, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach to generate videos with finely-prescribed complex motion dynamics.

      <title>What Variables Affect Out-of-Distribution Generalization in Pretrained Models?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15018v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Embeddings produced by pre-trained deep neural networks (DNNs) are widely used; however, their efficacy for downstream tasks can vary widely. We study the factors influencing transferability and out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization of pre-trained DNN embeddings through the lens of the tunnel effect hypothesis, which is closely related to intermediate neural collapse. This hypothesis suggests that deeper DNN layers compress representations and hinder OOD generalization. Contrary to earlier work, our experiments show this is not a universal phenomenon. We comprehensively investigate the impact of DNN architecture, training data, image resolution, and augmentations on transferability. We identify that training with high-resolution datasets containing many classes greatly reduces representation compression and improves transferability. Our results emphasize the danger of generalizing findings from toy datasets to broader contexts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17277v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tuning scientific and probabilistic machine learning models $-$ for example, partial differential equations, Gaussian processes, or Bayesian neural networks $-$ often relies on evaluating functions of matrices whose size grows with the data set or the number of parameters. While the state-of-the-art for evaluating these quantities is almost always based on Lanczos and Arnoldi iterations, the present work is the first to explain how to differentiate these workhorses of numerical linear algebra efficiently. To get there, we derive previously unknown adjoint systems for Lanczos and Arnoldi iterations, implement them in JAX, and show that the resulting code can compete with Diffrax when it comes to differentiating PDEs, GPyTorch for selecting Gaussian process models and beats standard factorisation methods for calibrating Bayesian neural networks. All this is achieved without any problem-specific code optimisation. Find the code at https://github.com/pnkraemer/experiments-lanczos-adjoints and install the library with pip install matfree.</description>

      <title>A Geometric View of Data Complexity: Efficient Local Intrinsic Dimension Estimation with Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03537v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-dimensional data commonly lies on low-dimensional submanifolds, and estimating the local intrinsic dimension (LID) of a datum -- i.e. the dimension of the submanifold it belongs to -- is a longstanding problem. LID can be understood as the number of local factors of variation: the more factors of variation a datum has, the more complex it tends to be. Estimating this quantity has proven useful in contexts ranging from generalization in neural networks to detection of out-of-distribution data, adversarial examples, and AI-generated text. The recent successes of deep generative models present an opportunity to leverage them for LID estimation, but current methods based on generative models produce inaccurate estimates, require more than a single pre-trained model, are computationally intensive, or do not exploit the best available deep generative models: diffusion models (DMs). In this work, we show that the Fokker-Planck equation associated with a DM can provide an LID estimator which addresses the aforementioned deficiencies. Our estimator, called FLIPD, is easy to implement and compatible with all popular DMs. Applying FLIPD to synthetic LID estimation benchmarks, we find that DMs implemented as fully-connected networks are highly effective LID estimators that outperform existing baselines. We also apply FLIPD to natural images where the true LID is unknown. Despite being sensitive to the choice of network architecture, FLIPD estimates remain a useful measure of relative complexity; compared to competing estimators, FLIPD exhibits a consistently higher correlation with image PNG compression rate and better aligns with qualitative assessments of complexity. Notably, FLIPD is orders of magnitude faster than other LID estimators, and the first to be tractable at the scale of Stable Diffusion.</description>

      <title>Beyond Model Collapse: Scaling Up with Synthesized Data Requires Verification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07515v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLM) are increasingly trained on data generated by other LLM, either because generated text and images become part of the pre-training corpus, or because synthetized data is used as a replacement for expensive human-annotation. This raises concerns about \emph{model collapse}, a drop in model performance when their training sets include generated data. Considering that it is easier for both humans and machines to tell between good and bad examples than to generate high-quality samples, we investigate the use of verification on synthesized data to prevent model collapse. We provide a theoretical characterization using Gaussian mixtures, linear classifiers, and linear verifiers to derive conditions with measurable proxies to assess whether the verifier can effectively select synthesized data that leads to optimal performance. We experiment with two practical tasks -- computing matrix eigenvalues with transformers and news summarization with LLMs -- which both exhibit model collapse when trained on generated data, and show that verifiers, even imperfect ones, can indeed be harnessed to prevent model collapse and that our proposed proxy measure strongly correlates with performance.</description>

      <title>Measuring memorization in RLHF for code completion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11715v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) has become the dominant method to align large models to user preferences. Unlike fine-tuning, for which there are many studies regarding training data memorization, it is not clear how memorization is affected by or introduced in the RLHF alignment process. Understanding this relationship is important as real user data may be collected and used to align large models; if user data is memorized during RLHF and later regurgitated, this could raise privacy concerns. In addition to RLHF, other methods such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and $\Psi$PO have gained popularity for learning directly from human preferences, removing the need for optimizing intermediary reward models with reinforcement learning. In this work, we analyze how training data memorization can surface and propagate through each phase of RLHF and direct preference learning. We focus our study on code completion models, as code completion is one of the most popular use cases for large language models. We find that RLHF significantly decreases the chance that data used for reward modeling and reinforcement learning is memorized in comparison to directly fine-tuning on this data, but that examples already memorized during the fine-tuning stage of RLHF, will, in the majority of cases, remain memorized after RLHF. In contrast, we find that aligning by learning directly from human preference data via a special case of $\Psi$PO, Identity Preference Optimization (IPO), increases the likelihood that training data is regurgitated compared to RLHF. Our work suggests that RLHF, as opposed to direct preference learning, is a safer way to mitigate the risk of regurgitating sensitive preference data when aligning large language models. We find our conclusions are robust across multiple code completion datasets, tasks, and model scales.</description>

      <title>An Optimal Tightness Bound for the Simulation Lemma</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16249v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a bound for value-prediction error with respect to model misspecification that is tight, including constant factors. This is a direct improvement of the "simulation lemma," a foundational result in reinforcement learning. We demonstrate that existing bounds are quite loose, becoming vacuous for large discount factors, due to the suboptimal treatment of compounding probability errors. By carefully considering this quantity on its own, instead of as a subcomponent of value error, we derive a bound that is sub-linear with respect to transition function misspecification. We then demonstrate broader applicability of this technique, improving a similar bound in the related subfield of hierarchical abstraction.</description>

      <title>Q-Adapter: Customizing Pre-trained LLMs to New Preferences with Forgetting Mitigation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03856v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), trained on a large amount of corpus, have demonstrated remarkable abilities. However, it may not be sufficient to directly apply open-source LLMs like Llama to certain real-world scenarios, since most of them are trained for \emph{general} purposes. Thus, the demands for customizing publicly available LLMs emerge, but are currently under-studied. In this work, we consider customizing pre-trained LLMs with new human preferences. Specifically, the LLM should not only meet the new preference but also preserve its original capabilities after customization. Drawing inspiration from the observation that human preference can be expressed as a reward model, we propose to cast LLM customization as optimizing the sum of two reward functions, one of which (denoted as $r_1$) was used to pre-train the LLM while the other (denoted as $r_2$) characterizes the new human preference. The obstacle here is that both reward functions are unknown, making the application of modern reinforcement learning methods infeasible. Thanks to the residual Q-learning framework, we can restore the customized LLM with the pre-trained LLM and the \emph{residual Q-function} without the reward function $r_1$. Moreover, we find that for a fixed pre-trained LLM, the reward function $r_2$ can be derived from the residual Q-function, enabling us to directly learn the residual Q-function from the new human preference data upon the Bradley-Terry model. We name our method Q-Adapter as it introduces an adapter module to approximate the residual Q-function for customizing the pre-trained LLM towards the new preference. Experiments based on the Llama-3.1 model on the DSP dataset and HH-RLHF dataset illustrate the superior effectiveness of Q-Adapter on both retaining existing knowledge and learning new preferences.

      <title>Active Label Refinement for Robust Training of Imbalanced Medical Image Classification Tasks in the Presence of High Label Noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05973v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The robustness of supervised deep learning-based medical image classification is significantly undermined by label noise. Although several methods have been proposed to enhance classification performance in the presence of noisy labels, they face some challenges: 1) a struggle with class-imbalanced datasets, leading to the frequent overlooking of minority classes as noisy samples; 2) a singular focus on maximizing performance using noisy datasets, without incorporating experts-in-the-loop for actively cleaning the noisy labels. To mitigate these challenges, we propose a two-phase approach that combines Learning with Noisy Labels (LNL) and active learning. This approach not only improves the robustness of medical image classification in the presence of noisy labels, but also iteratively improves the quality of the dataset by relabeling the important incorrect labels, under a limited annotation budget. Furthermore, we introduce a novel Variance of Gradients approach in LNL phase, which complements the loss-based sample selection by also sampling under-represented samples. Using two imbalanced noisy medical classification datasets, we demonstrate that that our proposed technique is superior to its predecessors at handling class imbalance by not misidentifying clean samples from minority classes as mostly noisy samples.</description>

      <title>Learning Unlabeled Clients Divergence for Federated Semi-Supervised Learning via Anchor Model Aggregation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10327v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Federated semi-supervised learning (FedSemi) refers to scenarios where there may be clients with fully labeled data, clients with partially labeled, and even fully unlabeled clients while preserving data privacy. However, challenges arise from client drift due to undefined heterogeneous class distributions and erroneous pseudo-labels. Existing FedSemi methods typically fail to aggregate models from unlabeled clients due to their inherent unreliability, thus overlooking unique information from their heterogeneous data distribution, leading to sub-optimal results. In this paper, we enable unlabeled client aggregation through SemiAnAgg, a novel Semi-supervised Anchor-Based federated Aggregation. SemiAnAgg learns unlabeled client contributions via an anchor model, effectively harnessing their informative value. Our key idea is that by feeding local client data to the same global model and the same consistently initialized anchor model (i.e., random model), we can measure the importance of each unlabeled client accordingly. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SemiAnAgg achieves new state-of-the-art results on four widely used FedSemi benchmarks, leading to substantial performance improvements: a 9% increase in accuracy on CIFAR-100 and a 7.6% improvement in recall on the medical dataset ISIC-18, compared with prior state-of-the-art.

      <description>arXiv:2407.15421v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: How a neural network (NN) generalizes to novel situations depends on whether it has learned to select actions heuristically or via a planning process. "An investigation of model-free planning" (Guez et al. 2019) found that a recurrent NN (RNN) trained to play Sokoban appears to plan, with extra computation steps improving the RNN's success rate. We replicate and expand on their behavioral analysis, finding the RNN learns to give itself extra computation steps in complex situations by "pacing" in cycles. Moreover, we train linear probes that predict the future actions taken by the network and find that intervening on the hidden state using these probes controls the agent's subsequent actions. Leveraging these insights, we perform model surgery, enabling the convolutional NN to generalize beyond its 10x10 architectural limit to arbitrarily sized inputs. The resulting model solves challenging, highly off-distribution levels. We open-source our model and code, and believe the neural network's small size (1.29M parameters) makes it an excellent model organism to deepen our understanding of learned planning.</description>

      <title>Advanced deep-reinforcement-learning methods for flow control: group-invariant and positional-encoding networks improve learning speed and quality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17822v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Flow control is key to maximize energy efficiency in a wide range of applications. However, traditional flow-control methods face significant challenges in addressing non-linear systems and high-dimensional data, limiting their application in realistic energy systems. This study advances deep-reinforcement-learning (DRL) methods for flow control, particularly focusing on integrating group-invariant networks and positional encoding into DRL architectures. Our methods leverage multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to exploit policy invariance in space, in combination with group-invariant networks to ensure local symmetry invariance. Additionally, a positional encoding inspired by the transformer architecture is incorporated to provide location information to the agents, mitigating action constraints from strict invariance. The proposed methods are verified using a case study of Rayleigh-B\'enard convection, where the goal is to minimize the Nusselt number Nu. The group-invariant neural networks (GI-NNs) show faster convergence compared to the base MARL, achieving better average policy performance. The GI-NNs not only cut DRL training time in half but also notably enhance learning reproducibility. Positional encoding further enhances these results, effectively reducing the minimum Nu and stabilizing convergence. Interestingly, group invariant networks specialize in improving learning speed and positional encoding specializes in improving learning quality. These results demonstrate that choosing a suitable feature-representation method according to the purpose as well as the characteristics of each control problem is essential. We believe that the results of this study will not only inspire novel DRL methods with invariant and unique representations, but also provide useful insights for industrial applications.</description>

      <title>On Biases in a UK Biobank-based Retinal Image Classification Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02676v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent work has uncovered alarming disparities in the performance of machine learning models in healthcare. In this study, we explore whether such disparities are present in the UK Biobank fundus retinal images by training and evaluating a disease classification model on these images. We assess possible disparities across various population groups and find substantial differences despite strong overall performance of the model. In particular, we discover unfair performance for certain assessment centres, which is surprising given the rigorous data standardisation protocol. We compare how these differences emerge and apply a range of existing bias mitigation methods to each one. A key insight is that each disparity has unique properties and responds differently to the mitigation methods. We also find that these methods are largely unable to enhance fairness, highlighting the need for better bias mitigation methods tailored to the specific type of bias.</description>

      <title>Derivative-Free Guidance in Continuous and Discrete Diffusion Models with Soft Value-Based Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08252v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion models excel at capturing the natural design spaces of images, molecules, DNA, RNA, and protein sequences. However, rather than merely generating designs that are natural, we often aim to optimize downstream reward functions while preserving the naturalness of these design spaces. Existing methods for achieving this goal often require ``differentiable'' proxy models (\textit{e.g.}, classifier guidance or DPS) or involve computationally expensive fine-tuning of diffusion models (\textit{e.g.}, classifier-free guidance, RL-based fine-tuning). In our work, we propose a new method to address these challenges. Our algorithm is an iterative sampling method that integrates soft value functions, which looks ahead to how intermediate noisy states lead to high rewards in the future, into the standard inference procedure of pre-trained diffusion models. Notably, our approach avoids fine-tuning generative models and eliminates the need to construct differentiable models. This enables us to (1) directly utilize non-differentiable features/reward feedback, commonly used in many scientific domains, and (2) apply our method to recent discrete diffusion models in a principled way. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm across several domains, including image generation, molecule generation, and DNA/RNA sequence generation.

      <title>Deep-MacroFin: Informed Equilibrium Neural Network for Continuous Time Economic Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10368v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present Deep-MacroFin, a comprehensive framework designed to solve partial differential equations, with a particular focus on models in continuous time economics. This framework leverages deep learning methodologies, including conventional Multi-Layer Perceptrons and the newly developed Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks. It is optimized using economic information encapsulated by Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations and coupled algebraic equations. The application of neural networks holds the promise of accurately resolving high-dimensional problems with fewer computational demands and limitations compared to standard numerical methods. This versatile framework can be readily adapted for elementary differential equations, and systems of differential equations, even in cases where the solutions may exhibit discontinuities. Importantly, it offers a more straightforward and user-friendly implementation than existing libraries.</description>

      <title>Masked Diffusion Models are Secretly Time-Agnostic Masked Models and Exploit Inaccurate Categorical Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02908v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Masked diffusion models (MDMs) have emerged as a popular research topic for generative modeling of discrete data, thanks to their superior performance over other discrete diffusion models, and are rivaling the auto-regressive models (ARMs) for language modeling tasks. The recent effort in simplifying the masked diffusion framework further leads to alignment with continuous-space diffusion models and more principled training and sampling recipes. In this paper, however, we reveal that both training and sampling of MDMs are theoretically free from the time variable, arguably the key signature of diffusion models, and are instead equivalent to masked models. The connection on the sampling aspect is drawn by our proposed first-hitting sampler (FHS). Specifically, we show that the FHS is theoretically equivalent to MDMs' original generation process while significantly alleviating the time-consuming categorical sampling and achieving a 20$\times$ speedup. In addition, our investigation raises doubts about whether MDMs can truly beat ARMs in text generation. We identify, for the first time, an underlying numerical issue, even with the commonly used 32-bit floating-point precision, which results in inaccurate categorical sampling. We show that it lowers the effective temperature both theoretically and empirically, and the resulting decrease in token diversity makes previous evaluations, which assess the generation quality solely through the incomplete generative perplexity metric, somewhat unfair.</description>

      <title>Towards Interpretable End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) Prediction: Utilizing Administrative Claims Data with Explainable AI Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12087v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study explores the potential of utilizing administrative claims data, combined with advanced machine learning and deep learning techniques, to predict the progression of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) to End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD). We analyze a comprehensive, 10-year dataset provided by a major health insurance organization to develop prediction models for multiple observation windows using traditional machine learning methods such as Random Forest and XGBoost as well as deep learning approaches such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. Our findings demonstrate that the LSTM model, particularly with a 24-month observation window, exhibits superior performance in predicting ESRD progression, outperforming existing models in the literature. We further apply SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis to enhance interpretability, providing insights into the impact of individual features on predictions at the individual patient level. This study underscores the value of leveraging administrative claims data for CKD management and predicting ESRD progression.</description>

      <title>iCost: A Novel Instance Complexity Based Cost-Sensitive Learning Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13007v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Class imbalance in data presents significant challenges for classification tasks. It is fairly common and requires careful handling to obtain desirable performance. Traditional classification algorithms become biased toward the majority class. One way to alleviate the scenario is to make the classifiers cost-sensitive. This is achieved by assigning a higher misclassification cost to minority-class instances. One issue with this implementation is that all the minority-class instances are treated equally, and assigned with the same penalty value. However, the learning difficulties of all the instances are not the same. Instances that are located in the overlapping region or near the decision boundary are harder to classify, whereas those further away are easier. Without taking into consideration the instance complexity and naively weighting all the minority-class samples uniformly, results in an unwarranted bias and consequently, a higher number of misclassifications of the majority-class instances. This is undesirable and to overcome the situation, we propose a novel instance complexity-based cost-sensitive approach (termed 'iCost') in this study. We first categorize all the minority-class instances based on their difficulty level and then the instances are penalized accordingly. This ensures a more equitable instance weighting and prevents excessive penalization. The performance of the proposed approach is tested on 65 binary and 10 multiclass imbalanced datasets against the traditional cost-sensitive learning frameworks. A significant improvement in performance has been observed, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13770v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel nonlinear programming-based approach to fine-tune pre-trained neural networks to improve robustness against adversarial attacks while maintaining high accuracy on clean data. Our method introduces adversary-correction constraints to ensure correct classification of adversarial data and minimizes changes to the model parameters. We propose an efficient cutting-plane-based algorithm to iteratively solve the large-scale nonconvex optimization problem by approximating the feasible region through polyhedral cuts and balancing between robustness and accuracy. Computational experiments on standard datasets such as MNIST and CIFAR10 demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly improves robustness, even with a very small set of adversarial data, while maintaining minimal impact on accuracy.</description>

      <title>One-shot World Models Using a Transformer Trained on a Synthetic Prior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14084v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A World Model is a compressed spatial and temporal representation of a real world environment that allows one to train an agent or execute planning methods. However, world models are typically trained on observations from the real world environment, and they usually do not enable learning policies for other real environments. We propose One-Shot World Model (OSWM), a transformer world model that is learned in an in-context learning fashion from purely synthetic data sampled from a prior distribution. Our prior is composed of multiple randomly initialized neural networks, where each network models the dynamics of each state and reward dimension of a desired target environment. We adopt the supervised learning procedure of Prior-Fitted Networks by masking next-state and reward at random context positions and query OSWM to make probabilistic predictions based on the remaining transition context. During inference time, OSWM is able to quickly adapt to the dynamics of a simple grid world, as well as the CartPole gym and a custom control environment by providing 1k transition steps as context and is then able to successfully train environment-solving agent policies. However, transferring to more complex environments remains a challenge, currently. Despite these limitations, we see this work as an important stepping-stone in the pursuit of learning world models purely from synthetic data.</description>

      <title>Selective Test-Time Adaptation for Unsupervised Anomaly Detection using Neural Implicit Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03306v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep learning models in medical imaging often encounter challenges when adapting to new clinical settings unseen during training. Test-time adaptation offers a promising approach to optimize models for these unseen domains, yet its application in anomaly detection (AD) remains largely unexplored. AD aims to efficiently identify deviations from normative distributions; however, full adaptation, including pathological shifts, may inadvertently learn the anomalies it intends to detect. We introduce a novel concept of selective test-time adaptation that utilizes the inherent characteristics of deep pre-trained features to adapt selectively in a zero-shot manner to any test image from an unseen domain. This approach employs a model-agnostic, lightweight multi-layer perceptron for neural implicit representations, enabling the adaptation of outputs from any reconstruction-based AD method without altering the source-trained model. Rigorous validation in brain AD demonstrated that our strategy substantially enhances detection accuracy for multiple conditions and different target distributions. Specifically, our method improves the detection rates by up to 78% for enlarged ventricles and 24% for edemas.</description>

      <title>Distributionally robust self-supervised learning for tabular data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08511v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models trained using Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) often exhibit systematic errors on specific subpopulations of tabular data, known as error slices. Learning robust representation in presence of error slices is challenging, especially in self-supervised settings during the feature reconstruction phase, due to high cardinality features and the complexity of constructing error sets. Traditional robust representation learning methods are largely focused on improving worst group performance in supervised setting in computer vision, leaving a gap in approaches tailored for tabular data. We address this gap by developing a framework to learn robust representation in tabular data during self-supervised pre-training. Our approach utilizes an encoder-decoder model trained with Masked Language Modeling (MLM) loss to learn robust latent representations. This paper applies the Just Train Twice (JTT) and Deep Feature Reweighting (DFR) methods during the pre-training phase for tabular data. These methods fine-tune the ERM pre-trained model by up-weighting error-prone samples or creating balanced datasets for specific categorical features. This results in specialized models for each feature, which are then used in an ensemble approach to enhance downstream classification performance. This methodology improves robustness across slices, thus enhancing overall generalization performance. Extensive experiments across various datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our approach. The code is available: \url{https://github.com/amazon-science/distributionally-robust-self-supervised-learning-for-tabular-data}.</description>

      <title>Automated Rewards via LLM-Generated Progress Functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09187v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have the potential to automate reward engineering by leveraging their broad domain knowledge across various tasks. However, they often need many iterations of trial-and-error to generate effective reward functions. This process is costly because evaluating every sampled reward function requires completing the full policy optimization process for each function. In this paper, we introduce an LLM-driven reward generation framework that is able to produce state-of-the-art policies on the challenging Bi-DexHands benchmark with 20x fewer reward function samples than the prior state-of-the-art work. Our key insight is that we reduce the problem of generating task-specific rewards to the problem of coarsely estimating task progress. Our two-step solution leverages the task domain knowledge and the code synthesis abilities of LLMs to author progress functions that estimate task progress from a given state. Then, we use this notion of progress to discretize states, and generate count-based intrinsic rewards using the low-dimensional state space. We show that the combination of LLM-generated progress functions and count-based intrinsic rewards is essential for our performance gains, while alternatives such as generic hash-based counts or using progress directly as a reward function fall short.</description>

      <title>LoLCATs: On Low-Rank Linearizing of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10254v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent works show we can linearize large language models (LLMs) -- swapping the quadratic attentions of popular Transformer-based LLMs with subquadratic analogs, such as linear attention -- avoiding the expensive pretraining costs. However, linearizing LLMs often significantly degrades model quality, still requires training over billions of tokens, and remains limited to smaller 1.3B to 7B LLMs. We thus propose Low-rank Linear Conversion via Attention Transfer (LoLCATs), a simple two-step method that improves LLM linearizing quality with orders of magnitudes less memory and compute. We base these steps on two findings. First, we can replace an LLM's softmax attentions with closely-approximating linear attentions, simply by training the linear attentions to match their softmax counterparts with an output MSE loss ("attention transfer"). Then, this enables adjusting for approximation errors and recovering LLM quality simply with low-rank adaptation (LoRA). LoLCATs significantly improves linearizing quality, training efficiency, and scalability. We significantly reduce the linearizing quality gap and produce state-of-the-art subquadratic LLMs from Llama 3 8B and Mistral 7B v0.1, leading to 20+ points of improvement on 5-shot MMLU. Furthermore, LoLCATs does so with only 0.2% of past methods' model parameters and 0.4% of their training tokens. Finally, we apply LoLCATs to create the first linearized 70B and 405B LLMs (50x larger than prior work). When compared with prior approaches under the same compute budgets, LoLCATs significantly improves linearizing quality, closing the gap between linearized and original Llama 3.1 70B and 405B LLMs by 77.8% and 78.1% on 5-shot MMLU.</description>

      <title>Loss Landscape Characterization of Neural Networks without Over-Parametrization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12455v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optimization methods play a crucial role in modern machine learning, powering the remarkable empirical achievements of deep learning models. These successes are even more remarkable given the complex non-convex nature of the loss landscape of these models. Yet, ensuring the convergence of optimization methods requires specific structural conditions on the objective function that are rarely satisfied in practice. One prominent example is the widely recognized Polyak-Lojasiewicz (PL) inequality, which has gained considerable attention in recent years. However, validating such assumptions for deep neural networks entails substantial and often impractical levels of over-parametrization. In order to address this limitation, we propose a novel class of functions that can characterize the loss landscape of modern deep models without requiring extensive over-parametrization and can also include saddle points. Crucially, we prove that gradient-based optimizers possess theoretical guarantees of convergence under this assumption. Finally, we validate the soundness of our new function class through both theoretical analysis and empirical experimentation across a diverse range of deep learning models.</description>

Abstract: The study conducted by Shumailov et al. (2024) demonstrates that repeatedly training a generative model on synthetic data leads to model collapse. This finding has generated considerable interest and debate, particularly given that current models have nearly exhausted the available data. In this work, we investigate the effects of fitting a distribution (through Kernel Density Estimation, or KDE) or a model to the data, followed by repeated sampling from it. Our objective is to develop a theoretical understanding of the phenomenon observed by Shumailov et al. (2024). Our results indicate that the outcomes reported are a statistical phenomenon and may be unavoidable.</description>

Abstract: We introduce MODEL SELECTOR, a framework for label-efficient selection of pretrained classifiers. Given a pool of unlabeled target data, MODEL SELECTOR samples a small subset of highly informative examples for labeling, in order to efficiently identify the best pretrained model for deployment on this target dataset. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that MODEL SELECTOR drastically reduces the need for labeled data while consistently picking the best or near-best performing model. Across 18 model collections on 16 different datasets, comprising over 1,500 pretrained models, MODEL SELECTOR reduces the labeling cost by up to 94.15% to identify the best model compared to the cost of the strongest baseline. Our results further highlight the robustness of MODEL SELECTOR in model selection, as it reduces the labeling cost by up to 72.41% when selecting a near-best model, whose accuracy is only within 1% of the best model.</description>

      <title>DistRL: An Asynchronous Distributed Reinforcement Learning Framework for On-Device Control Agents</title>

Abstract: On-device control agents, especially on mobile devices, are responsible for operating mobile devices to fulfill users' requests, enabling seamless and intuitive interactions. Integrating Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) into these agents enhances their ability to understand and execute complex commands, thereby improving user experience. However, fine-tuning MLLMs for on-device control presents significant challenges due to limited data availability and inefficient online training processes. This paper introduces DistRL, a novel framework designed to enhance the efficiency of online RL fine-tuning for mobile device control agents. DistRL employs centralized training and decentralized data acquisition to ensure efficient fine-tuning in the context of dynamic online interactions. Additionally, the framework is backed by our tailor-made RL algorithm, which effectively balances exploration with the prioritized utilization of collected data to ensure stable and robust training. Our experiments show that, on average, DistRL delivers a 3X improvement in training efficiency and enables training data collection 2.4X faster than the leading synchronous multi-machine methods. Notably, after training, DistRL achieves a 20% relative improvement in success rate compared to state-of-the-art methods on general Android tasks from an open benchmark, significantly outperforming existing approaches while maintaining the same training time. These results validate DistRL as a scalable and efficient solution, offering substantial improvements in both training efficiency and agent performance for real-world, in-the-wild device control tasks.</description>

      <title>On Designing Effective RL Reward at Training Time for LLM Reasoning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15115v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reward models have been increasingly critical for improving the reasoning capability of LLMs. Existing research has shown that a well-trained reward model can substantially improve model performances at inference time via search. However, the potential of reward models during RL training time still remains largely under-explored. It is currently unclear whether these reward models can provide additional training signals to enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs in RL training that uses sparse success rewards, which verify the correctness of solutions. In this work, we evaluate popular reward models for RL training, including the Outcome-supervised Reward Model (ORM) and the Process-supervised Reward Model (PRM), and train a collection of LLMs for math problems using RL by combining these learned rewards with success rewards. Surprisingly, even though these learned reward models have strong inference-time performances, they may NOT help or even hurt RL training, producing worse performances than LLMs trained with the success reward only. Our analysis reveals that an LLM can receive high rewards from some of these reward models by repeating correct but unnecessary reasoning steps, leading to a severe reward hacking issue. Therefore, we introduce two novel reward refinement techniques, including Clipping and Delta. The key idea is to ensure the accumulative reward of any reasoning trajectory is upper-bounded to keep a learned reward model effective without being exploited. We evaluate our techniques with multiple reward models over a set of 1.5B and 7B LLMs on MATH and GSM8K benchmarks and demonstrate that with a carefully designed reward function, RL training without any additional supervised tuning can improve all the evaluated LLMs, including the state-of-the-art 7B LLM Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct on MATH and GSM8K benchmarks.</description>

      <title>LFME: A Simple Framework for Learning from Multiple Experts in Domain Generalization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17020v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Domain generalization (DG) methods aim to maintain good performance in an unseen target domain by using training data from multiple source domains. While success on certain occasions are observed, enhancing the baseline across most scenarios remains challenging. This work introduces a simple yet effective framework, dubbed learning from multiple experts (LFME), that aims to make the target model an expert in all source domains to improve DG. Specifically, besides learning the target model used in inference, LFME will also train multiple experts specialized in different domains, whose output probabilities provide professional guidance by simply regularizing the logit of the target model. Delving deep into the framework, we reveal that the introduced logit regularization term implicitly provides effects of enabling the target model to harness more information, and mining hard samples from the experts during training. Extensive experiments on benchmarks from different DG tasks demonstrate that LFME is consistently beneficial to the baseline and can achieve comparable performance to existing arts. Code is available at~\url{https://github.com/liangchen527/LFME}.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Upper Confidence Bounds for Constrained Online Learning</title>

Abstract: The multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem is a foundational framework in sequential decision-making under uncertainty, extensively studied for its applications in areas such as clinical trials, online advertising, and resource allocation. Traditional MAB formulations, however, do not adequately capture scenarios where decisions are structured hierarchically, involve multi-level constraints, or feature context-dependent action spaces. In this paper, we introduce the hierarchical constrained bandits (HCB) framework, which extends the contextual bandit problem to incorporate hierarchical decision structures and multi-level constraints. We propose the hierarchical constrained upper confidence bound (HC-UCB) algorithm, designed to address the complexities of the HCB problem by leveraging confidence bounds within a hierarchical setting. Our theoretical analysis establishes sublinear regret bounds for HC-UCB and provides high-probability guarantees for constraint satisfaction at all hierarchical levels. Furthermore, we derive a minimax lower bound on the regret for the HCB problem, demonstrating the near-optimality of our algorithm. The results are significant for real-world applications where decision-making processes are inherently hierarchical and constrained, offering a robust and efficient solution that balances exploration and exploitation across multiple levels of decision-making.</description>

      <title>Evolution with Opponent-Learning Awareness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17466v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The universe involves many independent co-learning agents as an ever-evolving part of our observed environment. Yet, in practice, Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) applications are usually constrained to small, homogeneous populations and remain computationally intensive. In this paper, we study how large heterogeneous populations of learning agents evolve in normal-form games. We show how, under assumptions commonly made in the multi-armed bandit literature, Multi-Agent Policy Gradient closely resembles the Replicator Dynamic, and we further derive a fast, parallelizable implementation of Opponent-Learning Awareness tailored for evolutionary simulations. This enables us to simulate the evolution of very large populations made of heterogeneous co-learning agents, under both naive and advanced learning strategies. We demonstrate our approach in simulations of 200,000 agents, evolving in the classic games of Hawk-Dove, Stag-Hunt, and Rock-Paper-Scissors. Each game highlights distinct ways in which Opponent-Learning Awareness affects evolution.</description>

      <title>The Double-Edged Sword of Behavioral Responses in Strategic Classification: Theory and User Studies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18066v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When humans are subject to an algorithmic decision system, they can strategically adjust their behavior accordingly (``game'' the system). While a growing line of literature on strategic classification has used game-theoretic modeling to understand and mitigate such gaming, these existing works consider standard models of fully rational agents. In this paper, we propose a strategic classification model that considers behavioral biases in human responses to algorithms. We show how misperceptions of a classifier (specifically, of its feature weights) can lead to different types of discrepancies between biased and rational agents' responses, and identify when behavioral agents over- or under-invest in different features. We also show that strategic agents with behavioral biases can benefit or (perhaps, unexpectedly) harm the firm compared to fully rational strategic agents. We complement our analytical results with user studies, which support our hypothesis of behavioral biases in human responses to the algorithm. Together, our findings highlight the need to account for human (cognitive) biases when designing AI systems, and providing explanations of them, to strategic human in the loop.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Attribution Score: Evaluating Training Data Influence in Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18639v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As diffusion models become increasingly popular, the misuse of copyrighted and private images has emerged as a major concern. One promising solution to mitigate this issue is identifying the contribution of specific training samples in generative models, a process known as data attribution. Existing data attribution methods for diffusion models typically quantify the contribution of a training sample by evaluating the change in diffusion loss when the sample is included or excluded from the training process. However, we argue that the direct usage of diffusion loss cannot represent such a contribution accurately due to the calculation of diffusion loss. Specifically, these approaches measure the divergence between predicted and ground truth distributions, which leads to an indirect comparison between the predicted distributions and cannot represent the variances between model behaviors. To address these issues, we aim to measure the direct comparison between predicted distributions with an attribution score to analyse the training sample importance, which is achieved by Diffusion Attribution Score (DAS). Underpinned by rigorous theoretical analysis, we elucidate the effectiveness of DAS. Additionally, we explore strategies to accelerate DAS calculations, facilitating its application to large-scale diffusion models. Our extensive experiments across various datasets and diffusion models demonstrate that DAS significantly surpasses previous benchmarks in terms of the linear data-modelling score, establishing new state-of-the-art performance.</description>

      <title>$C^2$: Scalable Auto-Feedback for LLM-based Chart Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18652v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generating high-quality charts with Large Language Models presents significant challenges due to limited data and the high cost of scaling through human curation. Instruction, data, and code triplets are scarce and expensive to manually curate as their creation demands technical expertise. To address this scalability issue, we introduce a reference-free automatic feedback generator, which eliminates the need for costly human intervention. Our novel framework, $C^2$, consists of (1) an automatic feedback provider (ChartAF) and (2) a diverse, reference-free dataset (ChartUIE-8K). Quantitative results are compelling: in our first experiment, 74% of respondents strongly preferred, and 10% preferred, the results after feedback. The second post-feedback experiment demonstrates that ChartAF outperforms nine baselines. Moreover, ChartUIE-8K significantly improves data diversity by increasing queries, datasets, and chart types by 5982%, 1936%, and 91%, respectively, over benchmarks. Finally, an LLM user study revealed that 94% of participants preferred ChartUIE-8K's queries, with 93% deeming them aligned with real-world use cases. Core contributions are available as open-source at an anonymized project site, with ample qualitative examples.</description>

      <title>NIDS Neural Networks Using Sliding Time Window Data Processing with Trainable Activations and its Generalization Capability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18658v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents neural networks for network intrusion detection systems (NIDS), that operate on flow data preprocessed with a time window. It requires only eleven features which do not rely on deep packet inspection and can be found in most NIDS datasets and easily obtained from conventional flow collectors. The time window aggregates information with respect to hosts facilitating the identification of flow signatures that are missed by other aggregation methods. Several network architectures are studied and the use of Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN)-inspired trainable activation functions that help to achieve higher accuracy with simpler network structure is proposed. The reported training accuracy exceeds 99% for the proposed method with as little as twenty neural network input features. This work also studies the generalization capability of NIDS, a crucial aspect that has not been adequately addressed in the previous studies. The generalization experiments are conducted using CICIDS2017 dataset and a custom dataset collected as part of this study. It is shown that the performance metrics decline significantly when changing datasets, and the reduction in performance metrics can be attributed to the difference in signatures of the same type flows in different datasets, which in turn can be attributed to the differences between the underlying networks. It is shown that the generalization accuracy of some neural networks can be very unstable and sensitive to random initialization parameters, and neural networks with fewer parameters and well-tuned activations are more stable and achieve higher accuracy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2204.10438v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Most AI systems are black boxes generating reasonable outputs for given inputs. Some domains, however, have explainability and trustworthiness requirements that cannot be directly met by these approaches. Various methods have therefore been developed to interpret black-box models after training. This paper advocates an alternative approach where the models are transparent and explainable to begin with. This approach, EVOTER, evolves rule-sets based on simple logical expressions. The approach is evaluated in several prediction/classification and prescription/policy search domains with and without a surrogate. It is shown to discover meaningful rule sets that perform similarly to black-box models. The rules can provide insight into the domain, and make biases hidden in the data explicit. It may also be possible to edit them directly to remove biases and add constraints. EVOTER thus forms a promising foundation for building trustworthy AI systems for real-world applications in the future.</description>

      <title>Towards Understanding the Link Between Modularity and Performance in Neural Networks for Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: Modularity has been widely studied as a mechanism to improve the capabilities of neural networks through various techniques such as hand-crafted modular architectures and automatic approaches. While these methods have sometimes shown improvements towards generalisation ability, robustness, and efficiency, the mechanisms that enable modularity to give performance advantages are unclear. In this paper, we investigate this issue and find that the amount of network modularity for optimal performance is likely entangled in complex relationships between many other features of the network and problem environment. Therefore, direct optimisation or arbitrary designation of a suitable amount of modularity in neural networks may not be beneficial. We used a classic neuroevolutionary algorithm which enables rich, automatic optimisation and exploration of neural network architectures and weights with varying levels of modularity. The structural modularity and performance of networks generated by the NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies algorithm was assessed on three reinforcement learning tasks, with and without an additional modularity objective. The results of the quality-diversity optimisation algorithm, MAP-Elites, suggest intricate conditional relationships between modularity, performance, and other predefined network features.</description>

      <title>Fixed-Point Automatic Differentiation of Forward--Backward Splitting Algorithms for Partly Smooth Functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.03107v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A large class of non-smooth practical optimization problems can be written as minimization of a sum of smooth and partly smooth functions. We examine such structured problems which also depend on a parameter vector and study the problem of differentiating its solution mapping with respect to the parameter which has far reaching applications in sensitivity analysis and parameter learning problems. Under partial smoothness and other mild assumptions, we apply Implicit (ID) and Automatic Differentiation (AD) to the fixed-point iterations of proximal splitting algorithms. We show that AD of the sequence generated by these algorithms converges (linearly under further assumptions) to the derivative of the solution mapping. For a variant of automatic differentiation, which we call Fixed-Point Automatic Differentiation (FPAD), we remedy the memory overhead problem of the Reverse Mode AD and moreover provide faster convergence theoretically. We numerically illustrate the convergence and convergence rates of AD and FPAD on Lasso and Group Lasso problems and demonstrate the working of FPAD on prototypical image denoising problems by learning the regularization term.</description>

      <title>Neural-Rendezvous: Provably Robust Guidance and Control to Encounter Interstellar Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.04883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.04883v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interstellar objects (ISOs) are likely representatives of primitive materials invaluable in understanding exoplanetary star systems. Due to their poorly constrained orbits with generally high inclinations and relative velocities, however, exploring ISOs with conventional human-in-the-loop approaches is significantly challenging. This paper presents Neural-Rendezvous -- a deep learning-based guidance and control framework for encountering fast-moving objects, including ISOs, robustly, accurately, and autonomously in real time. It uses pointwise minimum norm tracking control on top of a guidance policy modeled by a spectrally-normalized deep neural network, where its hyperparameters are tuned with a loss function directly penalizing the MPC state trajectory tracking error. We show that Neural-Rendezvous provides a high probability exponential bound on the expected spacecraft delivery error, the proof of which leverages stochastic incremental stability analysis. In particular, it is used to construct a non-negative function with a supermartingale property, explicitly accounting for the ISO state uncertainty and the local nature of nonlinear state estimation guarantees. In numerical simulations, Neural-Rendezvous is demonstrated to satisfy the expected error bound for 100 ISO candidates. This performance is also empirically validated using our spacecraft simulator and in high-conflict and distributed UAV swarm reconfiguration with up to 20 UAVs.</description>

      <title>Bayan Algorithm: Detecting Communities in Networks Through Exact and Approximate Optimization of Modularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.04562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.04562v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Community detection is a classic network problem with extensive applications in various fields. Its most common method is using modularity maximization heuristics which rarely return an optimal partition or anything similar. Partitions with globally optimal modularity are difficult to compute, and therefore have been underexplored. Using structurally diverse networks, we compare 30 community detection methods including our proposed algorithm that offers optimality and approximation guarantees: the Bayan algorithm. Unlike existing methods, Bayan globally maximizes modularity or approximates it within a factor. Our results show the distinctive accuracy and stability of maximum-modularity partitions in retrieving planted partitions at rates higher than most alternatives for a wide range of parameter settings in two standard benchmarks. Compared to the partitions from 29 other algorithms, maximum-modularity partitions have the best medians for description length, coverage, performance, average conductance, and well clusteredness. These advantages come at the cost of additional computations which Bayan makes possible for small networks (networks that have up to 3000 edges in their largest connected component). Bayan is several times faster than using open-source and commercial solvers for modularity maximization, making it capable of finding optimal partitions for instances that cannot be optimized by any other existing method. Our results point to a few well performing algorithms, among which Bayan stands out as the most reliable method for small networks. A Python implementation of the Bayan algorithm (bayanpy) is publicly available through the package installer for Python.</description>

      <title>Towards End-to-End Open Conversational Machine Reading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.07113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.07113v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In open-retrieval conversational machine reading (OR-CMR) task, machines are required to do multi-turn question answering given dialogue history and a textual knowledge base. Existing works generally utilize two independent modules to approach this problem's two successive sub-tasks: first with a hard-label decision making and second with a question generation aided by various entailment reasoning methods. Such usual cascaded modeling is vulnerable to error propagation and prevents the two sub-tasks from being consistently optimized. In this work, we instead model OR-CMR as a unified text-to-text task in a fully end-to-end style. Experiments on the ShARC and OR-ShARC dataset show the effectiveness of our proposed end-to-end framework on both sub-tasks by a large margin, achieving new state-of-the-art results. Further ablation studies support that our framework can generalize to different backbone models.</description>

      <title>Contrastive-Signal-Dependent Plasticity: Self-Supervised Learning in Spiking Neural Circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.18187v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Brain-inspired machine intelligence research seeks to develop computational models that emulate the information processing and adaptability that distinguishes biological systems of neurons. This has led to the development of spiking neural networks, a class of models that promisingly addresses the biological implausibility and {the lack of energy efficiency} inherent to modern-day deep neural networks. In this work, we address the challenge of designing neurobiologically-motivated schemes for adjusting the synapses of spiking networks and propose contrastive-signal-dependent plasticity, a process which generalizes ideas behind self-supervised learning to facilitate local adaptation in architectures of event-based neuronal layers that operate in parallel. Our experimental simulations demonstrate a consistent advantage over other biologically-plausible approaches when training recurrent spiking networks, crucially side-stepping the need for extra structure such as feedback synapses.</description>

      <title>Least Squares Regression Can Exhibit Under-Parameterized Double Descent</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.14689v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The relationship between the number of training data points, the number of parameters, and the generalization capabilities of models has been widely studied. Previous work has shown that double descent can occur in the over-parameterized regime and that the standard bias-variance trade-off holds in the under-parameterized regime. These works provide multiple reasons for the existence of the peak. We postulate that the location of the peak depends on the technical properties of both the spectrum as well as the eigenvectors of the sample covariance. We present two simple examples that provably exhibit double descent in the under-parameterized regime and do not seem to occur for reasons provided in prior work.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models Can Be Contextual Privacy Protection Learners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02469v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has driven considerable interest in fine-tuning them with domain-specific data to create specialized language models. Nevertheless, such domain-specific fine-tuning data often contains contextually sensitive personally identifiable information (PII). Direct fine-tuning of LLMs on this data without privacy protection poses a risk of data leakage of sensitive PII during inference time. To address this challenge, we introduce Contextual Privacy Protection Language Models (CPPLM), a novel paradigm for fine-tuning LLMs that effectively injects domain-specific knowledge while safeguarding inference-time data privacy. Our work offers a theoretical analysis for model design and benchmarks various techniques such as corpus curation, penalty-based unlikelihood in training loss, instruction-based tuning, etc. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets and scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of our approaches. In particular, instruction tuning with both positive and negative examples stands out as a promising method, effectively protecting private data while enhancing the model's knowledge. Our work underscores the potential for Large Language Models as robust contextual privacy protection learners. The complete code and data for the work can be found at https://github.com/Yijia-Xiao/PPLM.</description>

      <title>Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning-Based UAV Pathfinding for Obstacle Avoidance in Stochastic Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16659v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traditional methods plan feasible paths for multiple agents in the stochastic environment. However, the methods' iterations with the changes in the environment result in computation complexities, especially for the decentralized agents without a centralized planner. Although reinforcement learning provides a plausible solution because of the generalization for different environments, it struggles with enormous agent-environment interactions in training. Here, we propose a novel centralized training with decentralized execution method based on multi-agent reinforcement learning, which is improved based on the idea of model predictive control. In our approach, agents communicate only with the centralized planner to make decentralized decisions online in the stochastic environment. Furthermore, considering the communication constraint with the centralized planner, each agent plans feasible paths through the extended observation, which combines information on neighboring agents based on the distance-weighted mean field approach. Inspired by the rolling optimization approach of model predictive control, we conduct multi-step value convergence in multi-agent reinforcement learning to enhance the training efficiency, which reduces the expensive interactions in convergence. Experiment results in both comparison, ablation, and real-robot studies validate the effectiveness and generalization performance of our method.</description>

      <title>Gradient-free online learning of subgrid-scale dynamics with neural emulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19385v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a generic algorithm to train machine learning-based subgrid parametrizations online, i.e., with a posteriori loss functions, but for non-differentiable numerical solvers. The proposed approach leverages a neural emulator to approximate the reduced state-space solver, which is then used to allow gradient propagation through temporal integration steps. We apply this methodology on a single layer quasi-geostrophic system with topography, known to be highly unstable in around 500 temporal iterations with offline strategies. Using our algorithm, we are able to train a parametrization that recovers most of the benefits of online strategies without having to compute the gradient of the original solver. It is demonstrated that training the neural emulator and parametrization components separately with different loss quantities is necessary in order to minimize the propagation of approximation biases. Experiments on emulator architectures with different complexities also indicates that emulator performance is key in order to learn an accurate parametrization. This work is a step towards learning parametrization with online strategies for weather models.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning and NLP in Cryptocurrency Forecasting: Integrating Financial, Blockchain, and Social Media Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14759v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce novel approaches to cryptocurrency price forecasting, leveraging Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, with a focus on Bitcoin and Ethereum. By analysing news and social media content, primarily from Twitter and Reddit, we assess the impact of public sentiment on cryptocurrency markets. A distinctive feature of our methodology is the application of the BART MNLI zero-shot classification model to detect bullish and bearish trends, significantly advancing beyond traditional sentiment analysis. Additionally, we systematically compare a range of pre-trained and fine-tuned deep learning NLP models against conventional dictionary-based sentiment analysis methods. Another key contribution of our work is the adoption of local extrema alongside daily price movements as predictive targets, reducing trading frequency and portfolio volatility. Our findings demonstrate that integrating textual data into cryptocurrency price forecasting not only improves forecasting accuracy but also consistently enhances the profitability and Sharpe ratio across various validation scenarios, particularly when applying deep learning NLP techniques. The entire codebase of our experiments is made available via an online repository: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/crypto-forecasting-public</description>

      <title>G2D: From Global to Dense Radiography Representation Learning via Vision-Language Pre-training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01522v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, medical vision-language pre-training (VLP) has reached substantial progress to learn global visual representation from medical images and their paired radiology reports. However, medical imaging tasks in real world usually require finer granularity in visual features. These tasks include visual localization tasks (e.g., semantic segmentation, object detection) and visual grounding task. Yet, current medical VLP methods face challenges in learning these fine-grained features, as they primarily focus on brute-force alignment between image patches and individual text tokens for local visual feature learning, which is suboptimal for downstream dense prediction tasks. In this work, we propose a new VLP framework, named \textbf{G}lobal to \textbf{D}ense level representation learning (G2D) that achieves significantly improved granularity and more accurate grounding for the learned features, compared to existing medical VLP approaches. In particular, G2D learns dense and semantically-grounded image representations via a pseudo segmentation task parallel with the global vision-language alignment. Notably, generating pseudo segmentation targets does not incur extra trainable parameters: they are obtained on the fly during VLP with a parameter-free processor. G2D achieves superior performance across 6 medical imaging tasks and 25 diseases, particularly in semantic segmentation, which necessitates fine-grained, semantically-grounded image features. In this task, G2D surpasses peer models even when fine-tuned with just 1\% of the training data, compared to the 100\% used by these models. The code can be found in https://github.com/cheliu-computation/G2D-NeurIPS24/tree/main.</description>

      <title>Class-Discriminative Attention Maps for Vision Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02364v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Importance estimators are explainability methods that quantify feature importance for deep neural networks (DNN). In vision transformers (ViT), the self-attention mechanism naturally leads to attention maps, which are sometimes interpreted as importance scores that indicate which input features ViT models are focusing on. However, attention maps do not account for signals from downstream tasks. To generate explanations that are sensitive to downstream tasks, we have developed class-discriminative attention maps (CDAM), a gradient-based extension that estimates feature importance with respect to a known class or a latent concept. CDAM scales attention scores by how relevant the corresponding tokens are for the predictions of a classifier head. In addition to targeting the supervised classifier, CDAM can explain an arbitrary concept shared by selected samples by measuring similarity in the latent space of ViT. Additionally, we introduce Smooth CDAM and Integrated CDAM, which average a series of CDAMs with slightly altered tokens. Our quantitative benchmarks include correctness, compactness, and class sensitivity, in comparison to 7 other importance estimators. Vanilla, Smooth, and Integrated CDAM excel across all three benchmarks. In particular, our results suggest that existing importance estimators may not provide sufficient class-sensitivity. We demonstrate the utility of CDAM in medical images by training and explaining malignancy and biomarker prediction models based on lung Computed Tomography (CT) scans. Overall, CDAM is shown to be highly class-discriminative and semantically relevant, while providing compact explanations.</description>

      <title>West-of-N: Synthetic Preferences for Self-Improving Reward Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.12086v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The success of reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) in language model alignment is strongly dependent on the quality of the underlying reward model. In this paper, we present a novel approach to improve reward model quality by generating synthetic preference data, thereby augmenting the training dataset with on-policy, high-quality preference pairs. Motivated by the promising results of Best-of-N sampling strategies in language model training, we extend their application to reward model training. This results in a self-training strategy to generate preference pairs by selecting the best and worst candidates in a pool of responses to a given query. Empirically, we find that this approach improves the performance of any reward model, with an effect comparable to the addition of a similar quantity of human preference data. This work opens up new avenues of research for improving RLHF for language model alignment, by offering synthetic preference generation as a solution to reward modeling challenges.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Filter Design in FBP: Transforming CT Reconstruction with Trainable Fourier Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16039v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we introduce a Fourier series-based trainable filter for computed tomography (CT) reconstruction within the filtered backprojection (FBP) framework. This method overcomes the limitation in noise reduction by optimizing Fourier series coefficients to construct the filter, maintaining computational efficiency with minimal increment for the trainable parameters compared to other deep learning frameworks. Additionally, we propose Gaussian edge-enhanced (GEE) loss function that prioritizes the $L_1$ norm of high-frequency magnitudes, effectively countering the blurring problems prevalent in mean squared error (MSE) approaches. The model's foundation in the FBP algorithm ensures excellent interpretability, as it relies on a data-driven filter with all other parameters derived through rigorous mathematical procedures. Designed as a plug-and-play solution, our Fourier series-based filter can be easily integrated into existing CT reconstruction models, making it an adaptable tool for a wide range of practical applications. Code and data are available at https://github.com/sypsyp97/Trainable-Fourier-Series.</description>

      <title>A Decision-Language Model (DLM) for Dynamic Restless Multi-Armed Bandit Tasks in Public Health</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14807v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Restless multi-armed bandits (RMAB) have demonstrated success in optimizing resource allocation for large beneficiary populations in public health settings. Unfortunately, RMAB models lack flexibility to adapt to evolving public health policy priorities. Concurrently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as adept automated planners across domains of robotic control and navigation. In this paper, we propose a Decision Language Model (DLM) for RMABs, enabling dynamic fine-tuning of RMAB policies in public health settings using human-language commands. We propose using LLMs as automated planners to (1) interpret human policy preference prompts, (2) propose reward functions as code for a multi-agent RMAB environment, and (3) iterate on the generated reward functions using feedback from grounded RMAB simulations. We illustrate the application of DLM in collaboration with ARMMAN, an India-based non-profit promoting preventative care for pregnant mothers, that currently relies on RMAB policies to optimally allocate health worker calls to low-resource populations. We conduct a technology demonstration in simulation using the Gemini Pro model, showing DLM can dynamically shape policy outcomes using only human prompts as input.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18419</link>

Abstract: Health insurance companies have a defined process called prior authorization (PA) which is a health plan cost-control process that requires doctors and other healthcare professionals to get clearance in advance from a health plan before performing a particular procedure on a patient in order to be eligible for payment coverage. For health insurance companies, approving PA requests for patients in the medical domain is a time-consuming and challenging task. One of those key challenges is validating if a request matches up to certain criteria such as age, gender, etc. In this work, we evaluate whether GPT can validate numerous key factors, in turn helping health plans reach a decision drastically faster. We frame it as a question answering task, prompting GPT to answer a question from patient electronic health record. We experiment with different conventional prompting techniques as well as introduce our own novel prompting technique. Moreover, we report qualitative assessment by humans on the natural language generation outputs from our approach. Results show that our method achieves superior performance with the mean weighted F1 score of 0.61 as compared to its standard counterparts.</description>

      <title>Improving Low-Resource Knowledge Tracing Tasks by Supervised Pre-training and Importance Mechanism Fine-tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06725v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Knowledge tracing (KT) aims to estimate student's knowledge mastery based on their historical interactions. Recently, the deep learning based KT (DLKT) approaches have achieved impressive performance in the KT task. These DLKT models heavily rely on the large number of available student interactions. However, due to various reasons such as budget constraints and privacy concerns, observed interactions are very limited in many real-world scenarios, a.k.a, low-resource KT datasets. Directly training a DLKT model on a low-resource KT dataset may lead to overfitting and it is difficult to choose the appropriate deep neural architecture. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a low-resource KT framework called LoReKT to address above challenges. Inspired by the prevalent "pre-training and fine-tuning" paradigm, we aim to learn transferable parameters and representations from rich-resource KT datasets during the pre-training stage and subsequently facilitate effective adaptation to low-resource KT datasets. Specifically, we simplify existing sophisticated DLKT model architectures with purely a stack of transformer decoders. We design an encoding mechanism to incorporate student interactions from multiple KT data sources and develop an importance mechanism to prioritize updating parameters with high importance while constraining less important ones during the fine-tuning stage. We evaluate LoReKT on six public KT datasets and experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our approach in terms of AUC and Accuracy. To encourage reproducible research, we make our data and code publicly available at https://github.com/rattlesnakey/LoReKT.</description>

      <title>The Fallacy of Minimizing Cumulative Regret in the Sequential Task Setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10946v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Online Reinforcement Learning (RL) is typically framed as the process of minimizing cumulative regret (CR) through interactions with an unknown environment. However, real-world RL applications usually involve a sequence of tasks, and the data collected in the first task is used to warm-start the second task. The performance of the warm-start policy is measured by simple regret (SR). While minimizing both CR and SR is generally a conflicting objective, previous research has shown that in stationary environments, both can be optimized in terms of the duration of the task, $T$.
  In practice, however, in real-world applications, human-in-the-loop decisions between tasks often results in non-stationarity. For instance, in clinical trials, scientists may adjust target health outcomes between implementations. Our results show that task non-stationarity leads to a more restrictive trade-off between CR and SR. To balance these competing goals, the algorithm must explore excessively, leading to a CR bound worse than the typical optimal rate of $T^{1/2}$. These findings are practically significant, indicating that increased exploration is necessary in non-stationary environments to accommodate task changes, impacting the design of RL algorithms in fields such as healthcare and beyond.</description>

      <title>Floralens: a Deep Learning Model for the Portuguese Native Flora</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12072v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine-learning techniques, especially deep convolutional neural networks, are pivotal for image-based identification of biological species in many Citizen Science platforms. In this paper, we describe the construction of a dataset for the Portuguese native flora based on publicly available research-grade datasets, and the derivation of a high-accuracy model from it using off-the-shelf deep convolutional neural networks. We anchored the dataset in high-quality data provided by Sociedade Portuguesa de Bot\^anica and added further sampled data from research-grade datasets available from GBIF. We find that with a careful dataset design, off-the-shelf machine-learning cloud services such as Google's AutoML Vision produce accurate models, with results comparable to those of Pl@ntNet, a state-of-the-art citizen science platform. The best model we derived, dubbed Floralens, has been integrated into the public website of Project Biolens, where we gather models for other taxa as well. The dataset used to train the model is also publicly available on Zenodo.</description>

      <title>Bootstrapping Reinforcement Learning with Imitation for Vision-Based Agile Flight</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12203v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning visuomotor policies for agile quadrotor flight presents significant difficulties, primarily from inefficient policy exploration caused by high-dimensional visual inputs and the need for precise and low-latency control. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach that combines the performance of Reinforcement Learning (RL) and the sample efficiency of Imitation Learning (IL) in the task of vision-based autonomous drone racing. While RL provides a framework for learning high-performance controllers through trial and error, it faces challenges with sample efficiency and computational demands due to the high dimensionality of visual inputs. Conversely, IL efficiently learns from visual expert demonstrations, but it remains limited by the expert's performance and state distribution. To overcome these limitations, our policy learning framework integrates the strengths of both approaches. Our framework contains three phases: training a teacher policy using RL with privileged state information, distilling it into a student policy via IL, and adaptive fine-tuning via RL. Testing in both simulated and real-world scenarios shows our approach can not only learn in scenarios where RL from scratch fails but also outperforms existing IL methods in both robustness and performance, successfully navigating a quadrotor through a race course using only visual information.</description>

      <title>Videoshop: Localized Semantic Video Editing with Noise-Extrapolated Diffusion Inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14617v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce Videoshop, a training-free video editing algorithm for localized semantic edits. Videoshop allows users to use any editing software, including Photoshop and generative inpainting, to modify the first frame; it automatically propagates those changes, with semantic, spatial, and temporally consistent motion, to the remaining frames. Unlike existing methods that enable edits only through imprecise textual instructions, Videoshop allows users to add or remove objects, semantically change objects, insert stock photos into videos, etc. with fine-grained control over locations and appearance. We achieve this through image-based video editing by inverting latents with noise extrapolation, from which we generate videos conditioned on the edited image. Videoshop produces higher quality edits against 6 baselines on 2 editing benchmarks using 10 evaluation metrics.</description>

      <title>Comparing Neighbors Together Makes it Easy: Jointly Comparing Multiple Candidates for Efficient and Effective Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12801v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A common retrieve-and-rerank paradigm involves retrieving relevant candidates from a broad set using a fast bi-encoder (BE), followed by applying expensive but accurate cross-encoders (CE) to a limited candidate set. However, relying on this small subset is often susceptible to error propagation from the bi-encoders, which limits the overall performance. To address these issues, we propose the Comparing Multiple Candidates (CMC) framework. CMC compares a query and multiple embeddings of similar candidates (i.e., neighbors) through shallow self-attention layers, delivering rich representations contextualized to each other. Furthermore, CMC is scalable enough to handle multiple comparisons simultaneously. For example, comparing ~10K candidates with CMC takes a similar amount of time as comparing 16 candidates with CE. Experimental results on the ZeSHEL dataset demonstrate that CMC, when plugged in between bi-encoders and cross-encoders as a seamless intermediate reranker (BE-CMC-CE), can effectively improve recall@k (+4.8%-p, +3.5%-p for R@16, R@64) compared to using only bi-encoders (BE-CE), with negligible slowdown (&lt;7%). Additionally, to verify CMC's effectiveness as the final-stage reranker in improving top-1 accuracy, we conduct experiments on downstream tasks such as entity, passage, and dialogue ranking. The results indicate that CMC is not only faster (11x) but also often more effective than CE, with improved prediction accuracy in Wikipedia entity linking (+0.7%-p) and DSTC7 dialogue ranking (+3.3%-p).</description>

      <title>Computing the Bias of Constant-step Stochastic Approximation with Markovian Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14285v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study stochastic approximation algorithms with Markovian noise and constant step-size $\alpha$. We develop a method based on infinitesimal generator comparisons to study the bias of the algorithm, which is the expected difference between $\theta_n$ -- the value at iteration $n$ -- and $\theta^*$ -- the unique equilibrium of the corresponding ODE. We show that, under some smoothness conditions, this bias is of order $O(\alpha)$. Furthermore, we show that the time-averaged bias is equal to $\alpha V + O(\alpha^2)$, where $V$ is a constant characterized by a Lyapunov equation, showing that $\mathbb{E}[\bar{\theta}_n] \approx \theta^*+V\alpha + O(\alpha^2)$, where $\bar{\theta}_n=(1/n)\sum_{k=1}^n\theta_k$ is the Polyak-Ruppert average. We also show that $\bar{\theta}_n$ converges with high probability around $\theta^*+\alpha V$. We illustrate how to combine this with Richardson-Romberg extrapolation to derive an iterative scheme with a bias of order $O(\alpha^2)$.</description>

      <title>Navigable Graphs for High-Dimensional Nearest Neighbor Search: Constructions and Limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18680v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There has been significant recent interest in graph-based nearest neighbor search methods, many of which are centered on the construction of navigable graphs over high-dimensional point sets. A graph is navigable if we can successfully move from any starting node to any target node using a greedy routing strategy where we always move to the neighbor that is closest to the destination according to a given distance function. The complete graph is navigable for any point set, but the important question for applications is if sparser graphs can be constructed. While this question is fairly well understood in low-dimensions, we establish some of the first upper and lower bounds for high-dimensional point sets. First, we give a simple and efficient way to construct a navigable graph with average degree $O(\sqrt{n \log n })$ for any set of $n$ points, in any dimension, for any distance function. We compliment this result with a nearly matching lower bound: even under the Euclidean metric in $O(\log n)$ dimensions, a random point set has no navigable graph with average degree $O(n^{\alpha})$ for any $\alpha &lt; 1/2$. Our lower bound relies on sharp anti-concentration bounds for binomial random variables, which we use to show that the near-neighborhoods of a set of random points do not overlap significantly, forcing any navigable graph to have many edges.</description>

      <title>Can GPT Redefine Medical Understanding? Evaluating GPT on Biomedical Machine Reading Comprehension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18682v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance on many tasks in different domains. However, their performance in closed-book biomedical machine reading comprehension (MRC) has not been evaluated in depth. In this work, we evaluate GPT on four closed-book biomedical MRC benchmarks. We experiment with different conventional prompting techniques as well as introduce our own novel prompting method. To solve some of the retrieval problems inherent to LLMs, we propose a prompting strategy named Implicit Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) that alleviates the need for using vector databases to retrieve important chunks in traditional RAG setups. Moreover, we report qualitative assessments on the natural language generation outputs from our approach. The results show that our new prompting technique is able to get the best performance in two out of four datasets and ranks second in rest of them. Experiments show that modern-day LLMs like GPT even in a zero-shot setting can outperform supervised models, leading to new state-of-the-art (SoTA) results on two of the benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Transformers need glasses! Information over-squashing in language tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04267v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study how information propagates in decoder-only Transformers, which are the architectural backbone of most existing frontier large language models (LLMs). We rely on a theoretical signal propagation analysis -- specifically, we analyse the representations of the last token in the final layer of the Transformer, as this is the representation used for next-token prediction. Our analysis reveals a representational collapse phenomenon: we prove that certain distinct sequences of inputs to the Transformer can yield arbitrarily close representations in the final token. This effect is exacerbated by the low-precision floating-point formats frequently used in modern LLMs. As a result, the model is provably unable to respond to these sequences in different ways -- leading to errors in, e.g., tasks involving counting or copying. Further, we show that decoder-only Transformer language models can lose sensitivity to specific tokens in the input, which relates to the well-known phenomenon of over-squashing in graph neural networks. We provide empirical evidence supporting our claims on contemporary LLMs. Our theory also points to simple solutions towards ameliorating these issues.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning for Swarm Confrontation with High Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07877v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In swarm robotics, confrontation including the pursuit-evasion game is a key scenario. High uncertainty caused by unknown opponents' strategies, dynamic obstacles, and insufficient training complicates the action space into a hybrid decision process. Although the deep reinforcement learning method is significant for swarm confrontation since it can handle various sizes, as an end-to-end implementation, it cannot deal with the hybrid process. Here, we propose a novel hierarchical reinforcement learning approach consisting of a target allocation layer, a path planning layer, and the underlying dynamic interaction mechanism between the two layers, which indicates the quantified uncertainty. It decouples the hybrid process into discrete allocation and continuous planning layers, with a probabilistic ensemble model to quantify the uncertainty and regulate the interaction frequency adaptively. Furthermore, to overcome the unstable training process introduced by the two layers, we design an integration training method including pre-training and cross-training, which enhances the training efficiency and stability. Experiment results in both comparison, ablation, and real-robot studies validate the effectiveness and generalization performance of our proposed approach. In our defined experiments with twenty to forty agents, the win rate of the proposed method reaches around ninety percent, outperforming other traditional methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13636v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Robot evaluations in language-guided, real world settings are time-consuming and often sample only a small space of potential instructions across complex scenes. In this work, we introduce contrast sets for robotics as an approach to make small, but specific, perturbations to otherwise independent, identically distributed (i.i.d.) test instances. We investigate the relationship between experimenter effort to carry out an evaluation and the resulting estimated test performance as well as the insights that can be drawn from performance on perturbed instances. We use the relative performance change of different contrast set perturbations to characterize policies at reduced experimenter effort in both a simulated manipulation task and a physical robot vision-and-language navigation task. We encourage the use of contrast set evaluations as a more informative alternative to small scale, i.i.d. demonstrations on physical robots, and as a scalable alternative to industry-scale real world evaluations.</description>

      <title>Shortcomings of LLMs for Low-Resource Translation: Retrieval and Understanding are Both the Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15625v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work investigates the in-context learning abilities of pretrained large language models (LLMs) when instructed to translate text from a low-resource language into a high-resource language as part of an automated machine translation pipeline. We conduct a set of experiments translating Southern Quechua to Spanish and examine the informativity of various types of context retrieved from a constrained database of digitized pedagogical materials (dictionaries and grammar lessons) and parallel corpora. Using both automatic and human evaluation of model output, we conduct ablation studies that manipulate (1) context type (morpheme translations, grammar descriptions, and corpus examples), (2) retrieval methods (automated vs. manual), and (3) model type. Our results suggest that even relatively small LLMs are capable of utilizing prompt context for zero-shot low-resource translation when provided a minimally sufficient amount of relevant linguistic information. However, the variable effects of context type, retrieval method, model type, and language-specific factors highlight the limitations of using even the best LLMs as translation systems for the majority of the world's 7,000+ languages and their speakers.</description>

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have shown significant potential in assisting medical diagnosis by leveraging extensive biomedical datasets. However, the advancement of medical image understanding and reasoning critically depends on building high-quality visual instruction data, which is costly and labor-intensive to obtain, particularly in the medical domain. To mitigate this data-starving issue, we introduce Self-Training Large Language and Vision Assistant for Medicine (STLLaVA-Med). The proposed method is designed to train a policy model (an LVLM) capable of auto-generating medical visual instruction data to improve data efficiency, guided through Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Specifically, a more powerful and larger LVLM (e.g., GPT-4o) is involved as a biomedical expert to oversee the DPO fine-tuning process on the auto-generated data, encouraging the policy model to align efficiently with human preferences. We validate the efficacy and data efficiency of STLLaVA-Med across three major medical Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmarks, demonstrating competitive zero-shot performance with the utilization of only 9% of the medical data.</description>

      <title>Compress then Serve: Serving Thousands of LoRA Adapters with Little Overhead</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00066v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) with low-rank adaptations (LoRAs) has become common practice, often yielding numerous copies of the same LLM differing only in their LoRA updates. This paradigm presents challenges for systems that serve real-time responses to queries that each involve a different LoRA. Prior works optimize the design of such systems but still require continuous loading and offloading of LoRAs, as it is infeasible to store thousands of LoRAs in GPU memory. To mitigate this issue, we investigate the efficacy of model compression when serving LoRAs. We propose a method for joint compression of LoRAs into a shared basis paired with LoRA-specific scaling matrices. We extend our algorithm to learn clusters of LoRAs that are more amenable to joint compression, allowing it to scale gracefully to large LoRA collections. Our experiments with up to 500 LoRAs demonstrate that compressed LoRAs preserve performance while offering major throughput gains in realistic serving scenarios with over a thousand LoRAs, maintaining 80% of the throughput of serving a single LoRA.</description>

      <title>PerSEval: Assessing Personalization in Text Summarizers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00453v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Personalized summarization models cater to individuals' subjective understanding of saliency, as represented by their reading history and current topics of attention. Existing personalized text summarizers are primarily evaluated based on accuracy measures such as BLEU, ROUGE, and METEOR. However, a recent study argued that accuracy measures are inadequate for evaluating the degree of personalization of these models and proposed EGISES, the first metric to evaluate personalized text summaries. It was suggested that accuracy is a separate aspect and should be evaluated standalone. In this paper, we challenge the necessity of an accuracy leaderboard, suggesting that relying on accuracy-based aggregated results might lead to misleading conclusions. To support this, we delve deeper into EGISES, demonstrating both theoretically and empirically that it measures the degree of responsiveness, a necessary but not sufficient condition for degree-of-personalization. We subsequently propose PerSEval, a novel measure that satisfies the required sufficiency condition. Based on the benchmarking of ten SOTA summarization models on the PENS dataset, we empirically establish that -- (i) PerSEval is reliable w.r.t human-judgment correlation (Pearson's r = 0.73; Spearman's $\rho$ = 0.62; Kendall's $\tau$ = 0.42), (ii) PerSEval has high rank-stability, (iii) PerSEval as a rank-measure is not entailed by EGISES-based ranking, and (iv) PerSEval can be a standalone rank-measure without the need of any aggregated ranking.</description>

      <title>Sparse Diffusion Policy: A Sparse, Reusable, and Flexible Policy for Robot Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01531v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The increasing complexity of tasks in robotics demands efficient strategies for multitask and continual learning. Traditional models typically rely on a universal policy for all tasks, facing challenges such as high computational costs and catastrophic forgetting when learning new tasks. To address these issues, we introduce a sparse, reusable, and flexible policy, Sparse Diffusion Policy (SDP). By adopting Mixture of Experts (MoE) within a transformer-based diffusion policy, SDP selectively activates experts and skills, enabling efficient and task-specific learning without retraining the entire model. SDP not only reduces the burden of active parameters but also facilitates the seamless integration and reuse of experts across various tasks. Extensive experiments on diverse tasks in both simulations and real world show that SDP 1) excels in multitask scenarios with negligible increases in active parameters, 2) prevents forgetting in continual learning of new tasks, and 3) enables efficient task transfer, offering a promising solution for advanced robotic applications. Demos and codes can be found in https://forrest-110.github.io/sparse_diffusion_policy/.</description>

      <title>Are Data Augmentation Methods in Named Entity Recognition Applicable for Uncertainty Estimation?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02062v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work investigates the impact of data augmentation on confidence calibration and uncertainty estimation in Named Entity Recognition (NER) tasks. For the future advance of NER in safety-critical fields like healthcare and finance, it is essential to achieve accurate predictions with calibrated confidence when applying Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), including Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs), as a real-world application. However, DNNs are prone to miscalibration, which limits their applicability. Moreover, existing methods for calibration and uncertainty estimation are computational expensive. Our investigation in NER found that data augmentation improves calibration and uncertainty in cross-genre and cross-lingual setting, especially in-domain setting. Furthermore, we showed that the calibration for NER tends to be more effective when the perplexity of the sentences generated by data augmentation is lower, and that increasing the size of the augmentation further improves calibration and uncertainty.</description>

      <title>GPT vs RETRO: Exploring the Intersection of Retrieval and Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04528v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) have become popular methods for adapting large language models while minimizing compute requirements. In this paper, we apply PEFT methods (P-tuning, Adapters, and LoRA) to a modified Retrieval-Enhanced Transformer (RETRO) and a baseline GPT model across several sizes, ranging from 823 million to 48 billion parameters. We show that RETRO models outperform GPT models in zero-shot settings due to their unique pre-training process but GPT models have higher performance potential with PEFT. Additionally, our study indicates that 8B parameter models strike an optimal balance between cost and performance and P-tuning lags behind other PEFT techniques. We further provide a comparative analysis between applying PEFT to an Instruction-tuned RETRO model and base RETRO model. This work presents the first comprehensive comparison of various PEFT methods integrated with RAG, applied to both GPT and RETRO models, highlighting their relative performance.</description>

      <title>Not (yet) the whole story: Evaluating Visual Storytelling Requires More than Measuring Coherence, Grounding, and Repetition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04559v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Visual storytelling consists in generating a natural language story given a temporally ordered sequence of images. This task is not only challenging for models, but also very difficult to evaluate with automatic metrics since there is no consensus about what makes a story 'good'. In this paper, we introduce a novel method that measures story quality in terms of human likeness regarding three key aspects highlighted in previous work: visual grounding, coherence, and repetitiveness. We then use this method to evaluate the stories generated by several models, showing that the foundation model LLaVA obtains the best result, but only slightly so compared to TAPM, a 50-times smaller visual storytelling model. Upgrading the visual and language components of TAPM results in a model that yields competitive performance with a relatively low number of parameters. Finally, we carry out a human evaluation study, whose results suggest that a 'good' story may require more than a human-like level of visual grounding, coherence, and repetition.</description>

      <title>One Stone, Four Birds: A Comprehensive Solution for QA System Using Supervised Contrastive Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09011v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel and comprehensive solution to enhance both the robustness and efficiency of question answering (QA) systems through supervised contrastive learning (SCL). Training a high-performance QA system has become straightforward with pre-trained language models, requiring only a small amount of data and simple fine-tuning. However, despite recent advances, existing QA systems still exhibit significant deficiencies in functionality and training efficiency. We address the functionality issue by defining four key tasks: user input intent classification, out-of-domain input detection, new intent discovery, and continual learning. We then leverage a unified SCL-based representation learning method to efficiently build an intra-class compact and inter-class scattered feature space, facilitating both known intent classification and unknown intent detection and discovery. Consequently, with minimal additional tuning on downstream tasks, our approach significantly improves model efficiency and achieves new state-of-the-art performance across all tasks.</description>

      <title>Human-like Episodic Memory for Infinite Context LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09450v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities, but still struggle with processing extensive contexts, limiting their ability to maintain coherence and accuracy over long sequences. In contrast, the human brain excels at organising and retrieving episodic experiences across vast temporal scales, spanning a lifetime. In this work, we introduce EM-LLM, a novel approach that integrates key aspects of human episodic memory and event cognition into LLMs with no fine-tuning, enabling them to handle practically infinite context lengths while maintaining computational efficiency. EM-LLM organises sequences of tokens into coherent episodic events using a combination of Bayesian surprise and graph-theoretic boundary refinement in an online fashion. When needed, these events are retrieved through a two-stage memory process, combining similarity-based and temporally contiguous retrieval for efficient and human-like access to relevant information. Experiments on the LongBench and InfiniteBench benchmarks demonstrate EM-LLM's superior performance, consistently outperforming the state-of-the-art retrieval model InfLLM across various baseline LLMs. In addition, EM-LLM outperforms its popular counterpart, RAG, in a wide range of tasks, while requiring similar resources. Notably, EM-LLM's performance even surpasses full-context models in most tasks, while successfully performing retrieval across 10 million tokens - a scale computationally infeasible for such models. Finally, our analysis reveals strong correlations between EM-LLM's event segmentation and human-perceived events, suggesting a bridge between this artificial system and its biological counterpart, thereby offering a novel computational framework for exploring human memory mechanisms.</description>

      <title>GABInsight: Exploring Gender-Activity Binding Bias in Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21001v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) are intensively used in many downstream tasks, including those requiring assessments of individuals appearing in the images. While VLMs perform well in simple single-person scenarios, in real-world applications, we often face complex situations in which there are persons of different genders doing different activities. We show that in such cases, VLMs are biased towards identifying the individual with the expected gender (according to ingrained gender stereotypes in the model or other forms of sample selection bias) as the performer of the activity. We refer to this bias in associating an activity with the gender of its actual performer in an image or text as the Gender-Activity Binding (GAB) bias and analyze how this bias is internalized in VLMs. To assess this bias, we have introduced the GAB dataset with approximately 5500 AI-generated images that represent a variety of activities, addressing the scarcity of real-world images for some scenarios. To have extensive quality control, the generated images are evaluated for their diversity, quality, and realism. We have tested 12 renowned pre-trained VLMs on this dataset in the context of text-to-image and image-to-text retrieval to measure the effect of this bias on their predictions. Additionally, we have carried out supplementary experiments to quantify the bias in VLMs' text encoders and to evaluate VLMs' capability to recognize activities. Our experiments indicate that VLMs experience an average performance decline of about 13.2% when confronted with gender-activity binding bias.</description>

      <title>Aliasing and Label-Independent Decomposition of Risk: Beyond the bias-variance trade-off</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08294v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A central problem in data science is to use potentially noisy samples of an unknown function to predict function values for unseen inputs. In classical statistics, the predictive error is understood as a trade-off between the bias and the variance that balances model simplicity with its ability to fit complex functions. However, over-parameterized models exhibit counter-intuitive behaviors, such as "double descent" in which models of increasing complexity exhibit decreasing generalization error. In contrast to the bias-variance trade-off, we introduce an alternative paradigm called the generalized aliasing decomposition (GAD). We explain the asymptotically small error of complex models as a systematic "de-aliasing" that occurs in the over-parameterized regime. In the limit of large models, the error contribution due to aliasing vanishes, leaving an expression for the asymptotic total error we call the data insufficiency failure of very large models on few training points. Because the generalized aliasing decomposition can be explicitly calculated from the relationship between model class and samples without seeing any data labels, it can answer questions related to experimental design and model selection before collecting data or performing experiments. We demonstrate this approach using several examples, including classical regression problems and a cluster expansion model used in materials science.</description>

      <title>CoRA: Collaborative Information Perception by Large Language Model's Weights for Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10645v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Involving collaborative information in Large Language Models (LLMs) is a promising technique for adapting LLMs for recommendation. Existing methods achieve this by concatenating collaborative features with text tokens into a unified sequence input and then fine-tuning to align these features with LLM's input space. Although effective, in this work, we identify two limitations when adapting LLMs to recommendation tasks, which hinder the integration of general knowledge and collaborative information, resulting in sub-optimal recommendation performance. (1) Fine-tuning LLM with recommendation data can undermine its inherent world knowledge and fundamental competencies, which are crucial for interpreting and inferring recommendation text. (2) Incorporating collaborative features into textual prompts disrupts the semantics of the original prompts, preventing LLM from generating appropriate outputs. In this paper, we propose a new paradigm, \textbf{Co}llaborative \textbf{Lo}RA (CoRA), with a collaborative query generator. Rather than input space alignment, this method aligns collaborative information with LLM's parameter space, representing them as incremental weights to update LLM's output. This way, LLM perceives collaborative information without altering its general knowledge and text inference capabilities. Specifically, we employ a collaborative filtering model to extract user and item embeddings and inject them into a set number of learnable queries. We then convert collaborative queries into collaborative weights with low-rank properties and merge the collaborative weights into LLM's weights, enabling LLM to perceive the collaborative signals and generate personalized recommendations without fine-tuning or extra collaborative tokens in prompts. Extensive experiments confirm that CoRA effectively integrates collaborative information into LLM, enhancing recommendation performance.</description>

      <title>Turbine location-aware multi-decadal wind power predictions for Germany using CMIP6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14889v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Climate change will impact wind and therefore wind power generation with largely unknown effect and magnitude. Climate models can provide insights and should be used for long-term power planning. In this work we use Gaussian processes to predict power output given wind speeds from a global climate model and compare the aggregated predictions to actual power generation. Analyzing past climate model data supports the use of CMIP6 climate model data for multi-decadal wind power predictions and highlights the importance of being location-aware. Our predictions up to 2050 reveal only minor changes in yearly wind power generation. We find that wind power projections of the two in-between climate scenarios SSP2-4.5 and SSP3-7.0 closely align with actual wind power generation between 2015 and 2023. Our analysis also reveals larger uncertainty associated with Germany's coastal areas in the North as compared to Germany's South, motivating wind power expansion in regions where future wind is likely more reliable. Overall, our results indicate that wind energy will likely remain a reliable energy source in the future.</description>

      <title>TinyAgent: Function Calling at the Edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00608v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent large language models (LLMs) have enabled the development of advanced agentic systems that can integrate various tools and APIs to fulfill user queries through function calling. However, the deployment of these LLMs on the edge has not been explored since they typically require cloud-based infrastructure due to their substantial model size and computational demands. To this end, we present TinyAgent, an end-to-end framework for training and deploying task-specific small language model agents capable of function calling for driving agentic systems at the edge. We first show how to enable accurate function calling for open-source models via the LLMCompiler framework. We then systematically curate a high-quality dataset for function calling, which we use to fine-tune two small language models, TinyAgent-1.1B and 7B. For efficient inference, we introduce a novel tool retrieval method to reduce the input prompt length and utilize quantization to further accelerate the inference speed. As a driving application, we demonstrate a local Siri-like system for Apple's MacBook that can execute user commands through text or voice input. Our results show that our models can achieve, and even surpass, the function-calling capabilities of larger models like GPT-4-Turbo, while being fully deployed at the edge. We open-source our dataset, models, and installable package and provide a demo video for our MacBook assistant agent.</description>

      <title>Acting for the Right Reasons: Creating Reason-Sensitive Artificial Moral Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15014v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an extension of the reinforcement learning architecture that enables moral decision-making of reinforcement learning agents based on normative reasons. Central to this approach is a reason-based shield generator yielding a moral shield that binds the agent to actions that conform with recognized normative reasons so that our overall architecture restricts the agent to actions that are (internally) morally justified. In addition, we describe an algorithm that allows to iteratively improve the reason-based shield generator through case-based feedback from a moral judge.</description>

      <title>Beyond Conformal Predictors: Adaptive Conformal Inference with Confidence Predictors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15548v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conformal prediction (CP) is a robust framework for distribution-free uncertainty quantification, but it requires exchangeable data to ensure valid prediction sets at a user-specified significance level. When this assumption is violated, as in time-series or other structured data, the validity guarantees of CP no longer hold. Adaptive conformal inference (ACI) was introduced to address this limitation by adjusting the significance level dynamically, ensuring finite-sample coverage guarantees even for non-exchangeable data. In this paper, we show that ACI does not require the use of conformal predictors; instead, it can be implemented with the more general confidence predictors, which are computationally simpler and still maintain the crucial property of nested prediction sets. Through experiments on synthetic and real-world data, we demonstrate that confidence predictors can perform comparably to, or even better than, conformal predictors, particularly in terms of computational efficiency. These findings suggest that confidence predictors represent a viable and efficient alternative to conformal predictors in non-exchangeable data settings, although further studies are needed to identify when one method is superior.</description>

      <title>Edge-preserving noise for diffusion models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01540v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Classical generative diffusion models learn an isotropic Gaussian denoising process, treating all spatial regions uniformly, thus neglecting potentially valuable structural information in the data. Inspired by the long-established work on anisotropic diffusion in image processing, we present a novel edge-preserving diffusion model that is a generalization of denoising diffusion probablistic models (DDPM). In particular, we introduce an edge-aware noise scheduler that varies between edge-preserving and isotropic Gaussian noise. We show that our model's generative process converges faster to results that more closely match the target distribution. We demonstrate its capability to better learn the low-to-mid frequencies within the dataset, which plays a crucial role in representing shapes and structural information. Our edge-preserving diffusion process consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in unconditional image generation. It is also more robust for generative tasks guided by a shape-based prior, such as stroke-to-image generation. We present qualitative and quantitative results showing consistent improvements (FID score) of up to 30% for both tasks. We provide source code and supplementary content via the public domain edge-preserving-diffusion.mpi-inf.mpg.de .</description>

      <title>Adversarial Multi-Agent Evaluation of Large Language Models through Iterative Debates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04663v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper explores optimal architectures for evaluating the outputs of large language models (LLMs) using LLMs themselves. We propose a novel framework that interprets LLMs as advocates within an ensemble of interacting agents, allowing them to defend their answers and reach conclusions through a judge and jury system. This approach offers a more dynamic and comprehensive evaluation process compared to traditional human-based assessments or automated metrics. We discuss the motivation behind this framework, its key components, and comparative advantages. We also present a probabilistic model to evaluate the error reduction achieved by iterative advocate systems. Finally, we outline experiments to validate the effectiveness of multi-advocate architectures and discuss future research directions.</description>

      <title>MC-QDSNN: Quantized Deep evolutionary SNN with Multi-Dendritic Compartment Neurons for Stress Detection using Physiological Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04992v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Long short-term memory (LSTM) has emerged as a definitive network for analyzing and inferring time series data. LSTM has the capability to extract spectral features and a mixture of temporal features. Due to this benefit, a similar feature extraction method is explored for the spiking counterparts targeting time-series data. Though LSTMs perform well in their spiking form, they tend to be compute and power intensive. Addressing this issue, this work proposes Multi-Compartment Leaky (MCLeaky) neuron as a viable alternative for efficient processing of time series data. The MCLeaky neuron, derived from the Leaky Integrate and Fire (LIF) neuron model, contains multiple memristive synapses interlinked to form a memory component, which emulates the human brain's Hippocampus region. The proposed MCLeaky neuron based Spiking Neural Network model and its quantized variant were benchmarked against state-of-the-art (SOTA) Spiking LSTMs to perform human stress detection, by comparing compute requirements, latency and real-world performances on unseen data with models derived through Neural Architecture Search (NAS). Results show that networks with MCLeaky activation neuron managed a superior accuracy of 98.8% to detect stress based on Electrodermal Activity (EDA) signals, better than any other investigated models, while using 20% less parameters on average. MCLeaky neuron was also tested for various signals including EDA Wrist and Chest, Temperature, ECG, and combinations of them. Quantized MCLeaky model was also derived and validated to forecast their performance on hardware architectures, which resulted in 91.84% accuracy. The neurons were evaluated for multiple modalities of data towards stress detection, which resulted in energy savings of 25.12x to 39.20x and EDP gains of 52.37x to 81.9x over ANNs, while offering a best accuracy of 98.8% when compared with the rest of the SOTA implementations.</description>

      <title>On the Expressive Power of Tree-Structured Probabilistic Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05465v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Probabilistic circuits (PCs) have emerged as a powerful framework to compactly represent probability distributions for efficient and exact probabilistic inference. It has been shown that PCs with a general directed acyclic graph (DAG) structure can be understood as a mixture of exponentially (in its height) many components, each of which is a product distribution over univariate marginals. However, existing structure learning algorithms for PCs often generate tree-structured circuits or use tree-structured circuits as intermediate steps to compress them into DAG-structured circuits. This leads to the intriguing question of whether there exists an exponential gap between DAGs and trees for the PC structure. In this paper, we provide a negative answer to this conjecture by proving that, for $n$ variables, there exists a quasi-polynomial upper bound $n^{O(\log n)}$ on the size of an equivalent tree computing the same probability distribution. On the other hand, we also show that given a depth restriction on the tree, there is a super-polynomial separation between tree and DAG-structured PCs. Our work takes an important step towards understanding the expressive power of tree-structured PCs, and our techniques may be of independent interest in the study of structure learning algorithms for PCs.</description>

      <title>Parametric model reduction of mean-field and stochastic systems via higher-order action matching</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12000v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The aim of this work is to learn models of population dynamics of physical systems that feature stochastic and mean-field effects and that depend on physics parameters. The learned models can act as surrogates of classical numerical models to efficiently predict the system behavior over the physics parameters. Building on the Benamou-Brenier formula from optimal transport and action matching, we use a variational problem to infer parameter- and time-dependent gradient fields that represent approximations of the population dynamics. The inferred gradient fields can then be used to rapidly generate sample trajectories that mimic the dynamics of the physical system on a population level over varying physics parameters. We show that combining Monte Carlo sampling with higher-order quadrature rules is critical for accurately estimating the training objective from sample data and for stabilizing the training process. We demonstrate on Vlasov-Poisson instabilities as well as on high-dimensional particle and chaotic systems that our approach accurately predicts population dynamics over a wide range of parameters and outperforms state-of-the-art diffusion-based and flow-based modeling that simply condition on time and physics parameters.</description>

      <title>A Transformer Based Generative Chemical Language AI Model for Structural Elucidation of Organic Compounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14719v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For over half a century, computer-aided structural elucidation systems (CASE) for organic compounds have relied on complex expert systems with explicitly programmed algorithms. These systems are often computationally inefficient for complex compounds due to the vast chemical structural space that must be explored and filtered. In this study, we present a proof-of-concept transformer based generative chemical language artificial intelligence (AI) model, an innovative end-to-end architecture designed to replace the logic and workflow of the classic CASE framework for ultra-fast and accurate spectroscopic-based structural elucidation. Our model employs an encoder-decoder architecture and self-attention mechanisms, similar to those in large language models, to directly generate the most probable chemical structures that match the input spectroscopic data. Trained on ~ 102k IR, UV, and 1H NMR spectra, it performs structural elucidation of molecules with up to 29 atoms in just a few seconds on a modern CPU, achieving a top-15 accuracy of 83%. This approach demonstrates the potential of transformer based generative AI to accelerate traditional scientific problem-solving processes. The model's ability to iterate quickly based on new data highlights its potential for rapid advancements in structural elucidation.</description>

      <title>The Representation of Meaningful Precision, and Accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14721v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The concepts of precision, and accuracy are domain and problem dependent. The simplified numeric hard and soft measures used in the fields of statistical learning, many types of machine learning, and binary or multiclass classification problems are known to be of limited use for understanding the meaningfulness of models or their relevance. Arguably, they are neither of patterns nor proofs. Further, there are no good measures or representations for analogous concepts in the cognition domain. In this research, the key issues are reflected upon, and a compositional knowledge representation approach in a minimalist general rough framework is proposed for the problem contexts. The latter is general enough to cover most application contexts, and may be applicable in the light of improved computational tools available.</description>

      <title>SPRIG: Improving Large Language Model Performance by System Prompt Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14826v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in many scenarios, but their performance depends, in part, on the choice of prompt. Past research has focused on optimizing prompts specific to a task. However, much less attention has been given to optimizing the general instructions included in a prompt, known as a system prompt. To address this gap, we propose SPRIG, an edit-based genetic algorithm that iteratively constructs prompts from prespecified components to maximize the model's performance in general scenarios. We evaluate the performance of system prompts on a collection of 47 different types of tasks to ensure generalizability. Our study finds that a single optimized system prompt performs on par with task prompts optimized for each individual task. Moreover, combining system and task-level optimizations leads to further improvement, which showcases their complementary nature. Experiments also reveal that the optimized system prompts generalize effectively across model families, parameter sizes, and languages. This study provides insights into the role of system-level instructions in maximizing LLM potential.</description>

      <title>Time-Varying Convex Optimization with $O(n)$ Computational Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15009v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we consider the problem of unconstrained time-varying convex optimization, where the cost function changes with time. We provide an in-depth technical analysis of the problem and argue why freezing the cost at each time step and taking finite steps toward the minimizer is not the best tracking solution for this problem. We propose a set of algorithms that by taking into account the temporal variation of the cost aim to reduce the tracking error of the time-varying minimizer of the problem. The main contribution of our work is that our proposed algorithms only require the first-order derivatives of the cost function with respect to the decision variable. This approach significantly reduces computational cost compared to the existing algorithms, which use the inverse of the Hessian of the cost. Specifically, the proposed algorithms reduce the computational cost from $O(n^3)$ to $O(n)$ per timestep, where $n$ is the size of the decision variable. Avoiding the inverse of the Hessian also makes our algorithms applicable to non-convex optimization problems. We refer to these algorithms as $O(n)$-algorithms. These $O(n)$-algorithms are designed to solve the problem for different scenarios based on the available temporal information about the cost. We illustrate our results through various examples, including the solution of a model predictive control problem framed as a convex optimization problem with a streaming time-varying cost function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15923v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Numerous Optimization Algorithms have a time-varying update rule thanks to, for instance, a changing step size, momentum parameter or, Hessian approximation. In this paper, we apply unrolled or automatic differentiation to a time-varying iterative process and provide convergence (rate) guarantees for the resulting derivative iterates. We adapt these convergence results and apply them to proximal gradient descent with variable step size and FISTA when solving partly smooth problems. We confirm our findings numerically by solving $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$-regularized linear and logisitc regression respectively. Our theoretical and numerical results show that the convergence rate of the algorithm is reflected in its derivative iterates.</description>

      <title>Limit Theorems for Stochastic Gradient Descent with Infinite Variance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16340v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stochastic gradient descent is a classic algorithm that has gained great popularity especially in the last decades as the most common approach for training models in machine learning. While the algorithm has been well-studied when stochastic gradients are assumed to have a finite variance, there is significantly less research addressing its theoretical properties in the case of infinite variance gradients. In this paper, we establish the asymptotic behavior of stochastic gradient descent in the context of infinite variance stochastic gradients, assuming that the stochastic gradient is regular varying with index $\alpha\in(1,2)$. The closest result in this context was established in 1969 , in the one-dimensional case and assuming that stochastic gradients belong to a more restrictive class of distributions. We extend it to the multidimensional case, covering a broader class of infinite variance distributions. As we show, the asymptotic distribution of the stochastic gradient descent algorithm can be characterized as the stationary distribution of a suitably defined Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process driven by an appropriate stable L\'evy process. Additionally, we explore the applications of these results in linear regression and logistic regression models.</description>

      <title>Bayesian scaling laws for in-context learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16531v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) is a powerful technique for getting language models to perform complex tasks with no training updates. Prior work has established strong correlations between the number of in-context examples provided and the accuracy of the model's predictions. In this paper, we seek to explain this correlation by showing that ICL approximates a Bayesian learner. This perspective gives rise to a family of novel Bayesian scaling laws for ICL. In experiments with \mbox{GPT-2} models of different sizes, our scaling laws exceed or match existing scaling laws in accuracy while also offering interpretable terms for task priors, learning efficiency, and per-example probabilities. To illustrate the analytic power that such interpretable scaling laws provide, we report on controlled synthetic dataset experiments designed to inform real-world studies of safety alignment. In our experimental protocol, we use SFT to suppress an unwanted existing model capability and then use ICL to try to bring that capability back (many-shot jailbreaking). We then experiment on real-world instruction-tuned LLMs using capabilities benchmarks as well as a new many-shot jailbreaking dataset. In all cases, Bayesian scaling laws accurately predict the conditions under which ICL will cause the suppressed behavior to reemerge, which sheds light on the ineffectiveness of post-training at increasing LLM safety.</description>

      <title>Learning Mathematical Rules with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16973v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the ability of large language models to learn specific mathematical rules such as distributivity or simplifying equations. We present an empirical analysis of their ability to generalize these rules, as well as to reuse them in the context of word problems. For this purpose, we provide a rigorous methodology to build synthetic data incorporating such rules, and perform fine-tuning of large language models on such data. Our experiments show that our model can learn and generalize these rules to some extent, as well as suitably reuse them in the context of word problems.</description>

      <title>UnCLe: Unsupervised Continual Learning of Depth Completion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18074v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose UnCLe, a standardized benchmark for Unsupervised Continual Learning of a multimodal depth estimation task: Depth completion aims to infer a dense depth map from a pair of synchronized RGB image and sparse depth map. We benchmark depth completion models under the practical scenario of unsupervised learning over continuous streams of data. Existing methods are typically trained on a static, or stationary, dataset. However, when adapting to novel non-stationary distributions, they "catastrophically forget" previously learned information. UnCLe simulates these non-stationary distributions by adapting depth completion models to sequences of datasets containing diverse scenes captured from distinct domains using different visual and range sensors. We adopt representative methods from continual learning paradigms and translate them to enable unsupervised continual learning of depth completion. We benchmark these models for indoor and outdoor and investigate the degree of catastrophic forgetting through standard quantitative metrics. Furthermore, we introduce model inversion quality as an additional measure of forgetting. We find that unsupervised continual learning of depth completion is an open problem, and we invite researchers to leverage UnCLe as a development platform.</description>

      <title>Data Efficiency for Large Recommendation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18111v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large recommendation models (LRMs) are fundamental to the multi-billion dollar online advertising industry, processing massive datasets of hundreds of billions of examples before transitioning to continuous online training to adapt to rapidly changing user behavior. The massive scale of data directly impacts both computational costs and the speed at which new methods can be evaluated (R&amp;D velocity). This paper presents actionable principles and high-level frameworks to guide practitioners in optimizing training data requirements. These strategies have been successfully deployed in Google's largest Ads CTR prediction models and are broadly applicable beyond LRMs. We outline the concept of data convergence, describe methods to accelerate this convergence, and finally, detail how to optimally balance training data volume with model size.</description>

      <title>Link, Synthesize, Retrieve: Universal Document Linking for Zero-Shot Information Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18385v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the recent advancements in information retrieval (IR), zero-shot IR remains a significant challenge, especially when dealing with new domains, languages, and newly-released use cases that lack historical query traffic from existing users. For such cases, it is common to use query augmentations followed by fine-tuning pre-trained models on the document data paired with synthetic queries. In this work, we propose a novel Universal Document Linking (UDL) algorithm, which links similar documents to enhance synthetic query generation across multiple datasets with different characteristics. UDL leverages entropy for the choice of similarity models and named entity recognition (NER) for the link decision of documents using similarity scores. Our empirical studies demonstrate the effectiveness and universality of the UDL across diverse datasets and IR models, surpassing state-of-the-art methods in zero-shot cases. The developed code for reproducibility is included in https://github.com/eoduself/UDL</description>
