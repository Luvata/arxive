      <title>LLaVE: Large Language and Vision Embedding Models with Hardness-Weighted Contrastive Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Universal multimodal embedding models play a critical role in tasks such as interleaved image-text retrieval, multimodal RAG, and multimodal clustering. However, our empirical results indicate that existing LMM-based embedding models trained with the standard InfoNCE loss exhibit a high degree of overlap in similarity distribution between positive and negative pairs, making it challenging to distinguish hard negative pairs effectively. To deal with this issue, we propose a simple yet effective framework that dynamically improves the embedding model's representation learning for negative pairs based on their discriminative difficulty. Within this framework, we train a series of models, named LLaVE, and evaluate them on the MMEB benchmark, which covers 4 meta-tasks and 36 datasets. Experimental results show that LLaVE establishes stronger baselines that achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance while demonstrating strong scalability and efficiency. Specifically, LLaVE-2B surpasses the previous SOTA 7B models, while LLaVE-7B achieves a further performance improvement of 6.2 points. Although LLaVE is trained on image-text data, it can generalize to text-video retrieval tasks in a zero-shot manner and achieve strong performance, demonstrating its remarkable potential for transfer to other embedding tasks.</description>

      <title>Invisible Strings: Revealing Latent Dancer-to-Dancer Interactions with Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dancing in a duet often requires a heightened attunement to one's partner: their orientation in space, their momentum, and the forces they exert on you. Dance artists who work in partnered settings might have a strong embodied understanding in the moment of how their movements relate to their partner's, but typical documentation of dance fails to capture these varied and subtle relationships. Working closely with dance artists interested in deepening their understanding of partnering, we leverage Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to highlight and interpret the intricate connections shared by two dancers. Using a video-to-3D-pose extraction pipeline, we extract 3D movements from curated videos of contemporary dance duets, apply a dedicated pre-processing to improve the reconstruction, and train a GNN to predict weighted connections between the dancers. By visualizing and interpreting the predicted relationships between the two movers, we demonstrate the potential for graph-based methods to construct alternate models of the collaborative dynamics of duets. Finally, we offer some example strategies for how to use these insights to inform a generative and co-creative studio practice.</description>

      <title>DA-STGCN: 4D Trajectory Prediction Based on Spatiotemporal Feature Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The importance of four-dimensional (4D) trajectory prediction within air traffic management systems is on the rise. Key operations such as conflict detection and resolution, aircraft anomaly monitoring, and the management of congested flight paths are increasingly reliant on this foundational technology, underscoring the urgent demand for intelligent solutions. The dynamics in airport terminal zones and crowded airspaces are intricate and ever-changing; however, current methodologies do not sufficiently account for the interactions among aircraft. To tackle these challenges, we propose DA-STGCN, an innovative spatiotemporal graph convolutional network that integrates a dual attention mechanism. Our model reconstructs the adjacency matrix through a self-attention approach, enhancing the capture of node correlations, and employs graph attention to distill spatiotemporal characteristics, thereby generating a probabilistic distribution of predicted trajectories. This novel adjacency matrix, reconstructed with the self-attention mechanism, is dynamically optimized throughout the network's training process, offering a more nuanced reflection of the inter-node relationships compared to traditional algorithms. The performance of the model is validated on two ADS-B datasets, one near the airport terminal area and the other in dense airspace. Experimental results demonstrate a notable improvement over current 4D trajectory prediction methods, achieving a 20% and 30% reduction in the Average Displacement Error (ADE) and Final Displacement Error (FDE), respectively. The incorporation of a Dual-Attention module has been shown to significantly enhance the extraction of node correlations, as verified by ablation experiments.</description>

      <title>StickMotion: Generating 3D Human Motions by Drawing a Stickman</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text-to-motion generation, which translates textual descriptions into human motions, has been challenging in accurately capturing detailed user-imagined motions from simple text inputs. This paper introduces StickMotion, an efficient diffusion-based network designed for multi-condition scenarios, which generates desired motions based on traditional text and our proposed stickman conditions for global and local control of these motions, respectively. We address the challenges introduced by the user-friendly stickman from three perspectives: 1) Data generation. We develop an algorithm to generate hand-drawn stickmen automatically across different dataset formats. 2) Multi-condition fusion. We propose a multi-condition module that integrates into the diffusion process and obtains outputs of all possible condition combinations, reducing computational complexity and enhancing StickMotion's performance compared to conventional approaches with the self-attention module. 3) Dynamic supervision. We empower StickMotion to make minor adjustments to the stickman's position within the output sequences, generating more natural movements through our proposed dynamic supervision strategy. Through quantitative experiments and user studies, sketching stickmen saves users about 51.5% of their time generating motions consistent with their imagination. Our codes, demos, and relevant data will be released to facilitate further research and validation within the scientific community.</description>

      <title>RD Efficient FPGA Deployment of Learned Image Compression: Knowledge Distillation and Hybrid Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learnable Image Compression (LIC) has shown the potential to outperform standardized video codecs in RD efficiency, prompting the research for hardware-friendly implementations. Most existing LIC hardware implementations prioritize latency to RD-efficiency and through an extensive exploration of the hardware design space. We present a novel design paradigm where the burden of tuning the design for a specific hardware platform is shifted towards model dimensioning and without compromising on RD-efficiency. First, we design a framework for distilling a leaner student LIC model from a reference teacher: by tuning a single model hyperparameters, we can meet the constraints of different hardware platforms without a complex hardware design exploration. Second, we propose a hardware-friendly implementation of the Generalized Divisive Normalization (GDN) activation that preserves RD efficiency even post parameter quantization. Third, we design a pipelined FPGA configuration which takes full advantage of available FPGA resources by leveraging parallel processing and optimizing resource allocation. Our experiments with a state of the art LIC model show that we outperform all existing FPGA implementations while performing very close to the original model in terms of RD efficiency.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Training for Multimodal Large Language Models against Jailbreak Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made remarkable strides in cross-modal comprehension and generation tasks. However, they remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, where crafted perturbations bypass security guardrails and elicit harmful outputs. In this paper, we present the first adversarial training (AT) paradigm tailored to defend against jailbreak attacks during the MLLM training phase. Extending traditional AT to this domain poses two critical challenges: efficiently tuning massive parameters and ensuring robustness against attacks across multiple modalities. To address these challenges, we introduce Projection Layer Against Adversarial Training (ProEAT), an end-to-end AT framework. ProEAT incorporates a projector-based adversarial training architecture that efficiently handles large-scale parameters while maintaining computational feasibility by focusing adversarial training on a lightweight projector layer instead of the entire model; additionally, we design a dynamic weight adjustment mechanism that optimizes the loss function's weight allocation based on task demands, streamlining the tuning process. To enhance defense performance, we propose a joint optimization strategy across visual and textual modalities, ensuring robust resistance to jailbreak attacks originating from either modality. Extensive experiments conducted on five major jailbreak attack methods across three mainstream MLLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. ProEAT achieves state-of-the-art defense performance, outperforming existing baselines by an average margin of +34% across text and image modalities, while incurring only a 1% reduction in clean accuracy. Furthermore, evaluations on real-world embodied intelligent systems highlight the practical applicability of our framework, paving the way for the development of more secure and reliable multimodal systems.</description>

      <title>Distilling Dataset into Neural Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Utilizing a large-scale dataset is essential for training high-performance deep learning models, but it also comes with substantial computation and storage costs. To overcome these challenges, dataset distillation has emerged as a promising solution by compressing the large-scale dataset into a smaller synthetic dataset that retains the essential information needed for training. This paper proposes a novel parameterization framework for dataset distillation, coined Distilling Dataset into Neural Field (DDiF), which leverages the neural field to store the necessary information of the large-scale dataset. Due to the unique nature of the neural field, which takes coordinates as input and output quantity, DDiF effectively preserves the information and easily generates various shapes of data. We theoretically confirm that DDiF exhibits greater expressiveness than some previous literature when the utilized budget for a single synthetic instance is the same. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that DDiF achieves superior performance on several benchmark datasets, extending beyond the image domain to include video, audio, and 3D voxel. We release the code at https://github.com/aailab-kaist/DDiF.</description>

      <title>FedPalm: A General Federated Learning Framework for Closed- and Open-Set Palmprint Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current deep learning (DL)-based palmprint verification models rely on centralized training with large datasets, which raises significant privacy concerns due to biometric data's sensitive and immutable nature. Federated learning~(FL), a privacy-preserving distributed learning paradigm, offers a compelling alternative by enabling collaborative model training without the need for data sharing. However, FL-based palmprint verification faces critical challenges, including data heterogeneity from diverse identities and the absence of standardized evaluation benchmarks. This paper addresses these gaps by establishing a comprehensive benchmark for FL-based palmprint verification, which explicitly defines and evaluates two practical scenarios: closed-set and open-set verification. We propose FedPalm, a unified FL framework that balances local adaptability with global generalization. Each client trains a personalized textural expert tailored to local data and collaboratively contributes to a shared global textural expert for extracting generalized features. To further enhance verification performance, we introduce a Textural Expert Interaction Module that dynamically routes textural features among experts to generate refined side textural features. Learnable parameters are employed to model relationships between original and side features, fostering cross-texture-expert interaction and improving feature discrimination. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of FedPalm, demonstrating robust performance across both scenarios and providing a promising foundation for advancing FL-based palmprint verification research.</description>

      <title>Combined Physics and Event Camera Simulator for Slip Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robot manipulation is a common task in fields like industrial manufacturing. Detecting when objects slip from a robot's grasp is crucial for safe and reliable operation. Event cameras, which register pixel-level brightness changes at high temporal resolution (called ``events''), offer an elegant feature when mounted on a robot's end effector: since they only detect motion relative to their viewpoint, a properly grasped object produces no events, while a slipping object immediately triggers them. To research this feature, representative datasets are essential, both for analytic approaches and for training machine learning models. The majority of current research on slip detection with event-based data is done on real-world scenarios and manual data collection, as well as additional setups for data labeling. This can result in a significant increase in the time required for data collection, a lack of flexibility in scene setups, and a high level of complexity in the repetition of experiments. This paper presents a simulation pipeline for generating slip data using the described camera-gripper configuration in a robot arm, and demonstrates its effectiveness through initial data-driven experiments. The use of a simulator, once it is set up, has the potential to reduce the time spent on data collection, provide the ability to alter the setup at any time, simplify the process of repetition and the generation of arbitrarily large data sets. Two distinct datasets were created and validated through visual inspection and artificial neural networks (ANNs). Visual inspection confirmed photorealistic frame generation and accurate slip modeling, while three ANNs trained on this data achieved high validation accuracy and demonstrated good generalization capabilities on a separate test set, along with initial applicability to real-world data.

      <title>Advancing Multimodal In-Context Learning in Large Vision-Language Models with Task-aware Demonstrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal in-context learning (ICL) has emerged as a key capability of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), driven by their increasing scale and applicability. Despite its promise, effective ICL in the multimodal setting remains challenging due to the inherent complexity of image-text inputs and the high sensitivity of ICL performance to input configurations. In this work, we shed light on the core mechanism underlying multimodal ICL, identifying task mapping as a crucial factor in configuring robust in-context demonstration (ICD) sequences. Building on these insights, we propose \textit{SabER}, a lightweight yet powerful decoder-only transformer equipped with task-aware attention, which intelligently selects and arranges ICDs from a demonstration library in an autoregressive fashion. This design enables fine-grained feature extraction and cross-modal reasoning, iteratively refining task mapping to generate high-quality ICD sequences. Through extensive experiments covering five LVLMs and nine benchmark datasets, SabER not only demonstrates strong empirical performance, but also provides deeper understanding of how task semantics interact with multimodal ICDs. Our findings highlight the importance of principled ICD sequence configuration and open new avenues to enhance multimodal ICL in a wide range of real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>ZAugNet for Z-Slice Augmentation in Bio-Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three-dimensional biological microscopy has significantly advanced our understanding of complex biological structures. However, limitations due to microscopy techniques, sample properties or phototoxicity often result in poor z-resolution, hindering accurate cellular measurements. Here, we introduce ZAugNet, a fast, accurate, and self-supervised deep learning method for enhancing z-resolution in biological images. By performing nonlinear interpolation between consecutive slices, ZAugNet effectively doubles resolution with each iteration. Compared on several microscopy modalities and biological objects, it outperforms competing methods on most metrics. Our method leverages a generative adversarial network (GAN) architecture combined with knowledge distillation to maximize prediction speed without compromising accuracy. We also developed ZAugNet+, an extended version enabling continuous interpolation at arbitrary distances, making it particularly useful for datasets with nonuniform slice spacing. Both ZAugNet and ZAugNet+ provide high-performance, scalable z-slice augmentation solutions for large-scale 3D imaging. They are available as open-source frameworks in PyTorch, with an intuitive Colab notebook interface for easy access by the scientific community.</description>

      <title>CAUSAL3D: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Causal Learning from Visual Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: True intelligence hinges on the ability to uncover and leverage hidden causal relations. Despite significant progress in AI and computer vision (CV), there remains a lack of benchmarks for assessing models' abilities to infer latent causality from complex visual data. In this paper, we introduce \textsc{\textbf{Causal3D}}, a novel and comprehensive benchmark that integrates structured data (tables) with corresponding visual representations (images) to evaluate causal reasoning. Designed within a systematic framework, Causal3D comprises 19 3D-scene datasets capturing diverse causal relations, views, and backgrounds, enabling evaluations across scenes of varying complexity. We assess multiple state-of-the-art methods, including classical causal discovery, causal representation learning, and large/vision-language models (LLMs/VLMs). Our experiments show that as causal structures grow more complex without prior knowledge, performance declines significantly, highlighting the challenges even advanced methods face in complex causal scenarios. Causal3D serves as a vital resource for advancing causal reasoning in CV and fostering trustworthy AI in critical domains.</description>

      <title>SHAPE : Self-Improved Visual Preference Alignment by Iteratively Generating Holistic Winner</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs) increasingly rely on preference alignment to ensure reliability, which steers the model behavior via preference fine-tuning on preference data structured as ``image - winner text - loser text'' triplets. However, existing approaches often suffer from limited diversity and high costs associated with human-annotated preference data, hindering LVLMs from fully achieving their intended alignment capabilities. We present \projectname, a self-supervised framework capable of transforming the already abundant supervised text-image pairs into holistic preference triplets for more effective and cheaper LVLM alignment, eliminating the need for human preference annotations. Our approach facilitates LVLMs in progressively enhancing alignment capabilities through iterative self-improvement. The key design rationale is to devise preference triplets where the winner text consistently improves in holisticness and outperforms the loser response in quality, thereby pushing the model to ``strive to the utmost'' of alignment performance through preference fine-tuning. For each given text-image pair, SHAPE introduces multiple visual augmentations and pairs them with a summarized text to serve as the winner response, while designating the original text as the loser response. Experiments across \textbf{12} benchmarks on various model architectures and sizes, including LLaVA and DeepSeek-VL, show that SHAPE achieves significant gains, for example, achieving +11.3\% on MMVet (comprehensive evaluation), +1.4\% on MMBench (general VQA), and +8.0\% on POPE (hallucination robustness) over baselines in 7B models. Notably, qualitative analyses confirm enhanced attention to visual details and better alignment with human preferences for holistic descriptions.</description>

      <title>End-to-End Human Pose Reconstruction from Wearable Sensors for 6G Extended Reality Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Full 3D human pose reconstruction is a critical enabler for extended reality (XR) applications in future sixth generation (6G) networks, supporting immersive interactions in gaming, virtual meetings, and remote collaboration. However, achieving accurate pose reconstruction over wireless networks remains challenging due to channel impairments, bit errors, and quantization effects. Existing approaches often assume error-free transmission in indoor settings, limiting their applicability to real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a novel deep learning-based framework for human pose reconstruction over orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) systems. The framework introduces a two-stage deep learning receiver: the first stage jointly estimates the wireless channel and decodes OFDM symbols, and the second stage maps the received sensor signals to full 3D body poses. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed neural receiver reduces bit error rate (BER), thus gaining a 5 dB gap at $10^{-4}$ BER, compared to the baseline method that employs separate signal detection steps, i.e., least squares channel estimation and linear minimum mean square error equalization. Additionally, our empirical findings show that 8-bit quantization is sufficient for accurate pose reconstruction, achieving a mean squared error of $5\times10^{-4}$ for reconstructed sensor signals, and reducing joint angular error by 37\% for the reconstructed human poses compared to the baseline.</description>

      <title>High-Precision Transformer-Based Visual Servoing for Humanoid Robots in Aligning Tiny Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-precision tiny object alignment remains a common and critical challenge for humanoid robots in real-world. To address this problem, this paper proposes a vision-based framework for precisely estimating and controlling the relative position between a handheld tool and a target object for humanoid robots, e.g., a screwdriver tip and a screw head slot. By fusing images from the head and torso cameras on a robot with its head joint angles, the proposed Transformer-based visual servoing method can correct the handheld tool's positional errors effectively, especially at a close distance. Experiments on M4-M8 screws demonstrate an average convergence error of 0.8-1.3 mm and a success rate of 93\%-100\%. Through comparative analysis, the results validate that this capability of high-precision tiny object alignment is enabled by the Distance Estimation Transformer architecture and the Multi-Perception-Head mechanism proposed in this paper.</description>

      <title>Manboformer: Learning Gaussian Representations via Spatial-temporal Attention Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compared with voxel-based grid prediction, in the field of 3D semantic occupation prediction for autonomous driving, GaussianFormer proposed using 3D Gaussian to describe scenes with sparse 3D semantic Gaussian based on objects is another scheme with lower memory requirements. Each 3D Gaussian function represents a flexible region of interest and its semantic features, which are iteratively refined by the attention mechanism. In the experiment, it is found that the Gaussian function required by this method is larger than the query resolution of the original dense grid network, resulting in impaired performance. Therefore, we consider optimizing GaussianFormer by using unused temporal information. We learn the Spatial-Temporal Self-attention Mechanism from the previous grid-given occupation network and improve it to GaussianFormer. The experiment was conducted with the NuScenes dataset, and the experiment is currently underway.</description>

      <title>E4: Energy-Efficient DNN Inference for Edge Video Analytics Via Early-Exit and DVFS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep neural network (DNN) models are increasingly popular in edge video analytic applications. However, the compute-intensive nature of DNN models pose challenges for energy-efficient inference on resource-constrained edge devices. Most existing solutions focus on optimizing DNN inference latency and accuracy, often overlooking energy efficiency. They also fail to account for the varying complexity of video frames, leading to sub-optimal performance in edge video analytics. In this paper, we propose an Energy-Efficient Early-Exit (E4) framework that enhances DNN inference efficiency for edge video analytics by integrating a novel early-exit mechanism with dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) governors. It employs an attention-based cascade module to analyze video frame diversity and automatically determine optimal DNN exit points. Additionally, E4 features a just-in-time (JIT) profiler that uses coordinate descent search to co-optimize CPU and GPU clock frequencies for each layer before the DNN exit points. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that E4 outperforms current state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to 2.8x speedup and 26% average energy saving while maintaining high accuracy.</description>

      <title>Toward Lightweight and Fast Decoders for Diffusion Models in Image and Video Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate methods to reduce inference time and memory footprint in stable diffusion models by introducing lightweight decoders for both image and video synthesis. Traditional latent diffusion pipelines rely on large Variational Autoencoder decoders that can slow down generation and consume considerable GPU memory. We propose custom-trained decoders using lightweight Vision Transformer and Taming Transformer architectures. Experiments show up to 15% overall speed-ups for image generation on COCO2017 and up to 20 times faster decoding in the sub-module, with additional gains on UCF-101 for video tasks. Memory requirements are moderately reduced, and while there is a small drop in perceptual quality compared to the default decoder, the improvements in speed and scalability are crucial for large-scale inference scenarios such as generating 100K images. Our work is further contextualized by advances in efficient video generation, including dual masking strategies, illustrating a broader effort to improve the scalability and efficiency of generative models.</description>

      <title>Adapt3R: Adaptive 3D Scene Representation for Domain Transfer in Imitation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Imitation Learning (IL) has been very effective in training robots to perform complex and diverse manipulation tasks. However, its performance declines precipitously when the observations are out of the training distribution. 3D scene representations that incorporate observations from calibrated RGBD cameras have been proposed as a way to improve generalizability of IL policies, but our evaluations in cross-embodiment and novel camera pose settings found that they show only modest improvement. To address those challenges, we propose Adaptive 3D Scene Representation (Adapt3R), a general-purpose 3D observation encoder which uses a novel architecture to synthesize data from one or more RGBD cameras into a single vector that can then be used as conditioning for arbitrary IL algorithms. The key idea is to use a pretrained 2D backbone to extract semantic information about the scene, using 3D only as a medium for localizing this semantic information with respect to the end-effector. We show that when trained end-to-end with several SOTA multi-task IL algorithms, Adapt3R maintains these algorithms' multi-task learning capacity while enabling zero-shot transfer to novel embodiments and camera poses. Furthermore, we provide a detailed suite of ablation and sensitivity experiments to elucidate the design space for point cloud observation encoders.</description>

      <title>Extracting Symbolic Sequences from Visual Representations via Self-Supervised Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the potential of abstracting complex visual information into discrete, structured symbolic sequences using self-supervised learning (SSL). Inspired by how language abstracts and organizes information to enable better reasoning and generalization, we propose a novel approach for generating symbolic representations from visual data. To learn these sequences, we extend the DINO framework to handle visual and symbolic information. Initial experiments suggest that the generated symbolic sequences capture a meaningful level of abstraction, though further refinement is required. An advantage of our method is its interpretability: the sequences are produced by a decoder transformer using cross-attention, allowing attention maps to be linked to specific symbols and offering insight into how these representations correspond to image regions. This approach lays the foundation for creating interpretable symbolic representations with potential applications in high-level scene understanding.</description>

      <title>Fine-Tuning Florence2 for Enhanced Object Detection in Un-constructed Environments: Vision-Language Model Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence has progressed through the development of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), which integrate text and visual inputs to achieve comprehensive understanding and interaction in various contexts. Enhancing the performance of these models such as the transformer based Florence 2 on specialized tasks like object detection in complex and unstructured environments requires fine-tuning. The goal of this paper is to improve the efficiency of the Florence 2 model in challenging environments by finetuning it. We accomplished this by experimenting with different configurations, using various GPU types (T4, L4, A100) and optimizers such as AdamW and SGD. We also employed a range of learning rates and LoRA (Low Rank Adaptation) settings. Analyzing the performance metrics, such as Mean Average Precision (mAP) scores,reveals that the finetuned Florence 2 models performed comparably to YOLO models, including YOLOv8, YOLOv9, and YOLOv10. This demonstrates how transformer based VLMs can be adapted for detailed object detection tasks. The paper emphasizes the capability of optimized transformer based VLMs to address specific challenges in object detection within unstructured environments, opening up promising avenues for practical applications in demanding and complex settings.</description>

      <title>FirePlace: Geometric Refinements of LLM Common Sense Reasoning for 3D Object Placement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scene generation with 3D assets presents a complex challenge, requiring both high-level semantic understanding and low-level geometric reasoning. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at semantic tasks, their application to 3D scene generation is hindered by their limited grounding on 3D geometry. In this paper, we investigate how to best work with MLLMs in an object placement task. Towards this goal, we introduce a novel framework, FirePlace, that applies existing MLLMs in (1) 3D geometric reasoning and the extraction of relevant geometric details from the 3D scene, (2) constructing and solving geometric constraints on the extracted low-level geometry, and (3) pruning for final placements that conform to common sense. By combining geometric reasoning with real-world understanding of MLLMs, our method can propose object placements that satisfy both geometric constraints as well as high-level semantic common-sense considerations. Our experiments show that these capabilities allow our method to place objects more effectively in complex scenes with intricate geometry, surpassing the quality of prior work.</description>

      <title>Metadata-free Georegistration of Ground and Airborne Imagery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heterogeneous collections of ground and airborne imagery can readily be used to create high-quality 3D models and novel viewpoint renderings of the observed scene. Standard photogrammetry pipelines generate models in arbitrary coordinate systems, which is problematic for applications that require georegistered models. Even for applications that do not require georegistered models, georegistration is useful as a mechanism for aligning multiple disconnected models generated from non-overlapping data. The proposed method leverages satellite imagery, an associated digital surface model (DSM), and the novel view generation capabilities of modern 3D modeling techniques (e.g. neural radiance fields) to provide a robust method for georegistering airborne imagery, and a related technique for registering ground-based imagery to models created from airborne imagery. Experiments demonstrate successful georegistration of airborne and ground-based photogrammetric models across a variety of distinct sites. The proposed method does not require use of any metadata other than a satellite-based reference product and therefore has general applicability.</description>

      <title>Spectral Informed Mamba for Robust Point Cloud Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: State space models have shown significant promise in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and, more recently, computer vision. This paper introduces a new methodology leveraging Mamba and Masked Autoencoder networks for point cloud data in both supervised and self-supervised learning. We propose three key contributions to enhance Mamba's capability in processing complex point cloud structures. First, we exploit the spectrum of a graph Laplacian to capture patch connectivity, defining an isometry-invariant traversal order that is robust to viewpoints and better captures shape manifolds than traditional 3D grid-based traversals. Second, we adapt segmentation via a recursive patch partitioning strategy informed by Laplacian spectral components, allowing finer integration and segment analysis. Third, we address token placement in Masked Autoencoder for Mamba by restoring tokens to their original positions, which preserves essential order and improves learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the improvements of our approach in classification, segmentation, and few-shot tasks over state-of-the-art baselines.</description>

      <title>HyDA: Hypernetworks for Test Time Domain Adaptation in Medical Imaging Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medical imaging datasets often vary due to differences in acquisition protocols, patient demographics, and imaging devices. These variations in data distribution, known as domain shift, present a significant challenge in adapting imaging analysis models for practical healthcare applications.
  Most current domain adaptation (DA) approaches aim either to align the distributions between the source and target domains or to learn an invariant feature space that generalizes well across all domains. However, both strategies require access to a sufficient number of examples, though not necessarily annotated, from the test domain during training. This limitation hinders the widespread deployment of models in clinical settings, where target domain data may only be accessible in real time.
  In this work, we introduce HyDA, a novel hypernetwork framework that leverages domain characteristics rather than suppressing them, enabling dynamic adaptation at inference time. Specifically, HyDA learns implicit domain representations and uses them to adjust model parameters on-the-fly, effectively interpolating to unseen domains. We validate HyDA on two clinically relevant applications - MRI brain age prediction and chest X-ray pathology classification - demonstrating its ability to generalize across tasks and modalities. Our code is available at TBD.</description>

      <title>LVLM-Compress-Bench: Benchmarking the Broader Impact of Large Vision-Language Model Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite recent efforts in understanding the compression impact on large language models (LLMs) in terms of their downstream task performance and trustworthiness on relatively simpler uni-modal benchmarks (for example, question answering, common sense reasoning), their detailed study on multi-modal Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) is yet to be unveiled. Towards mitigating this gap, we present LVLM-Compress-Bench, a framework to first thoroughly study the broad impact of compression on the generative performance of LVLMs with multi-modal input driven tasks. In specific, we consider two major classes of compression for autoregressive models, namely KV cache and weight compression, for the dynamically growing intermediate cache and static weights, respectively.
  We use four LVLM variants of the popular LLaVA framework to present our analysis via integrating various state-of-the-art KV and weight compression methods including uniform, outlier-reduced, and group quantization for the KV cache and weights. With this framework we demonstrate on ten different multi-modal datasets with different capabilities including recognition, knowledge, language generation, spatial awareness, visual reasoning, hallucination and visual illusion identification, toxicity, stereotypes and bias. In specific, our framework demonstrates the compression impact on both general and ethically critical metrics leveraging a combination of real world and synthetic datasets to encompass diverse societal intersectional attributes. Extensive experimental evaluations yield diverse and intriguing observations on the behavior of LVLMs at different quantization budget of KV and weights, in both maintaining and losing performance as compared to the baseline model with FP16 data format.

      <title>Leveraging Large Language Models For Scalable Vector Graphics Processing: A Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, rapid advances in computer vision have significantly improved the processing and generation of raster images. However, vector graphics, which is essential in digital design, due to its scalability and ease of editing, have been relatively understudied. Traditional vectorization techniques, which are often used in vector generation, suffer from long processing times and excessive output complexity, limiting their usability in practical applications. The advent of large language models (LLMs) has opened new possibilities for the generation, editing, and analysis of vector graphics, particularly in the SVG format, which is inherently text-based and well-suited for integration with LLMs.
  This paper provides a systematic review of existing LLM-based approaches for SVG processing, categorizing them into three main tasks: generation, editing, and understanding. We observe notable models such as IconShop, StrokeNUWA, and StarVector, highlighting their strengths and limitations. Furthermore, we analyze benchmark datasets designed for assessing SVG-related tasks, including SVGEditBench, VGBench, and SGP-Bench, and conduct a series of experiments to evaluate various LLMs in these domains. Our results demonstrate that for vector graphics reasoning-enhanced models outperform standard LLMs, particularly in generation and understanding tasks. Furthermore, our findings underscore the need to develop more diverse and richly annotated datasets to further improve LLM capabilities in vector graphics tasks.</description>

      <title>ISP-AD: A Large-Scale Real-World Dataset for Advancing Industrial Anomaly Detection with Synthetic and Real Defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automatic visual inspection using machine learning-based methods plays a key role in achieving zero-defect policies in industry. Research on anomaly detection approaches is constrained by the availability of datasets that represent complex defect appearances and imperfect imaging conditions, which are typical to industrial processes. Recent benchmarks indicate that most publicly available datasets are biased towards optimal imaging conditions, leading to an overestimation of the methods' applicability to real-world industrial scenarios. To address this gap, we introduce the Industrial Screen Printing Anomaly Detection dataset (ISP-AD). It presents challenging small and weakly contrasted surface defects embedded within structured patterns exhibiting high permitted design variability. To the best of our knowledge, it is the largest publicly available industrial dataset to date, including both synthetic and real defects collected directly from the factory floor. In addition to the evaluation of defect detection performance of recent unsupervised anomaly detection methods, experiments on a mixed supervised training approach, incorporating both synthesized and real defects, were conducted. Even small amounts of injected real defects prove beneficial for model generalization. Furthermore, starting from training on purely synthetic defects, emerging real defective samples can be efficiently integrated into subsequent scalable training. Research findings indicate that supervision by means of both synthetic and accumulated real defects can complement each other, meeting demanded industrial inspection requirements such as low false positive rates and high recall. The presented unsupervised and supervised dataset splits are designed to emphasize research on unsupervised, self-supervised, and supervised approaches, enhancing their applicability to industrial settings.</description>

      <title>Taming Video Diffusion Prior with Scene-Grounding Guidance for 3D Gaussian Splatting from Sparse Inputs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite recent successes in novel view synthesis using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), modeling scenes with sparse inputs remains a challenge. In this work, we address two critical yet overlooked issues in real-world sparse-input modeling: extrapolation and occlusion. To tackle these issues, we propose to use a reconstruction by generation pipeline that leverages learned priors from video diffusion models to provide plausible interpretations for regions outside the field of view or occluded. However, the generated sequences exhibit inconsistencies that do not fully benefit subsequent 3DGS modeling. To address the challenge of inconsistencies, we introduce a novel scene-grounding guidance based on rendered sequences from an optimized 3DGS, which tames the diffusion model to generate consistent sequences. This guidance is training-free and does not require any fine-tuning of the diffusion model. To facilitate holistic scene modeling, we also propose a trajectory initialization method. It effectively identifies regions that are outside the field of view and occluded. We further design a scheme tailored for 3DGS optimization with generated sequences. Experiments demonstrate that our method significantly improves upon the baseline and achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Fake It To Make It: Virtual Multiviews to Enhance Monocular Indoor Semantic Scene Completion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monocular Indoor Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) aims to reconstruct a 3D semantic occupancy map from a single RGB image of an indoor scene, inferring spatial layout and object categories from 2D image cues. The challenge of this task arises from the depth, scale, and shape ambiguities that emerge when transforming a 2D image into 3D space, particularly within the complex and often heavily occluded environments of indoor scenes. Current SSC methods often struggle with these ambiguities, resulting in distorted or missing object representations. To overcome these limitations, we introduce an innovative approach that leverages novel view synthesis and multiview fusion. Specifically, we demonstrate how virtual cameras can be placed around the scene to emulate multiview inputs that enhance contextual scene information. We also introduce a Multiview Fusion Adaptor (MVFA) to effectively combine the multiview 3D scene predictions into a unified 3D semantic occupancy map. Finally, we identify and study the inherent limitation of generative techniques when applied to SSC, specifically the Novelty-Consistency tradeoff. Our system, GenFuSE, demonstrates IoU score improvements of up to 2.8% for Scene Completion and 4.9% for Semantic Scene Completion when integrated with existing SSC networks on the NYUv2 dataset. This work introduces GenFuSE as a standard framework for advancing monocular SSC with synthesized inputs.</description>

      <title>Visual Cues of Gender and Race are Associated with Stereotyping in Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current research on bias in Vision Language Models (VLMs) has important limitations: it is focused exclusively on trait associations while ignoring other forms of stereotyping, it examines specific contexts where biases are expected to appear, and it conceptualizes social categories like race and gender as binary, ignoring the multifaceted nature of these identities. Using standardized facial images that vary in prototypicality, we test four VLMs for both trait associations and homogeneity bias in open-ended contexts. We find that VLMs consistently generate more uniform stories for women compared to men, with people who are more gender prototypical in appearance being represented more uniformly. By contrast, VLMs represent White Americans more uniformly than Black Americans. Unlike with gender prototypicality, race prototypicality was not related to stronger uniformity. In terms of trait associations, we find limited evidence of stereotyping-Black Americans were consistently linked with basketball across all models, while other racial associations (i.e., art, healthcare, appearance) varied by specific VLM. These findings demonstrate that VLM stereotyping manifests in ways that go beyond simple group membership, suggesting that conventional bias mitigation strategies may be insufficient to address VLM stereotyping and that homogeneity bias persists even when trait associations are less apparent in model outputs.</description>

      <title>SMILENet: Unleashing Extra-Large Capacity Image Steganography via a Synergistic Mosaic InvertibLE Hiding Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing image steganography methods face fundamental limitations in hiding capacity (typically $1\sim7$ images) due to severe information interference and uncoordinated capacity-distortion trade-off. We propose SMILENet, a novel synergistic framework that achieves 25 image hiding through three key innovations: (i) A synergistic network architecture coordinates reversible and non-reversible operations to efficiently exploit information redundancy in both secret and cover images. The reversible Invertible Cover-Driven Mosaic (ICDM) module and Invertible Mosaic Secret Embedding (IMSE) module establish cover-guided mosaic transformations and representation embedding with mathematically guaranteed invertibility for distortion-free embedding. The non-reversible Secret Information Selection (SIS) module and Secret Detail Enhancement (SDE) module implement learnable feature modulation for critical information selection and enhancement. (ii) A unified training strategy that coordinates complementary modules to achieve 3.0x higher capacity than existing methods with superior visual quality. (iii) Last but not least, we introduce a new metric to model Capacity-Distortion Trade-off for evaluating the image steganography algorithms that jointly considers hiding capacity and distortion, and provides a unified evaluation approach for accessing results with different number of secret image. Extensive experiments on DIV2K, Paris StreetView and ImageNet1K show that SMILENet outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of hiding capacity, recovery quality as well as security against steganalysis methods.</description>

      <title>EDM: Efficient Deep Feature Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent feature matching methods have achieved remarkable performance but lack efficiency consideration. In this paper, we revisit the mainstream detector-free matching pipeline and improve all its stages considering both accuracy and efficiency. We propose an Efficient Deep feature Matching network, EDM. We first adopt a deeper CNN with fewer dimensions to extract multi-level features. Then we present a Correlation Injection Module that conducts feature transformation on high-level deep features, and progressively injects feature correlations from global to local for efficient multi-scale feature aggregation, improving both speed and performance. In the refinement stage, a novel lightweight bidirectional axis-based regression head is designed to directly predict subpixel-level correspondences from latent features, avoiding the significant computational cost of explicitly locating keypoints on high-resolution local feature heatmaps. Moreover, effective selection strategies are introduced to enhance matching accuracy. Extensive experiments show that our EDM achieves competitive matching accuracy on various benchmarks and exhibits excellent efficiency, offering valuable best practices for real-world applications.

      <title>HexPlane Representation for 3D Semantic Scene Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the HexPlane representation for 3D semantic scene understanding. Specifically, we first design the View Projection Module (VPM) to project the 3D point cloud into six planes to maximally retain the original spatial information. Features of six planes are extracted by the 2D encoder and sent to the HexPlane Association Module (HAM) to adaptively fuse the most informative information for each point. The fused point features are further fed to the task head to yield the ultimate predictions. Compared to the popular point and voxel representation, the HexPlane representation is efficient and can utilize highly optimized 2D operations to process sparse and unordered 3D point clouds. It can also leverage off-the-shelf 2D models, network weights, and training recipes to achieve accurate scene understanding in 3D space. On ScanNet and SemanticKITTI benchmarks, our algorithm, dubbed HexNet3D, achieves competitive performance with previous algorithms. In particular, on the ScanNet 3D segmentation task, our method obtains 77.0 mIoU on the validation set, surpassing Point Transformer V2 by 1.6 mIoU. We also observe encouraging results in indoor 3D detection tasks. Note that our method can be seamlessly integrated into existing voxel-based, point-based, and range-based approaches and brings considerable gains without bells and whistles. The codes will be available upon publication.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research focuses on the development and enhancement of text-to-image denoising diffusion models, addressing key challenges such as limited sample diversity and training instability. By incorporating Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) and Exponential Moving Average (EMA) techniques, this study significantly improves image quality, diversity, and stability. Utilizing Hugging Face's state-of-the-art text-to-image generation model, the proposed enhancements establish new benchmarks in generative AI. This work explores the underlying principles of diffusion models, implements advanced strategies to overcome existing limitations, and presents a comprehensive evaluation of the improvements achieved. Results demonstrate substantial progress in generating stable, diverse, and high-quality images from textual descriptions, advancing the field of generative artificial intelligence and providing new foundations for future applications.

      <title>Accelerating Diffusion Transformer via Gradient-Optimized Cache</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Feature caching has emerged as an effective strategy to accelerate diffusion transformer (DiT) sampling through temporal feature reuse. It is a challenging problem since (1) Progressive error accumulation from cached blocks significantly degrades generation quality, particularly when over 50\% of blocks are cached; (2) Current error compensation approaches neglect dynamic perturbation patterns during the caching process, leading to suboptimal error correction. To solve these problems, we propose the Gradient-Optimized Cache (GOC) with two key innovations: (1) Cached Gradient Propagation: A gradient queue dynamically computes the gradient differences between cached and recomputed features. These gradients are weighted and propagated to subsequent steps, directly compensating for the approximation errors introduced by caching. (2) Inflection-Aware Optimization: Through statistical analysis of feature variation patterns, we identify critical inflection points where the denoising trajectory changes direction. By aligning gradient updates with these detected phases, we prevent conflicting gradient directions during error correction. Extensive evaluations on ImageNet demonstrate GOC's superior trade-off between efficiency and quality. With 50\% cached blocks, GOC achieves IS 216.28 (26.3\% higher) and FID 3.907 (43\% lower) compared to baseline DiT, while maintaining identical computational costs. These improvements persist across various cache ratios, demonstrating robust adaptability to different acceleration requirements.</description>

      <title>GaussianCAD: Robust Self-Supervised CAD Reconstruction from Three Orthographic Views Using 3D Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The automatic reconstruction of 3D computer-aided design (CAD) models from CAD sketches has recently gained significant attention in the computer vision community. Most existing methods, however, rely on vector CAD sketches and 3D ground truth for supervision, which are often difficult to be obtained in industrial applications and are sensitive to noise inputs. We propose viewing CAD reconstruction as a specific instance of sparse-view 3D reconstruction to overcome these limitations. While this reformulation offers a promising perspective, existing 3D reconstruction methods typically require natural images and corresponding camera poses as inputs, which introduces two major significant challenges: (1) modality discrepancy between CAD sketches and natural images, and (2) difficulty of accurate camera pose estimation for CAD sketches. To solve these issues, we first transform the CAD sketches into representations resembling natural images and extract corresponding masks. Next, we manually calculate the camera poses for the orthographic views to ensure accurate alignment within the 3D coordinate system. Finally, we employ a customized sparse-view 3D reconstruction method to achieve high-quality reconstructions from aligned orthographic views. By leveraging raster CAD sketches for self-supervision, our approach eliminates the reliance on vector CAD sketches and 3D ground truth. Experiments on the Sub-Fusion360 dataset demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms previous approaches in CAD reconstruction performance and exhibits strong robustness to noisy inputs.</description>

      <title>EvolvingGS: High-Fidelity Streamable Volumetric Video via Evolving 3D Gaussian Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have recently seen great progress in 3D scene reconstruction through explicit point-based 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), notable for its high quality and fast rendering speed. However, reconstructing dynamic scenes such as complex human performances with long durations remains challenging. Prior efforts fall short of modeling a long-term sequence with drastic motions, frequent topology changes or interactions with props, and resort to segmenting the whole sequence into groups of frames that are processed independently, which undermines temporal stability and thereby leads to an unpleasant viewing experience and inefficient storage footprint. In view of this, we introduce EvolvingGS, a two-stage strategy that first deforms the Gaussian model to coarsely align with the target frame, and then refines it with minimal point addition/subtraction, particularly in fast-changing areas. Owing to the flexibility of the incrementally evolving representation, our method outperforms existing approaches in terms of both per-frame and temporal quality metrics while maintaining fast rendering through its purely explicit representation. Moreover, by exploiting temporal coherence between successive frames, we propose a simple yet effective compression algorithm that achieves over 50x compression rate. Extensive experiments on both public benchmarks and challenging custom datasets demonstrate that our method significantly advances the state-of-the-art in dynamic scene reconstruction, particularly for extended sequences with complex human performances.</description>

      <title>Spatial Context-Driven Positive Pair Sampling for Enhanced Histopathology Image Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning has demonstrated great promise in cancer classification from whole-slide images (WSIs) but remains constrained by the need for extensive annotations. Annotation-free methods, such as multiple instance learning (MIL) and self-supervised learning (SSL), have emerged to address this challenge; however, current SSL techniques often depend on synthetic augmentations or temporal context, which may not adequately capture the intricate spatial relationships inherent to histopathology. In this work, we introduce a novel spatial context-driven positive pair sampling strategy for SSL that leverages the natural coherence of adjacent patches in WSIs. By constructing biologically relevant positive pairs from spatially proximate patches, our approach harnesses inherent spatial coherence to enhance patch-level representations, ultimately boosting slide-level classification performance. Experiments on multiple datasets reveal that our strategy improves classification accuracy by 5\% to 10\% over the standard method, paving the way for more clinically relevant AI models in cancer diagnosis.

      <title>SplatPose: Geometry-Aware 6-DoF Pose Estimation from Single RGB Image via 3D Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 6-DoF pose estimation is a fundamental task in computer vision with wide-ranging applications in augmented reality and robotics. Existing single RGB-based methods often compromise accuracy due to their reliance on initial pose estimates and susceptibility to rotational ambiguity, while approaches requiring depth sensors or multi-view setups incur significant deployment costs. To address these limitations, we introduce SplatPose, a novel framework that synergizes 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) with a dual-branch neural architecture to achieve high-precision pose estimation using only a single RGB image. Central to our approach is the Dual-Attention Ray Scoring Network (DARS-Net), which innovatively decouples positional and angular alignment through geometry-domain attention mechanisms, explicitly modeling directional dependencies to mitigate rotational ambiguity. Additionally, a coarse-to-fine optimization pipeline progressively refines pose estimates by aligning dense 2D features between query images and 3DGS-synthesized views, effectively correcting feature misalignment and depth errors from sparse ray sampling. Experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that SplatPose achieves state-of-the-art 6-DoF pose estimation accuracy in single RGB settings, rivaling approaches that depend on depth or multi-view images.</description>

      <title>MGSR: 2D/3D Mutual-boosted Gaussian Splatting for High-fidelity Surface Reconstruction under Various Light Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Novel view synthesis (NVS) and surface reconstruction (SR) are essential tasks in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS). Despite recent progress, these tasks are often addressed independently, with GS-based rendering methods struggling under diverse light conditions and failing to produce accurate surfaces, while GS-based reconstruction methods frequently compromise rendering quality. This raises a central question: must rendering and reconstruction always involve a trade-off? To address this, we propose MGSR, a 2D/3D Mutual-boosted Gaussian splatting for Surface Reconstruction that enhances both rendering quality and 3D reconstruction accuracy. MGSR introduces two branches--one based on 2D-GS and the other on 3D-GS. The 2D-GS branch excels in surface reconstruction, providing precise geometry information to the 3D-GS branch. Leveraging this geometry, the 3D-GS branch employs a geometry-guided illumination decomposition module that captures reflected and transmitted components, enabling realistic rendering under varied light conditions. Using the transmitted component as supervision, the 2D-GS branch also achieves high-fidelity surface reconstruction. Throughout the optimization process, the 2D-GS and 3D-GS branches undergo alternating optimization, providing mutual supervision. Prior to this, each branch completes an independent warm-up phase, with an early stopping strategy implemented to reduce computational costs. We evaluate MGSR on a diverse set of synthetic and real-world datasets, at both object and scene levels, demonstrating strong performance in rendering and surface reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Spectral-Spatial Extraction through Layered Tensor Decomposition for Hyperspectral Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low rank tensor representation (LRTR) methods are very useful for hyperspectral anomaly detection (HAD). To overcome the limitations that they often overlook spectral anomaly and rely on large-scale matrix singular value decomposition, we first apply non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) to alleviate spectral dimensionality redundancy and extract spectral anomaly and then employ LRTR to extract spatial anomaly while mitigating spatial redundancy, yielding a highly efffcient layered tensor decomposition (LTD) framework for HAD. An iterative algorithm based on proximal alternating minimization is developed to solve the proposed LTD model, with convergence guarantees provided. Moreover, we introduce a rank reduction strategy with validation mechanism that adaptively reduces data size while preventing excessive reduction. Theoretically, we rigorously establish the equivalence between the tensor tubal rank and tensor group sparsity regularization (TGSR) and, under mild conditions, demonstrate that the relaxed formulation of TGSR shares the same global minimizers and optimal values as its original counterpart. Experimental results on the Airport-Beach-Urban and MVTec datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in the HAD task.</description>

      <title>Narrating the Video: Boosting Text-Video Retrieval via Comprehensive Utilization of Frame-Level Captions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent text-video retrieval, the use of additional captions from vision-language models has shown promising effects on the performance. However, existing models using additional captions often have struggled to capture the rich semantics, including temporal changes, inherent in the video. In addition, incorrect information caused by generative models can lead to inaccurate retrieval. To address these issues, we propose a new framework, Narrating the Video (NarVid), which strategically leverages the comprehensive information available from frame-level captions, the narration. The proposed NarVid exploits narration in multiple ways: 1) feature enhancement through cross-modal interactions between narration and video, 2) query-aware adaptive filtering to suppress irrelevant or incorrect information, 3) dual-modal matching score by adding query-video similarity and query-narration similarity, and 4) hard-negative loss to learn discriminative features from multiple perspectives using the two similarities from different views. Experimental results demonstrate that NarVid achieves state-of-the-art performance on various benchmark datasets.</description>

      <title>Partially Supervised Unpaired Multi-Modal Learning for Label-Efficient Medical Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unpaired Multi-Modal Learning (UMML) which leverages unpaired multi-modal data to boost model performance on each individual modality has attracted a lot of research interests in medical image analysis. However, existing UMML methods require multi-modal datasets to be fully labeled, which incurs tremendous annotation cost. In this paper, we investigate the use of partially labeled data for label-efficient unpaired multi-modal learning, which can reduce the annotation cost by up to one half. We term the new learning paradigm as Partially Supervised Unpaired Multi-Modal Learning (PSUMML) and propose a novel Decomposed partial class adaptation with snapshot Ensembled Self-Training (DEST) framework for it. Specifically, our framework consists of a compact segmentation network with modality specific normalization layers for learning with partially labeled unpaired multi-modal data. The key challenge in PSUMML lies in the complex partial class distribution discrepancy due to partial class annotation, which hinders effective knowledge transfer across modalities. We theoretically analyze this phenomenon with a decomposition theorem and propose a decomposed partial class adaptation technique to precisely align the partially labeled classes across modalities to reduce the distribution discrepancy. We further propose a snapshot ensembled self-training technique to leverage the valuable snapshot models during training to assign pseudo-labels to partially labeled pixels for self-training to boost model performance. We perform extensive experiments under different scenarios of PSUMML for two medical image segmentation tasks, namely cardiac substructure segmentation and abdominal multi-organ segmentation. Our framework outperforms existing methods significantly.</description>

      <title>Data-Efficient Generalization for Zero-shot Composed Image Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zero-shot Composed Image Retrieval (ZS-CIR) aims to retrieve the target image based on a reference image and a text description without requiring in-distribution triplets for training. One prevalent approach follows the vision-language pretraining paradigm that employs a mapping network to transfer the image embedding to a pseudo-word token in the text embedding space. However, this approach tends to impede network generalization due to modality discrepancy and distribution shift between training and inference. To this end, we propose a Data-efficient Generalization (DeG) framework, including two novel designs, namely, Textual Supplement (TS) module and Semantic-Set (S-Set). The TS module exploits compositional textual semantics during training, enhancing the pseudo-word token with more linguistic semantics and thus mitigating the modality discrepancy effectively. The S-Set exploits the zero-shot capability of pretrained Vision-Language Models (VLMs), alleviating the distribution shift and mitigating the overfitting issue from the redundancy of the large-scale image-text data. Extensive experiments over four ZS-CIR benchmarks show that DeG outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods with much less training data, and saves substantial training and inference time for practical usage.</description>

      <title>Separability Membrane: 3D Active Contour for Point Cloud Surface Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes Separability Membrane, a robust 3D active contour for extracting a surface from 3D point cloud object. Our approach defines the surface of a 3D object as the boundary that maximizes the separability of point features, such as intensity, color, or local density, between its inner and outer regions based on Fisher's ratio. Separability Membrane identifies the exact surface of a 3D object by maximizing class separability while controlling the rigidity of the 3D surface model with an adaptive B-spline surface that adjusts its properties based on the local and global separability. A key advantage of our method is its ability to accurately reconstruct surface boundaries even when they are ambiguous due to noise or outliers, without requiring any training data or conversion to volumetric representation. Evaluations on a synthetic 3D point cloud dataset and the 3DNet dataset demonstrate the membrane's effectiveness and robustness under diverse conditions.</description>

      <title>Unified Reward Model for Multimodal Understanding and Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in human preference alignment have significantly enhanced multimodal generation and understanding. A key approach is training reward models to guide preference optimization. However, existing models are often task-specific, limiting their adaptability across diverse visual applications. We also argue that jointly learning to assess multiple tasks may foster a synergistic effect, where improved image understanding enhances image generation assessment, and refined image evaluation benefits video assessment through better frame analysis. To this end, this paper proposes UnifiedReward, the first unified reward model for multimodal understanding and generation assessment, enabling both pairwise ranking and pointwise scoring, which can be employed for vision model preference alignment. Specifically, (1) we first develop UnifiedReward on our constructed large-scale human preference dataset, including both image and video generation/understanding tasks. (2) Then, it is utilized to automatically construct high-quality preference pair data based on the vision models, fine-gradually filtering their outputs through pair ranking and point sifting. (3) Finally, these data are used for their preference alignment through Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Experimental results demonstrate that joint learning to assess diverse visual tasks can lead to substantial mutual benefits and we apply our pipeline to both image and video understanding/generation tasks, significantly improving the performance in each domain.</description>

      <title>ColFigPhotoAttnNet: Reliable Finger Photo Presentation Attack Detection Leveraging Window-Attention on Color Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finger photo Presentation Attack Detection (PAD) can significantly strengthen smartphone device security. However, these algorithms are trained to detect certain types of attacks. Furthermore, they are designed to operate on images acquired by specific capture devices, leading to poor generalization and a lack of robustness in handling the evolving nature of mobile hardware. The proposed investigation is the first to systematically analyze the performance degradation of existing deep learning PAD systems, convolutional and transformers, in cross-capture device settings. In this paper, we introduce the ColFigPhotoAttnNet architecture designed based on window attention on color channels, followed by the nested residual network as the predictor to achieve a reliable PAD. Extensive experiments using various capture devices, including iPhone13 Pro, GooglePixel 3, Nokia C5, and OnePlusOne, were carried out to evaluate the performance of proposed and existing methods on three publicly available databases. The findings underscore the effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <title>CMMCoT: Enhancing Complex Multi-Image Comprehension via Multi-Modal Chain-of-Thought and Memory Augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While previous multimodal slow-thinking methods have demonstrated remarkable success in single-image understanding scenarios, their effectiveness becomes fundamentally constrained when extended to more complex multi-image comprehension tasks. This limitation stems from their predominant reliance on text-based intermediate reasoning processes. While for human, when engaging in sophisticated multi-image analysis, they typically perform two complementary cognitive operations: (1) continuous cross-image visual comparison through region-of-interest matching, and (2) dynamic memorization of critical visual concepts throughout the reasoning chain. Motivated by these observations, we propose the Complex Multi-Modal Chain-of-Thought (CMMCoT) framework, a multi-step reasoning framework that mimics human-like "slow thinking" for multi-image understanding. Our approach incorporates two key innovations: 1. The construction of interleaved multimodal multi-step reasoning chains, which utilize critical visual region tokens, extracted from intermediate reasoning steps, as supervisory signals. This mechanism not only facilitates comprehensive cross-modal understanding but also enhances model interpretability. 2. The introduction of a test-time memory augmentation module that expands the model reasoning capacity during inference while preserving parameter efficiency. Furthermore, to facilitate research in this direction, we have curated a novel multi-image slow-thinking dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our model.</description>

      <title>Escaping Plato's Cave: Towards the Alignment of 3D and Text Latent Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent works have shown that, when trained at scale, uni-modal 2D vision and text encoders converge to learned features that share remarkable structural properties, despite arising from different representations. However, the role of 3D encoders with respect to other modalities remains unexplored. Furthermore, existing 3D foundation models that leverage large datasets are typically trained with explicit alignment objectives with respect to frozen encoders from other representations. In this work, we investigate the possibility of a posteriori alignment of representations obtained from uni-modal 3D encoders compared to text-based feature spaces. We show that naive post-training feature alignment of uni-modal text and 3D encoders results in limited performance. We then focus on extracting subspaces of the corresponding feature spaces and discover that by projecting learned representations onto well-chosen lower-dimensional subspaces the quality of alignment becomes significantly higher, leading to improved accuracy on matching and retrieval tasks. Our analysis further sheds light on the nature of these shared subspaces, which roughly separate between semantic and geometric data representations. Overall, ours is the first work that helps to establish a baseline for post-training alignment of 3D uni-modal and text feature spaces, and helps to highlight both the shared and unique properties of 3D data compared to other representations.</description>

      <title>Frequency Autoregressive Image Generation with Continuous Tokens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models for image generation typically adopt a two-stage paradigm of vector quantization and raster-scan ``next-token prediction", inspired by its great success in language modeling. However, due to the huge modality gap, image autoregressive models may require a systematic reevaluation from two perspectives: tokenizer format and regression direction. In this paper, we introduce the frequency progressive autoregressive (\textbf{FAR}) paradigm and instantiate FAR with the continuous tokenizer. Specifically, we identify spectral dependency as the desirable regression direction for FAR, wherein higher-frequency components build upon the lower one to progressively construct a complete image. This design seamlessly fits the causality requirement for autoregressive models and preserves the unique spatial locality of image data. Besides, we delve into the integration of FAR and the continuous tokenizer, introducing a series of techniques to address optimization challenges and improve the efficiency of training and inference processes. We demonstrate the efficacy of FAR through comprehensive experiments on the ImageNet dataset and verify its potential on text-to-image generation.</description>

      <title>Robust Multimodal Learning for Ophthalmic Disease Grading via Disentangled Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper discusses how ophthalmologists often rely on multimodal data to improve diagnostic accuracy. However, complete multimodal data is rare in real-world applications due to a lack of medical equipment and concerns about data privacy. Traditional deep learning methods typically address these issues by learning representations in latent space. However, the paper highlights two key limitations of these approaches: (i) Task-irrelevant redundant information (e.g., numerous slices) in complex modalities leads to significant redundancy in latent space representations. (ii) Overlapping multimodal representations make it difficult to extract unique features for each modality. To overcome these challenges, the authors propose the Essence-Point and Disentangle Representation Learning (EDRL) strategy, which integrates a self-distillation mechanism into an end-to-end framework to enhance feature selection and disentanglement for more robust multimodal learning. Specifically, the Essence-Point Representation Learning module selects discriminative features that improve disease grading performance. The Disentangled Representation Learning module separates multimodal data into modality-common and modality-unique representations, reducing feature entanglement and enhancing both robustness and interpretability in ophthalmic disease diagnosis. Experiments on multimodal ophthalmology datasets show that the proposed EDRL strategy significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Attenuation artifact detection and severity classification in intracoronary OCT using mixed image representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In intracoronary optical coherence tomography (OCT), blood residues and gas bubbles cause attenuation artifacts that can obscure critical vessel structures. The presence and severity of these artifacts may warrant re-acquisition, prolonging procedure time and increasing use of contrast agent. Accurate detection of these artifacts can guide targeted re-acquisition, reducing the amount of repeated scans needed to achieve diagnostically viable images. However, the highly heterogeneous appearance of these artifacts poses a challenge for the automated detection of the affected image regions. To enable automatic detection of the attenuation artifacts caused by blood residues and gas bubbles based on their severity, we propose a convolutional neural network that performs classification of the attenuation lines (A-lines) into three classes: no artifact, mild artifact and severe artifact. Our model extracts and merges features from OCT images in both Cartesian and polar coordinates, where each column of the image represents an A-line. Our method detects the presence of attenuation artifacts in OCT frames reaching F-scores of 0.77 and 0.94 for mild and severe artifacts, respectively. The inference time over a full OCT scan is approximately 6 seconds. Our experiments show that analysis of images represented in both Cartesian and polar coordinate systems outperforms the analysis in polar coordinates only, suggesting that these representations contain complementary features. This work lays the foundation for automated artifact assessment and image acquisition guidance in intracoronary OCT imaging.</description>

      <title>CoMoGaussian: Continuous Motion-Aware Gaussian Splatting from Motion-Blurred Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has gained significant attention for their high-quality novel view rendering, motivating research to address real-world challenges. A critical issue is the camera motion blur caused by movement during exposure, which hinders accurate 3D scene reconstruction. In this study, we propose CoMoGaussian, a Continuous Motion-Aware Gaussian Splatting that reconstructs precise 3D scenes from motion-blurred images while maintaining real-time rendering speed. Considering the complex motion patterns inherent in real-world camera movements, we predict continuous camera trajectories using neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs). To ensure accurate modeling, we employ rigid body transformations, preserving the shape and size of the object but rely on the discrete integration of sampled frames. To better approximate the continuous nature of motion blur, we introduce a continuous motion refinement (CMR) transformation that refines rigid transformations by incorporating additional learnable parameters. By revisiting fundamental camera theory and leveraging advanced neural ODE techniques, we achieve precise modeling of continuous camera trajectories, leading to improved reconstruction accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance both quantitatively and qualitatively on benchmark datasets, which include a wide range of motion blur scenarios, from moderate to extreme blur.</description>

      <title>PhysicsGen: Can Generative Models Learn from Images to Predict Complex Physical Relations?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The image-to-image translation abilities of generative learning models have recently made significant progress in the estimation of complex (steered) mappings between image distributions. While appearance based tasks like image in-painting or style transfer have been studied at length, we propose to investigate the potential of generative models in the context of physical simulations. Providing a dataset of 300k image-pairs and baseline evaluations for three different physical simulation tasks, we propose a benchmark to investigate the following research questions: i) are generative models able to learn complex physical relations from input-output image pairs? ii) what speedups can be achieved by replacing differential equation based simulations? While baseline evaluations of different current models show the potential for high speedups (ii), these results also show strong limitations toward the physical correctness (i). This underlines the need for new methods to enforce physical correctness. Data, baseline models and evaluation code http://www.physics-gen.org.</description>

Abstract: The deformable registration of images of different modalities, essential in many medical imaging applications, remains challenging. The main challenge is developing a robust measure for image overlap despite the compared images capturing different aspects of the underlying tissue. Here, we explore similarity metrics based on functional dependence between intensity values of registered images. Although functional dependence is too restrictive on the global scale, earlier work has shown competitive performance in deformable registration when such measures are applied over small enough contexts. We confirm this finding and further develop the idea by modeling local functional dependence via the linear basis function model with the basis functions learned jointly with the deformation. The measure can be implemented via convolutions, making it efficient to compute on GPUs. We release the method as an easy-to-use tool and show good performance on three datasets compared to well-established baseline and earlier functional dependence-based methods.</description>

      <title>Multi-Grained Feature Pruning for Video-Based Human Pose Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human pose estimation, with its broad applications in action recognition and motion capture, has experienced significant advancements. However, current Transformer-based methods for video pose estimation often face challenges in managing redundant temporal information and achieving fine-grained perception because they only focus on processing low-resolution features. To address these challenges, we propose a novel multi-scale resolution framework that encodes spatio-temporal representations at varying granularities and executes fine-grained perception compensation. Furthermore, we employ a density peaks clustering method to dynamically identify and prioritize tokens that offer important semantic information. This strategy effectively prunes redundant feature tokens, especially those arising from multi-frame features, thereby optimizing computational efficiency without sacrificing semantic richness. Empirically, it sets new benchmarks for both performance and efficiency on three large-scale datasets. Our method achieves a 93.8% improvement in inference speed compared to the baseline, while also enhancing pose estimation accuracy, reaching 87.4 mAP on the PoseTrack2017 dataset.</description>

      <title>Semantic Shift Estimation via Dual-Projection and Classifier Reconstruction for Exemplar-Free Class-Incremental Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exemplar-Free Class-Incremental Learning (EFCIL) aims to sequentially learn from distinct categories without retaining exemplars but easily suffers from catastrophic forgetting of learned knowledge. While existing EFCIL methods leverage knowledge distillation to alleviate forgetting, they still face two critical challenges: semantic shift and decision bias. Specifically, the embeddings of old tasks shift in the embedding space after learning new tasks, and the classifier becomes biased towards new tasks due to training solely with new data, thereby hindering the balance between old and new knowledge. To address these issues, we propose the Dual-Projection Shift Estimation and Classifier Reconstruction (DPCR) approach for EFCIL. DPCR effectively estimates semantic shift through a dual-projection, which combines a learnable transformation with a row-space projection to capture both task-wise and category-wise shifts. Furthermore, to mitigate decision bias, DPCR employs ridge regression to reformulate classifier training as a reconstruction process. This reconstruction exploits previous information encoded in covariance and prototype of each class after calibration with estimated shift, thereby reducing decision bias. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, across various datasets, DPCR effectively balances old and new tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art EFCIL methods.</description>

      <title>Automatic Teaching Platform on Vision Language Retrieval Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automating teaching presents unique challenges, as replicating human interaction and adaptability is complex. Automated systems cannot often provide nuanced, real-time feedback that aligns with students' individual learning paces or comprehension levels, which can hinder effective support for diverse needs. This is especially challenging in fields where abstract concepts require adaptive explanations. In this paper, we propose a vision language retrieval augmented generation (named VL-RAG) system that has the potential to bridge this gap by delivering contextually relevant, visually enriched responses that can enhance comprehension. By leveraging a database of tailored answers and images, the VL-RAG system can dynamically retrieve information aligned with specific questions, creating a more interactive and engaging experience that fosters deeper understanding and active student participation. It allows students to explore concepts visually and verbally, promoting deeper understanding and reducing the need for constant human oversight while maintaining flexibility to expand across different subjects and course material.</description>

      <title>FastMap: Fast Queries Initialization Based Vectorized HD Map Reconstruction Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconstruction of high-definition maps is a crucial task in perceiving the autonomous driving environment, as its accuracy directly impacts the reliability of prediction and planning capabilities in downstream modules. Current vectorized map reconstruction methods based on the DETR framework encounter limitations due to the redundancy in the decoder structure, necessitating the stacking of six decoder layers to maintain performance, which significantly hampers computational efficiency. To tackle this issue, we introduce FastMap, an innovative framework designed to reduce decoder redundancy in existing approaches. FastMap optimizes the decoder architecture by employing a single-layer, two-stage transformer that achieves multilevel representation capabilities. Our framework eliminates the conventional practice of randomly initializing queries and instead incorporates a heatmap-guided query generation module during the decoding phase, which effectively maps image features into structured query vectors using learnable positional encoding. Additionally, we propose a geometry-constrained point-to-line loss mechanism for FastMap, which adeptly addresses the challenge of distinguishing highly homogeneous features that often arise in traditional point-to-point loss computations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FastMap achieves state-of-the-art performance in both nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets, with its decoder operating 3.2 faster than the baseline. Code and more demos are available at https://github.com/hht1996ok/FastMap.</description>

      <title>Removing Geometric Bias in One-Class Anomaly Detection with Adaptive Feature Perturbation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One-class anomaly detection aims to detect objects that do not belong to a predefined normal class. In practice training data lack those anomalous samples; hence state-of-the-art methods are trained to discriminate between normal and synthetically-generated pseudo-anomalous data. Most methods use data augmentation techniques on normal images to simulate anomalies. However the best-performing ones implicitly leverage a geometric bias present in the benchmarking datasets. This limits their usability in more general conditions. Others are relying on basic noising schemes that may be suboptimal in capturing the underlying structure of normal data. In addition most still favour the image domain to generate pseudo-anomalies training models end-to-end from only the normal class and overlooking richer representations of the information. To overcome these limitations we consider frozen yet rich feature spaces given by pretrained models and create pseudo-anomalous features with a novel adaptive linear feature perturbation technique. It adapts the noise distribution to each sample applies decaying linear perturbations to feature vectors and further guides the classification process using a contrastive learning objective. Experimental evaluation conducted on both standard and geometric bias-free datasets demonstrates the superiority of our approach with respect to comparable baselines. The codebase is accessible via our public repository.</description>

      <title>Post-Hoc Concept Disentanglement: From Correlated to Isolated Concept Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs) are widely used to model human-understandable concepts as directions within the latent space of neural networks. They are trained by identifying directions from the activations of concept samples to those of non-concept samples. However, this method often produces similar, non-orthogonal directions for correlated concepts, such as "beard" and "necktie" within the CelebA dataset, which frequently co-occur in images of men. This entanglement complicates the interpretation of concepts in isolation and can lead to undesired effects in CAV applications, such as activation steering. To address this issue, we introduce a post-hoc concept disentanglement method that employs a non-orthogonality loss, facilitating the identification of orthogonal concept directions while preserving directional correctness. We evaluate our approach with real-world and controlled correlated concepts in CelebA and a synthetic FunnyBirds dataset with VGG16 and ResNet18 architectures. We further demonstrate the superiority of orthogonalized concept representations in activation steering tasks, allowing (1) the insertion of isolated concepts into input images through generative models and (2) the removal of concepts for effective shortcut suppression with reduced impact on correlated concepts in comparison to baseline CAVs.</description>

      <title>S4M: Segment Anything with 4 Extreme Points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Segment Anything Model (SAM) has revolutionized open-set interactive image segmentation, inspiring numerous adapters for the medical domain. However, SAM primarily relies on sparse prompts such as point or bounding box, which may be suboptimal for fine-grained instance segmentation, particularly in endoscopic imagery, where precise localization is critical and existing prompts struggle to capture object boundaries effectively. To address this, we introduce S4M (Segment Anything with 4 Extreme Points), which augments SAM by leveraging extreme points -- the top-, bottom-, left-, and right-most points of an instance -- prompts. These points are intuitive to identify and provide a faster, structured alternative to box prompts. However, a na\"ive use of extreme points degrades performance, due to SAM's inability to interpret their semantic roles. To resolve this, we introduce dedicated learnable embeddings, enabling the model to distinguish extreme points from generic free-form points and better reason about their spatial relationships. We further propose an auxiliary training task through the Canvas module, which operates solely on prompts -- without vision input -- to predict a coarse instance mask. This encourages the model to internalize the relationship between extreme points and mask distributions, leading to more robust segmentation. S4M outperforms other SAM-based approaches on three endoscopic surgical datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in complex scenarios. Finally, we validate our approach through a human annotation study on surgical endoscopic videos, confirming that extreme points are faster to acquire than bounding boxes.</description>

      <title>Disconnect to Connect: A Data Augmentation Method for Improving Topology Accuracy in Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate segmentation of thin, tubular structures (e.g., blood vessels) is challenging for deep neural networks. These networks classify individual pixels, and even minor misclassifications can break the thin connections within these structures. Existing methods for improving topology accuracy, such as topology loss functions, rely on very precise, topologically-accurate training labels, which are difficult to obtain. This is because annotating images, especially 3D images, is extremely laborious and time-consuming. Low image resolution and contrast further complicates the annotation by causing tubular structures to appear disconnected. We present CoLeTra, a data augmentation strategy that integrates to the models the prior knowledge that structures that appear broken are actually connected. This is achieved by creating images with the appearance of disconnected structures while maintaining the original labels. Our extensive experiments, involving different architectures, loss functions, and datasets, demonstrate that CoLeTra leads to segmentations topologically more accurate while often improving the Dice coefficient and Hausdorff distance. CoLeTra's hyper-parameters are intuitive to tune, and our sensitivity analysis shows that CoLeTra is robust to changes in these hyper-parameters. We also release a dataset specifically suited for image segmentation methods with a focus on topology accuracy. CoLetra's code can be found at https://github.com/jmlipman/CoLeTra.</description>

      <title>Pi-GPS: Enhancing Geometry Problem Solving by Unleashing the Power of Diagrammatic Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geometry problem solving has garnered increasing attention due to its potential applications in intelligent education field. Inspired by the observation that text often introduces ambiguities that diagrams can clarify, this paper presents Pi-GPS, a novel framework that unleashes the power of diagrammatic information to resolve textual ambiguities, an aspect largely overlooked in prior research. Specifically, we design a micro module comprising a rectifier and verifier: the rectifier employs MLLMs to disambiguate text based on the diagrammatic context, while the verifier ensures the rectified output adherence to geometric rules, mitigating model hallucinations. Additionally, we explore the impact of LLMs in theorem predictor based on the disambiguated formal language. Empirical results demonstrate that Pi-GPS surpasses state-of-the-art models, achieving a nearly 10\% improvement on Geometry3K over prior neural-symbolic approaches. We hope this work highlights the significance of resolving textual ambiguity in multimodal mathematical reasoning, a crucial factor limiting performance.</description>

      <title>Stereo Any Video: Temporally Consistent Stereo Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces Stereo Any Video, a powerful framework for video stereo matching. It can estimate spatially accurate and temporally consistent disparities without relying on auxiliary information such as camera poses or optical flow. The strong capability is driven by rich priors from monocular video depth models, which are integrated with convolutional features to produce stable representations. To further enhance performance, key architectural innovations are introduced: all-to-all-pairs correlation, which constructs smooth and robust matching cost volumes, and temporal convex upsampling, which improves temporal coherence. These components collectively ensure robustness, accuracy, and temporal consistency, setting a new standard in video stereo matching. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple datasets both qualitatively and quantitatively in zero-shot settings, as well as strong generalization to real-world indoor and outdoor scenarios.</description>

      <title>TomatoScanner: phenotyping tomato fruit based on only RGB image</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In tomato greenhouse, phenotypic measurement is meaningful for researchers and farmers to monitor crop growth, thereby precisely control environmental conditions in time, leading to better quality and higher yield. Traditional phenotyping mainly relies on manual measurement, which is accurate but inefficient, more importantly, endangering the health and safety of people. Several studies have explored computer vision-based methods to replace manual phenotyping. However, the 2D-based need extra calibration, or cause destruction to fruit, or can only measure limited and meaningless traits. The 3D-based need extra depth camera, which is expensive and unacceptable for most farmers. In this paper, we propose a non-contact tomato fruit phenotyping method, titled TomatoScanner, where RGB image is all you need for input. First, pixel feature is extracted by instance segmentation of our proposed EdgeYOLO with preprocessing of individual separation and pose correction. Second, depth feature is extracted by depth estimation of Depth Pro. Third, pixel and depth feature are fused to output phenotype results in reality. We establish self-built Tomato Phenotype Dataset to test TomatoScanner, which achieves excellent phenotyping on width, height, vertical area and volume, with median relative error of 5.63%, 7.03%, -0.64% and 37.06%, respectively. We propose and add three innovative modules - EdgeAttention, EdgeLoss and EdgeBoost - into EdgeYOLO, to enhance the segmentation accuracy on edge portion. Precision and mean Edge Error greatly improve from 0.943 and 5.641% to 0.986 and 2.963%, respectively. Meanwhile, EdgeYOLO keeps lightweight and efficient, with 48.7 M weights size and 76.34 FPS.

      <title>Novel Object 6D Pose Estimation with a Single Reference View</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing novel object 6D pose estimation methods typically rely on CAD models or dense reference views, which are both difficult to acquire. Using only a single reference view is more scalable, but challenging due to large pose discrepancies and limited geometric and spatial information. To address these issues, we propose a Single-Reference-based novel object 6D (SinRef-6D) pose estimation method. Our key idea is to iteratively establish point-wise alignment in the camera coordinate system based on state space models (SSMs). Specifically, iterative camera-space point-wise alignment can effectively handle large pose discrepancies, while our proposed RGB and Points SSMs can capture long-range dependencies and spatial information from a single view, offering linear complexity and superior spatial modeling capability. Once pre-trained on synthetic data, SinRef-6D can estimate the 6D pose of a novel object using only a single reference view, without requiring retraining or a CAD model. Extensive experiments on six popular datasets and real-world robotic scenes demonstrate that we achieve on-par performance with CAD-based and dense reference view-based methods, despite operating in the more challenging single reference setting. Code will be released at https://github.com/CNJianLiu/SinRef-6D.</description>

      <title>QArtSR: Quantization via Reverse-Module and Timestep-Retraining in One-Step Diffusion based Image Super-Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One-step diffusion-based image super-resolution (OSDSR) models are showing increasingly superior performance nowadays. However, although their denoising steps are reduced to one and they can be quantized to 8-bit to reduce the costs further, there is still significant potential for OSDSR to quantize to lower bits. To explore more possibilities of quantized OSDSR, we propose an efficient method, Quantization via reverse-module and timestep-retraining for OSDSR, named QArtSR. Firstly, we investigate the influence of timestep value on the performance of quantized models. Then, we propose Timestep Retraining Quantization (TRQ) and Reversed Per-module Quantization (RPQ) strategies to calibrate the quantized model. Meanwhile, we adopt the module and image losses to update all quantized modules. We only update the parameters in quantization finetuning components, excluding the original weights. To ensure that all modules are fully finetuned, we add extended end-to-end training after per-module stage. Our 4-bit and 2-bit quantization experimental results indicate that QArtSR obtains superior effects against the recent leading comparison methods. The performance of 4-bit QArtSR is close to the full-precision one. Our code will be released at https://github.com/libozhu03/QArtSR.</description>

      <title>Anti-Diffusion: Preventing Abuse of Modifications of Diffusion-Based Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although diffusion-based techniques have shown remarkable success in image generation and editing tasks, their abuse can lead to severe negative social impacts. Recently, some works have been proposed to provide defense against the abuse of diffusion-based methods. However, their protection may be limited in specific scenarios by manually defined prompts or the stable diffusion (SD) version. Furthermore, these methods solely focus on tuning methods, overlooking editing methods that could also pose a significant threat. In this work, we propose Anti-Diffusion, a privacy protection system designed for general diffusion-based methods, applicable to both tuning and editing techniques. To mitigate the limitations of manually defined prompts on defense performance, we introduce the prompt tuning (PT) strategy that enables precise expression of original images. To provide defense against both tuning and editing methods, we propose the semantic disturbance loss (SDL) to disrupt the semantic information of protected images. Given the limited research on the defense against editing methods, we develop a dataset named Defense-Edit to assess the defense performance of various methods. Experiments demonstrate that our Anti-Diffusion achieves superior defense performance across a wide range of diffusion-based techniques in different scenarios.</description>

      <title>D2GV: Deformable 2D Gaussian Splatting for Video Representation in 400FPS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have emerged as a powerful approach for video representation, offering versatility across tasks such as compression and inpainting. However, their implicit formulation limits both interpretability and efficacy, undermining their practicality as a comprehensive solution. We propose a novel video representation based on deformable 2D Gaussian splatting, dubbed D2GV, which aims to achieve three key objectives: 1) improved efficiency while delivering superior quality; 2) enhanced scalability and interpretability; and 3) increased friendliness for downstream tasks. Specifically, we initially divide the video sequence into fixed-length Groups of Pictures (GoP) to allow parallel training and linear scalability with video length. For each GoP, D2GV represents video frames by applying differentiable rasterization to 2D Gaussians, which are deformed from a canonical space into their corresponding timestamps. Notably, leveraging efficient CUDA-based rasterization, D2GV converges fast and decodes at speeds exceeding 400 FPS, while delivering quality that matches or surpasses state-of-the-art INRs. Moreover, we incorporate a learnable pruning and quantization strategy to streamline D2GV into a more compact representation. We demonstrate D2GV's versatility in tasks including video interpolation, inpainting and denoising, underscoring its potential as a promising solution for video representation.

      <title>CACTUS: An Open Dataset and Framework for Automated Cardiac Assessment and Classification of Ultrasound Images Using Deep Transfer Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cardiac ultrasound (US) scanning is a commonly used techniques in cardiology to diagnose the health of the heart and its proper functioning. Therefore, it is necessary to consider ways to automate these tasks and assist medical professionals in classifying and assessing cardiac US images. Machine learning (ML) techniques are regarded as a prominent solution due to their success in numerous applications aimed at enhancing the medical field, including addressing the shortage of echography technicians. However, the limited availability of medical data presents a significant barrier to applying ML in cardiology, particularly regarding US images of the heart. This paper addresses this challenge by introducing the first open graded dataset for Cardiac Assessment and ClassificaTion of UltraSound (CACTUS), which is available online. This dataset contains images obtained from scanning a CAE Blue Phantom and representing various heart views and different quality levels, exceeding the conventional cardiac views typically found in the literature. Additionally, the paper introduces a Deep Learning (DL) framework consisting of two main components. The first component classifies cardiac US images based on the heart view using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The second component uses Transfer Learning (TL) to fine-tune the knowledge from the first component and create a model for grading and assessing cardiac images. The framework demonstrates high performance in both classification and grading, achieving up to 99.43% accuracy and as low as 0.3067 error, respectively. To showcase its robustness, the framework is further fine-tuned using new images representing additional cardiac views and compared to several other state-of-the-art architectures. The framework's outcomes and performance in handling real-time scans were also assessed using a questionnaire answered by cardiac experts.</description>

      <title>Conformal Prediction for Image Segmentation Using Morphological Prediction Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image segmentation is a challenging task influenced by multiple sources of uncertainty, such as the data labeling process or the sampling of training data. In this paper we focus on binary segmentation and address these challenges using conformal prediction, a family of model- and data-agnostic methods for uncertainty quantification that provide finite-sample theoretical guarantees and applicable to any pretrained predictor. Our approach involves computing nonconformity scores, a type of prediction residual, on held-out calibration data not used during training. We use dilation, one of the fundamental operations in mathematical morphology, to construct a margin added to the borders of predicted segmentation masks. At inference, the predicted set formed by the mask and its margin contains the ground-truth mask with high probability, at a confidence level specified by the user. The size of the margin serves as an indicator of predictive uncertainty for a given model and dataset. We work in a regime of minimal information as we do not require any feedback from the predictor: only the predicted masks are needed for computing the prediction sets. Hence, our method is applicable to any segmentation model, including those based on deep learning; we evaluate our approach on several medical imaging applications.</description>

      <title>FMT:A Multimodal Pneumonia Detection Model Based on Stacking MOE Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence has shown the potential to improve diagnostic accuracy through medical image analysis for pneumonia diagnosis. However, traditional multimodal approaches often fail to address real-world challenges such as incomplete data and modality loss. In this study, a Flexible Multimodal Transformer (FMT) was proposed, which uses ResNet-50 and BERT for joint representation learning, followed by a dynamic masked attention strategy that simulates clinical modality loss to improve robustness; finally, a sequential mixture of experts (MOE) architecture was used to achieve multi-level decision refinement. After evaluation on a small multimodal pneumonia dataset, FMT achieved state-of-the-art performance with 94% accuracy, 95% recall, and 93% F1 score, outperforming single-modal baselines (ResNet: 89%; BERT: 79%) and the medical benchmark CheXMed (90%), providing a scalable solution for multimodal diagnosis of pneumonia in resource-constrained medical settings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present TrajectoryCrafter, a novel approach to redirect camera trajectories for monocular videos. By disentangling deterministic view transformations from stochastic content generation, our method achieves precise control over user-specified camera trajectories. We propose a novel dual-stream conditional video diffusion model that concurrently integrates point cloud renders and source videos as conditions, ensuring accurate view transformations and coherent 4D content generation. Instead of leveraging scarce multi-view videos, we curate a hybrid training dataset combining web-scale monocular videos with static multi-view datasets, by our innovative double-reprojection strategy, significantly fostering robust generalization across diverse scenes. Extensive evaluations on multi-view and large-scale monocular videos demonstrate the superior performance of our method.</description>

      <title>VideoPainter: Any-length Video Inpainting and Editing with Plug-and-Play Context Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video inpainting, which aims to restore corrupted video content, has experienced substantial progress. Despite these advances, existing methods, whether propagating unmasked region pixels through optical flow and receptive field priors, or extending image-inpainting models temporally, face challenges in generating fully masked objects or balancing the competing objectives of background context preservation and foreground generation in one model, respectively. To address these limitations, we propose a novel dual-stream paradigm VideoPainter that incorporates an efficient context encoder (comprising only 6% of the backbone parameters) to process masked videos and inject backbone-aware background contextual cues to any pre-trained video DiT, producing semantically consistent content in a plug-and-play manner. This architectural separation significantly reduces the model's learning complexity while enabling nuanced integration of crucial background context. We also introduce a novel target region ID resampling technique that enables any-length video inpainting, greatly enhancing our practical applicability. Additionally, we establish a scalable dataset pipeline leveraging current vision understanding models, contributing VPData and VPBench to facilitate segmentation-based inpainting training and assessment, the largest video inpainting dataset and benchmark to date with over 390K diverse clips. Using inpainting as a pipeline basis, we also explore downstream applications including video editing and video editing pair data generation, demonstrating competitive performance and significant practical potential. Extensive experiments demonstrate VideoPainter's superior performance in both any-length video inpainting and editing, across eight key metrics, including video quality, mask region preservation, and textual coherence.</description>

      <title>AIM-Fair: Advancing Algorithmic Fairness via Selectively Fine-Tuning Biased Models with Contextual Synthetic Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in generative models have sparked research on improving model fairness with AI-generated data. However, existing methods often face limitations in the diversity and quality of synthetic data, leading to compromised fairness and overall model accuracy. Moreover, many approaches rely on the availability of demographic group labels, which are often costly to annotate. This paper proposes AIM-Fair, aiming to overcome these limitations and harness the potential of cutting-edge generative models in promoting algorithmic fairness. We investigate a fine-tuning paradigm starting from a biased model initially trained on real-world data without demographic annotations. This model is then fine-tuned using unbiased synthetic data generated by a state-of-the-art diffusion model to improve its fairness. Two key challenges are identified in this fine-tuning paradigm, 1) the low quality of synthetic data, which can still happen even with advanced generative models, and 2) the domain and bias gap between real and synthetic data. To address the limitation of synthetic data quality, we propose Contextual Synthetic Data Generation (CSDG) to generate data using a text-to-image diffusion model (T2I) with prompts generated by a context-aware LLM, ensuring both data diversity and control of bias in synthetic data. To resolve domain and bias shifts, we introduce a novel selective fine-tuning scheme in which only model parameters more sensitive to bias and less sensitive to domain shift are updated. Experiments on CelebA and UTKFace datasets show that our AIM-Fair improves model fairness while maintaining utility, outperforming both fully and partially fine-tuned approaches to model fairness.</description>

      <title>GoalFlow: Goal-Driven Flow Matching for Multimodal Trajectories Generation in End-to-End Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose GoalFlow, an end-to-end autonomous driving method for generating high-quality multimodal trajectories. In autonomous driving scenarios, there is rarely a single suitable trajectory. Recent methods have increasingly focused on modeling multimodal trajectory distributions. However, they suffer from trajectory selection complexity and reduced trajectory quality due to high trajectory divergence and inconsistencies between guidance and scene information. To address these issues, we introduce GoalFlow, a novel method that effectively constrains the generative process to produce high-quality, multimodal trajectories. To resolve the trajectory divergence problem inherent in diffusion-based methods, GoalFlow constrains the generated trajectories by introducing a goal point. GoalFlow establishes a novel scoring mechanism that selects the most appropriate goal point from the candidate points based on scene information. Furthermore, GoalFlow employs an efficient generative method, Flow Matching, to generate multimodal trajectories, and incorporates a refined scoring mechanism to select the optimal trajectory from the candidates. Our experimental results, validated on the Navsim\cite{Dauner2024_navsim}, demonstrate that GoalFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance, delivering robust multimodal trajectories for autonomous driving. GoalFlow achieved PDMS of 90.3, significantly surpassing other methods. Compared with other diffusion-policy-based methods, our approach requires only a single denoising step to obtain excellent performance.

Abstract: Simulation-based approaches to microstructure generation can suffer from a variety of limitations, such as high memory usage, long computational times, and difficulties in generating complex geometries. Generative machine learning models present a way around these issues, but they have previously been limited by the fixed size of their generation area. We present a new microstructure generation methodology leveraging advances in inpainting using denoising diffusion models to overcome this generation area limitation. We show that microstructures generated with the presented methodology are statistically similar to grain structures generated with a kinetic Monte Carlo simulator, SPPARKS.</description>

      <title>RTFusion: A depth estimation network based on multimodal fusion in challenging scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Depth estimation in complex real-world scenarios is a challenging task, especially when relying solely on a single modality such as visible light or thermal infrared (THR) imagery. This paper proposes a novel multimodal depth estimation model, RTFusion, which enhances depth estimation accuracy and robustness by integrating the complementary strengths of RGB and THR data. The RGB modality provides rich texture and color information, while the THR modality captures thermal patterns, ensuring stability under adverse lighting conditions such as extreme illumination. The model incorporates a unique fusion mechanism, EGFusion, consisting of the Mutual Complementary Attention (MCA) module for cross-modal feature alignment and the Edge Saliency Enhancement Module (ESEM) to improve edge detail preservation. Comprehensive experiments on the MS2 and ViViD++ datasets demonstrate that the proposed model consistently produces high-quality depth maps across various challenging environments, including nighttime, rainy, and high-glare conditions. The experimental results highlight the potential of the proposed method in applications requiring reliable depth estimation, such as autonomous driving, robotics, and augmented reality.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Few-Shot Medical Image Segmentation by SAM2: A Training-Free Framework with Augmentative Prompting and Dynamic Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The reliance on large labeled datasets presents a significant challenge in medical image segmentation. Few-shot learning offers a potential solution, but existing methods often still require substantial training data. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2), a vision foundation model with strong video segmentation capabilities. We conceptualize 3D medical image volumes as video sequences, departing from the traditional slice-by-slice paradigm. Our core innovation is a support-query matching strategy: we perform extensive data augmentation on a single labeled support image and, for each frame in the query volume, algorithmically select the most analogous augmented support image. This selected image, along with its corresponding mask, is used as a mask prompt, driving SAM2's video segmentation. This approach entirely avoids model retraining or parameter updates. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on benchmark few-shot medical image segmentation datasets, achieving significant improvements in accuracy and annotation efficiency. This plug-and-play method offers a powerful and generalizable solution for 3D medical image segmentation.</description>

      <title>PGAD: Prototype-Guided Adaptive Distillation for Multi-Modal Learning in AD Diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Missing modalities pose a major issue in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) diagnosis, as many subjects lack full imaging data due to cost and clinical constraints. While multi-modal learning leverages complementary information, most existing methods train only on complete data, ignoring the large proportion of incomplete samples in real-world datasets like ADNI. This reduces the effective training set and limits the full use of valuable medical data. While some methods incorporate incomplete samples, they fail to effectively address inter-modal feature alignment and knowledge transfer challenges under high missing rates. To address this, we propose a Prototype-Guided Adaptive Distillation (PGAD) framework that directly incorporates incomplete multi-modal data into training. PGAD enhances missing modality representations through prototype matching and balances learning with a dynamic sampling strategy. We validate PGAD on the ADNI dataset with varying missing rates (20%, 50%, and 70%) and demonstrate that it significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of prototype matching and adaptive sampling, highlighting the potential of our framework for robust and scalable AD diagnosis in real-world clinical settings.</description>

      <title>Prediction of Frozen Region Growth in Kidney Cryoablation Intervention Using a 3D Flow-Matching Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents a 3D flow-matching model designed to predict the progression of the frozen region (iceball) during kidney cryoablation. Precise intraoperative guidance is critical in cryoablation to ensure complete tumor eradication while preserving adjacent healthy tissue. However, conventional methods, typically based on physics driven or diffusion based simulations, are computationally demanding and often struggle to represent complex anatomical structures accurately. To address these limitations, our approach leverages intraoperative CT imaging to inform the model. The proposed 3D flow matching model is trained to learn a continuous deformation field that maps early-stage CT scans to future predictions. This transformation not only estimates the volumetric expansion of the iceball but also generates corresponding segmentation masks, effectively capturing spatial and morphological changes over time. Quantitative analysis highlights the model robustness, demonstrating strong agreement between predictions and ground-truth segmentations. The model achieves an Intersection over Union (IoU) score of 0.61 and a Dice coefficient of 0.75. By integrating real time CT imaging with advanced deep learning techniques, this approach has the potential to enhance intraoperative guidance in kidney cryoablation, improving procedural outcomes and advancing the field of minimally invasive surgery.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Alzheimer's Diagnosis: Leveraging Anatomical Landmarks in Graph Convolutional Neural Networks on Tetrahedral Meshes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a major neurodegenerative condition that affects millions around the world. As one of the main biomarkers in the AD diagnosis procedure, brain amyloid positivity is typically identified by positron emission tomography (PET), which is costly and invasive. Brain structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) may provide a safer and more convenient solution for the AD diagnosis. Recent advances in geometric deep learning have facilitated sMRI analysis and early diagnosis of AD. However, determining AD pathology, such as brain amyloid deposition, in preclinical stage remains challenging, as less significant morphological changes can be observed. As a result, few AD classification models are generalizable to the brain amyloid positivity classification task. Blood-based biomarkers (BBBMs), on the other hand, have recently achieved remarkable success in predicting brain amyloid positivity and identifying individuals with high risk of being brain amyloid positive. However, individuals in medium risk group still require gold standard tests such as Amyloid PET for further evaluation. Inspired by the recent success of transformer architectures, we propose a geometric deep learning model based on transformer that is both scalable and robust to variations in input volumetric mesh size. Our work introduced a novel tokenization scheme for tetrahedral meshes, incorporating anatomical landmarks generated by a pre-trained Gaussian process model. Our model achieved superior classification performance in AD classification task. In addition, we showed that the model was also generalizable to the brain amyloid positivity prediction with individuals in the medium risk class, where BM alone cannot achieve a clear classification. Our work may enrich geometric deep learning research and improve AD diagnosis accuracy without using expensive and invasive PET scans.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Patient-specific Non-Cartesian MRI Reconstruction using Implicit Neural Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The scanning time for a fully sampled MRI can be undesirably lengthy. Compressed sensing has been developed to minimize image artifacts in accelerated scans, but the required iterative reconstruction is computationally complex and difficult to generalize on new cases. Image-domain-based deep learning methods (e.g., convolutional neural networks) emerged as a faster alternative but face challenges in modeling continuous k-space, a problem amplified with non-Cartesian sampling commonly used in accelerated acquisition. In comparison, implicit neural representations can model continuous signals in the frequency domain and thus are compatible with arbitrary k-space sampling patterns. The current study develops a novel generative-adversarially trained implicit neural representations (k-GINR) for de novo undersampled non-Cartesian k-space reconstruction. k-GINR consists of two stages: 1) supervised training on an existing patient cohort; 2) self-supervised patient-specific optimization. In stage 1, the network is trained with the generative-adversarial network on diverse patients of the same anatomical region supervised by fully sampled acquisition. In stage 2, undersampled k-space data of individual patients is used to tailor the prior-embedded network for patient-specific optimization. The UCSF StarVIBE T1-weighted liver dataset was evaluated on the proposed framework. k-GINR is compared with an image-domain deep learning method, Deep Cascade CNN, and a compressed sensing method. k-GINR consistently outperformed the baselines with a larger performance advantage observed at very high accelerations (e.g., 20 times). k-GINR offers great value for direct non-Cartesian k-space reconstruction for new incoming patients across a wide range of accelerations liver anatomy.</description>

      <title>Lightweight Hypercomplex MRI Reconstruction: A Generalized Kronecker-Parameterized Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is crucial for clinical diagnostics but is hindered by prolonged scan times. Current deep learning models enhance MRI reconstruction but are often memory-intensive and unsuitable for resource-limited systems. This paper introduces a lightweight MRI reconstruction model leveraging Kronecker-Parameterized Hypercomplex Neural Networks to achieve high performance with reduced parameters. By integrating Kronecker-based modules, including Kronecker MLP, Kronecker Window Attention, and Kronecker Convolution, the proposed model efficiently extracts spatial features while preserving representational power. We introduce Kronecker U-Net and Kronecker SwinMR, which maintain high reconstruction quality with approximately 50% fewer parameters compared to existing models. Experimental evaluation on the FastMRI dataset demonstrates competitive PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS metrics, even at high acceleration factors (8x and 16x), with no significant performance drop. Additionally, Kronecker variants exhibit superior generalization and reduced overfitting on limited datasets, facilitating efficient MRI reconstruction on hardware-constrained systems. This approach sets a new benchmark for parameter-efficient medical imaging models.</description>

      <title>We Care Each Pixel: Calibrating on Medical Segmentation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Medical image segmentation is fundamental for computer-aided diagnostics, providing accurate delineation of anatomical structures and pathological regions. While common metrics such as Accuracy, DSC, IoU, and HD primarily quantify spatial agreement between predictions and ground-truth labels, they do not assess the calibration quality of segmentation models, which is crucial for clinical reliability. To address this limitation, we propose pixel-wise Expected Calibration Error (pECE), a novel metric that explicitly measures miscalibration at the pixel level, thereby ensuring both spatial precision and confidence reliability. We further introduce a morphological adaptation strategy that applies morphological operations to ground-truth masks before computing calibration losses, particularly benefiting margin-based losses such as Margin SVLS and NACL. Additionally, we present the Signed Distance Calibration Loss (SDC), which aligns boundary geometry with calibration objectives by penalizing discrepancies between predicted and ground-truth signed distance functions (SDFs). Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method not only enhances segmentation performance but also improves calibration quality, yielding more trustworthy confidence estimates.

      <title>R1-Zero's "Aha Moment" in Visual Reasoning on a 2B Non-SFT Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently DeepSeek R1 demonstrated how reinforcement learning with simple rule-based incentives can enable autonomous development of complex reasoning in large language models, characterized by the "aha moment", in which the model manifest self-reflection and increased response length during training. However, attempts to extend this success to multimodal reasoning often failed to reproduce these key characteristics. In this report, we present the first successful replication of these emergent characteristics for multimodal reasoning on only a non-SFT 2B model. Starting with Qwen2-VL-2B and applying reinforcement learning directly on the SAT dataset, our model achieves 59.47% accuracy on CVBench, outperforming the base model by approximately ~30% and exceeding both SFT setting by ~2%. In addition, we share our failed attempts and insights in attempting to achieve R1-like reasoning using RL with instruct models. aiming to shed light on the challenges involved. Our key observations include: (1) applying RL on instruct model often results in trivial reasoning trajectories, and (2) naive length reward are ineffective in eliciting reasoning capabilities.

      <title>STGA: Selective-Training Gaussian Head Avatars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose selective-training Gaussian head avatars (STGA) to enhance the details of dynamic head Gaussian. The dynamic head Gaussian model is trained based on the FLAME parameterized model. Each Gaussian splat is embedded within the FLAME mesh to achieve mesh-based animation of the Gaussian model. Before training, our selection strategy calculates the 3D Gaussian splat to be optimized in each frame. The parameters of these 3D Gaussian splats are optimized in the training of each frame, while those of the other splats are frozen. This means that the splats participating in the optimization process differ in each frame, to improve the realism of fine details. Compared with network-based methods, our method achieves better results with shorter training time. Compared with mesh-based methods, our method produces more realistic details within the same training time. Additionally, the ablation experiment confirms that our method effectively enhances the quality of details.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Random Fields as an Abstract Representation of Patient Metadata for Multimodal Medical Image Segmentation</title>

Abstract: The growing rate of chronic wound occurrence, especially in patients with diabetes, has become a concerning trend in recent years. Chronic wounds are difficult and costly to treat, and have become a serious burden on health care systems worldwide. Chronic wounds can have devastating consequences for the patient, with infection often leading to reduced quality of life and increased mortality risk. Innovative deep learning methods for the detection and monitoring of such wounds have the potential to reduce the impact to both patient and clinician. We present a novel multimodal segmentation method which allows for the introduction of patient metadata into the training workflow whereby the patient data are expressed as Gaussian random fields. Our results indicate that the proposed method improved performance when utilising multiple models, each trained on different metadata categories. Using the Diabetic Foot Ulcer Challenge 2022 test set, when compared to the baseline results (intersection over union = 0.4670, Dice similarity coefficient = 0.5908) we demonstrate improvements of +0.0220 and +0.0229 for intersection over union and Dice similarity coefficient respectively. This paper presents the first study to focus on integrating patient data into a chronic wound segmentation workflow. Our results show significant performance gains when training individual models using specific metadata categories, followed by average merging of prediction masks using distance transforms.

      <title>DiVISe: Direct Visual-Input Speech Synthesis Preserving Speaker Characteristics And Intelligibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Video-to-speech (V2S) synthesis, the task of generating speech directly from silent video input, is inherently more challenging than other speech synthesis tasks due to the need to accurately reconstruct both speech content and speaker characteristics from visual cues alone. Recently, audio-visual pre-training has eliminated the need for additional acoustic hints in V2S, which previous methods often relied on to ensure training convergence. However, even with pre-training, existing methods continue to face challenges in achieving a balance between acoustic intelligibility and the preservation of speaker-specific characteristics. We analyzed this limitation and were motivated to introduce DiVISe (Direct Visual-Input Speech Synthesis), an end-to-end V2S model that predicts Mel-spectrograms directly from video frames alone. Despite not taking any acoustic hints, DiVISe effectively preserves speaker characteristics in the generated audio, and achieves superior performance on both objective and subjective metrics across the LRS2 and LRS3 datasets. Our results demonstrate that DiVISe not only outperforms existing V2S models in acoustic intelligibility but also scales more effectively with increased data and model parameters. Code and weights can be found at https://github.com/PussyCat0700/DiVISe.</description>

      <title>L-FUSION: Laplacian Fetal Ultrasound Segmentation &amp; Uncertainty Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate analysis of prenatal ultrasound (US) is essential for early detection of developmental anomalies. However, operator dependency and technical limitations (e.g. intrinsic artefacts and effects, setting errors) can complicate image interpretation and the assessment of diagnostic uncertainty. We present L-FUSION (Laplacian Fetal US Segmentation with Integrated FoundatiON models), a framework that integrates uncertainty quantification through unsupervised, normative learning and large-scale foundation models for robust segmentation of fetal structures in normal and pathological scans. We propose to utilise the aleatoric logit distributions of Stochastic Segmentation Networks and Laplace approximations with fast Hessian estimations to estimate epistemic uncertainty only from the segmentation head. This enables us to achieve reliable abnormality quantification for instant diagnostic feedback. Combined with an integrated Dropout component, L-FUSION enables reliable differentiation of lesions from normal fetal anatomy with enhanced uncertainty maps and segmentation counterfactuals in US imaging. It improves epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty interpretation and removes the need for manual disease-labelling. Evaluations across multiple datasets show that L-FUSION achieves superior segmentation accuracy and consistent uncertainty quantification, supporting on-site decision-making and offering a scalable solution for advancing fetal ultrasound analysis in clinical settings.</description>

      <title>Pretext Task Adversarial Learning for Unpaired Low-field to Ultra High-field MRI Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given the scarcity and cost of high-field MRI, the synthesis of high-field MRI from low-field MRI holds significant potential when there is limited data for training downstream tasks (e.g. segmentation). Low-field MRI often suffers from a reduced signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and spatial resolution compared to high-field MRI. However, synthesizing high-field MRI data presents challenges. These involve aligning image features across domains while preserving anatomical accuracy and enhancing fine details. To address these challenges, we propose a Pretext Task Adversarial (PTA) learning framework for high-field MRI synthesis from low-field MRI data. The framework comprises three processes: (1) The slice-wise gap perception (SGP) network aligns the slice inconsistencies of low-field and high-field datasets based on contrastive learning. (2) The local structure correction (LSC) network extracts local structures by restoring the locally rotated and masked images. (3) The pretext task-guided adversarial training process introduces additional supervision and incorporates a discriminator to improve image realism. Extensive experiments on low-field to ultra high-field task demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving state-of-the-art performance (16.892 in FID, 1.933 in IS, and 0.324 in MS-SSIM). This enables the generation of high-quality high-field-like MRI data from low-field MRI data to augment training datasets for downstream tasks. The code is available at: https://github.com/Zhenxuan-Zhang/PTA4Unpaired_HF_MRI_SYN.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we present the first application of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) to an Omni-multimodal large language model in the context of emotion recognition, a task where both visual and audio modalities play crucial roles. We leverage RLVR to optimize the Omni model, significantly enhancing its performance in three key aspects: reasoning capability, emotion recognition accuracy, and generalization ability. The introduction of RLVR not only improves the model's overall performance on in-distribution data but also demonstrates superior robustness when evaluated on out-of-distribution datasets. More importantly, the improved reasoning capability enables clear analysis of the contributions of different modalities, particularly visual and audio information, in the emotion recognition process. This provides valuable insights into the optimization of multimodal large language models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-modeling enables robots to build task-agnostic models of their morphology and kinematics based on data that can be automatically collected, with minimal human intervention and prior information, thereby enhancing machine intelligence. Recent research has highlighted the potential of data-driven technology in modeling the morphology and kinematics of robots. However, existing self-modeling methods suffer from either low modeling quality or excessive data acquisition costs. Beyond morphology and kinematics, texture is also a crucial component of robots, which is challenging to model and remains unexplored. In this work, a high-quality, texture-aware, and link-level method is proposed for robot self-modeling. We utilize three-dimensional (3D) Gaussians to represent the static morphology and texture of robots, and cluster the 3D Gaussians to construct neural ellipsoid bones, whose deformations are controlled by the transformation matrices generated by a kinematic neural network. The 3D Gaussians and kinematic neural network are trained using data pairs composed of joint angles, camera parameters and multi-view images without depth information. By feeding the kinematic neural network with joint angles, we can utilize the well-trained model to describe the corresponding morphology, kinematics and texture of robots at the link level, and render robot images from different perspectives with the aid of 3D Gaussian splatting. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the established model can be exploited to perform downstream tasks such as motion planning and inverse kinematics.</description>

      <title>Towards Locally Explaining Prediction Behavior via Gradual Interventions and Measuring Property Gradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning models achieve high predictive performance but lack intrinsic interpretability, hindering our understanding of the learned prediction behavior. Existing local explainability methods focus on associations, neglecting the causal drivers of model predictions. Other approaches adopt a causal perspective but primarily provide more general global explanations. However, for specific inputs, it's unclear whether globally identified factors apply locally. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel framework for local interventional explanations by leveraging recent advances in image-to-image editing models. Our approach performs gradual interventions on semantic properties to quantify the corresponding impact on a model's predictions using a novel score, the expected property gradient magnitude. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through an extensive empirical evaluation on a wide range of architectures and tasks. First, we validate it in a synthetic scenario and demonstrate its ability to locally identify biases. Afterward, we apply our approach to analyze network training dynamics, investigate medical skin lesion classifiers, and study a pre-trained CLIP model with real-life interventional data. Our results highlight the potential of interventional explanations on the property level to reveal new insights into the behavior of deep models.</description>

      <title>DecoupledGaussian: Object-Scene Decoupling for Physics-Based Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present DecoupledGaussian, a novel system that decouples static objects from their contacted surfaces captured in-the-wild videos, a key prerequisite for realistic Newtonian-based physical simulations. Unlike prior methods focused on synthetic data or elastic jittering along the contact surface, which prevent objects from fully detaching or moving independently, DecoupledGaussian allows for significant positional changes without being constrained by the initial contacted surface. Recognizing the limitations of current 2D inpainting tools for restoring 3D locations, our approach proposes joint Poisson fields to repair and expand the Gaussians of both objects and contacted scenes after separation. This is complemented by a multi-carve strategy to refine the object's geometry. Our system enables realistic simulations of decoupling motions, collisions, and fractures driven by user-specified impulses, supporting complex interactions within and across multiple scenes. We validate DecoupledGaussian through a comprehensive user study and quantitative benchmarks. This system enhances digital interaction with objects and scenes in real-world environments, benefiting industries such as VR, robotics, and autonomous driving.

Abstract: Efficient and accurate whole-brain lesion segmentation remains a challenge in medical image analysis. In this work, we revisit MeshNet, a parameter-efficient segmentation model, and introduce a novel multi-scale dilation pattern with an encoder-decoder structure. This innovation enables capturing broad contextual information and fine-grained details without traditional downsampling, upsampling, or skip-connections. Unlike previous approaches processing subvolumes or slices, we operate directly on whole-brain $256^3$ MRI volumes. Evaluations on the Aphasia Recovery Cohort (ARC) dataset demonstrate that MeshNet achieves superior or comparable DICE scores to state-of-the-art architectures such as MedNeXt and U-MAMBA at 1/1000th of parameters. Our results validate MeshNet's strong balance of efficiency and performance, making it particularly suitable for resource-limited environments such as web-based applications and opening new possibilities for the widespread deployment of advanced medical image analysis tools.</description>

      <title>Joint 3D Point Cloud Segmentation using Real-Sim Loop: From Panels to Trees and Branches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern orchards are planted in structured rows with distinct panel divisions to improve management. Accurate and efficient joint segmentation of point cloud from Panel to Tree and Branch (P2TB) is essential for robotic operations. However, most current segmentation methods focus on single instance segmentation and depend on a sequence of deep networks to perform joint tasks. This strategy hinders the use of hierarchical information embedded in the data, leading to both error accumulation and increased costs for annotation and computation, which limits its scalability for real-world applications. In this study, we proposed a novel approach that incorporated a Real2Sim L-TreeGen for training data generation and a joint model (J-P2TB) designed for the P2TB task. The J-P2TB model, trained on the generated simulation dataset, was used for joint segmentation of real-world panel point clouds via zero-shot learning. Compared to representative methods, our model outperformed them in most segmentation metrics while using 40% fewer learnable parameters. This Sim2Real result highlighted the efficacy of L-TreeGen in model training and the performance of J-P2TB for joint segmentation, demonstrating its strong accuracy, efficiency, and generalizability for real-world applications. These improvements would not only greatly benefit the development of robots for automated orchard operations but also advance digital twin technology.</description>

      <title>BEHAVIOR Robot Suite: Streamlining Real-World Whole-Body Manipulation for Everyday Household Activities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real-world household tasks present significant challenges for mobile manipulation robots. An analysis of existing robotics benchmarks reveals that successful task performance hinges on three key whole-body control capabilities: bimanual coordination, stable and precise navigation, and extensive end-effector reachability. Achieving these capabilities requires careful hardware design, but the resulting system complexity further complicates visuomotor policy learning. To address these challenges, we introduce the BEHAVIOR Robot Suite (BRS), a comprehensive framework for whole-body manipulation in diverse household tasks. Built on a bimanual, wheeled robot with a 4-DoF torso, BRS integrates a cost-effective whole-body teleoperation interface for data collection and a novel algorithm for learning whole-body visuomotor policies. We evaluate BRS on five challenging household tasks that not only emphasize the three core capabilities but also introduce additional complexities, such as long-range navigation, interaction with articulated and deformable objects, and manipulation in confined spaces. We believe that BRS's integrated robotic embodiment, data collection interface, and learning framework mark a significant step toward enabling real-world whole-body manipulation for everyday household tasks. BRS is open-sourced at https://behavior-robot-suite.github.io/</description>

      <title>NoT: Federated Unlearning via Weight Negation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated unlearning (FU) aims to remove a participant's data contributions from a trained federated learning (FL) model, ensuring privacy and regulatory compliance. Traditional FU methods often depend on auxiliary storage on either the client or server side or require direct access to the data targeted for removal-a dependency that may not be feasible if the data is no longer available. To overcome these limitations, we propose NoT, a novel and efficient FU algorithm based on weight negation (multiplying by -1), which circumvents the need for additional storage and access to the target data. We argue that effective and efficient unlearning can be achieved by perturbing model parameters away from the set of optimal parameters, yet being well-positioned for quick re-optimization. This technique, though seemingly contradictory, is theoretically grounded: we prove that the weight negation perturbation effectively disrupts inter-layer co-adaptation, inducing unlearning while preserving an approximate optimality property, thereby enabling rapid recovery. Experimental results across three datasets and three model architectures demonstrate that NoT significantly outperforms existing baselines in unlearning efficacy as well as in communication and computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Towards Effective and Efficient Context-aware Nucleus Detection in Histopathology Whole Slide Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nucleus detection in histopathology whole slide images (WSIs) is crucial for a broad spectrum of clinical applications. Current approaches for nucleus detection in gigapixel WSIs utilize a sliding window methodology, which overlooks boarder contextual information (eg, tissue structure) and easily leads to inaccurate predictions. To address this problem, recent studies additionally crops a large Filed-of-View (FoV) region around each sliding window to extract contextual features. However, such methods substantially increases the inference latency. In this paper, we propose an effective and efficient context-aware nucleus detection algorithm. Specifically, instead of leveraging large FoV regions, we aggregate contextual clues from off-the-shelf features of historically visited sliding windows. This design greatly reduces computational overhead. Moreover, compared to large FoV regions at a low magnification, the sliding window patches have higher magnification and provide finer-grained tissue details, thereby enhancing the detection accuracy. To further improve the efficiency, we propose a grid pooling technique to compress dense feature maps of each patch into a few contextual tokens. Finally, we craft OCELOT-seg, the first benchmark dedicated to context-aware nucleus instance segmentation. Code, dataset, and model checkpoints will be available at https://github.com/windygoo/PathContext.</description>

      <title>Task-oriented Uncertainty Collaborative Learning for Label-Efficient Brain Tumor Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-contrast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) plays a vital role in brain tumor segmentation and diagnosis by leveraging complementary information from different contrasts. Each contrast highlights specific tumor characteristics, enabling a comprehensive understanding of tumor morphology, edema, and pathological heterogeneity. However, existing methods still face the challenges of multi-level specificity perception across different contrasts, especially with limited annotations. These challenges include data heterogeneity, granularity differences, and interference from redundant information. To address these limitations, we propose a Task-oriented Uncertainty Collaborative Learning (TUCL) framework for multi-contrast MRI segmentation. TUCL introduces a task-oriented prompt attention (TPA) module with intra-prompt and cross-prompt attention mechanisms to dynamically model feature interactions across contrasts and tasks. Additionally, a cyclic process is designed to map the predictions back to the prompt to ensure that the prompts are effectively utilized. In the decoding stage, the TUCL framework proposes a dual-path uncertainty refinement (DUR) strategy which ensures robust segmentation by refining predictions iteratively. Extensive experimental results on limited labeled data demonstrate that TUCL significantly improves segmentation accuracy (88.2\% in Dice and 10.853 mm in HD95). It shows that TUCL has the potential to extract multi-contrast information and reduce the reliance on extensive annotations. The code is available at: https://github.com/Zhenxuan-Zhang/TUCL_BrainSeg.</description>

      <title>Fairness-Aware Low-Rank Adaptation Under Demographic Privacy Constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pre-trained foundation models can be adapted for specific tasks using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). However, the fairness properties of these adapted classifiers remain underexplored. Existing fairness-aware fine-tuning methods rely on direct access to sensitive attributes or their predictors, but in practice, these sensitive attributes are often held under strict consumer privacy controls, and neither the attributes nor their predictors are available to model developers, hampering the development of fair models. To address this issue, we introduce a set of LoRA-based fine-tuning methods that can be trained in a distributed fashion, where model developers and fairness auditors collaborate without sharing sensitive attributes or predictors. In this paper, we evaluate three such methods - sensitive unlearning, adversarial training, and orthogonality loss - against a fairness-unaware baseline, using experiments on the CelebA and UTK-Face datasets with an ImageNet pre-trained ViT-Base model. We find that orthogonality loss consistently reduces bias while maintaining or improving utility, whereas adversarial training improves False Positive Rate Parity and Demographic Parity in some cases, and sensitive unlearning provides no clear benefit. In tasks where significant biases are present, distributed fairness-aware fine-tuning methods can effectively eliminate bias without compromising consumer privacy and, in most cases, improve model utility.</description>

Abstract: Given a question-image input, the Visual Commonsense Reasoning (VCR) model can predict an answer with the corresponding rationale, which requires inference ability from the real world. The VCR task, which calls for exploiting the multi-source information as well as learning different levels of understanding and extensive commonsense knowledge, is a cognition-level scene understanding task. The VCR task has aroused researchers' interest due to its wide range of applications, including visual question answering, automated vehicle systems, and clinical decision support. Previous approaches to solving the VCR task generally rely on pre-training or exploiting memory with long dependency relationship encoded models. However, these approaches suffer from a lack of generalizability and losing information in long sequences. In this paper, we propose a parallel attention-based cognitive VCR network PAVCR, which fuses visual-textual information efficiently and encodes semantic information in parallel to enable the model to capture rich information for cognition-level inference. Extensive experiments show that the proposed model yields significant improvements over existing methods on the benchmark VCR dataset. Moreover, the proposed model provides intuitive interpretation into visual commonsense reasoning.</description>

      <title>Depth Completion with Multiple Balanced Bases and Confidence for Dense Monocular SLAM</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.04145v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dense SLAM based on monocular cameras does indeed have immense application value in the field of AR/VR, especially when it is performed on a mobile device. In this paper, we propose a novel method that integrates a light-weight depth completion network into a sparse SLAM system using a multi-basis depth representation, so that dense mapping can be performed online even on a mobile phone. Specifically, we present a specifically optimized multi-basis depth completion network, called BBC-Net, tailored to the characteristics of traditional sparse SLAM systems. BBC-Net can predict multiple balanced bases and a confidence map from a monocular image with sparse points generated by off-the-shelf keypoint-based SLAM systems. The final depth is a linear combination of predicted depth bases that can be optimized by tuning the corresponding weights. To seamlessly incorporate the weights into traditional SLAM optimization and ensure efficiency and robustness, we design a set of depth weight factors, which makes our network a versatile plug-in module, facilitating easy integration into various existing sparse SLAM systems and significantly enhancing global depth consistency through bundle adjustment. To verify the portability of our method, we integrate BBC-Net into two representative SLAM systems. The experimental results on various datasets show that the proposed method achieves better performance in monocular dense mapping than the state-of-the-art methods. We provide an online demo running on a mobile phone, which verifies the efficiency and mapping quality of the proposed method in real-world scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10173v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Event cameras offer high temporal resolution and dynamic range with minimal motion blur, making them promising for robust object detection. While Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) on neuromorphic hardware are often considered for energy efficient and low latency event-based data processing, they often fall short of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) in accuracy and flexibility. Here, we introduce Attention-based Hybrid SNN-ANN backbones for event-based object detection to leverage the strengths of both SNN and ANN architectures. A novel Attention-based SNN-ANN bridge module captures sparse spatial and temporal relations from the SNN layer and converts them into dense feature maps for the ANN part of the backbone. Additionally, we present a variant that integrates DWConvLSTMs to the ANN blocks to capture slower dynamics. This multi-timescale network combines fast SNN processing for short timesteps with long-term dense RNN processing, effectively capturing both fast and slow dynamics. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method surpasses SNN-based approaches by significant margins, with results comparable to existing ANN and RNN-based methods. Unlike ANN-only networks, the hybrid setup allows us to implement the SNN blocks on digital neuromorphic hardware to investigate the feasibility of our approach. Extensive ablation studies and implementation on neuromorphic hardware confirm the effectiveness of our proposed modules and architectural choices. Our hybrid SNN-ANN architectures pave the way for ANN-like performance at a drastically reduced parameter, latency, and power budget.</description>

      <title>PRAM: Place Recognition Anywhere Model for Efficient Visual Localization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07785v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Visual localization is a key technique to a variety of applications, e.g., autonomous driving, AR/VR, and robotics. For these real applications, both efficiency and accuracy are important especially on edge devices with limited computing resources. However, previous frameworks, e.g., absolute pose regression (APR), scene coordinate regression (SCR), and the hierarchical method (HM), have limited either accuracy or efficiency in both indoor and outdoor environments. In this paper, we propose the place recognition anywhere model (PRAM), a new framework, to perform visual localization efficiently and accurately by recognizing 3D landmarks. Specifically, PRAM first generates landmarks directly in 3D space in a self-supervised manner. Without relying on commonly used classic semantic labels, these 3D landmarks can be defined in any place in indoor and outdoor scenes with higher generalization ability. Representing the map with 3D landmarks, PRAM discards global descriptors, repetitive local descriptors, and redundant 3D points, increasing the memory efficiency significantly. Then, sparse keypoints, rather than dense pixels, are utilized as the input tokens to a transformer-based recognition module for landmark recognition, which enables PRAM to recognize hundreds of landmarks with high time and memory efficiency. At test time, sparse keypoints and predicted landmark labels are utilized for outlier removal and landmark-wise 2D-3D matching as opposed to exhaustive 2D-2D matching, which further increases the time efficiency. A comprehensive evaluation of APRs, SCRs, HMs, and PRAM on both indoor and outdoor datasets demonstrates that PRAM outperforms ARPs and SCRs in large-scale scenes with a large margin and gives competitive accuracy to HMs but reduces over 90\% memory cost and runs 2.4 times faster, leading to a better balance between efficiency and accuracy.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Convolutional Neural Network-Based Star Detection and Centroiding Method for CubeSat Star Tracker</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19108v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Star trackers are one of the most accurate celestial sensors used for absolute attitude determination. The devices detect stars in captured images and accurately compute their projected centroids on an imaging focal plane with subpixel precision. Traditional algorithms for star detection and centroiding often rely on threshold adjustments for star pixel detection and pixel brightness weighting for centroid computation. However, challenges like high sensor noise and stray light can compromise algorithm performance. This article introduces a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based approach for star detection and centroiding, tailored to address the issues posed by noisy star tracker images in the presence of stray light and other artifacts. Trained using simulated star images overlayed with real sensor noise and stray light, the CNN produces both a binary segmentation map distinguishing star pixels from the background and a distance map indicating each pixel's proximity to the nearest star centroid. Leveraging this distance information alongside pixel coordinates transforms centroid calculations into a set of trilateration problems solvable via the least squares method. Our method employs efficient UNet variants for the underlying CNN architectures, and the variants' performances are evaluated. Comprehensive testing has been undertaken with synthetic image evaluations, hardware-in-the-loop assessments, and night sky tests. The tests consistently demonstrated that our method outperforms several existing algorithms in centroiding accuracy and exhibits superior resilience to high sensor noise and stray light interference. An additional benefit of our algorithms is that they can be executed in real-time on low-power edge AI processors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05057v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) is a numerical method that seeks to fit timeseries data to a linear dynamical system. In doing so, DMD decomposes dynamic data into spatially coherent modes that evolve in time according to exponential growth/decay or with a fixed frequency of oscillation. A prolific application of DMD has been to video, where one interprets the high-dimensional pixel space evolving through time as the video plays. In this work, we propose a simple and interpretable motion detection algorithm for streaming video data rooted in DMD. Our method leverages the fact that there exists a correspondence between the evolution of important video features, such as foreground motion, and the eigenvalues of the matrix which results from applying DMD to segments of video. We apply the method to a database of test videos which emulate security footage under varying realistic conditions. Effectiveness is analyzed using receiver operating characteristic curves, while we use cross-validation to optimize the threshold parameter that identifies movement.</description>

Abstract: Recent advancements in Surgical Visual Question Answering (Surgical-VQA) and related region grounding have shown great promise for robotic and medical applications, addressing the critical need for automated methods in personalized surgical mentorship. However, existing models primarily provide simple structured answers and struggle with complex scenarios due to their limited capability in recognizing long-range dependencies and aligning multimodal information. In this paper, we introduce Surgical-LVLM, a novel personalized large vision-language model tailored for complex surgical scenarios. Leveraging the pre-trained large vision-language model and specialized Visual Perception LoRA (VP-LoRA) blocks, our model excels in understanding complex visual-language tasks within surgical contexts. In addressing the visual grounding task, we propose the Token-Interaction (TIT) module, which strengthens the interaction between the grounding module and the language responses of the Large Visual Language Model (LVLM) after projecting them into the latent space.

      <title>Needle In A Video Haystack: A Scalable Synthetic Evaluator for Video MLLMs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09367v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Video understanding is a crucial next step for multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Various benchmarks are introduced for better evaluating the MLLMs. Nevertheless, current video benchmarks are still inefficient for evaluating video models during iterative development due to the high cost of constructing datasets and the difficulty in isolating specific skills. In this paper, we propose VideoNIAH (Video Needle In A Haystack), a benchmark construction framework through synthetic video generation. VideoNIAH decouples video content from their query-responses by inserting unrelated visual 'needles' into original videos. The framework automates the generation of query-response pairs using predefined rules, minimizing manual labor. The queries focus on specific aspects of video understanding, enabling more skill-specific evaluations. The separation between video content and the queries also allow for increased video variety and evaluations across different lengths. Utilizing VideoNIAH, we compile a video benchmark VNBench, which includes tasks such as retrieval, ordering, and counting to evaluate three key aspects of video understanding: temporal perception, chronological ordering, and spatio-temporal coherence. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of both proprietary and open-source models, uncovering significant differences in their video understanding capabilities across various tasks. Additionally, we perform an in-depth analysis of the test results and model configurations. Based on these findings, we provide some advice for improving video MLLM training, offering valuable insights to guide future research and model development.

      <title>Vulnerabilities in AI-generated Image Detection: The Challenge of Adversarial Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20836v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in image synthesis, particularly with the advent of GAN and Diffusion models, have amplified public concerns regarding the dissemination of disinformation. To address such concerns, numerous AI-generated Image (AIGI) Detectors have been proposed and achieved promising performance in identifying fake images. However, there still lacks a systematic understanding of the adversarial robustness of AIGI detectors. In this paper, we examine the vulnerability of state-of-the-art AIGI detectors against adversarial attack under white-box and black-box settings, which has been rarely investigated so far. To this end, we propose a new method to attack AIGI detectors. First, inspired by the obvious difference between real images and fake images in the frequency domain, we add perturbations under the frequency domain to push the image away from its original frequency distribution. Second, we explore the full posterior distribution of the surrogate model to further narrow this gap between heterogeneous AIGI detectors, e.g. transferring adversarial examples across CNNs and ViTs. This is achieved by introducing a novel post-train Bayesian strategy that turns a single surrogate into a Bayesian one, capable of simulating diverse victim models using one pre-trained surrogate, without the need for re-training. We name our method as Frequency-based Post-train Bayesian Attack, or FPBA. Through FPBA, we show that adversarial attack is truly a real threat to AIGI detectors, because FPBA can deliver successful black-box attacks across models, generators, defense methods, and even evade cross-generator detection, which is a crucial real-world detection scenario. The code will be shared upon acceptance.</description>

      <title>MicroMIL: Graph-based Contextual Multiple Instance Learning for Patient Diagnosis Using Microscopy Images</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21604v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cancer diagnosis has greatly benefited from the integration of whole-slide images (WSIs) with multiple instance learning (MIL), enabling high-resolution analysis of tissue morphology. Graph-based MIL (GNN-MIL) approaches have emerged as powerful solutions for capturing spatial and relational structures in WSIs, thereby improving diagnostic accuracy. However, despite their effectiveness, WSIs require significant computational and infrastructural resources, limiting accessibility in resource-constrained settings. Microscopy imaging provides a cost-effective alternative, but applying GNN-MIL to microscopy imaging is challenging due to the absence of spatial coordinates and the high redundancy in pathologist-acquired images. To address these issues, we introduce MicroMIL, the first weakly-supervised MIL framework specifically designed for microscopy imaging. MicroMIL leverages a representative image extractor (RIE) that employs deep cluster embedding (DCE) and hard Gumbel-Softmax to dynamically reduce redundancy and select representative images. These selected images serve as graph nodes, with edges determined by cosine similarity, eliminating the need for spatial coordinates while preserving relational structure. Extensive experiments on a real-world colon cancer dataset and the BreakHis dataset demonstrate that MicroMIL achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving both diagnostic accuracy and robustness to redundancy.

      <title>Rethinking Pre-Trained Feature Extractor Selection in Multiple Instance Learning for Whole Slide Image Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01167v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multiple instance learning (MIL) has become a preferred method for gigapixel whole slide image (WSI) classification without requiring patch-level annotations. Current MIL research primarily relies on embedding-based approaches, which extract patch features using a pre-trained feature extractor and aggregate them for slide-level prediction. Despite the critical role of feature extraction, there is limited guidance on selecting optimal feature extractors to maximize WSI performance. This study addresses this gap by systematically evaluating MIL feature extractors across three dimensions: pre-training dataset, backbone model, and pre-training method. Extensive experiments were conducted on two public WSI datasets (TCGA-NSCLC and Camelyon16) using four state-of-the-art (SOTA) MIL models. Our findings reveal that: 1) selecting a robust self-supervised learning (SSL) method has a greater impact on performance than relying solely on an in-domain pre-training dataset; 2) prioritizing Transformer-based backbones with deeper architectures over CNN-based models; and 3) using larger, more diverse pre-training datasets significantly enhances classification outcomes. We hope that these insights can provide practical guidance for optimizing WSI classification and explain the reasons behind the performance advantages of the current SOTA pathology foundation models. Furthermore, this work may inform the development of more effective pathology foundation models.

      <title>Real-Time Incremental Explanations for Object Detectors in Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11963v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Object detectors are widely used in safety-critical real-time applications such as autonomous driving. Explainability is especially important for safety-critical applications, and due to the variety of object detectors and their often proprietary nature, black-box explainability tools are needed. However, existing black-box explainability tools for AI models rely on multiple model calls, rendering them impractical for real-time use.
  In this paper, we introduce IncX, an algorithm and a tool for real-time black-box explainability for object detectors. The algorithm is based on linear transformations of saliency maps, producing sufficient explanations. We evaluate our implementation on four widely used video datasets of autonomous driving and demonstrate that IncX's explanations are comparable in quality to the state-of-the-art and are computed two orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art, making them usable in real time.</description>

      <title>A Simple and Generalist Approach for Panoptic Segmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16504v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Panoptic segmentation is an important computer vision task, where the current state-of-the-art solutions require specialized components to perform well. We propose a simple generalist framework based on a deep encoder - shallow decoder architecture with per-pixel prediction. Essentially fine-tuning a massively pretrained image model with minimal additional components. Naively this method does not yield good results. We show that this is due to imbalance during training and propose a novel method for reducing it - centroid regression in the space of spectral positional embeddings. Our method achieves panoptic quality (PQ) of 55.1 on the challenging MS-COCO dataset, state-of-the-art performance among generalist methods.</description>

      <title>Towards Student Actions in Classroom Scenes: New Dataset and Baseline</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00926v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Analyzing student actions is an important and challenging task in educational research. Existing efforts have been hampered by the lack of accessible datasets to capture the nuanced action dynamics in classrooms. In this paper, we present a new multi-label Student Action Video (SAV) dataset, specifically designed for action detection in classroom settings. The SAV dataset consists of 4,324 carefully trimmed video clips from 758 different classrooms, annotated with 15 distinct student actions. Compared to existing action detection datasets, the SAV dataset stands out by providing a wide range of real classroom scenarios, high-quality video data, and unique challenges, including subtle movement differences, dense object engagement, significant scale differences, varied shooting angles, and visual occlusion. These complexities introduce new opportunities and challenges to advance action detection methods. To benchmark this, we propose a novel baseline method based on a visual transformer, designed to enhance attention to key local details within small and dense object regions. Our method demonstrates excellent performance with a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 67.9% and 27.4% on the SAV and AVA datasets, respectively. This paper not only provides the dataset but also calls for further research into AI-driven educational tools that may transform teaching methodologies and learning outcomes. The code and dataset are released at https://github.com/Ritatanz/SAV.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04003v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have improved controllable streetscape generation and supported downstream perception and planning tasks. However, challenges remain in accurately modeling driving scenes and generating long videos. To alleviate these issues, we propose DreamForge, an advanced diffusion-based autoregressive video generation model tailored for 3D-controllable long-term generation. To enhance the lane and foreground generation, we introduce perspective guidance and integrate object-wise position encoding to incorporate local 3D correlation and improve foreground object modeling. We also propose motion-aware temporal attention to capture motion cues and appearance changes in videos. By leveraging motion frames and an autoregressive generation paradigm,we can autoregressively generate long videos (over 200 frames) using a model trained in short sequences, achieving superior quality compared to the baseline in 16-frame video evaluations. Finally, we integrate our method with the realistic simulator DriveArena to provide more reliable open-loop and closed-loop evaluations for vision-based driving agents.

      <title>Large Language Models are Strong Audio-Visual Speech Recognition Learners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12319v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have recently become a focal point of research due to their formidable multimodal understanding capabilities. For example, in the audio and speech domains, an LLM can be equipped with (automatic) speech recognition (ASR) abilities by just concatenating the audio tokens, computed with an audio encoder, and the text tokens to achieve state-of-the-art results. On the contrary, tasks like visual and audio-visual speech recognition (VSR/AVSR), which also exploit noise-invariant lip movement information, have received little or no attention. To bridge this gap, we propose Llama-AVSR, a new MLLM with strong audio-visual speech recognition capabilities. It leverages pre-trained audio and video encoders to produce modality-specific tokens which, together with the text tokens, are processed by a pre-trained LLM (e.g., Llama3.1-8B) to yield the resulting response in an auto-regressive fashion. Llama-AVSR requires a small number of trainable parameters as only modality-specific projectors and LoRA modules are trained whereas the multi-modal encoders and LLM are kept frozen. We evaluate our proposed approach on LRS3, the largest public AVSR benchmark, and we achieve new state-of-the-art results for the tasks of ASR and AVSR with a WER of 0.79% and 0.77%, respectively. To bolster our results, we investigate the key factors that underpin the effectiveness of Llama-AVSR: the choice of the pre-trained encoders and LLM, the efficient integration of LoRA modules, and the optimal performance-efficiency trade-off obtained via modality-aware compression rates.</description>

      <title>General Detection-based Text Line Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17095v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a general detection-based approach to text line recognition, be it printed (OCR) or handwritten (HTR), with Latin, Chinese, or ciphered characters. Detection-based approaches have until now been largely discarded for HTR because reading characters separately is often challenging, and character-level annotation is difficult and expensive. We overcome these challenges thanks to three main insights: (i) synthetic pre-training with sufficiently diverse data enables learning reasonable character localization for any script; (ii) modern transformer-based detectors can jointly detect a large number of instances, and, if trained with an adequate masking strategy, leverage consistency between the different detections; (iii) once a pre-trained detection model with approximate character localization is available, it is possible to fine-tune it with line-level annotation on real data, even with a different alphabet. Our approach, dubbed DTLR, builds on a completely different paradigm than state-of-the-art HTR methods, which rely on autoregressive decoding, predicting character values one by one, while we treat a complete line in parallel. Remarkably, we demonstrate good performance on a large range of scripts, usually tackled with specialized approaches. In particular, we improve state-of-the-art performances for Chinese script recognition on the CASIA v2 dataset, and for cipher recognition on the Borg and Copiale datasets. Our code and models are available at https://github.com/raphael-baena/DTLR.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Vision Language Model Unlearning via Fictitious Facial Identity Dataset</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03554v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine unlearning has emerged as an effective strategy for forgetting specific information in the training data. However, with the increasing integration of visual data, privacy concerns in Vision Language Models (VLMs) remain underexplored. To address this, we introduce Facial Identity Unlearning Benchmark (FIUBench), a novel VLM unlearning benchmark designed to robustly evaluate the effectiveness of unlearning algorithms under the Right to be Forgotten setting. Specifically, we formulate the VLM unlearning task via constructing the Fictitious Facial Identity VQA dataset and apply a two-stage evaluation pipeline that is designed to precisely control the sources of information and their exposure levels. In terms of evaluation, since VLM supports various forms of ways to ask questions with the same semantic meaning, we also provide robust evaluation metrics including membership inference attacks and carefully designed adversarial privacy attacks to evaluate the performance of algorithms. Through the evaluation of four baseline VLM unlearning algorithms within FIUBench, we find that all methods remain limited in their unlearning performance, with significant trade-offs between model utility and forget quality. Furthermore, our findings also highlight the importance of privacy attacks for robust evaluations. We hope FIUBench will drive progress in developing more effective VLM unlearning algorithms.</description>

      <title>Modification Takes Courage: Seamless Image Stitching via Reference-Driven Inpainting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10309v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current image stitching methods often produce noticeable seams in challenging scenarios such as uneven hue and large parallax. To tackle this problem, we propose the Reference-Driven Inpainting Stitcher (RDIStitcher), which reformulates the image fusion and rectangling as a reference-based inpainting model, incorporating a larger modification fusion area and stronger modification intensity than previous methods. Furthermore, we introduce a self-supervised model training method, which enables the implementation of RDIStitcher without requiring labeled data by fine-tuning a Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion model. Recognizing difficulties in assessing the quality of stitched images, we present the Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)-based metrics, offering a new perspective on evaluating stitched image quality. Compared to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) method, extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly enhances content coherence and seamless transitions in the stitched images. Especially in the zero-shot experiments, our method exhibits strong generalization capabilities. Code: https://github.com/yayoyo66/RDIStitcher</description>

Abstract: This paper presents a method for object recognition and automatic labeling in large-area remote sensing images called LRSAA. The method integrates YOLOv11 and MobileNetV3-SSD object detection algorithms through ensemble learning to enhance model performance.

      <description>arXiv:2411.15811v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transformer-based multi-object tracking (MOT) methods have captured the attention of many researchers in recent years. However, these models often suffer from slow inference speeds due to their structure or other issues. To address this problem, we revisited the Joint Detection and Tracking (JDT) method by looking back at past approaches. By integrating the original JDT approach with some advanced theories, this paper employs an efficient method of information transfer between frames on the DETR, constructing a fast and novel JDT-type MOT framework: FastTrackTr. Thanks to the superiority of this information transfer method, our approach not only reduces the number of queries required during tracking but also avoids the excessive introduction of network structures, ensuring model simplicity. Experimental results indicate that our method has the potential to achieve real-time tracking and exhibits competitive tracking accuracy across multiple datasets.</description>

      <title>VidHal: Benchmarking Temporal Hallucinations in Vision LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16771v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs) are widely acknowledged to be prone to hallucinations. Existing research addressing this problem has primarily been confined to image inputs, with limited exploration of video-based hallucinations. Furthermore, current evaluation methods fail to capture nuanced errors in generated responses, which are often exacerbated by the rich spatiotemporal dynamics of videos. To address this, we introduce VidHal, a benchmark specially designed to evaluate video-based hallucinations in VLLMs. VidHal is constructed by bootstrapping video instances across a wide range of common temporal aspects. A defining feature of our benchmark lies in the careful creation of captions which represent varying levels of hallucination associated with each video. To enable fine-grained evaluation, we propose a novel caption ordering task requiring VLLMs to rank captions by hallucinatory extent. We conduct extensive experiments on VidHal and comprehensively evaluate a broad selection of models. Our results uncover significant limitations in existing VLLMs regarding hallucination generation. Through our benchmark, we aim to inspire further research on 1) holistic understanding of VLLM capabilities, particularly regarding hallucination, and 2) extensive development of advanced VLLMs to alleviate this problem.</description>

      <title>DepthCues: Evaluating Monocular Depth Perception in Large Vision Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17385v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large-scale pre-trained vision models are becoming increasingly prevalent, offering expressive and generalizable visual representations that benefit various downstream tasks. Recent studies on the emergent properties of these models have revealed their high-level geometric understanding, in particular in the context of depth perception. However, it remains unclear how depth perception arises in these models without explicit depth supervision provided during pre-training. To investigate this, we examine whether the monocular depth cues, similar to those used by the human visual system, emerge in these models. We introduce a new benchmark, DepthCues, designed to evaluate depth cue understanding, and present findings across 20 diverse and representative pre-trained vision models. Our analysis shows that human-like depth cues emerge in more recent larger models. We also explore enhancing depth perception in large vision models by fine-tuning on DepthCues, and find that even without dense depth supervision, this improves depth estimation. To support further research, our benchmark and evaluation code will be made publicly available for studying depth perception in vision models.</description>

      <title>RS-vHeat: Heat Conduction Guided Efficient Remote Sensing Foundation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17984v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Remote sensing foundation models largely break away from the traditional paradigm of designing task-specific models, offering greater scalability across multiple tasks. However, they face challenges such as low computational efficiency and limited interpretability, especially when dealing with large-scale remote sensing images. To overcome these, we draw inspiration from heat conduction, a physical process modeling local heat diffusion. Building on this idea, we are the first to explore the potential of using the parallel computing model of heat conduction to simulate the local region correlations in high-resolution remote sensing images, and introduce RS-vHeat, an efficient multi-modal remote sensing foundation model. Specifically, RS-vHeat 1) applies the Heat Conduction Operator (HCO) with a complexity of $O(N^{1.5})$ and a global receptive field, reducing computational overhead while capturing remote sensing object structure information to guide heat diffusion; 2) learns the frequency distribution representations of various scenes through a self-supervised strategy based on frequency domain hierarchical masking and multi-domain reconstruction; 3) significantly improves efficiency and performance over state-of-the-art techniques across 4 tasks and 10 datasets. Compared to attention-based remote sensing foundation models, we reduce memory usage by 84\%, FLOPs by 24\% and improves throughput by 2.7 times. The code will be made publicly available.</description>

      <title>Gaussians-to-Life: Text-Driven Animation of 3D Gaussian Splatting Scenes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19233v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: State-of-the-art novel view synthesis methods achieve impressive results for multi-view captures of static 3D scenes. However, the reconstructed scenes still lack "liveliness," a key component for creating engaging 3D experiences. Recently, novel video diffusion models generate realistic videos with complex motion and enable animations of 2D images, however they cannot naively be used to animate 3D scenes as they lack multi-view consistency. To breathe life into the static world, we propose Gaussians2Life, a method for animating parts of high-quality 3D scenes in a Gaussian Splatting representation. Our key idea is to leverage powerful video diffusion models as the generative component of our model and to combine these with a robust technique to lift 2D videos into meaningful 3D motion. We find that, in contrast to prior work, this enables realistic animations of complex, pre-existing 3D scenes and further enables the animation of a large variety of object classes, while related work is mostly focused on prior-based character animation, or single 3D objects. Our model enables the creation of consistent, immersive 3D experiences for arbitrary scenes.</description>

      <title>CLIP meets DINO for Tuning Zero-Shot Classifier using Unlabeled Image Collections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19346v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the era of foundation models, CLIP has emerged as a powerful tool for aligning text &amp; visual modalities into a common embedding space. However, the alignment objective used to train CLIP often results in subpar visual features for fine-grained tasks. In contrast, SSL-pretrained models like DINO excel at extracting rich visual features due to their specialized training paradigm. Yet, these SSL models require an additional supervised linear probing step, which relies on fully labeled data which is often expensive and difficult to obtain at scale. In this paper, we propose a label-free prompt-tuning method that leverages the rich visual features of self-supervised learning models (DINO) and the broad textual knowledge of large language models (LLMs) to largely enhance CLIP-based image classification performance using unlabeled images. Our approach unfolds in three key steps: (1) We generate robust textual feature embeddings that more accurately represent object classes by leveraging class-specific descriptions from LLMs, enabling more effective zero-shot classification compared to CLIP's default name-specific prompts. (2) These textual embeddings are then used to produce pseudo-labels to train an alignment module that integrates the complementary strengths of LLM description-based textual embeddings &amp; DINO's visual features. (3) Finally, we prompt-tune CLIP's vision encoder through DINO-assisted supervision using the trained alignment module. This three-step process allows us to harness the best of visual &amp; textual foundation models, resulting in a powerful and efficient approach that surpasses state-of-the-art label-free classification methods. Notably, our framework, NoLA (No Labels Attached), achieves an average absolute gain of 3.6% over the state-of-the-art LaFTer across 11 diverse image classification datasets. Our code &amp; models can be found at https://github.com/fazliimam/NoLA.</description>

      <title>VISION-XL: High Definition Video Inverse Problem Solver using Latent Image Diffusion Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00156v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel framework for solving high-definition video inverse problems using latent image diffusion models. Building on recent advancements in spatio-temporal optimization for video inverse problems using image diffusion models, our approach leverages latent-space diffusion models to achieve enhanced video quality and resolution. To address the high computational demands of processing high-resolution frames, we introduce a pseudo-batch consistent sampling strategy, allowing efficient operation on a single GPU. Additionally, to improve temporal consistency, we present pseudo-batch inversion, an initialization technique that incorporates informative latents from the measurement. By integrating with SDXL, our framework achieves state-of-the-art video reconstruction across a wide range of spatio-temporal inverse problems, including complex combinations of frame averaging and various spatial degradations, such as deblurring, super-resolution, and inpainting. Unlike previous methods, our approach supports multiple aspect ratios (landscape, vertical, and square) and delivers HD-resolution reconstructions (exceeding 1280x720) in under 6 seconds per frame on a single NVIDIA 4090 GPU.</description>

Abstract: 3D single object tracking is essential in autonomous driving and robotics. Existing methods often struggle with sparse and incomplete point cloud scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a Multimodal-guided Virtual Cues Projection (MVCP) scheme that generates virtual cues to enrich sparse point clouds. Additionally, we introduce an enhanced tracker MVCTrack based on the generated virtual cues. Specifically, the MVCP scheme seamlessly integrates RGB sensors into LiDAR-based systems, leveraging a set of 2D detections to create dense 3D virtual cues that significantly improve the sparsity of point clouds. These virtual cues can naturally integrate with existing LiDAR-based 3D trackers, yielding substantial performance gains. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance on the NuScenes dataset.</description>

      <title>Generative Densification: Learning to Densify Gaussians for High-Fidelity Generalizable 3D Reconstruction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06234v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generalized feed-forward Gaussian models have achieved significant progress in sparse-view 3D reconstruction by leveraging prior knowledge from large multi-view datasets. However, these models often struggle to represent high-frequency details due to the limited number of Gaussians. While the densification strategy used in per-scene 3D Gaussian splatting (3D-GS) optimization can be adapted to the feed-forward models, it may not be ideally suited for generalized scenarios. In this paper, we propose Generative Densification, an efficient and generalizable method to densify Gaussians generated by feed-forward models. Unlike the 3D-GS densification strategy, which iteratively splits and clones raw Gaussian parameters, our method up-samples feature representations from the feed-forward models and generates their corresponding fine Gaussians in a single forward pass, leveraging the embedded prior knowledge for enhanced generalization. Experimental results on both object-level and scene-level reconstruction tasks demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches with comparable or smaller model sizes, achieving notable improvements in representing fine details.</description>

      <title>Motion by Queries: Identity-Motion Trade-offs in Text-to-Video Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07750v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Text-to-video diffusion models have shown remarkable progress in generating coherent video clips from textual descriptions. However, the interplay between motion, structure, and identity representations in these models remains under-explored. Here, we investigate how self-attention query features (a.k.a. Q features) simultaneously govern motion, structure, and identity and examine the challenges arising when these representations interact. Our analysis reveals that Q affects not only layout, but that during denoising Q also has a strong effect on subject identity, making it hard to transfer motion without the side-effect of transferring identity. Understanding this dual role enabled us to control query feature injection (Q injection) and demonstrate two applications: (1) a zero-shot motion transfer method that is 20 times more efficient than existing approaches, and (2) a training-free technique for consistent multi-shot video generation, where characters maintain identity across multiple video shots while Q injection enhances motion fidelity.</description>

      <title>RowDetr: End-to-End Row Detection Using Polynomials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10525v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Crop row detection is essential for enabling autonomous navigation in GPS-denied environments, such as under-canopy agricultural settings. Traditional methods often struggle with occlusions, variable lighting conditions, and the structural variability of crop rows. To address these challenges, RowDetr, a novel end-to-end neural network architecture, is introduced for robust and efficient row detection. A new dataset of approximately 6,900 images is curated, capturing a diverse range of real-world agricultural conditions, including occluded rows, uneven terrain, and varying crop densities. Unlike previous approaches, RowDetr leverages smooth polynomial functions to precisely delineate crop boundaries in the image space, ensuring a more structured and interpretable representation of row geometry. A key innovation of this approach is PolyOptLoss, a novel energy-based loss function designed to enhance learning robustness, even in the presence of noisy or imperfect labels. This loss function significantly improves model stability and generalization by optimizing polynomial curve fitting directly in image space. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RowDetr significantly outperforms existing frameworks, including Agronav and RowColAttention, across key performance metrics. Additionally, RowDetr achieves a sixfold speedup over Agronav, making it highly suitable for real-time deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. To facilitate better comparisons across future studies, lane detection metrics from autonomous driving research are adapted, providing a more standardized and meaningful evaluation framework for crop row detection. This work establishes a new benchmark in under-canopy</description>

      <title>Meta Curvature-Aware Minimization for Domain Generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11542v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Domain generalization (DG) aims to enhance the ability of models trained on source domains to generalize effectively to unseen domains. Recently, Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) has shown promise in this area by reducing the sharpness of the loss landscape to obtain more generalized models. However, SAM and its variants sometimes fail to guide the model toward a flat minimum, and their training processes exhibit limitations, hindering further improvements in model generalization. In this paper, we first propose an improved model training process aimed at encouraging the model to converge to a flat minima. To achieve this, we design a curvature metric that has a minimal effect when the model is far from convergence but becomes increasingly influential in indicating the curvature of the minima as the model approaches a local minimum. Then we derive a novel algorithm from this metric, called Meta Curvature-Aware Minimization (MeCAM), to minimize the curvature around the local minima. Specifically, the optimization objective of MeCAM simultaneously minimizes the regular training loss, the surrogate gap of SAM, and the surrogate gap of meta-learning. We provide theoretical analysis on MeCAM's generalization error and convergence rate, and demonstrate its superiority over existing DG methods through extensive experiments on five benchmark DG datasets, including PACS, VLCS, OfficeHome, TerraIncognita, and DomainNet. Code will be available on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Tell Me What to Track: Infusing Robust Language Guidance for Enhanced Referring Multi-Object Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12561v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Referring multi-object tracking (RMOT) is an emerging cross-modal task that aims to localize an arbitrary number of targets based on a language expression and continuously track them in a video. This intricate task involves reasoning on multi-modal data and precise target localization with temporal association. However, prior studies overlook the imbalanced data distribution between newborn targets and existing targets due to the nature of the task. In addition, they only indirectly fuse multi-modal features, struggling to deliver clear guidance on newborn target detection. To solve the above issues, we conduct a collaborative matching strategy to alleviate the impact of the imbalance, boosting the ability to detect newborn targets while maintaining tracking performance. In the encoder, we integrate and enhance the cross-modal and multi-scale fusion, overcoming the bottlenecks in previous work, where limited multi-modal information is shared and interacted between feature maps. In the decoder, we also develop a referring-infused adaptation that provides explicit referring guidance through the query tokens. The experiments showcase the superior performance of our model (+3.42%) compared to prior works, demonstrating the effectiveness of our designs.</description>

      <title>Language-guided Medical Image Segmentation with Target-informed Multi-level Contrastive Alignments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13533v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Medical image segmentation is crucial in modern medical image analysis, which can aid into diagnosis of various disease conditions. Recently, language-guided segmentation methods have shown promising results in automating image segmentation where text reports are incorporated as guidance. These text reports, containing image impressions and insights given by clinicians, provides auxiliary guidance. However, these methods neglect the inherent pattern gaps between the two distinct modalities, which leads to sub-optimal image-text feature fusion without proper cross-modality feature alignments. Contrastive alignments are widely used to associate image-text semantics in representation learning; however, it has not been exploited to bridge the pattern gaps in language-guided segmentation that relies on subtle low level image details to represent diseases. Existing contrastive alignment methods typically algin high-level global image semantics without involving low-level, localized target information, and therefore fails to explore fine-grained text guidance for language-guided segmentation. In this study, we propose a language-guided segmentation network with Target-informed Multi-level Contrastive Alignments (TMCA). TMCA enables target-informed cross-modality alignments and fine-grained text guidance to bridge the pattern gaps in language-guided segmentation. Specifically, we introduce: 1) a target-sensitive semantic distance module that enables granular image-text alignment modelling, and 2) a multi-level alignment strategy that directs text guidance on low-level image features. In addition, a language-guided target enhancement module is proposed to leverage the aligned text to redirect attention to focus on critical localized image features. Extensive experiments on 4 image-text datasets, involving 3 medical imaging modalities, demonstrated that our TMCA achieved superior performances.</description>

      <title>A Simple yet Effective Test-Time Adaptation for Zero-Shot Monocular Metric Depth Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14103v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent development of foundation models for monocular depth estimation such as Depth Anything paved the way to zero-shot monocular depth estimation. Since it returns an affine-invariant disparity map, the favored technique to recover the metric depth consists in fine-tuning the model. However, this stage is not straightforward, it can be costly and time-consuming because of the training and the creation of the dataset. The latter must contain images captured by the camera that will be used at test time and the corresponding ground truth. Moreover, the fine-tuning may also degrade the generalizing capacity of the original model. Instead, we propose in this paper a new method to rescale Depth Anything predictions using 3D points provided by sensors or techniques such as low-resolution LiDAR or structure-from-motion with poses given by an IMU. This approach avoids fine-tuning and preserves the generalizing power of the original depth estimation model while being robust to the noise of the sparse depth or of the depth model. Our experiments highlight enhancements relative to zero-shot monocular metric depth estimation methods, competitive results compared to fine-tuned approaches and a better robustness than depth completion approaches.

      <title>Completion as Enhancement: A Degradation-Aware Selective Image Guided Network for Depth Completion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19225v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the Selective Image Guided Network (SigNet), a novel degradation-aware framework that transforms depth completion into depth enhancement for the first time. Moving beyond direct completion using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), SigNet initially densifies sparse depth data through non-CNN densification tools to obtain coarse yet dense depth. This approach eliminates the mismatch and ambiguity caused by direct convolution over irregularly sampled sparse data. Subsequently, SigNet redefines completion as enhancement, establishing a self-supervised degradation bridge between the coarse depth and the targeted dense depth for effective RGB-D fusion. To achieve this, SigNet leverages the implicit degradation to adaptively select high-frequency components (e.g., edges) of RGB data to compensate for the coarse depth. This degradation is further integrated into a multi-modal conditional Mamba, dynamically generating the state parameters to enable efficient global high-frequency information interaction. We conduct extensive experiments on the NYUv2, DIML, SUN RGBD, and TOFDC datasets, demonstrating the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance of SigNet.</description>

      <title>OASIS Uncovers: High-Quality T2I Models, Same Old Stereotypes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00962v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Images generated by text-to-image (T2I) models often exhibit visual biases and stereotypes of concepts such as culture and profession. Existing quantitative measures of stereotypes are based on statistical parity that does not align with the sociological definition of stereotypes and, therefore, incorrectly categorizes biases as stereotypes. Instead of oversimplifying stereotypes as biases, we propose a quantitative measure of stereotypes that aligns with its sociological definition. We then propose OASIS to measure the stereotypes in a generated dataset and understand their origins within the T2I model. OASIS includes two scores to measure stereotypes from a generated image dataset: (M1) Stereotype Score to measure the distributional violation of stereotypical attributes, and (M2) WALS to measure spectral variance in the images along a stereotypical attribute. OASIS also includes two methods to understand the origins of stereotypes in T2I models: (U1) StOP to discover attributes that the T2I model internally associates with a given concept, and (U2) SPI to quantify the emergence of stereotypical attributes in the latent space of the T2I model during image generation. Despite the considerable progress in image fidelity, using OASIS, we conclude that newer T2I models such as FLUX.1 and SDv3 contain strong stereotypical predispositions about concepts and still generate images with widespread stereotypical attributes. Additionally, the quantity of stereotypes worsens for nationalities with lower Internet footprints.</description>

      <title>Quantum Down Sampling Filter for Variational Auto-encoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06259v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Variational autoencoders (VAEs) are fundamental for generative modeling and image reconstruction, yet their performance often struggles to maintain high fidelity in reconstructions. This study introduces a hybrid model, quantum variational autoencoder (Q-VAE), which integrates quantum encoding within the encoder while utilizing fully connected layers to extract meaningful representations. The decoder uses transposed convolution layers for up-sampling. The Q-VAE is evaluated against the classical VAE and the classical direct-passing VAE, which utilizes windowed pooling filters. Results on the MNIST and USPS datasets demonstrate that Q-VAE consistently outperforms classical approaches, achieving lower Fr\'echet inception distance scores, thereby indicating superior image fidelity and enhanced reconstruction quality. These findings highlight the potential of Q-VAE for high-quality synthetic data generation and improved image reconstruction in generative models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09898v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tremendous progress has been made in deep stereo matching to excel on benchmark datasets through per-domain fine-tuning. However, achieving strong zero-shot generalization - a hallmark of foundation models in other computer vision tasks - remains challenging for stereo matching. We introduce FoundationStereo, a foundation model for stereo depth estimation designed to achieve strong zero-shot generalization. To this end, we first construct a large-scale (1M stereo pairs) synthetic training dataset featuring large diversity and high photorealism, followed by an automatic self-curation pipeline to remove ambiguous samples. We then design a number of network architecture components to enhance scalability, including a side-tuning feature backbone that adapts rich monocular priors from vision foundation models to mitigate the sim-to-real gap, and long-range context reasoning for effective cost volume filtering. Together, these components lead to strong robustness and accuracy across domains, establishing a new standard in zero-shot stereo depth estimation.

      <title>ATRNet-STAR: A Large Dataset and Benchmark Towards Remote Sensing Object Recognition in the Wild</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13354v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The absence of publicly available, large-scale, high-quality datasets for Synthetic Aperture Radar Automatic Target Recognition (SAR ATR) has significantly hindered the application of rapidly advancing deep learning techniques, which hold huge potential to unlock new capabilities in this field. This is primarily because collecting large volumes of diverse target samples from SAR images is prohibitively expensive, largely due to privacy concerns, the characteristics of microwave radar imagery perception, and the need for specialized expertise in data annotation. Throughout the history of SAR ATR research, there have been only a number of small datasets, mainly including targets like ships, airplanes, buildings, etc. There is only one vehicle dataset MSTAR collected in the 1990s, which has been a valuable source for SAR ATR. To fill this gap, this paper introduces a large-scale, new dataset named ATRNet-STAR with 40 different vehicle categories collected under various realistic imaging conditions and scenes. It marks a substantial advancement in dataset scale and diversity, comprising over 190,000 well-annotated samples, 10 times larger than its predecessor, the famous MSTAR. Building such a large dataset is a challenging task, and the data collection scheme will be detailed. Secondly, we illustrate the value of ATRNet-STAR via extensively evaluating the performance of 15 representative methods with 7 different experimental settings on challenging classification and detection benchmarks derived from the dataset. Finally, based on our extensive experiments, we identify valuable insights for SAR ATR and discuss potential future research directions in this field. We hope that the scale, diversity, and benchmark of ATRNet-STAR can significantly facilitate the advancement of SAR ATR.</description>

Abstract: In the rapidly advancing domain of computer vision, accurately estimating the poses of multiple individuals from various viewpoints remains a significant challenge, especially when reliability is a key requirement. This paper introduces a novel algorithm that excels in multi-view, multi-person pose estimation by incorporating depth information. An extensive evaluation demonstrates that the proposed algorithm not only generalizes well to unseen datasets, and shows a fast runtime performance, but also is adaptable to different keypoints.

      <title>Multi-Knowledge-oriented Nighttime Haze Imaging Enhancer for Vision-driven Intelligent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07351v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Salient object detection (SOD) plays a critical role in vision-driven measurement systems (VMS), facilitating the detection and segmentation of key visual elements in an image. However, adverse imaging conditions such as haze during the day, low light, and haze at night severely degrade image quality, and complicating the SOD process. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-task-oriented nighttime haze imaging enhancer (MToIE), which integrates three tasks: daytime dehazing, low-light enhancement, and nighttime dehazing. The MToIE incorporates two key innovative components: First, the network employs a task-oriented node learning mechanism to handle three specific degradation types: day-time haze, low light, and night-time haze conditions, with an embedded self-attention module enhancing its performance in nighttime imaging. In addition, multi-receptive field enhancement module that efficiently extracts multi-scale features through three parallel depthwise separable convolution branches with different dilation rates, capturing comprehensive spatial information with minimal computational overhead. To ensure optimal image reconstruction quality and visual characteristics, we suggest a hybrid loss function. Extensive experiments on different types of weather/imaging conditions illustrate that MToIE surpasses existing methods, significantly enhancing the accuracy and reliability of vision systems across diverse imaging scenarios.

      <title>Revisiting the Generalization Problem of Low-level Vision Models Through the Lens of Image Deraining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12600v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generalization remains a significant challenge for low-level vision models, which often struggle with unseen degradations in real-world scenarios despite their success in controlled benchmarks. In this paper, we revisit the generalization problem in low-level vision models. Image deraining is selected as a case study due to its well-defined and easily decoupled structure, allowing for more effective observation and analysis. Through comprehensive experiments, we reveal that the generalization issue is not primarily due to limited network capacity but rather the failure of existing training strategies, which leads networks to overfit specific degradation patterns. Our findings show that guiding networks to focus on learning the underlying image content, rather than the degradation patterns, is key to improving generalization. We demonstrate that balancing the complexity of background images and degradations in the training data helps networks better fit the image distribution. Furthermore, incorporating content priors from pre-trained generative models significantly enhances generalization. Experiments on both image deraining and image denoising validate the proposed strategies. We believe the insights and solutions will inspire further research and improve the generalization of low-level vision models.</description>

      <title>Bridging Text and Vision: A Multi-View Text-Vision Registration Approach for Cross-Modal Place Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14195v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mobile robots necessitate advanced natural language understanding capabilities to accurately identify locations and perform tasks such as package delivery. However, traditional visual place recognition (VPR) methods rely solely on single-view visual information and cannot interpret human language descriptions. To overcome this challenge, we bridge text and vision by proposing a multiview (360{\deg} views of the surroundings) text-vision registration approach called Text4VPR for place recognition task, which is the first method that exclusively utilizes textual descriptions to match a database of images. Text4VPR employs the frozen T5 language model to extract global textual embeddings. Additionally, it utilizes the Sinkhorn algorithm with temperature coefficient to assign local tokens to their respective clusters, thereby aggregating visual descriptors from images. During the training stage, Text4VPR emphasizes the alignment between individual text-image pairs for precise textual description. In the inference stage, Text4VPR uses the Cascaded Cross-Attention Cosine Alignment (CCCA) to address the internal mismatch between text and image groups. Subsequently, Text4VPR performs precisely place match based on the descriptions of text-image groups. On Street360Loc, the first text to image VPR dataset we created, Text4VPR builds a robust baseline, achieving a leading top-1 accuracy of 57% and a leading top-10 accuracy of 92% within a 5-meter radius on the test set, which indicates that localization from textual descriptions to images is not only feasible but also holds significant potential for further advancement, as shown in Figure 1.</description>

      <title>InstaFace: Identity-Preserving Facial Editing with Single Image Inference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20577v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Facial appearance editing is crucial for digital avatars, AR/VR, and personalized content creation, driving realistic user experiences. However, preserving identity with generative models is challenging, especially in scenarios with limited data availability. Traditional methods often require multiple images and still struggle with unnatural face shifts, inconsistent hair alignment, or excessive smoothing effects. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a novel diffusion-based framework, InstaFace, to generate realistic images while preserving identity using only a single image. Central to InstaFace, we introduce an efficient guidance network that harnesses 3D perspectives by integrating multiple 3DMM-based conditionals without introducing additional trainable parameters. Moreover, to ensure maximum identity retention as well as preservation of background, hair, and other contextual features like accessories, we introduce a novel module that utilizes feature embeddings from a facial recognition model and a pre-trained vision-language model. Quantitative evaluations demonstrate that our method outperforms several state-of-the-art approaches in terms of identity preservation, photorealism, and effective control of pose, expression, and lighting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.21314v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Text-to-video generation has demonstrated promising progress with the advent of diffusion models, yet existing approaches are limited by dataset quality and computational resources. To address these limitations, this paper presents a comprehensive approach that advances both data curation and model design. We introduce CFC-VIDS-1M, a high-quality video dataset constructed through a systematic coarse-to-fine curation pipeline. The pipeline first evaluates video quality across multiple dimensions, followed by a fine-grained stage that leverages vision-language models to enhance text-video alignment and semantic richness. Building upon the curated dataset's emphasis on visual quality and temporal coherence, we develop RACCOON, a transformer-based architecture with decoupled spatial-temporal attention mechanisms. The model is trained through a progressive four-stage strategy designed to efficiently handle the complexities of video generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our integrated approach of high-quality data curation and efficient training strategy generates visually appealing and temporally coherent videos while maintaining computational efficiency. We will release our dataset, code, and models.</description>

      <title>CAT-3DGS: A Context-Adaptive Triplane Approach to Rate-Distortion-Optimized 3DGS Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00357v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently emerged as a promising 3D representation. Much research has been focused on reducing its storage requirements and memory footprint. However, the needs to compress and transmit the 3DGS representation to the remote side are overlooked. This new application calls for rate-distortion-optimized 3DGS compression. How to quantize and entropy encode sparse Gaussian primitives in the 3D space remains largely unexplored. Few early attempts resort to the hyperprior framework from learned image compression. But, they fail to utilize fully the inter and intra correlation inherent in Gaussian primitives. Built on ScaffoldGS, this work, termed CAT-3DGS, introduces a context-adaptive triplane approach to their rate-distortion-optimized coding. It features multi-scale triplanes, oriented according to the principal axes of Gaussian primitives in the 3D space, to capture their inter correlation (i.e. spatial correlation) for spatial autoregressive coding in the projected 2D planes. With these triplanes serving as the hyperprior, we further perform channel-wise autoregressive coding to leverage the intra correlation within each individual Gaussian primitive. Our CAT-3DGS incorporates a view frequency-aware masking mechanism. It actively skips from coding those Gaussian primitives that potentially have little impact on the rendering quality. When trained end-to-end to strike a good rate-distortion trade-off, our CAT-3DGS achieves the state-of-the-art compression performance on the commonly used real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>Jointly Understand Your Command and Intention:Reciprocal Co-Evolution between Scene-Aware 3D Human Motion Synthesis and Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00371v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As two intimate reciprocal tasks, scene-aware human motion synthesis and analysis require a joint understanding between multiple modalities, including 3D body motions, 3D scenes, and textual descriptions. In this paper, we integrate these two paired processes into a Co-Evolving Synthesis-Analysis (CESA) pipeline and mutually benefit their learning. Specifically, scene-aware text-to-human synthesis generates diverse indoor motion samples from the same textual description to enrich human-scene interaction intra-class diversity, thus significantly benefiting training a robust human motion analysis system. Reciprocally, human motion analysis would enforce semantic scrutiny on each synthesized motion sample to ensure its semantic consistency with the given textual description, thus improving realistic motion synthesis. Considering that real-world indoor human motions are goal-oriented and path-guided, we propose a cascaded generation strategy that factorizes text-driven scene-specific human motion generation into three stages: goal inferring, path planning, and pose synthesizing. Coupling CESA with this powerful cascaded motion synthesis model, we jointly improve realistic human motion synthesis and robust human motion analysis in 3D scenes.</description>

      <title>DLF: Extreme Image Compression with Dual-generative Latent Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01428v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent studies in extreme image compression have achieved remarkable performance by compressing the tokens from generative tokenizers. However, these methods often prioritize clustering common semantics within the dataset, while overlooking the diverse details of individual objects. Consequently, this results in suboptimal reconstruction fidelity, especially at low bitrates. To address this issue, we introduce a Dual-generative Latent Fusion (DLF) paradigm. DLF decomposes the latent into semantic and detail elements, compressing them through two distinct branches. The semantic branch clusters high-level information into compact tokens, while the detail branch encodes perceptually critical details to enhance the overall fidelity. Additionally, we propose a cross-branch interactive design to reduce redundancy between the two branches, thereby minimizing the overall bit cost. Experimental results demonstrate the impressive reconstruction quality of DLF even below 0.01 bits per pixel (bpp). On the CLIC2020 test set, our method achieves bitrate savings of up to 27.93% on LPIPS and 53.55% on DISTS compared to MS-ILLM. Furthermore, DLF surpasses recent diffusion-based codecs in visual fidelity while maintaining a comparable level of generative realism. Code will be available later.</description>

Abstract: In recent years, the increasing popularity of Hi-DPI screens has driven a rising demand for high-resolution images. However, the limited computational power of edge devices poses a challenge in deploying complex super-resolution neural networks, highlighting the need for efficient methods. While prior works have made significant progress, they have not fully exploited pixel-level information. Moreover, their reliance on fixed sampling patterns limits both accuracy and the ability to capture fine details in low-resolution images. To address these challenges, we introduce two plug-and-play modules designed to capture and leverage pixel information effectively in Look-Up Table (LUT) based super-resolution networks. Our method introduces Automatic Sampling (AutoSample), a flexible LUT sampling approach where sampling weights are automatically learned during training to adapt to pixel variations and expand the receptive field without added inference cost. We also incorporate Adaptive Residual Learning (AdaRL) to enhance inter-layer connections, enabling detailed information flow and improving the network's ability to reconstruct fine details. Our method achieves significant performance improvements on both MuLUT and SPF-LUT while maintaining similar storage sizes. Specifically, for MuLUT, we achieve a PSNR improvement of approximately +0.20 dB improvement on average across five datasets. For SPF-LUT, with more than a 50% reduction in storage space and about a 2/3 reduction in inference time, our method still maintains performance comparable to the original.

      <title>Diff-Reg v2: Diffusion-Based Matching Matrix Estimation for Image Matching and 3D Registration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04127v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Establishing reliable correspondences is crucial for all registration tasks, including 2D image registration, 3D point cloud registration, and 2D-3D image-to-point cloud registration. However, these tasks are often complicated by challenges such as scale inconsistencies, symmetry, and large deformations, which can lead to ambiguous matches. Previous feature-based and correspondence-based methods typically rely on geometric or semantic features to generate or polish initial potential correspondences. Some methods typically leverage specific geometric priors, such as topological preservation, to devise diverse and innovative strategies tailored to a given enhancement goal, which cannot be exhaustively enumerated. Additionally, many previous approaches rely on a single-step prediction head, which can struggle with local minima in complex matching scenarios. To address these challenges, we introduce an innovative paradigm that leverages a diffusion model in matrix space for robust matching matrix estimation. Our model treats correspondence estimation as a denoising diffusion process in the matching matrix space, gradually refining the intermediate matching matrix to the optimal one. Specifically, we apply the diffusion model in the doubly stochastic matrix space for 3D-3D and 2D-3D registration tasks. In the 2D image registration task, we deploy the diffusion model in a matrix subspace where dual-softmax projection regularization is applied. For all three registration tasks, we provide adaptive matching matrix embedding implementations tailored to the specific characteristics of each task while maintaining a consistent "match-to-warp" encoding pattern. Furthermore, we adopt a lightweight design for the denoising module. In inference, once points or image features are extracted and fixed, this module performs multi-step denoising predictions through reverse sampling.</description>

      <title>LEDiT: Your Length-Extrapolatable Diffusion Transformer without Positional Encoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04344v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion transformers(DiTs) struggle to generate images at resolutions higher than their training resolutions. The primary obstacle is that the explicit positional encodings(PE), such as RoPE, need extrapolation which degrades performance when the inference resolution differs from training. In this paper, we propose a Length-Extrapolatable Diffusion Transformer(LEDiT), a simple yet powerful architecture to overcome this limitation. LEDiT needs no explicit PEs, thereby avoiding extrapolation. The key innovations of LEDiT are introducing causal attention to implicitly impart global positional information to tokens, while enhancing locality to precisely distinguish adjacent tokens. Experiments on 256x256 and 512x512 ImageNet show that LEDiT can scale the inference resolution to 512x512 and 1024x1024, respectively, while achieving better image quality compared to current state-of-the-art length extrapolation methods(NTK-aware, YaRN). Moreover, LEDiT achieves strong extrapolation performance with just 100K steps of fine-tuning on a pretrained DiT, demonstrating its potential for integration into existing text-to-image DiTs.

      <title>Question-Aware Gaussian Experts for Audio-Visual Question Answering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04459v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Audio-Visual Question Answering (AVQA) requires not only question-based multimodal reasoning but also precise temporal grounding to capture subtle dynamics for accurate prediction. However, existing methods mainly use question information implicitly, limiting focus on question-specific details. Furthermore, most studies rely on uniform frame sampling, which can miss key question-relevant frames. Although recent Top-K frame selection methods aim to address this, their discrete nature still overlooks fine-grained temporal details. This paper proposes QA-TIGER, a novel framework that explicitly incorporates question information and models continuous temporal dynamics. Our key idea is to use Gaussian-based modeling to adaptively focus on both consecutive and non-consecutive frames based on the question, while explicitly injecting question information and applying progressive refinement. We leverage a Mixture of Experts (MoE) to flexibly implement multiple Gaussian models, activating temporal experts specifically tailored to the question. Extensive experiments on multiple AVQA benchmarks show that QA-TIGER consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance. Code is available at https://aim-skku.github.io/QA-TIGER/</description>

      <title>Spatial regularisation for improved accuracy and interpretability in keypoint-based registration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04499v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unsupervised registration strategies bypass requirements in ground truth transforms or segmentations by optimising similarity metrics between fixed and moved volumes. Among these methods, a recent subclass of approaches based on unsupervised keypoint detection stand out as very promising for interpretability. Specifically, these methods train a network to predict feature maps for fixed and moving images, from which explainable centres of mass are computed to obtain point clouds, that are then aligned in closed-form. However, the features returned by the network often yield spatially diffuse patterns that are hard to interpret, thus undermining the purpose of keypoint-based registration. Here, we propose a three-fold loss to regularise the spatial distribution of the features. First, we use the KL divergence to model features as point spread functions that we interpret as probabilistic keypoints. Then, we sharpen the spatial distributions of these features to increase the precision of the detected landmarks. Finally, we introduce a new repulsive loss across keypoints to encourage spatial diversity. Overall, our loss considerably improves the interpretability of the features, which now correspond to precise and anatomically meaningful landmarks. We demonstrate our three-fold loss in foetal rigid motion tracking and brain MRI affine registration tasks, where it not only outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised strategies, but also bridges the gap with state-of-the-art supervised methods.

      <title>Generalized moduli of continuity under irregular or random deformations via multiscale analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.11977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2104.11977v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the problem of robustness to deformations of the input for deep convolutional neural networks, we identify signal classes which are inherently stable to irregular deformations induced by distortion fields $\tau\in L^\infty(\mathbb{R}^d;\mathbb{R}^d)$, to be characterized in terms of a generalized modulus of continuity associated with the deformation operator. Resorting to ideas of harmonic and multiscale analysis, we prove that for signals in multiresolution approximation spaces $U_s$ at scale $s$, stability in $L^2$ holds in the regime $\|\tau\|_{L^\infty}/s\ll 1$ - essentially as an effect of the uncertainty principle. Instability occurs when $\|\tau\|_{L^\infty}/s\gg 1$, and we provide a sharp upper bound for the asymptotic growth rate. The stability results are then extended to signals in the Besov space $B^{d/2}_{2,1}$ tailored to the given multiresolution approximation. We also consider the case of more general time-frequency deformations. Finally, we provide stochastic versions of the aforementioned results, namely we study the issue of stability in mean when $\tau(x)$ is modeled as a random field (not bounded, in general) with identically distributed variables $|\tau(x)|$, $x\in\mathbb{R}^d$.</description>

      <title>Sustainable transparency in Recommender Systems: Bayesian Ranking of Images for Explainability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.01196v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recommender Systems have become crucial in the modern world, commonly guiding users towards relevant content or products, and having a large influence over the decisions of users and citizens. However, ensuring transparency and user trust in these systems remains a challenge; personalized explanations have emerged as a solution, offering justifications for recommendations. Among the existing approaches for generating personalized explanations, using existing visual content created by users is a promising option to maximize transparency and user trust. State-of-the-art models that follow this approach, despite leveraging highly optimized architectures, employ surrogate learning tasks that do not efficiently model the objective of ranking images as explanations for a given recommendation; this leads to a suboptimal training process with high computational costs that may not be reduced without affecting model performance. This work presents BRIE, a novel model where we leverage Bayesian Pairwise Ranking to enhance the training process, allowing us to consistently outperform state-of-the-art models in six real-world datasets while reducing its model size by up to 64 times and its CO2 emissions by up to 75% in training and inference.</description>

      <title>PseudoTouch: Efficiently Imaging the Surface Feel of Objects for Robotic Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15107v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tactile sensing is vital for human dexterous manipulation, however, it has not been widely used in robotics. Compact, low-cost sensing platforms can facilitate a change, but unlike their popular optical counterparts, they are difficult to deploy in high-fidelity tasks due to their low signal dimensionality and lack of a simulation model. To overcome these challenges, we introduce PseudoTouch which links high-dimensional structural information to low-dimensional sensor signals. It does so by learning a low-dimensional visual-tactile embedding, wherein we encode a depth patch from which we decode the tactile signal. We collect and train PseudoTouch on a dataset comprising aligned tactile and visual data pairs obtained through random touching of eight basic geometric shapes. We demonstrate the utility of our trained PseudoTouch model in two downstream tasks: object recognition and grasp stability prediction. In the object recognition task, we evaluate the learned embedding's performance on a set of five basic geometric shapes and five household objects. Using PseudoTouch, we achieve an object recognition accuracy 84% after just ten touches, surpassing a proprioception baseline. For the grasp stability task, we use ACRONYM labels to train and evaluate a grasp success predictor using PseudoTouch's predictions derived from virtual depth information. Our approach yields a 32% absolute improvement in accuracy compared to the baseline relying on partial point cloud data. We make the data, code, and trained models publicly available at https://pseudotouch.cs.uni-freiburg.de.</description>

Abstract: Autonomous robot navigation and manipulation in open environments require reasoning and replanning with closed-loop feedback. In this work, we present COME-robot, the first closed-loop robotic system utilizing the GPT-4V vision-language foundation model for open-ended reasoning and adaptive planning in real-world scenarios.COME-robot incorporates two key innovative modules: (i) a multi-level open-vocabulary perception and situated reasoning module that enables effective exploration of the 3D environment and target object identification using commonsense knowledge and situated information, and (ii) an iterative closed-loop feedback and restoration mechanism that verifies task feasibility, monitors execution success, and traces failure causes across different modules for robust failure recovery. Through comprehensive experiments involving 8 challenging real-world mobile and tabletop manipulation tasks, COME-robot demonstrates a significant improvement in task success rate (~35%) compared to state-of-the-art methods. We further conduct comprehensive analyses to elucidate how COME-robot's design facilitates failure recovery, free-form instruction following, and long-horizon task planning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09787v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe the design and results from the BraTS 2023 Intracranial Meningioma Segmentation Challenge. The BraTS Meningioma Challenge differed from prior BraTS Glioma challenges in that it focused on meningiomas, which are typically benign extra-axial tumors with diverse radiologic and anatomical presentation and a propensity for multiplicity. Nine participating teams each developed deep-learning automated segmentation models using image data from the largest multi-institutional systematically expert annotated multilabel multi-sequence meningioma MRI dataset to date, which included 1000 training set cases, 141 validation set cases, and 283 hidden test set cases. Each case included T2, FLAIR, T1, and T1Gd brain MRI sequences with associated tumor compartment labels delineating enhancing tumor, non-enhancing tumor, and surrounding non-enhancing FLAIR hyperintensity. Participant automated segmentation models were evaluated and ranked based on a scoring system evaluating lesion-wise metrics including dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and 95% Hausdorff Distance. The top ranked team had a lesion-wise median dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 0.976, 0.976, and 0.964 for enhancing tumor, tumor core, and whole tumor, respectively and a corresponding average DSC of 0.899, 0.904, and 0.871, respectively. These results serve as state-of-the-art benchmarks for future pre-operative meningioma automated segmentation algorithms. Additionally, we found that 1286 of 1424 cases (90.3%) had at least 1 compartment voxel abutting the edge of the skull-stripped image edge, which requires further investigation into optimal pre-processing face anonymization steps.</description>

      <title>MBSS-T1: Model-Based Subject-Specific Self-Supervised Motion Correction for Robust Cardiac T1 Mapping</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11992v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cardiac T1 mapping is a valuable quantitative MRI technique for diagnosing diffuse myocardial diseases. Traditional methods, relying on breath-hold sequences and cardiac triggering based on an ECG signal, face challenges with patient compliance, limiting their effectiveness. Image registration can enable motion-robust cardiac T1 mapping, but inherent intensity differences between time points pose a challenge. We present MBSS-T1, a subject-specific self-supervised model for motion correction in cardiac T1 mapping. Physical constraints, implemented through a loss function comparing synthesized and motion-corrected images, enforce signal decay behavior, while anatomical constraints, applied via a Dice loss, ensure realistic deformations. The unique combination of these constraints results in motion-robust cardiac T1 mapping along the longitudinal relaxation axis. In a 5-fold experiment on a public dataset of 210 patients (STONE sequence) and an internal dataset of 19 patients (MOLLI sequence), MBSS-T1 outperformed baseline deep-learning registration methods. It achieved superior model fitting quality ($R^2$: 0.975 vs. 0.941, 0.946 for STONE; 0.987 vs. 0.982, 0.965 for MOLLI free-breathing; 0.994 vs. 0.993, 0.991 for MOLLI breath-hold), anatomical alignment (Dice: 0.89 vs. 0.84, 0.88 for STONE; 0.963 vs. 0.919, 0.851 for MOLLI free-breathing; 0.954 vs. 0.924, 0.871 for MOLLI breath-hold), and visual quality (4.33 vs. 3.38, 3.66 for STONE; 4.1 vs. 3.5, 3.28 for MOLLI free-breathing; 3.79 vs. 3.15, 2.84 for MOLLI breath-hold). MBSS-T1 enables motion-robust T1 mapping for broader patient populations, overcoming challenges such as suboptimal compliance, and facilitates free-breathing cardiac T1 mapping without requiring large annotated datasets.

Abstract: Multi-modal end-to-end autonomous driving has shown promising advancements in recent work. By embedding more modalities into end-to-end networks, the system's understanding of both static and dynamic aspects of the driving environment is enhanced, thereby improving the safety of autonomous driving. In this paper, we introduce METDrive, an end-to-end system that leverages temporal guidance from the embedded time series features of ego states, including rotation angles, steering, throttle signals, and waypoint vectors. The geometric features derived from perception sensor data and the time series features of ego state data jointly guide the waypoint prediction with the proposed temporal guidance loss function. We evaluated METDrive on the CARLA leaderboard benchmarks, achieving a driving score of 70%, a route completion score of 94%, and an infraction score of 0.78.</description>

      <title>BuildingView: Constructing Urban Building Exteriors Databases with Street View Imagery and Multimodal Large Language Mode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19527v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Urban Building Exteriors are increasingly important in urban analytics, driven by advancements in Street View Imagery and its integration with urban research. Multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) offer powerful tools for urban annotation, enabling deeper insights into urban environments. However, challenges remain in creating accurate and detailed urban building exterior databases, identifying critical indicators for energy efficiency, environmental sustainability, and human-centric design, and systematically organizing these indicators. To address these challenges, we propose BuildingView, a novel approach that integrates high-resolution visual data from Google Street View with spatial information from OpenStreetMap via the Overpass API. This research improves the accuracy of urban building exterior data, identifies key sustainability and design indicators, and develops a framework for their extraction and categorization. Our methodology includes a systematic literature review, building and Street View sampling, and annotation using the ChatGPT-4O API. The resulting database, validated with data from New York City, Amsterdam, and Singapore, provides a comprehensive tool for urban studies, supporting informed decision-making in urban planning, architectural design, and environmental policy. The code for BuildingView is available at https://github.com/Jasper0122/BuildingView.</description>

      <title>M2Distill: Multi-Modal Distillation for Lifelong Imitation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00064v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lifelong imitation learning for manipulation tasks poses significant challenges due to distribution shifts that occur in incremental learning steps. Existing methods often focus on unsupervised skill discovery to construct an ever-growing skill library or distillation from multiple policies, which can lead to scalability issues as diverse manipulation tasks are continually introduced and may fail to ensure a consistent latent space throughout the learning process, leading to catastrophic forgetting of previously learned skills. In this paper, we introduce M2Distill, a multi-modal distillation-based method for lifelong imitation learning focusing on preserving consistent latent space across vision, language, and action distributions throughout the learning process. By regulating the shifts in latent representations across different modalities from previous to current steps, and reducing discrepancies in Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) policies between consecutive learning steps, we ensure that the learned policy retains its ability to perform previously learned tasks while seamlessly integrating new skills. Extensive evaluations on the LIBERO lifelong imitation learning benchmark suites, including LIBERO-OBJECT, LIBERO-GOAL, and LIBERO-SPATIAL, demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods across all evaluated metrics.</description>

      <title>NeRF-Aug: Data Augmentation for Robotics with Neural Radiance Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02482v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Training a policy that can generalize to unknown objects is a long standing challenge within the field of robotics. The performance of a policy often drops significantly in situations where an object in the scene was not seen during training. To solve this problem, we present NeRF-Aug, a novel method that is capable of teaching a policy to interact with objects that are not present in the dataset. This approach differs from existing approaches by leveraging the speed, photorealism, and 3D consistency of a neural radiance field for augmentation. NeRF-Aug both creates more photorealistic data and runs 63% faster than existing methods. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on 5 tasks with 9 novel objects that are not present in the expert demonstrations. We achieve an average performance boost of 55.6% when comparing our method to the next best method. You can see video results at https://nerf-aug.github.io.</description>

      <title>Neighboring Slice Noise2Noise: Self-Supervised Medical Image Denoising from Single Noisy Image Volume</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10831v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the last few years, with the rapid development of deep learning technologies, supervised methods based on convolutional neural networks have greatly enhanced the performance of medical image denoising. However, these methods require large quantities of noisy-clean image pairs for training, which greatly limits their practicality. Although some researchers have attempted to train denoising networks using only single noisy images, existing self-supervised methods, including blind-spot-based and data-splitting-based methods, heavily rely on the assumption that noise is pixel-wise independent. However, this assumption often does not hold in real-world medical images. Therefore, in the field of medical imaging, there remains a lack of simple and practical denoising methods that can achieve high-quality denoising performance using only single noisy images. In this paper, we propose a novel self-supervised medical image denoising method, Neighboring Slice Noise2Noise (NS-N2N). The proposed method utilizes neighboring slices within a single noisy image volume to construct weighted training data, and then trains the denoising network using a self-supervised scheme with regional consistency loss and inter-slice continuity loss. NS-N2N only requires a single noisy image volume obtained from one medical imaging procedure to achieve high-quality denoising of the image volume itself. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art self-supervised denoising methods in both denoising performance and processing efficiency. Furthermore, since NS-N2N operates solely in the image domain, it is free from device-specific issues such as reconstruction geometry, making it easier to apply in various clinical practices.</description>

      <title>FloNa: Floor Plan Guided Embodied Visual Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18335v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Humans naturally rely on floor plans to navigate in unfamiliar environments, as they are readily available, reliable, and provide rich geometrical guidance. However, existing visual navigation settings overlook this valuable prior knowledge, leading to limited efficiency and accuracy. To eliminate this gap, we introduce a novel navigation task: Floor Plan Visual Navigation (FloNa), the first attempt to incorporate floor plan into embodied visual navigation. While the floor plan offers significant advantages, two key challenges emerge: (1) handling the spatial inconsistency between the floor plan and the actual scene layout for collision-free navigation, and (2) aligning observed images with the floor plan sketch despite their distinct modalities. To address these challenges, we propose FloDiff, a novel diffusion policy framework incorporating a localization module to facilitate alignment between the current observation and the floor plan. We further collect $20k$ navigation episodes across $117$ scenes in the iGibson simulator to support the training and evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our framework in unfamiliar scenes using floor plan knowledge. Project website: https://gauleejx.github.io/flona/.</description>

      <title>NavRAG: Generating User Demand Instructions for Embodied Navigation through Retrieval-Augmented LLM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11142v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) is an essential skill for embodied agents, allowing them to navigate in 3D environments following natural language instructions. High-performance navigation models require a large amount of training data, the high cost of manually annotating data has seriously hindered this field. Therefore, some previous methods translate trajectory videos into step-by-step instructions for expanding data, but such instructions do not match well with users' communication styles that briefly describe destinations or state specific needs. Moreover, local navigation trajectories overlook global context and high-level task planning. To address these issues, we propose NavRAG, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework that generates user demand instructions for VLN. NavRAG leverages LLM to build a hierarchical scene description tree for 3D scene understanding from global layout to local details, then simulates various user roles with specific demands to retrieve from the scene tree, generating diverse instructions with LLM. We annotate over 2 million navigation instructions across 861 scenes and evaluate the data quality and navigation performance of trained models.</description>

      <title>Toward Robust Non-Transferable Learning: A Survey and Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13593v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Over the past decades, researchers have primarily focused on improving the generalization abilities of models, with limited attention given to regulating such generalization. However, the ability of models to generalize to unintended data (e.g., harmful or unauthorized data) can be exploited by malicious adversaries in unforeseen ways, potentially resulting in violations of model ethics. Non-transferable learning (NTL), a task aimed at reshaping the generalization abilities of deep learning models, was proposed to address these challenges. While numerous methods have been proposed in this field, a comprehensive review of existing progress and a thorough analysis of current limitations remain lacking. In this paper, we bridge this gap by presenting the first comprehensive survey on NTL and introducing NTLBench, the first benchmark to evaluate NTL performance and robustness within a unified framework. Specifically, we first introduce the task settings, general framework, and criteria of NTL, followed by a summary of NTL approaches. Furthermore, we emphasize the often-overlooked issue of robustness against various attacks that can destroy the non-transferable mechanism established by NTL. Experiments conducted via NTLBench verify the limitations of existing NTL methods in robustness. Finally, we discuss the practical applications of NTL, along with its future directions and associated challenges.</description>

      <title>RURANET++: An Unsupervised Learning Method for Diabetic Macular Edema Based on SCSE Attention Mechanisms and Dynamic Multi-Projection Head Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20224v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diabetic Macular Edema (DME), a prevalent complication among diabetic patients, constitutes a major cause of visual impairment and blindness. Although deep learning has achieved remarkable progress in medical image analysis, traditional DME diagnosis still relies on extensive annotated data and subjective ophthalmologist assessments, limiting practical applications. To address this, we present RURANET++, an unsupervised learning-based automated DME diagnostic system. This framework incorporates an optimized U-Net architecture with embedded Spatial and Channel Squeeze &amp; Excitation (SCSE) attention mechanisms to enhance lesion feature extraction. During feature processing, a pre-trained GoogLeNet model extracts deep features from retinal images, followed by PCA-based dimensionality reduction to 50 dimensions for computational efficiency. Notably, we introduce a novel clustering algorithm employing multi-projection heads to explicitly control cluster diversity while dynamically adjusting similarity thresholds, thereby optimizing intra-class consistency and inter-class discrimination. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance across multiple metrics, achieving maximum accuracy (0.8411), precision (0.8593), recall (0.8411), and F1-score (0.8390), with exceptional clustering quality. This work provides an efficient unsupervised solution for DME diagnosis with significant clinical implications.</description>

      <title>Nexus-O: An Omni-Perceptive And -Interactive Model for Language, Audio, And Vision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01879v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Human beings perceive the real world through a spectrum of sensory modalities, encompassing auditory, visual, and linguistic faculties. The journey towards achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) necessitates the development of models that can emulate these multifaceted perceptual capabilities and comprehensively understand these diversified data. To this end, we introduce \textbf{Nexus-O}, an industry-level \textbf{omni-perceptive and -interactive} model capable of efficiently processing Audio, Image, Video, and Text data in any combination and output audio/text in an end-to-end way. We systematically investigate Nexus-O by addressing three key research questions: First, how can models be efficiently designed and trained to achieve tri-modal alignment, understanding and reasoning capabilities across multiple modalities? Second, what approaches can be implemented to evaluate tri-modal model robustness, ensuring reliable performance and applicability in real-world scenarios? Third, what strategies can be employed to curate and obtain high-quality, real-life scenario speech datasets? For the first question, we design and pre-train Nexus-O based on the vision-language model, rather than the language model. By pre-training the model over high-quality synthetic audio data, our model is capable of tri-modal perception and interaction. For the second question, we introduce a new audio testbed, Nexus-O-audio, comprising diverse Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) samples, spanning various real-world scenarios, such as corporate meetings and live stream. For the third question, we design the speech data synthesis pipeline to obtain high-quality speech training datasets, covering various real-world scenarios. Comprehensive experimentation and an in-depth analysis of tri-modal alignment over latent space demonstrate the advantages of our model on downstream tasks.</description>

      <title>Learning to Chain Operations by Routing Information Through a Global Workspace</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01906v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a model inspired by the Global Workspace Theory that integrates specialized modules to perform a sequential reasoning task. A controller selectively routes information between modules through the workspace using a gating mechanism. This approach allows the model to chain operations by iteratively broadcasting information between specialized domains, mimicking System-2 reasoning. We evaluate the model's performance on a simple addition task, where two addends must be summed. The task can be solved by routing information sequentially through an Input module, an Increment module (multiple times), and finally an Output module. We consider two implementations of this system with increasing complexity. First, using hand-designed modules operating on one-hot digit representations, the controller (a LSTM recurrent network) learns to select the appropriate modules (input, increment, output) in the appropriate sequence. Second, we replace the hand-designed modules with learned representation modules for MNIST images and an increment module trained on the task objectives; here again, the controller learns the appropriate sequential module selection to solve the task. Finally, we show that the Global Workspace model, while having fewer parameters, outperforms LSTMs and Transformers when tested on unseen addition operations (both interpolations and extrapolations of addition operations seen during training). Our results highlight the potential of architectures inspired by the Global Workspace Theory to enhance deep learning's reasoning capabilities.</description>

      <title>GBT-SAM: A Parameter-Efficient Depth-Aware Model for Generalizable Brain tumour Segmentation on mp-MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04325v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gliomas are brain tumours that stand out for their highly lethal and aggressive nature, which demands a precise approach in their diagnosis. Medical image segmentation plays a crucial role in the evaluation and follow-up of these tumours, allowing specialists to analyse their morphology. However, existing methods for automatic glioma segmentation often lack generalization capability across other brain tumour domains, require extensive computational resources, or fail to fully utilize the multi-parametric MRI (mp-MRI) data used to delineate them. In this work, we introduce GBT-SAM, a novel Generalizable Brain Tumour (GBT) framework that extends the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to brain tumour segmentation tasks. Our method employs a two-step training protocol: first, fine-tuning the patch embedding layer to process the entire mp-MRI modalities, and second, incorporating parameter-efficient LoRA blocks and a Depth-Condition block into the Vision Transformer (ViT) to capture inter-slice correlations. GBT-SAM achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Adult Glioma dataset (Dice Score of $93.54$) while demonstrating robust generalization across Meningioma, Pediatric Glioma, and Sub-Saharan Glioma datasets. Furthermore, GBT-SAM uses less than 6.5M trainable parameters, thus offering an efficient solution for brain tumour segmentation. \\ Our code and models are available at https://github.com/vpulab/med-sam-brain .</description>
