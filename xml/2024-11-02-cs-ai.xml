      <title>Argumentation and Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This chapter provides an overview of research works that present approaches with some degree of cross-fertilisation between Computational Argumentation and Machine Learning. Our review of the literature identified two broad themes representing the purpose of the interaction between these two areas: argumentation for machine learning and machine learning for argumentation. Across these two themes, we systematically evaluate the spectrum of works across various dimensions, including the type of learning and the form of argumentation framework used. Further, we identify three types of interaction between these two areas: synergistic approaches, where the Argumentation and Machine Learning components are tightly integrated; segmented approaches, where the two are interleaved such that the outputs of one are the inputs of the other; and approximated approaches, where one component shadows the other at a chosen level of detail. We draw conclusions about the suitability of certain forms of Argumentation for supporting certain types of Machine Learning, and vice versa, with clear patterns emerging from the review. Whilst the reviewed works provide inspiration for successfully combining the two fields of research, we also identify and discuss limitations and challenges that ought to be addressed in order to ensure that they remain a fruitful pairing as AI advances.</description>

      <title>Towards Reliable Alignment: Uncertainty-aware RLHF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in aligning Large Language Models with human preferences have benefited from larger reward models and better preference data. However, most of these methodologies rely on the accuracy of the reward model. The reward models used in Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) are typically learned from small datasets using stochastic optimization algorithms, making them prone to high variability. We illustrate the inconsistencies between reward models empirically on numerous open-source datasets.
  We theoretically show that the fluctuation of the reward models can be detrimental to the alignment problem because the derived policies are more overfitted to the reward model and, hence, are riskier if the reward model itself is uncertain. We use concentration of measure to motivate an uncertainty-aware, conservative algorithm for policy optimization. We show that such policies are more risk-averse in the sense that they are more cautious of uncertain rewards. We theoretically prove that our proposed methodology has less risk than the vanilla method.
  We corroborate our theoretical results with experiments based on designing an ensemble of reward models. We use this ensemble of reward models to align a language model using our methodology and observe that our empirical findings match our theoretical predictions.</description>

      <title>Reasons and Solutions for the Decline in Model Performance after Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowledge editing technology has received widespread attention for low-cost updates of incorrect or outdated knowledge in large-scale language models. However, recent research has found that edited models often exhibit varying degrees of performance degradation. The reasons behind this phenomenon and potential solutions have not yet been provided. In order to investigate the reasons for the performance decline of the edited model and optimize the editing method, this work explores the underlying reasons from both data and model perspectives. Specifically, 1) from a data perspective, to clarify the impact of data on the performance of editing models, this paper first constructs a Multi-Question Dataset (MQD) to evaluate the impact of different types of editing data on model performance. The performance of the editing model is mainly affected by the diversity of editing targets and sequence length, as determined through experiments. 2) From a model perspective, this article explores the factors that affect the performance of editing models. The results indicate a strong correlation between the L1-norm of the editing model layer and the editing accuracy, and clarify that this is an important factor leading to the bottleneck of editing performance. Finally, in order to improve the performance of the editing model, this paper further proposes a Dump for Sequence (D4S) method, which successfully overcomes the previous editing bottleneck by reducing the L1-norm of the editing layer, allowing users to perform multiple effective edits and minimizing model damage. Our code is available at https://github.com/nlpkeg/D4S.</description>

      <title>Plan-on-Graph: Self-Correcting Adaptive Planning of Large Language Model on Knowledge Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable reasoning capabilities on complex tasks, but they still suffer from out-of-date knowledge, hallucinations, and opaque decision-making. In contrast, Knowledge Graphs (KGs) can provide explicit and editable knowledge for LLMs to alleviate these issues. Existing paradigm of KG-augmented LLM manually predefines the breadth of exploration space and requires flawless navigation in KGs. However, this paradigm cannot adaptively explore reasoning paths in KGs based on the question semantics and self-correct erroneous reasoning paths, resulting in a bottleneck in efficiency and effect. To address these limitations, we propose a novel self-correcting adaptive planning paradigm for KG-augmented LLM named Plan-on-Graph (PoG), which first decomposes the question into several sub-objectives and then repeats the process of adaptively exploring reasoning paths, updating memory, and reflecting on the need to self-correct erroneous reasoning paths until arriving at the answer. Specifically, three important mechanisms of Guidance, Memory, and Reflection are designed to work together, to guarantee the adaptive breadth of self-correcting planning for graph reasoning. Finally, extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of PoG.</description>

      <title>Neural Network Verification with PyRAT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As AI systems are becoming more and more popular and used in various critical domains (health, transport, energy, ...), the need to provide guarantees and trust of their safety is undeniable. To this end, we present PyRAT, a tool based on abstract interpretation to verify the safety and the robustness of neural networks. In this paper, we describe the different abstractions used by PyRAT to find the reachable states of a neural network starting from its input as well as the main features of the tool to provide fast and accurate analysis of neural networks. PyRAT has already been used in several collaborations to ensure safety guarantees, with its second place at the VNN-Comp 2024 showcasing its performance.</description>

      <title>RL-STaR: Theoretical Analysis of Reinforcement Learning Frameworks for Self-Taught Reasoner</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) have improved with chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, allowing models to solve complex tasks in a stepwise manner. However, training CoT capabilities requires detailed reasoning data, which is often scarce. The self-taught reasoner (STaR) framework addresses this by using reinforcement learning to automatically generate reasoning steps, reducing reliance on human-labeled data. Although STaR and its variants have demonstrated empirical success, a theoretical foundation explaining these improvements is lacking. This work provides a theoretical framework for understanding the effectiveness of reinforcement learning on CoT reasoning and STaR. Our contributions are: (1) an analysis of policy improvement, showing why LLM reasoning improves iteratively with STaR; (2) conditions for convergence to an optimal reasoning policy; (3) an examination of STaR's robustness, explaining how it can improve reasoning even when incorporating occasional incorrect steps; and (4) criteria for the quality of pre-trained models necessary to initiate effective reasoning improvement. This framework aims to bridge empirical findings with theoretical insights, advancing reinforcement learning approaches for reasoning in LLMs.</description>

      <title>Average Controlled and Average Natural Micro Direct Effects in Summary Causal Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the identifiability of average controlled direct effects and average natural direct effects in causal systems represented by summary causal graphs, which are abstractions of full causal graphs, often used in dynamic systems where cycles and omitted temporal information complicate causal inference. Unlike in the traditional linear setting, where direct effects are typically easier to identify and estimate, non-parametric direct effects, which are crucial for handling real-world complexities, particularly in epidemiological contexts where relationships between variables (e.g, genetic, environmental, and behavioral factors) are often non-linear, are much harder to define and identify. In particular, we give sufficient conditions for identifying average controlled micro direct effect and average natural micro direct effect from summary causal graphs in the presence of hidden confounding. Furthermore, we show that the conditions given for the average controlled micro direct effect become also necessary in the setting where there is no hidden confounding and where we are only interested in identifiability by adjustment.</description>

      <title>AndroidLab: Training and Systematic Benchmarking of Android Autonomous Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous agents have become increasingly important for interacting with the real world. Android agents, in particular, have been recently a frequently-mentioned interaction method. However, existing studies for training and evaluating Android agents lack systematic research on both open-source and closed-source models. In this work, we propose AndroidLab as a systematic Android agent framework. It includes an operation environment with different modalities, action space, and a reproducible benchmark. It supports both large language models (LLMs) and multimodal models (LMMs) in the same action space. AndroidLab benchmark includes predefined Android virtual devices and 138 tasks across nine apps built on these devices. By using the AndroidLab environment, we develop an Android Instruction dataset and train six open-source LLMs and LMMs, lifting the average success rates from 4.59\% to 21.50\% for LLMs and from 1.93\% to 13.28\% for LMMs. AndroidLab is open-sourced and publicly available at \url{https://github.com/THUDM/Android-Lab}.</description>

      <title>Graph Learning for Numeric Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph learning is naturally well suited for use in symbolic, object-centric planning due to its ability to exploit relational structures exhibited in planning domains and to take as input planning instances with arbitrary numbers of objects. Numeric planning is an extension of symbolic planning in which states may now also exhibit numeric variables. In this work, we propose data-efficient and interpretable machine learning models for learning to solve numeric planning tasks. This involves constructing a new graph kernel for graphs with both continuous and categorical attributes, as well as new optimisation methods for learning heuristic functions for numeric planning. Experiments show that our graph kernels are vastly more efficient and generalise better than graph neural networks for numeric planning, and also yield competitive coverage performance compared to domain-independent numeric planners.

      <title>Text2Motion: From Natural Language Instructions to Feasible Plans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.12153v5 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose Text2Motion, a language-based planning framework enabling robots to solve sequential manipulation tasks that require long-horizon reasoning. Given a natural language instruction, our framework constructs both a task- and motion-level plan that is verified to reach inferred symbolic goals. Text2Motion uses feasibility heuristics encoded in Q-functions of a library of skills to guide task planning with Large Language Models. Whereas previous language-based planners only consider the feasibility of individual skills, Text2Motion actively resolves geometric dependencies spanning skill sequences by performing geometric feasibility planning during its search. We evaluate our method on a suite of problems that require long-horizon reasoning, interpretation of abstract goals, and handling of partial affordance perception. Our experiments show that Text2Motion can solve these challenging problems with a success rate of 82%, while prior state-of-the-art language-based planning methods only achieve 13%. Text2Motion thus provides promising generalization characteristics to semantically diverse sequential manipulation tasks with geometric dependencies between skills.</description>

      <title>Unpacking Failure Modes of Generative Policies: Runtime Monitoring of Consistency and Progress</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04640v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robot behavior policies trained via imitation learning are prone to failure under conditions that deviate from their training data. Thus, algorithms that monitor learned policies at test time and provide early warnings of failure are necessary to facilitate scalable deployment. We propose Sentinel, a runtime monitoring framework that splits the detection of failures into two complementary categories: 1) Erratic failures, which we detect using statistical measures of temporal action consistency, and 2) task progression failures, where we use Vision Language Models (VLMs) to detect when the policy confidently and consistently takes actions that do not solve the task. Our approach has two key strengths. First, because learned policies exhibit diverse failure modes, combining complementary detectors leads to significantly higher accuracy at failure detection. Second, using a statistical temporal action consistency measure ensures that we quickly detect when multimodal, generative policies exhibit erratic behavior at negligible computational cost. In contrast, we only use VLMs to detect failure modes that are less time-sensitive. We demonstrate our approach in the context of diffusion policies trained on robotic mobile manipulation domains in both simulation and the real world. By unifying temporal consistency detection and VLM runtime monitoring, Sentinel detects 18% more failures than using either of the two detectors alone and significantly outperforms baselines, thus highlighting the importance of assigning specialized detectors to complementary categories of failure.

      <title>FVEval: Understanding Language Model Capabilities in Formal Verification of Digital Hardware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The remarkable reasoning and code generation capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have spurred significant interest in applying LLMs to enable task automation in digital chip design. In particular, recent work has investigated early ideas of applying these models to formal verification (FV), an approach to verifying hardware implementations that can provide strong guarantees of confidence but demands significant amounts of human effort. While the value of LLM-driven automation is evident, our understanding of model performance, however, has been hindered by the lack of holistic evaluation. In response, we present FVEval, the first comprehensive benchmark and evaluation framework for characterizing LLM performance in tasks pertaining to FV. The benchmark consists of three sub-tasks that measure LLM capabilities at different levels: from the generation of SystemVerilog assertions (SVAs) given natural language descriptions to reasoning about the design RTL and suggesting assertions directly without additional human input. As test instances, we present both collections of expert-written verification collateral and methodologies to scalably generate synthetic examples aligned with industrial FV workflows. A wide range of existing LLMs, both proprietary and open-source, are evaluated against FVEval, based on which we investigate where today's LLMs stand and how we might further enable their application toward improving productivity in digital FV. Our benchmark and evaluation code is available at \url{https://github.com/NVlabs/FVEval}.</description>

      <title>Advanced Cyberattack Detection in Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) Using Convolutional Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing integration of the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) into healthcare systems has significantly enhanced patient care but has also introduced critical cybersecurity challenges. This paper presents a novel approach based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for detecting cyberattacks within IoMT environments. Unlike previous studies that predominantly utilized traditional machine learning (ML) models or simpler Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), the proposed model leverages the capabilities of CNNs to effectively analyze the temporal characteristics of network traffic data. Trained and evaluated on the CICIoMT2024 dataset, which comprises 18 distinct types of cyberattacks across a range of IoMT devices, the proposed CNN model demonstrates superior performance compared to previous state-of-the-art methods, achieving a perfect accuracy of 99% in binary, categorical, and multiclass classification tasks. This performance surpasses that of conventional ML models such as Logistic Regression, AdaBoost, DNNs, and Random Forests. These findings highlight the potential of CNNs to substantially improve IoMT cybersecurity, thereby ensuring the protection and integrity of connected healthcare systems.</description>

      <title>Systematically Analyzing Prompt Injection Vulnerabilities in Diverse LLM Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study systematically analyzes the vulnerability of 36 large language models (LLMs) to various prompt injection attacks, a technique that leverages carefully crafted prompts to elicit malicious LLM behavior. Across 144 prompt injection tests, we observed a strong correlation between model parameters and vulnerability, with statistical analyses, such as logistic regression and random forest feature analysis, indicating that parameter size and architecture significantly influence susceptibility. Results revealed that 56 percent of tests led to successful prompt injections, emphasizing widespread vulnerability across various parameter sizes, with clustering analysis identifying distinct vulnerability profiles associated with specific model configurations. Additionally, our analysis uncovered correlations between certain prompt injection techniques, suggesting potential overlaps in vulnerabilities. These findings underscore the urgent need for robust, multi-layered defenses in LLMs deployed across critical infrastructure and sensitive industries. Successful prompt injection attacks could result in severe consequences, including data breaches, unauthorized access, or misinformation. Future research should explore multilingual and multi-step defenses alongside adaptive mitigation strategies to strengthen LLM security in diverse, real-world environments.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the potential of deterministic systems, specifically large language models (LLMs), to exhibit the functional capacities of moral agency and compatibilist free will. We develop a functional definition of free will grounded in Dennett's compatibilist framework, building on an interdisciplinary theoretical foundation that integrates Shannon's information theory, Dennett's compatibilism, and Floridi's philosophy of information. This framework emphasizes the importance of reason-responsiveness and value alignment in determining moral responsibility rather than requiring metaphysical libertarian free will. Shannon's theory highlights the role of processing complex information in enabling adaptive decision-making, while Floridi's philosophy reconciles these perspectives by conceptualizing agency as a spectrum, allowing for a graduated view of moral status based on a system's complexity and responsiveness. Our analysis of LLMs' decision-making in moral dilemmas demonstrates their capacity for rational deliberation and their ability to adjust choices in response to new information and identified inconsistencies. Thus, they exhibit features of a moral agency that align with our functional definition of free will. These results challenge traditional views on the necessity of consciousness for moral responsibility, suggesting that systems with self-referential reasoning capacities can instantiate degrees of free will and moral reasoning in artificial and biological contexts. This study proposes a parsimonious framework for understanding free will as a spectrum that spans artificial and biological systems, laying the groundwork for further interdisciplinary research on agency and ethics in the artificial intelligence era.</description>

      <title>VL-Cache: Sparsity and Modality-Aware KV Cache Compression for Vision-Language Model Inference Acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across a versatile set of tasks. A key challenge in accelerating VLMs is storing and accessing the large Key-Value (KV) cache that encodes long visual contexts, such as images or videos. While existing KV cache compression methods are effective for Large Language Models (LLMs), directly migrating them to VLMs yields suboptimal accuracy and speedup. To bridge the gap, we propose VL-Cache, a novel KV cache compression recipe tailored for accelerating VLM inference. In this paper, we first investigate the unique sparsity pattern of VLM attention by distinguishing visual and text tokens in prefill and decoding phases. Based on these observations, we introduce a layer-adaptive sparsity-aware cache budget allocation method that effectively distributes the limited cache budget across different layers, further reducing KV cache size without compromising accuracy. Additionally, we develop a modality-aware token scoring policy to better evaluate the token importance. Empirical results on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that retaining only 10% of KV cache achieves accuracy comparable to that with full cache. In a speed benchmark, our method accelerates end-to-end latency of generating 100 tokens by up to 2.33x and speeds up decoding by up to 7.08x, while reducing the memory footprint of KV cache in GPU by 90%.</description>

      <title>Lina-Speech: Gated Linear Attention is a Fast and Parameter-Efficient Learner for text-to-speech synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural codec language models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis, leveraging scalable architectures like autoregressive transformers and large-scale speech datasets. By framing voice cloning as a prompt continuation task, these models excel at cloning voices from short audio samples. However, this approach is limited in its ability to handle numerous or lengthy speech excerpts, since the concatenation of source and target speech must fall within the maximum context length which is determined during training. In this work, we introduce Lina-Speech, a model that replaces traditional self-attention mechanisms with emerging recurrent architectures like Gated Linear Attention (GLA). Building on the success of initial-state tuning on RWKV, we extend this technique to voice cloning, enabling the use of multiple speech samples and full utilization of the context window in synthesis. This approach is fast, easy to deploy, and achieves performance comparable to fine-tuned baselines when the dataset size ranges from 3 to 15 minutes. Notably, Lina-Speech matches or outperforms state-of-the-art baseline models, including some with a parameter count up to four times higher or trained in an end-to-end style. We release our code and checkpoints. Audio samples are available at https://theodorblackbird.github.io/blog/demo_lina/.</description>

      <title>Exploiting Phonological Similarities between African Languages to achieve Speech to Speech Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a pilot study on direct speech-to-speech translation (S2ST) by leveraging linguistic similarities among selected African languages within the same phylum, particularly in cases where traditional data annotation is expensive or impractical. We propose a segment-based model that maps speech segments both within and across language phyla, effectively eliminating the need for large paired datasets. By utilizing paired segments and guided diffusion, our model enables translation between any two languages in the dataset. We evaluate the model on a proprietary dataset from the Kenya Broadcasting Corporation (KBC), which includes five languages: Swahili, Luo, Kikuyu, Nandi, and English. The model demonstrates competitive performance in segment pairing and translation quality, particularly for languages within the same phylum. Our experiments reveal that segment length significantly influences translation accuracy, with average-length segments yielding the highest pairing quality. Comparative analyses with traditional cascaded ASR-MT techniques show that the proposed model delivers nearly comparable translation performance. This study underscores the potential of exploiting linguistic similarities within language groups to perform efficient S2ST, especially in low-resource language contexts.</description>

      <title>Transfer Learning in Vocal Education: Technical Evaluation of Limited Samples Describing Mezzo-soprano</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vocal education in the music field is difficult to quantify due to the individual differences in singers' voices and the different quantitative criteria of singing techniques. Deep learning has great potential to be applied in music education due to its efficiency to handle complex data and perform quantitative analysis. However, accurate evaluations with limited samples over rare vocal types, such as Mezzo-soprano, requires extensive well-annotated data support using deep learning models. In order to attain the objective, we perform transfer learning by employing deep learning models pre-trained on the ImageNet and Urbansound8k datasets for the improvement on the precision of vocal technique evaluation. Furthermore, we tackle the problem of the lack of samples by constructing a dedicated dataset, the Mezzo-soprano Vocal Set (MVS), for vocal technique assessment. Our experimental results indicate that transfer learning increases the overall accuracy (OAcc) of all models by an average of 8.3%, with the highest accuracy at 94.2%. We not only provide a novel approach to evaluating Mezzo-soprano vocal techniques but also introduce a new quantitative assessment method for music education.</description>

      <title>Variable Resolution Sampling and Deep Learning Image Recovery for Accelerated Multi-Spectral MRI Near Metal Implants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Purpose: This study presents a variable resolution (VR) sampling and deep learning reconstruction approach for multi-spectral MRI near metal implants, aiming to reduce scan times while maintaining image quality. Background: The rising use of metal implants has increased MRI scans affected by metal artifacts. Multi-spectral imaging (MSI) reduces these artifacts but sacrifices acquisition efficiency. Methods: This retrospective study on 1.5T MSI knee and hip data from patients with metal hardware used a novel spectral undersampling scheme to improve acquisition efficiency by ~40%. U-Net-based deep learning models were trained for reconstruction. Image quality was evaluated using SSIM, PSNR, and RESI metrics. Results: Deep learning reconstructions of undersampled VR data (DL-VR) showed significantly higher SSIM and PSNR values (p&lt;0.001) compared to conventional reconstruction (CR-VR), with improved edge sharpness. Edge sharpness in DL-reconstructed images matched fully sampled references (p=0.5). Conclusion: This approach can potentially enhance MRI examinations near metal implants by reducing scan times or enabling higher resolution. Further prospective studies are needed to assess clinical value.</description>

      <title>CLIPErase: Efficient Unlearning of Visual-Textual Associations in CLIP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine unlearning (MU) has gained significant attention as a means to remove specific data from trained models without requiring a full retraining process. While progress has been made in unimodal domains like text and image classification, unlearning in multimodal models remains relatively underexplored. In this work, we address the unique challenges of unlearning in CLIP, a prominent multimodal model that aligns visual and textual representations. We introduce CLIPErase, a novel approach that disentangles and selectively forgets both visual and textual associations, ensuring that unlearning does not compromise model performance. CLIPErase consists of three key modules: a Forgetting Module that disrupts the associations in the forget set, a Retention Module that preserves performance on the retain set, and a Consistency Module that maintains consistency with the original model. Extensive experiments on the CIFAR-100 and Flickr30K datasets across four CLIP downstream tasks demonstrate that CLIPErase effectively forgets designated associations in zero-shot tasks for multimodal samples, while preserving the model's performance on the retain set after unlearning.</description>

      <title>MoLE: Enhancing Human-centric Text-to-image Diffusion via Mixture of Low-rank Experts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion has attracted vast attention due to its impressive image-generation capabilities. However, when it comes to human-centric text-to-image generation, particularly in the context of faces and hands, the results often fall short of naturalness due to insufficient training priors. We alleviate the issue in this work from two perspectives. 1) From the data aspect, we carefully collect a human-centric dataset comprising over one million high-quality human-in-the-scene images and two specific sets of close-up images of faces and hands. These datasets collectively provide a rich prior knowledge base to enhance the human-centric image generation capabilities of the diffusion model. 2) On the methodological front, we propose a simple yet effective method called Mixture of Low-rank Experts (MoLE) by considering low-rank modules trained on close-up hand and face images respectively as experts. This concept draws inspiration from our observation of low-rank refinement, where a low-rank module trained by a customized close-up dataset has the potential to enhance the corresponding image part when applied at an appropriate scale. To validate the superiority of MoLE in the context of human-centric image generation compared to state-of-the-art, we construct two benchmarks and perform evaluations with diverse metrics and human studies.

      <title>ASURA-FDPS-ML: Star-by-star Galaxy Simulations Accelerated by Surrogate Modeling for Supernova Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce new high-resolution galaxy simulations accelerated by a surrogate model that reduces the computation cost by approximately 75 percent. Massive stars with a Zero Age Main Sequence mass of about 8 solar masses and above explode as core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe), which play a critical role in galaxy formation. The energy released by CCSNe is essential for regulating star formation and driving feedback processes in the interstellar medium (ISM). However, the short integration timesteps required for SNe feedback present significant bottlenecks in star-by-star galaxy simulations that aim to capture individual stellar dynamics and the inhomogeneous shell expansion of SNe within the turbulent ISM. Our new framework combines direct numerical simulations and surrogate modeling, including machine learning and Gibbs sampling. The star formation history and the time evolution of outflow rates in the galaxy match those obtained from resolved direct numerical simulations. Our new approach achieves high-resolution fidelity while reducing computational costs, effectively bridging the physical scale gap and enabling multi-scale simulations.</description>

      <title>Sequential Order-Robust Mamba for Time Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mamba has recently emerged as a promising alternative to Transformers, offering near-linear complexity in processing sequential data. However, while channels in time series (TS) data have no specific order in general, recent studies have adopted Mamba to capture channel dependencies (CD) in TS, introducing a sequential order bias. To address this issue, we propose SOR-Mamba, a TS forecasting method that 1) incorporates a regularization strategy to minimize the discrepancy between two embedding vectors generated from data with reversed channel orders, thereby enhancing robustness to channel order, and 2) eliminates the 1D-convolution originally designed to capture local information in sequential data. Furthermore, we introduce channel correlation modeling (CCM), a pretraining task aimed at preserving correlations between channels from the data space to the latent space in order to enhance the ability to capture CD. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method across standard and transfer learning scenarios. Code is available at https://github.com/seunghan96/SOR-Mamba.</description>

Abstract: The first artificial quantum neuron models followed a similar path to classic models, as they work only with discrete values. Here we introduce an algorithm that generalizes the binary model manipulating the phase of complex numbers. We propose, test, and implement a neuron model that works with continuous values in a quantum computer. Through simulations, we demonstrate that our model may work in a hybrid training scheme utilizing gradient descent as a learning algorithm. This work represents another step in the direction of evaluation of the use of artificial neural networks efficiently implemented on near-term quantum devices.</description>

Abstract: Ensuring neural network robustness is essential for the safe and reliable operation of robotic learning systems, especially in perception and decision-making tasks within real-world environments. This paper investigates the robustness of neural networks in perception systems, specifically examining their sensitivity to targeted, small-scale perturbations. We identify the Lipschitz constant as a key metric for quantifying and enhancing network robustness. We derive an analytical expression to compute the Lipschitz constant based on neural network architecture, providing a theoretical basis for estimating and improving robustness. Several experiments reveal the relationship between network design, the Lipschitz constant, and robustness, offering practical insights for developing safer, more robust robot learning systems.</description>

      <title>STIED: A deep learning model for the SpatioTemporal detection of focal Interictal Epileptiform Discharges with MEG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetoencephalography (MEG) allows the non-invasive detection of interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs). Clinical MEG analysis in epileptic patients traditionally relies on the visual identification of IEDs, which is time consuming and partially subjective. Automatic, data-driven detection methods exist but show limited performance. Still, the rise of deep learning (DL)-with its ability to reproduce human-like abilities-could revolutionize clinical MEG practice. Here, we developed and validated STIED, a simple yet powerful supervised DL algorithm combining two convolutional neural networks with temporal (1D time-course) and spatial (2D topography) features of MEG signals inspired from current clinical guidelines. Our DL model enabled both temporal and spatial localization of IEDs in patients suffering from focal epilepsy with frequent and high amplitude spikes (FE group), with high-performance metrics-accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity all exceeding 85%-when learning from spatiotemporal features of IEDs. This performance can be attributed to our handling of input data, which mimics established clinical MEG practice. Reverse engineering further revealed that STIED encodes fine spatiotemporal features of IEDs rather than their mere amplitude. The model trained on the FE group also showed promising results when applied to a separate group of presurgical patients with different types of refractory focal epilepsy, though further work is needed to distinguish IEDs from physiological transients. This study paves the way of incorporating STIED and DL algorithms into the routine clinical MEG evaluation of epilepsy.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a framework that integrates variational autoencoders (VAE) with reinforcement learning (RL) to balance system performance and resource usage in multi-agent systems by dynamically adjusting network structures over time. A key innovation of this method is its capability to handle the vast action space of the network structure. This is achieved by combining Variational Auto-Encoder and Deep Reinforcement Learning to control the latent space encoded from the network structures. The proposed method, evaluated on the modified OpenAI particle environment under various scenarios, not only demonstrates superior performance compared to baselines but also reveals interesting strategies and insights through the learned behaviors.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Network Intervention for Complex Systems: A Hierarchical Graph Reinforcement Learning Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effective governance and steering of behavior in complex multi-agent systems (MAS) are essential for managing system-wide outcomes, particularly in environments where interactions are structured by dynamic networks. In many applications, the goal is to promote pro-social behavior among agents, where network structure plays a pivotal role in shaping these interactions. This paper introduces a Hierarchical Graph Reinforcement Learning (HGRL) framework that governs such systems through targeted interventions in the network structure. Operating within the constraints of limited managerial authority, the HGRL framework demonstrates superior performance across a range of environmental conditions, outperforming established baseline methods. Our findings highlight the critical influence of agent-to-agent learning (social learning) on system behavior: under low social learning, the HGRL manager preserves cooperation, forming robust core-periphery networks dominated by cooperators. In contrast, high social learning accelerates defection, leading to sparser, chain-like networks. Additionally, the study underscores the importance of the system manager's authority level in preventing system-wide failures, such as agent rebellion or collapse, positioning HGRL as a powerful tool for dynamic network-based governance.</description>

      <title>FlowLLM: Flow Matching for Material Generation with Large Language Models as Base Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Material discovery is a critical area of research with the potential to revolutionize various fields, including carbon capture, renewable energy, and electronics. However, the immense scale of the chemical space makes it challenging to explore all possible materials experimentally. In this paper, we introduce FlowLLM, a novel generative model that combines large language models (LLMs) and Riemannian flow matching (RFM) to design novel crystalline materials. FlowLLM first fine-tunes an LLM to learn an effective base distribution of meta-stable crystals in a text representation. After converting to a graph representation, the RFM model takes samples from the LLM and iteratively refines the coordinates and lattice parameters. Our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, increasing the generation rate of stable materials by over three times and increasing the rate for stable, unique, and novel crystals by $\sim50\%$ - a huge improvement on a difficult problem. Additionally, the crystals generated by FlowLLM are much closer to their relaxed state when compared with another leading model, significantly reducing post-hoc computational cost.</description>

      <title>TPP-Gaze: Modelling Gaze Dynamics in Space and Time with Neural Temporal Point Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Attention guides our gaze to fixate the proper location of the scene and holds it in that location for the deserved amount of time given current processing demands, before shifting to the next one. As such, gaze deployment crucially is a temporal process. Existing computational models have made significant strides in predicting spatial aspects of observer's visual scanpaths (where to look), while often putting on the background the temporal facet of attention dynamics (when). In this paper we present TPP-Gaze, a novel and principled approach to model scanpath dynamics based on Neural Temporal Point Process (TPP), that jointly learns the temporal dynamics of fixations position and duration, integrating deep learning methodologies with point process theory. We conduct extensive experiments across five publicly available datasets. Our results show the overall superior performance of the proposed model compared to state-of-the-art approaches. Source code and trained models are publicly available at: https://github.com/phuselab/tppgaze.</description>

      <title>Venire: A Machine Learning-Guided Panel Review System for Community Content Moderation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Research into community content moderation often assumes that moderation teams govern with a single, unified voice. However, recent work has found that moderators disagree with one another at modest, but concerning rates. The problem is not the root disagreements themselves. Subjectivity in moderation is unavoidable, and there are clear benefits to including diverse perspectives within a moderation team. Instead, the crux of the issue is that, due to resource constraints, moderation decisions end up being made by individual decision-makers. The result is decision-making that is inconsistent, which is frustrating for community members. To address this, we develop Venire, an ML-backed system for panel review on Reddit. Venire uses a machine learning model trained on log data to identify the cases where moderators are most likely to disagree. Venire fast-tracks these cases for multi-person review. Ideally, Venire allows moderators to surface and resolve disagreements that would have otherwise gone unnoticed. We conduct three studies through which we design and evaluate Venire: a set of formative interviews with moderators, technical evaluations on two datasets, and a think-aloud study in which moderators used Venire to make decisions on real moderation cases. Quantitatively, we demonstrate that Venire is able to improve decision consistency and surface latent disagreements. Qualitatively, we find that Venire helps moderators resolve difficult moderation cases more confidently. Venire represents a novel paradigm for human-AI content moderation, and shifts the conversation from replacing human decision-making to supporting it.</description>

      <title>Return Augmented Decision Transformer for Off-Dynamics Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study offline off-dynamics reinforcement learning (RL) to utilize data from an easily accessible source domain to enhance policy learning in a target domain with limited data. Our approach centers on return-conditioned supervised learning (RCSL), particularly focusing on the decision transformer (DT), which can predict actions conditioned on desired return guidance and complete trajectory history. Previous works tackle the dynamics shift problem by augmenting the reward in the trajectory from the source domain to match the optimal trajectory in the target domain. However, this strategy can not be directly applicable in RCSL owing to (1) the unique form of the RCSL policy class, which explicitly depends on the return, and (2) the absence of a straightforward representation of the optimal trajectory distribution. We propose the Return Augmented Decision Transformer (RADT) method, where we augment the return in the source domain by aligning its distribution with that in the target domain. We provide the theoretical analysis demonstrating that the RCSL policy learned from RADT achieves the same level of suboptimality as would be obtained without a dynamics shift. We introduce two practical implementations RADT-DARA and RADT-MV respectively. Extensive experiments conducted on D4RL datasets reveal that our methods generally outperform dynamic programming based methods in off-dynamics RL scenarios.</description>

      <title>Graph-Augmented Relation Extraction Model with LLMs-Generated Support Document</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study introduces a novel approach to sentence-level relation extraction (RE) that integrates Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate contextually enriched support documents. By harnessing the power of LLMs to generate auxiliary information, our approach crafts an intricate graph representation of textual data. This graph is subsequently processed through a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to refine and enrich the embeddings associated with each entity ensuring a more nuanced and interconnected understanding of the data. This methodology addresses the limitations of traditional sentence-level RE models by incorporating broader contexts and leveraging inter-entity interactions, thereby improving the model's ability to capture complex relationships across sentences. Our experiments, conducted on the CrossRE dataset, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, with notable improvements in performance across various domains. The results underscore the potential of combining GNNs with LLM-generated context to advance the field of relation extraction.</description>

      <title>Risk Sources and Risk Management Measures in Support of Standards for General-Purpose AI Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is an urgent need to identify both short and long-term risks from newly emerging types of Artificial Intelligence (AI), as well as available risk management measures. In response, and to support global efforts in regulating AI and writing safety standards, we compile an extensive catalog of risk sources and risk management measures for general-purpose AI (GPAI) systems, complete with descriptions and supporting examples where relevant. This work involves identifying technical, operational, and societal risks across model development, training, and deployment stages, as well as surveying established and experimental methods for managing these risks. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first of its kind to provide extensive documentation of both GPAI risk sources and risk management measures that are descriptive, self-contained and neutral with respect to any existing regulatory framework. This work intends to help AI providers, standards experts, researchers, policymakers, and regulators in identifying and mitigating systemic risks from GPAI systems. For this reason, the catalog is released under a public domain license for ease of direct use by stakeholders in AI governance and standards.</description>

      <title>Keep on Swimming: Real Attackers Only Need Partial Knowledge of a Multi-Model System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent approaches in machine learning often solve a task using a composition of multiple models or agentic architectures. When targeting a composed system with adversarial attacks, it might not be computationally or informationally feasible to train an end-to-end proxy model or a proxy model for every component of the system. We introduce a method to craft an adversarial attack against the overall multi-model system when we only have a proxy model for the final black-box model, and when the transformation applied by the initial models can make the adversarial perturbations ineffective. Current methods handle this by applying many copies of the first model/transformation to an input and then re-use a standard adversarial attack by averaging gradients, or learning a proxy model for both stages. To our knowledge, this is the first attack specifically designed for this threat model and our method has a substantially higher attack success rate (80% vs 25%) and contains 9.4% smaller perturbations (MSE) compared to prior state-of-the-art methods. Our experiments focus on a supervised image pipeline, but we are confident the attack will generalize to other multi-model settings [e.g. a mix of open/closed source foundation models], or agentic systems</description>

      <title>Causality-Driven Audits of Model Robustness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robustness audits of deep neural networks (DNN) provide a means to uncover model sensitivities to the challenging real-world imaging conditions that significantly degrade DNN performance in-the-wild. Such conditions are often the result of the compounding of multiple factors inherent to the environment, sensor, or processing pipeline and may lead to complex image distortions that are not easily categorized. When robustness audits are limited to a set of pre-determined imaging effects or distortions, the results cannot be (easily) transferred to real-world conditions where image corruptions may be more complex or nuanced. To address this challenge, we present a new alternative robustness auditing method that uses causal inference to measure DNN sensitivities to the factors of the imaging process that cause complex distortions. Our approach uses causal models to explicitly encode assumptions about the domain-relevant factors and their interactions. Then, through extensive experiments on natural and rendered images across multiple vision tasks, we show that our approach reliably estimates causal effects of each factor on DNN performance using observational domain data. These causal effects directly tie DNN sensitivities to observable properties of the imaging pipeline in the domain of interest towards reducing the risk of unexpected DNN failures when deployed in that domain.</description>

      <title>DASH: Warm-Starting Neural Network Training in Stationary Settings without Loss of Plasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Warm-starting neural network training by initializing networks with previously learned weights is appealing, as practical neural networks are often deployed under a continuous influx of new data. However, it often leads to loss of plasticity, where the network loses its ability to learn new information, resulting in worse generalization than training from scratch. This occurs even under stationary data distributions, and its underlying mechanism is poorly understood. We develop a framework emulating real-world neural network training and identify noise memorization as the primary cause of plasticity loss when warm-starting on stationary data. Motivated by this, we propose Direction-Aware SHrinking (DASH), a method aiming to mitigate plasticity loss by selectively forgetting memorized noise while preserving learned features. e validate our approach on vision tasks, demonstrating improvements in test accuracy and training efficiency.</description>

Abstract: Reinforcement learning utilizing kernel ridge regression to predict the expected value function represents a powerful method with great representational capacity. This setting is a highly versatile framework amenable to analytical results. We consider kernel-based function approximation for RL in the infinite horizon average reward setting, also referred to as the undiscounted setting. We propose an optimistic algorithm, similar to acquisition function based algorithms in the special case of bandits. We establish novel no-regret performance guarantees for our algorithm, under kernel-based modelling assumptions. Additionally, we derive a novel confidence interval for the kernel-based prediction of the expected value function, applicable across various RL problems.</description>

      <title>All or None: Identifiable Linear Properties of Next-token Predictors in Language Modeling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze identifiability as a possible explanation for the ubiquity of linear properties across language models, such as the vector difference between the representations of "easy" and "easiest" being parallel to that between "lucky" and "luckiest". For this, we ask whether finding a linear property in one model implies that any model that induces the same distribution has that property, too. To answer that, we first prove an identifiability result to characterize distribution-equivalent next-token predictors, lifting a diversity requirement of previous results. Second, based on a refinement of relational linearity [Paccanaro and Hinton, 2001; Hernandez et al., 2024], we show how many notions of linearity are amenable to our analysis. Finally, we show that under suitable conditions, these linear properties either hold in all or none distribution-equivalent next-token predictors.</description>

      <title>Learning to Achieve Goals with Belief State Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the "Belief State Transformer", a next-token predictor that takes both a prefix and suffix as inputs, with a novel objective of predicting both the next token for the prefix and the previous token for the suffix. The Belief State Transformer effectively learns to solve challenging problems that conventional forward-only transformers struggle with, in a domain-independent fashion. Key to this success is learning a compact belief state that captures all relevant information necessary for accurate predictions. Empirical ablations show that each component of the model is essential in difficult scenarios where standard Transformers fall short. For the task of story writing with known prefixes and suffixes, our approach outperforms the Fill-in-the-Middle method for reaching known goals and demonstrates improved performance even when the goals are unknown. Altogether, the Belief State Transformer enables more efficient goal-conditioned decoding, better test-time inference, and high-quality text representations on small scale problems.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Strategy Planning for Efficient Question Answering with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Research has shown the effectiveness of reasoning (e.g., Chain-of-Thought), planning (e.g., SelfAsk), and retrieval augmented generation strategies to improve the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) on various tasks, such as question answering. However, using a single fixed strategy to answer different kinds of questions is suboptimal in performance and inefficient in terms of generated output tokens and performed retrievals. In our work, we propose a novel technique DyPlan, to induce a dynamic strategy selection process in LLMs, to improve performance and reduce costs in question-answering. DyPlan incorporates an initial decision step to select the most suitable strategy conditioned on the input question and guides the LLM's response generation accordingly. We extend DyPlan to DyPlan-verify, adding an internal verification and correction process to further enrich the generated answer. Experiments on three prominent multi-hop question answering (MHQA) datasets reveal how DyPlan can improve model performance by 7-13% while reducing the cost by 11-32% relative to the best baseline model.</description>

      <title>LEAF: Learning and Evaluation Augmented by Fact-Checking to Improve Factualness in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in various natural language processing tasks, yet they often struggle with maintaining factual accuracy, particularly in knowledge-intensive domains like healthcare. This study introduces LEAF: Learning and Evaluation Augmented by Fact-Checking, a novel approach designed to enhance the factual reliability of LLMs, with a focus on medical question answering (QA). LEAF utilizes a dual strategy to enhance the factual accuracy of responses from models such as Llama 3 70B Instruct and Llama 3 8B Instruct. The first strategy, Fact-Check-Then-RAG, improves Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by incorporating fact-checking results to guide the retrieval process without updating model parameters. The second strategy, Learning from Fact-Checks via Self-Training, involves supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on fact-checked responses or applying Simple Preference Optimization (SimPO) with fact-checking as a ranking mechanism, both updating LLM parameters from supervision. These findings suggest that integrating fact-checked responses whether through RAG enhancement or self-training enhances the reliability and factual correctness of LLM outputs, offering a promising solution for applications where information accuracy is crucial.</description>

      <title>There and Back Again: On the relation between noises, images, and their inversions in diffusion models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) achieve state-of-the-art performance in synthesizing new images from random noise, but they lack meaningful latent space that encodes data into features. Recent DDPM-based editing techniques try to mitigate this issue by inverting images back to their approximated staring noise. In this work, we study the relation between the initial Gaussian noise, the samples generated from it, and their corresponding latent encodings obtained through the inversion procedure. First, we interpret their spatial distance relations to show the inaccuracy of the DDIM inversion technique by localizing latent representations manifold between the initial noise and generated samples. Then, we demonstrate the peculiar relation between initial Gaussian noise and its corresponding generations during diffusion training, showing that the high-level features of generated images stabilize rapidly, keeping the spatial distance relationship between noises and generations consistent throughout the training.</description>

      <title>Simulating User Agents for Embodied Conversational-AI</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Embodied agents designed to assist users with tasks must engage in natural language interactions, interpret instructions, execute actions, and communicate effectively to resolve issues. However, collecting large-scale, diverse datasets of situated human-robot dialogues to train and evaluate such agents is expensive, labor-intensive, and time-consuming. To address this challenge, we propose building a large language model (LLM)-based user agent that can simulate user behavior during interactions with an embodied agent in a virtual environment. Given a user goal (e.g., make breakfast), at each time step, the user agent may observe" the robot actions or speak" to either intervene with the robot or answer questions. Such a user agent assists in improving the scalability and efficiency of embodied dialogues dataset generation and is critical for enhancing and evaluating the robot's interaction and task completion ability, as well as for research in reinforcement learning using AI feedback. We evaluate our user agent's ability to generate human-like behaviors by comparing its simulated dialogues with the TEACh dataset. We perform three experiments: zero-shot prompting to predict dialogue acts, few-shot prompting, and fine-tuning on the TEACh training subset. Results show the LLM-based user agent achieves an F-measure of 42% with zero-shot prompting and 43.4% with few-shot prompting in mimicking human speaking behavior. Through fine-tuning, performance in deciding when to speak remained stable, while deciding what to say improved from 51.1% to 62.5%. These findings showcase the feasibility of the proposed approach for assessing and enhancing the effectiveness of robot task completion through natural language communication.</description>

      <title>ALISE: Accelerating Large Language Model Serving with Speculative Scheduling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) represent a revolutionary advancement in the contemporary landscape of artificial general intelligence (AGI). As exemplified by ChatGPT, LLM-based applications necessitate minimal response latency and maximal throughput for inference serving. However, due to the unpredictability of LLM execution, the first-come-first-serve (FCFS) scheduling policy employed by current LLM serving systems suffers from head-of-line (HoL) blocking issues and long job response times.
  In this paper, we propose a new efficient LLM inference serving framework, named ALISE. The key design paradigm of ALISE is to leverage a novel speculative scheduler by estimating the execution time for each job and exploiting such prior knowledge to assign appropriate job priority orders, thus minimizing potential queuing delays for heterogeneous workloads. Furthermore, to mitigate the memory overhead of the intermediate key-value (KV) cache, we employ a priority-based adaptive memory management protocol and quantization-based compression techniques. Evaluations demonstrate that in comparison to the state-of-the-art solution vLLM, ALISE improves the throughput of inference serving by up to 1.8x and 2.1x under the same latency constraint on the Alpaca and ShareGPT datasets, respectively.</description>

      <title>From Context to Action: Analysis of the Impact of State Representation and Context on the Generalization of Multi-Turn Web Navigation Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Model (LLM)-based frameworks have extended their capabilities to complex real-world applications, such as interactive web navigation. These systems, driven by user commands, navigate web browsers to complete tasks through multi-turn dialogues, offering both innovative opportunities and significant challenges. Despite the introduction of benchmarks for conversational web navigation, a detailed understanding of the key contextual components that influence the performance of these agents remains elusive. This study aims to fill this gap by analyzing the various contextual elements crucial to the functioning of web navigation agents. We investigate the optimization of context management, focusing on the influence of interaction history and web page representation. Our work highlights improved agent performance across out-of-distribution scenarios, including unseen websites, categories, and geographic locations through effective context management. These findings provide insights into the design and optimization of LLM-based agents, enabling more accurate and effective web navigation in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Transferable Ensemble Black-box Jailbreak Attacks on Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this report, we propose a novel black-box jailbreak attacking framework that incorporates various LLM-as-Attacker methods to deliver transferable and powerful jailbreak attacks. Our method is designed based on three key observations from existing jailbreaking studies and practices. First, we consider an ensemble approach should be more effective in exposing the vulnerabilities of an aligned LLM compared to individual attacks. Second, different malicious instructions inherently vary in their jailbreaking difficulty, necessitating differentiated treatment to ensure more efficient attacks. Finally, the semantic coherence of a malicious instruction is crucial for triggering the defenses of an aligned LLM; therefore, it must be carefully disrupted to manipulate its embedding representation, thereby increasing the jailbreak success rate. We validated our approach by participating in the Competition for LLM and Agent Safety 2024, where our team achieved top performance in the Jailbreaking Attack Track.</description>

      <title>MS-Glance: Non-semantic context vectors and the applications in supervising image reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-semantic context information is crucial for visual recognition, as the human visual perception system first uses global statistics to process scenes rapidly before identifying specific objects. However, while semantic information is increasingly incorporated into computer vision tasks such as image reconstruction, non-semantic information, such as global spatial structures, is often overlooked. To bridge the gap, we propose a biologically informed non-semantic context descriptor, \textbf{MS-Glance}, along with the Glance Index Measure for comparing two images. A Global Glance vector is formulated by randomly retrieving pixels based on a perception-driven rule from an image to form a vector representing non-semantic global context, while a local Glance vector is a flattened local image window, mimicking a zoom-in observation. The Glance Index is defined as the inner product of two standardized sets of Glance vectors. We evaluate the effectiveness of incorporating Glance supervision in two reconstruction tasks: image fitting with implicit neural representation (INR) and undersampled MRI reconstruction. Extensive experimental results show that MS-Glance outperforms existing image restoration losses across both natural and medical images. The code is available at \url{https://github.com/Z7Gao/MSGlance}.</description>

      <title>Automating Quantum Software Maintenance: Flakiness Detection and Root Cause Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flaky tests, which pass or fail inconsistently without code changes, are a major challenge in software engineering in general and in quantum software engineering in particular due to their complexity and probabilistic nature, leading to hidden issues and wasted developer effort.
  We aim to create an automated framework to detect flaky tests in quantum software and an extended dataset of quantum flaky tests, overcoming the limitations of manual methods.
  Building on prior manual analysis of 14 quantum software repositories, we expanded the dataset and automated flaky test detection using transformers and cosine similarity. We conducted experiments with Large Language Models (LLMs) from the OpenAI GPT and Meta LLaMA families to assess their ability to detect and classify flaky tests from code and issue descriptions.
  Embedding transformers proved effective: we identified 25 new flaky tests, expanding the dataset by 54%. Top LLMs achieved an F1-score of 0.8871 for flakiness detection but only 0.5839 for root cause identification.
  We introduced an automated flaky test detection framework using machine learning, showing promising results but highlighting the need for improved root cause detection and classification in large quantum codebases. Future work will focus on improving detection techniques and developing automatic flaky test fixes.</description>

      <title>How Do Flow Matching Models Memorize and Generalize in Sample Data Subspaces?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real-world data is often assumed to lie within a low-dimensional structure embedded in high-dimensional space. In practical settings, we observe only a finite set of samples, forming what we refer to as the sample data subspace. It serves an essential approximation supporting tasks such as dimensionality reduction and generation. A major challenge lies in whether generative models can reliably synthesize samples that stay within this subspace rather than drifting away from the underlying structure. In this work, we provide theoretical insights into this challenge by leveraging Flow Matching models, which transform a simple prior into a complex target distribution via a learned velocity field. By treating the real data distribution as discrete, we derive analytical expressions for the optimal velocity field under a Gaussian prior, showing that generated samples memorize real data points and represent the sample data subspace exactly. To generalize to suboptimal scenarios, we introduce the Orthogonal Subspace Decomposition Network (OSDNet), which systematically decomposes the velocity field into subspace and off-subspace components. Our analysis shows that the off-subspace component decays, while the subspace component generalizes within the sample data subspace, ensuring generated samples preserve both proximity and diversity.</description>

      <title>Using Structural Similarity and Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks for Anatomical Embedding of 3-hinge Gyrus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The 3-hinge gyrus (3HG) is a newly defined folding pattern, which is the conjunction of gyri coming from three directions in cortical folding. Many studies demonstrated that 3HGs can be reliable nodes when constructing brain networks or connectome since they simultaneously possess commonality and individuality across different individual brains and populations. However, 3HGs are identified and validated within individual spaces, making it difficult to directly serve as the brain network nodes due to the absence of cross-subject correspondence. The 3HG correspondences represent the intrinsic regulation of brain organizational architecture, traditional image-based registration methods tend to fail because individual anatomical properties need to be fully respected. To address this challenge, we propose a novel self-supervised framework for anatomical feature embedding of the 3HGs to build the correspondences among different brains. The core component of this framework is to construct a structural similarity-enhanced multi-hop feature encoding strategy based on the recently developed Kolmogorov-Arnold network (KAN) for anatomical feature embedding. Extensive experiments suggest that our approach can effectively establish robust cross-subject correspondences when no one-to-one mapping exists.</description>

      <title>Posture-Informed Muscular Force Learning for Robust Hand Pressure Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present PiMForce, a novel framework that enhances hand pressure estimation by leveraging 3D hand posture information to augment forearm surface electromyography (sEMG) signals. Our approach utilizes detailed spatial information from 3D hand poses in conjunction with dynamic muscle activity from sEMG to enable accurate and robust whole-hand pressure measurements under diverse hand-object interactions. We also developed a multimodal data collection system that combines a pressure glove, an sEMG armband, and a markerless finger-tracking module. We created a comprehensive dataset from 21 participants, capturing synchronized data of hand posture, sEMG signals, and exerted hand pressure across various hand postures and hand-object interaction scenarios using our collection system. Our framework enables precise hand pressure estimation in complex and natural interaction scenarios. Our approach substantially mitigates the limitations of traditional sEMG-based or vision-based methods by integrating 3D hand posture information with sEMG signals. Video demos, data, and code are available online.</description>

Abstract: Emerging research in Pluralistic Artificial Intelligence (AI) alignment seeks to address how intelligent systems can be designed and deployed in accordance with diverse human needs and values. We contribute to this pursuit with a dynamic approach for aligning AI with diverse and shifting user preferences through Multi Objective Reinforcement Learning (MORL), via post-learning policy selection adjustment. In this paper, we introduce the proposed framework for this approach, outline its anticipated advantages and assumptions, and discuss technical details about the implementation. We also examine the broader implications of adopting a retroactive alignment approach through the sociotechnical systems perspective.</description>

Abstract: We introduce anytime constraints to the multi-agent setting with the corresponding solution concept being anytime-constrained equilibrium (ACE). Then, we present a comprehensive theory of anytime-constrained Markov games, which includes (1) a computational characterization of feasible policies, (2) a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm for computing ACE, and (3) a polynomial-time algorithm for approximately computing feasible ACE. Since computing a feasible policy is NP-hard even for two-player zero-sum games, our approximation guarantees are the best possible under worst-case analysis. We also develop the first theory of efficient computation for action-constrained Markov games, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD), a degenerative disorder of the central nervous system, is commonly diagnosed using functional medical imaging techniques such as single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). In this study, we utilized two SPECT data sets (n = 634 and n = 202) from different hospitals to develop a model capable of accurately predicting PD stages, a multiclass classification task. We used the entire three-dimensional (3D) brain images as input and experimented with various model architectures. Initially, we treated the 3D images as sequences of two-dimensional (2D) slices and fed them sequentially into 2D convolutional neural network (CNN) models pretrained on ImageNet, averaging the outputs to obtain the final predicted stage. We also applied 3D CNN models pretrained on Kinetics-400. Additionally, we incorporated an attention mechanism to account for the varying importance of different slices in the prediction process. To further enhance model efficacy and robustness, we simultaneously trained the two data sets using weight sharing, a technique known as cotraining. Our results demonstrated that 2D models pretrained on ImageNet outperformed 3D models pretrained on Kinetics-400, and models utilizing the attention mechanism outperformed both 2D and 3D models. The cotraining technique proved effective in improving model performance when the cotraining data sets were sufficiently large.</description>

      <title>Kernel Looping: Eliminating Synchronization Boundaries for Peak Inference Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Token generation speed is critical to power the next wave of AI inference applications. GPUs significantly underperform during token generation due to synchronization overheads at kernel boundaries, utilizing only 21% of their peak memory bandwidth. While recent dataflow architectures mitigate these overheads by enabling aggressive fusion of decoder layers into a single kernel, they too leave performance on the table due to synchronization penalties at layer boundaries.
  This paper presents kernel looping, a specialized global optimization technique which exploits an optimization opportunity brought by combining the unique layer-level fusion possible in modern dataflow architectures with the repeated layer structure found in language models. Kernel looping eliminates synchronization costs between consecutive calls to the same kernel by transforming these calls into a single call to a modified kernel containing a pipelined outer loop. We evaluate kernel looping on the SambaNova SN40L Reconfigurable Dataflow Unit (RDU), a commercial dataflow accelerator for AI. Experiments demonstrate that kernel looping speeds up the decode phase of a wide array of powerful open-source models by up to 2.2$\times$ on SN40L. Kernel looping allows scaling of decode performance over multiple SN40L sockets, achieving speedups of up to 2.5$\times$. Finally, kernel looping enables SN40L to achieve over 90% of peak performance on 8 and 16 sockets and achieve a speedup of up to 3.7$\times$ over DGX H100. Kernel looping, as well as the models evaluated in this paper, are deployed in production in a commercial AI inference cloud.</description>

      <title>Provable Benefit of Cutout and CutMix for Feature Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Patch-level data augmentation techniques such as Cutout and CutMix have demonstrated significant efficacy in enhancing the performance of vision tasks. However, a comprehensive theoretical understanding of these methods remains elusive. In this paper, we study two-layer neural networks trained using three distinct methods: vanilla training without augmentation, Cutout training, and CutMix training. Our analysis focuses on a feature-noise data model, which consists of several label-dependent features of varying rarity and label-independent noises of differing strengths. Our theorems demonstrate that Cutout training can learn low-frequency features that vanilla training cannot, while CutMix training can learn even rarer features that Cutout cannot capture. From this, we establish that CutMix yields the highest test accuracy among the three. Our novel analysis reveals that CutMix training makes the network learn all features and noise vectors "evenly" regardless of the rarity and strength, which provides an interesting insight into understanding patch-level augmentation.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Inverse Reinforcement Learning: from Data Alignment to Task Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many imitation learning (IL) algorithms use inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) to infer a reward function that aligns with the demonstration. However, the inferred reward functions often fail to capture the underlying task objectives. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for IRL-based IL that prioritizes task alignment over conventional data alignment. Our framework is a semi-supervised approach that leverages expert demonstrations as weak supervision to derive a set of candidate reward functions that align with the task rather than only with the data. It then adopts an adversarial mechanism to train a policy with this set of reward functions to gain a collective validation of the policy's ability to accomplish the task. We provide theoretical insights into this framework's ability to mitigate task-reward misalignment and present a practical implementation. Our experimental results show that our framework outperforms conventional IL baselines in complex and transfer learning scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: \textbf{Trial design} Crossover randomized controlled trial. \textbf{Methods} An AI tool, Easy-ICD, was developed to assist clinical coders and was tested for improving both accuracy and time in a user study in Norway and Sweden. Participants were randomly assigned to two groups, and crossed over between coding complex (longer) texts versus simple (shorter) texts, while using our tool versus not using our tool. \textbf{Results} Based on Mann-Whitney U test, the median coding time difference for complex clinical text sequences was 123 seconds (\emph{P}\textless.001, 95\% CI: 81 to 164), representing a 46\% reduction in median coding time when our tool is used. There was no significant time difference for simpler text sequences. For coding accuracy, the improvement we noted for both complex and simple texts was not significant. \textbf{Conclusions} This study demonstrates the potential of AI to transform common tasks in clinical workflows, with ostensible positive impacts on work efficiencies for complex clinical coding tasks. Further studies within hospital workflows are required before these presumed impacts can be more clearly understood.</description>

      <title>What Happened in LLMs Layers when Trained for Fast vs. Slow Thinking: A Gradient Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: What makes a difference in the post-training of LLMs? We investigate the training patterns of different layers in large language models (LLMs), through the lens of gradient, when training with different responses and initial models. We are specifically interested in how fast vs. slow thinking affects the layer-wise gradients, given the recent popularity of training LLMs on reasoning paths such as chain-of-thoughts (CoT) and process rewards. In our study, fast thinking without CoT leads to larger gradients and larger differences of gradients across layers than slow thinking (Detailed CoT), indicating the learning stability brought by the latter. Moreover, pre-trained LLMs are less affected by the instability of fast thinking than instruction-tuned LLMs. Additionally, we study whether the gradient patterns can reflect the correctness of responses when training different LLMs using slow vs. fast thinking paths. The results show that the gradients of slow thinking can distinguish correct and irrelevant reasoning paths. As a comparison, we conduct similar gradient analyses on non-reasoning knowledge learning tasks, on which, however, trivially increasing the response length does not lead to similar behaviors of slow thinking. Our study strengthens fundamental understandings of LLM training and sheds novel insights on its efficiency and stability, which pave the way towards building a generalizable System-2 agent. Our code, data, and gradient statistics can be found in: https://github.com/MingLiiii/Layer_Gradient.</description>

      <title>Syno: Structured Synthesis for Neural Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The desires for better prediction accuracy and higher execution performance in neural networks never end. Neural architecture search (NAS) and tensor compilers are two popular techniques to optimize these two goals, but they are both limited to composing or optimizing existing manually designed operators rather than coming up with completely new designs. In this work, we explore the less studied direction of neural operator synthesis, which aims to automatically and efficiently discover novel neural operators with better accuracy and/or speed. We develop an end-to-end framework Syno, to realize practical neural operator synthesis. Syno makes use of a novel set of fine-grained primitives defined on tensor dimensions, which ensure various desired properties to ease model training, and also enable expression canonicalization techniques to avoid redundant candidates during search. Syno further adopts a novel guided synthesis flow to obtain valid operators matched with the specified input/output dimension sizes, and leverages efficient stochastic tree search algorithms to quickly explore the design space. We demonstrate that Syno discovers better operators with an average of $2.06\times$ speedup and less than $1\%$ accuracy loss, even on NAS-optimized models.</description>

      <title>DetectRL: Benchmarking LLM-Generated Text Detection in Real-World Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detecting text generated by large language models (LLMs) is of great recent interest. With zero-shot methods like DetectGPT, detection capabilities have reached impressive levels. However, the reliability of existing detectors in real-world applications remains underexplored. In this study, we present a new benchmark, DetectRL, highlighting that even state-of-the-art (SOTA) detection techniques still underperformed in this task. We collected human-written datasets from domains where LLMs are particularly prone to misuse. Using popular LLMs, we generated data that better aligns with real-world applications. Unlike previous studies, we employed heuristic rules to create adversarial LLM-generated text, simulating advanced prompt usages, human revisions like word substitutions, and writing errors. Our development of DetectRL reveals the strengths and limitations of current SOTA detectors. More importantly, we analyzed the potential impact of writing styles, model types, attack methods, the text lengths, and real-world human writing factors on different types of detectors. We believe DetectRL could serve as an effective benchmark for assessing detectors in real-world scenarios, evolving with advanced attack methods, thus providing more stressful evaluation to drive the development of more efficient detectors. Data and code are publicly available at: https://github.com/NLP2CT/DetectRL.</description>

      <title>Exploring Consistency in Graph Representations:from Graph Kernels to Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a dominant approach in graph representation learning, yet they often struggle to capture consistent similarity relationships among graphs. While graph kernel methods such as the Weisfeiler-Lehman subtree (WL-subtree) and Weisfeiler-Lehman optimal assignment (WLOA) kernels are effective in capturing similarity relationships, they rely heavily on predefined kernels and lack sufficient non-linearity for more complex data patterns. Our work aims to bridge the gap between neural network methods and kernel approaches by enabling GNNs to consistently capture relational structures in their learned representations. Given the analogy between the message-passing process of GNNs and WL algorithms, we thoroughly compare and analyze the properties of WL-subtree and WLOA kernels. We find that the similarities captured by WLOA at different iterations are asymptotically consistent, ensuring that similar graphs remain similar in subsequent iterations, thereby leading to superior performance over the WL-subtree kernel. Inspired by these findings, we conjecture that the consistency in the similarities of graph representations across GNN layers is crucial in capturing relational structures and enhancing graph classification performance. Thus, we propose a loss to enforce the similarity of graph representations to be consistent across different layers. Our empirical analysis verifies our conjecture and shows that our proposed consistency loss can significantly enhance graph classification performance across several GNN backbones on various datasets.</description>

Abstract: Transformer-based architectures have achieved remarkable success in natural language processing and computer vision. However, their performance in multivariate long-term forecasting often lags behind simpler linear baselines. Previous studies have identified the traditional attention mechanism as a significant factor contributing to this limitation. To unlock the full potential of transformers for multivariate time series forecasting, I introduce \textbf{LSEAttention}, an approach designed to address entropy collapse and training instability commonly observed in transformer models. I validate the effectiveness of LSEAttention across various real-world multivariate time series datasets, demonstrating that it not only outperforms existing time series transformer models but also exceeds the performance of some state-of-the-art models on specific datasets.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Chess Reinforcement Learning with Graph Representation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mastering games is a hard task, as games can be extremely complex, and still fundamentally different in structure from one another. While the AlphaZero algorithm has demonstrated an impressive ability to learn the rules and strategy of a large variety of games, ranging from Go and Chess, to Atari games, its reliance on extensive computational resources and rigid Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture limits its adaptability and scalability. A model trained to play on a $19\times 19$ Go board cannot be used to play on a smaller $13\times 13$ board, despite the similarity between the two Go variants. In this paper, we focus on Chess, and explore using a more generic Graph-based Representation of a game state, rather than a grid-based one, to introduce a more general architecture based on Graph Neural Networks (GNN). We also expand the classical Graph Attention Network (GAT) layer to incorporate edge-features, to naturally provide a generic policy output format. Our experiments, performed on smaller networks than the initial AlphaZero paper, show that this new architecture outperforms previous architectures with a similar number of parameters, being able to increase playing strength an order of magnitude faster. We also show that the model, when trained on a smaller $5\times 5$ variant of chess, is able to be quickly fine-tuned to play on regular $8\times 8$ chess, suggesting that this approach yields promising generalization abilities.

      <title>The Potential of LLMs in Medical Education: Generating Questions and Answers for Qualification Exams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent research on large language models (LLMs) has primarily focused on their adaptation and application in specialized domains. The application of LLMs in the medical field is mainly concentrated on tasks such as the automation of medical report generation, summarization, diagnostic reasoning, and question-and-answer interactions between doctors and patients. The challenge of becoming a good teacher is more formidable than that of becoming a good student, and this study pioneers the application of LLMs in the field of medical education. In this work, we investigate the extent to which LLMs can generate medical qualification exam questions and corresponding answers based on few-shot prompts. Utilizing a real-world Chinese dataset of elderly chronic diseases, we tasked the LLMs with generating open-ended questions and answers based on a subset of sampled admission reports across eight widely used LLMs, including ERNIE 4, ChatGLM 4, Doubao, Hunyuan, Spark 4, Qwen, Llama 3, and Mistral. Furthermore, we engaged medical experts to manually evaluate these open-ended questions and answers across multiple dimensions. The study found that LLMs, after using few-shot prompts, can effectively mimic real-world medical qualification exam questions, whereas there is room for improvement in the correctness, evidence-based statements, and professionalism of the generated answers. Moreover, LLMs also demonstrate a decent level of ability to correct and rectify reference answers. Given the immense potential of artificial intelligence in the medical field, the task of generating questions and answers for medical qualification exams aimed at medical students, interns and residents can be a significant focus of future research.</description>

      <title>Driving by the Rules: A Benchmark for Integrating Traffic Sign Regulations into Vectorized HD Map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ensuring adherence to traffic sign regulations is essential for both human and autonomous vehicle navigation. While current benchmark datasets concentrate on lane perception or basic traffic sign recognition, they often overlook the intricate task of integrating these regulations into lane operations. Addressing this gap, we introduce MapDR, a novel dataset designed for the extraction of Driving Rules from traffic signs and their association with vectorized, locally perceived HD Maps. MapDR features over 10,000 annotated video clips that capture the intricate correlation between traffic sign regulations and lanes. We define two pivotal sub-tasks: 1) Rule Extraction from Traffic Sign, which accurately deciphers regulatory instructions, and 2) Rule-Lane Correspondence Reasoning, which aligns these rules with their respective lanes. Built upon this benchmark, we provide a multimodal solution that offers a strong baseline for advancing autonomous driving technologies. It fills a critical gap in the integration of traffic sign rules, contributing to the development of reliable autonomous navigation systems.</description>

      <title>EDT: An Efficient Diffusion Transformer Framework Inspired by Human-like Sketching</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transformer-based Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) have shown more potential than CNN-based DPMs, yet their extensive computational requirements hinder widespread practical applications. To reduce the computation budget of transformer-based DPMs, this work proposes the Efficient Diffusion Transformer (EDT) framework. The framework includes a lightweight-design diffusion model architecture, and a training-free Attention Modulation Matrix and its alternation arrangement in EDT inspired by human-like sketching. Additionally, we propose a token relation-enhanced masking training strategy tailored explicitly for EDT to augment its token relation learning capability. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of EDT. The EDT framework reduces training and inference costs and surpasses existing transformer-based diffusion models in image synthesis performance, thereby achieving a significant overall enhancement. With lower FID, EDT-S, EDT-B, and EDT-XL attained speed-ups of 3.93x, 2.84x, and 1.92x respectively in the training phase, and 2.29x, 2.29x, and 2.22x respectively in inference, compared to the corresponding sizes of MDTv2.

      <title>Improving snore detection under limited dataset through harmonic/percussive source separation and convolutional neural networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Snoring, an acoustic biomarker commonly observed in individuals with Obstructive Sleep Apnoea Syndrome (OSAS), holds significant potential for diagnosing and monitoring this recognized clinical disorder. Irrespective of snoring types, most snoring instances exhibit identifiable harmonic patterns manifested through distinctive energy distributions over time. In this work, we propose a novel method to differentiate monaural snoring from non-snoring sounds by analyzing the harmonic content of the input sound using harmonic/percussive sound source separation (HPSS). The resulting feature, based on the harmonic spectrogram from HPSS, is employed as input data for conventional neural network architectures, aiming to enhance snoring detection performance even under a limited data learning framework. To evaluate the performance of our proposal, we studied two different scenarios: 1) using a large dataset of snoring and interfering sounds, and 2) using a reduced training set composed of around 1% of the data material. In the former scenario, the proposed HPSS-based feature provides competitive results compared to other input features from the literature. However, the key advantage of the proposed method lies in the superior performance of the harmonic spectrogram derived from HPSS in a limited data learning context. In this particular scenario, using the proposed harmonic feature significantly enhances the performance of all the studied architectures in comparison to the classical input features documented in the existing literature. This finding clearly demonstrates that incorporating harmonic content enables more reliable learning of the essential time-frequency characteristics that are prevalent in most snoring sounds, even in scenarios where the amount of training data is limited.</description>

Abstract: We introduce the Continuous Arcade Learning Environment (CALE), an extension of the well-known Arcade Learning Environment (ALE) [Bellemare et al., 2013]. The CALE uses the same underlying emulator of the Atari 2600 gaming system (Stella), but adds support for continuous actions. This enables the benchmarking and evaluation of continuous-control agents (such as PPO [Schulman et al., 2017] and SAC [Haarnoja et al., 2018]) and value-based agents (such as DQN [Mnih et al., 2015] and Rainbow [Hessel et al., 2018]) on the same environment suite. We provide a series of open questions and research directions that CALE enables, as well as initial baseline results using Soft Actor-Critic. CALE is available as part of the ALE athttps://github.com/Farama-Foundation/Arcade-Learning-Environment.</description>

      <title>The NPU-HWC System for the ISCSLP 2024 Inspirational and Convincing Audio Generation Challenge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the NPU-HWC system submitted to the ISCSLP 2024 Inspirational and Convincing Audio Generation Challenge 2024 (ICAGC). Our system consists of two modules: a speech generator for Track 1 and a background audio generator for Track 2. In Track 1, we employ Single-Codec to tokenize the speech into discrete tokens and use a language-model-based approach to achieve zero-shot speaking style cloning. The Single-Codec effectively decouples timbre and speaking style at the token level, reducing the acoustic modeling burden on the autoregressive language model. Additionally, we use DSPGAN to upsample 16 kHz mel-spectrograms to high-fidelity 48 kHz waveforms. In Track 2, we propose a background audio generator based on large language models (LLMs). This system produces scene-appropriate accompaniment descriptions, synthesizes background audio with Tango 2, and integrates it with the speech generated by our Track 1 system. Our submission achieves the second place and the first place in Track 1 and Track 2 respectively.</description>

      <title>Disentangling Disentangled Representations: Towards Improved Latent Units via Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Disentangled representation learning (DRL) aims to break down observed data into core intrinsic factors for a profound understanding of the data. In real-world scenarios, manually defining and labeling these factors are non-trivial, making unsupervised methods attractive. Recently, there have been limited explorations of utilizing diffusion models (DMs), which are already mainstream in generative modeling, for unsupervised DRL. They implement their own inductive bias to ensure that each latent unit input to the DM expresses only one distinct factor. In this context, we design Dynamic Gaussian Anchoring to enforce attribute-separated latent units for more interpretable DRL. This unconventional inductive bias explicitly delineates the decision boundaries between attributes while also promoting the independence among latent units. Additionally, we also propose Skip Dropout technique, which easily modifies the denoising U-Net to be more DRL-friendly, addressing its uncooperative nature with the disentangling feature extractor. Our methods, which carefully consider the latent unit semantics and the distinct DM structure, enhance the practicality of DM-based disentangled representations, demonstrating state-of-the-art disentanglement performance on both synthetic and real data, as well as advantages in downstream tasks.</description>

      <title>Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning Medical Multimodal Large Language Models for Medical Visual Grounding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) inherit the superior text understanding capabilities of LLMs and extend these capabilities to multimodal scenarios. These models achieve excellent results in the general domain of multimodal tasks. However, in the medical domain, the substantial training costs and the requirement for extensive medical data pose challenges to the development of medical MLLMs. Furthermore, due to the free-text form of answers, tasks such as visual grounding that need to produce output in a prescribed form become difficult for MLLMs. So far, there have been no medical MLLMs works in medical visual grounding area. For the medical vision grounding task, which involves identifying locations in medical images based on short text descriptions, we propose Parameter-efficient Fine-tuning medical multimodal large language models for Medcial Visual Grounding (PFMVG). To validate the performance of the model, we evaluate it on a public benchmark dataset for medical visual grounding, where it achieves competitive results, and significantly outperforming GPT-4v. Our code will be open sourced after peer review.</description>

      <title>GlotCC: An Open Broad-Coverage CommonCrawl Corpus and Pipeline for Minority Languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The need for large text corpora has increased with the advent of pretrained language models and, in particular, the discovery of scaling laws for these models. Most available corpora have sufficient data only for languages with large dominant communities. However, there is no corpus available that (i) covers a wide range of minority languages; (ii) is generated by an open-source reproducible pipeline; and (iii) is rigorously cleaned from noise, making it trustworthy to use. We present GlotCC, a clean, document-level, 2TB general domain corpus derived from CommonCrawl, covering more than 1000 languages. We make GlotCC and the system used to generate it - including the pipeline, language identification model, and filters - available to the research community.

      <title>Counterfactual MRI Data Augmentation using Conditional Denoising Diffusion Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning (DL) models in medical imaging face challenges in generalizability and robustness due to variations in image acquisition parameters (IAP). In this work, we introduce a novel method using conditional denoising diffusion generative models (cDDGMs) to generate counterfactual magnetic resonance (MR) images that simulate different IAP without altering patient anatomy. We demonstrate that using these counterfactual images for data augmentation can improve segmentation accuracy, particularly in out-of-distribution settings, enhancing the overall generalizability and robustness of DL models across diverse imaging conditions. Our approach shows promise in addressing domain and covariate shifts in medical imaging.

      <title>Auditing Google's Search Algorithm: Measuring News Diversity Across Brazil, the UK, and the US</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study examines the influence of Google's search algorithm on news diversity by analyzing search results in Brazil, the UK, and the US. It explores how Google's system preferentially favors a limited number of news outlets. Utilizing algorithm auditing techniques, the research measures source concentration with the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) and Gini coefficient, revealing significant concentration trends. The study underscores the importance of conducting horizontal analyses across multiple search queries, as focusing solely on individual results pages may obscure these patterns. Factors such as popularity, political bias, and recency were evaluated for their impact on news rankings. Findings indicate a slight leftward bias in search outcomes and a preference for popular, often national outlets. This bias, combined with a tendency to prioritize recent content, suggests that Google's algorithm may reinforce existing media inequalities. By analyzing the largest dataset to date -- 221,863 search results -- this research provides comprehensive, longitudinal insights into how algorithms shape public access to diverse news sources.</description>

      <title>Commonsense Knowledge Editing Based on Free-Text in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Knowledge editing technology is crucial for maintaining the accuracy and timeliness of large language models (LLMs) . However, the setting of this task overlooks a significant portion of commonsense knowledge based on free-text in the real world, characterized by broad knowledge scope, long content and non instantiation. The editing objects of previous methods (e.g., MEMIT) were single token or entity, which were not suitable for commonsense knowledge in free-text form. To address the aforementioned challenges, we conducted experiments from two perspectives: knowledge localization and knowledge editing. Firstly, we introduced Knowledge Localization for Free-Text(KLFT) method, revealing the challenges associated with the distribution of commonsense knowledge in MLP and Attention layers, as well as in decentralized distribution. Next, we propose a Dynamics-aware Editing Method(DEM), which utilizes a Dynamics-aware Module to locate the parameter positions corresponding to commonsense knowledge, and uses Knowledge Editing Module to update knowledge. The DEM method fully explores the potential of the MLP and Attention layers, and successfully edits commonsense knowledge based on free-text. The experimental results indicate that the DEM can achieve excellent editing performance.</description>

      <title>RAGraph: A General Retrieval-Augmented Graph Learning Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become essential in interpreting relational data across various domains, yet, they often struggle to generalize to unseen graph data that differs markedly from training instances. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework called General Retrieval-Augmented Graph Learning (RAGraph), which brings external graph data into the general graph foundation model to improve model generalization on unseen scenarios. On the top of our framework is a toy graph vector library that we established, which captures key attributes, such as features and task-specific label information. During inference, the RAGraph adeptly retrieves similar toy graphs based on key similarities in downstream tasks, integrating the retrieved data to enrich the learning context via the message-passing prompting mechanism. Our extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that RAGraph significantly outperforms state-of-the-art graph learning methods in multiple tasks such as node classification, link prediction, and graph classification across both dynamic and static datasets. Furthermore, extensive testing confirms that RAGraph consistently maintains high performance without the need for task-specific fine-tuning, highlighting its adaptability, robustness, and broad applicability.</description>

      <title>'No' Matters: Out-of-Distribution Detection in Multimodality Long Dialogue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection in multimodal contexts is essential for identifying deviations in combined inputs from different modalities, particularly in applications like open-domain dialogue systems or real-life dialogue interactions. This paper aims to improve the user experience that involves multi-round long dialogues by efficiently detecting OOD dialogues and images. We introduce a novel scoring framework named Dialogue Image Aligning and Enhancing Framework (DIAEF) that integrates the visual language models with the novel proposed scores that detect OOD in two key scenarios (1) mismatches between the dialogue and image input pair and (2) input pairs with previously unseen labels. Our experimental results, derived from various benchmarks, demonstrate that integrating image and multi-round dialogue OOD detection is more effective with previously unseen labels than using either modality independently. In the presence of mismatched pairs, our proposed score effectively identifies these mismatches and demonstrates strong robustness in long dialogues. This approach enhances domain-aware, adaptive conversational agents and establishes baselines for future studies.</description>

      <title>GEPS: Boosting Generalization in Parametric PDE Neural Solvers through Adaptive Conditioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solving parametric partial differential equations (PDEs) presents significant challenges for data-driven methods due to the sensitivity of spatio-temporal dynamics to variations in PDE parameters. Machine learning approaches often struggle to capture this variability. To address this, data-driven approaches learn parametric PDEs by sampling a very large variety of trajectories with varying PDE parameters. We first show that incorporating conditioning mechanisms for learning parametric PDEs is essential and that among them, $\textit{adaptive conditioning}$, allows stronger generalization. As existing adaptive conditioning methods do not scale well with respect to the number of parameters to adapt in the neural solver, we propose GEPS, a simple adaptation mechanism to boost GEneralization in Pde Solvers via a first-order optimization and low-rank rapid adaptation of a small set of context parameters. We demonstrate the versatility of our approach for both fully data-driven and for physics-aware neural solvers. Validation performed on a whole range of spatio-temporal forecasting problems demonstrates excellent performance for generalizing to unseen conditions including initial conditions, PDE coefficients, forcing terms and solution domain. $\textit{Project page}$: https://geps-project.github.io</description>

      <title>Leveraging LLMs for MT in Crisis Scenarios: a blueprint for low-resource languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In an evolving landscape of crisis communication, the need for robust and adaptable Machine Translation (MT) systems is more pressing than ever, particularly for low-resource languages. This study presents a comprehensive exploration of leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multilingual LLMs (MLLMs) to enhance MT capabilities in such scenarios. By focusing on the unique challenges posed by crisis situations where speed, accuracy, and the ability to handle a wide range of languages are paramount, this research outlines a novel approach that combines the cutting-edge capabilities of LLMs with fine-tuning techniques and community-driven corpus development strategies. At the core of this study is the development and empirical evaluation of MT systems tailored for two low-resource language pairs, illustrating the process from initial model selection and fine-tuning through to deployment. Bespoke systems are developed and modelled on the recent Covid-19 pandemic. The research highlights the importance of community involvement in creating highly specialised, crisis-specific datasets and compares custom GPTs with NLLB-adapted MLLM models. It identifies fine-tuned MLLM models as offering superior performance compared with their LLM counterparts. A scalable and replicable model for rapid MT system development in crisis scenarios is outlined. Our approach enhances the field of humanitarian technology by offering a blueprint for developing multilingual communication systems during emergencies.</description>

      <title>AllClear: A Comprehensive Dataset and Benchmark for Cloud Removal in Satellite Imagery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Clouds in satellite imagery pose a significant challenge for downstream applications. A major challenge in current cloud removal research is the absence of a comprehensive benchmark and a sufficiently large and diverse training dataset. To address this problem, we introduce the largest public dataset -- $\textit{AllClear}$ for cloud removal, featuring 23,742 globally distributed regions of interest (ROIs) with diverse land-use patterns, comprising 4 million images in total. Each ROI includes complete temporal captures from the year 2022, with (1) multi-spectral optical imagery from Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8/9, (2) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery from Sentinel-1, and (3) auxiliary remote sensing products such as cloud masks and land cover maps. We validate the effectiveness of our dataset by benchmarking performance, demonstrating the scaling law -- the PSNR rises from $28.47$ to $33.87$ with $30\times$ more data, and conducting ablation studies on the temporal length and the importance of individual modalities. This dataset aims to provide comprehensive coverage of the Earth's surface and promote better cloud removal results.</description>

      <title>Efficient Inference and Computation of Optimal Alternatives for Preference Languages Based On Lexicographic Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyse preference inference, through consistency, for general preference languages based on lexicographic models. We identify a property, which we call strong compositionality, that applies for many natural kinds of preference statement, and that allows a greedy algorithm for determining consistency of a set of preference statements. We also consider different natural definitions of optimality, and their relations to each other, for general preference languages based on lexicographic models. Based on our framework, we show that testing consistency, and thus inference, is polynomial for a specific preference language LpqT, which allows strict and non-strict statements, comparisons between outcomes and between partial tuples, both ceteris paribus and strong statements, and their combination. Computing different kinds of optimal sets is also shown to be polynomial; this is backed up by our experimental results.</description>

      <title>Transformer-based Model Predictive Control: Trajectory Optimization via Sequence Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Model predictive control (MPC) has established itself as the primary methodology for constrained control, enabling general-purpose robot autonomy in diverse real-world scenarios. However, for most problems of interest, MPC relies on the recursive solution of highly non-convex trajectory optimization problems, leading to high computational complexity and strong dependency on initialization. In this work, we present a unified framework to combine the main strengths of optimization-based and learning-based methods for MPC. Our approach entails embedding high-capacity, transformer-based neural network models within the optimization process for trajectory generation, whereby the transformer provides a near-optimal initial guess, or target plan, to a non-convex optimization problem. Our experiments, performed in simulation and the real world onboard a free flyer platform, demonstrate the capabilities of our framework to improve MPC convergence and runtime. Compared to purely optimization-based approaches, results show that our approach can improve trajectory generation performance by up to 75%, reduce the number of solver iterations by up to 45%, and improve overall MPC runtime by 7x without loss in performance.</description>

      <title>BitStack: Fine-Grained Size Control for Compressed Large Language Models in Variable Memory Environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23918v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized numerous applications, yet their deployment remains challenged by memory constraints on local devices. While scaling laws have enhanced LLM capabilities, the primary bottleneck has shifted from \textit{capability} to \textit{availability}, emphasizing the need for efficient memory management. Traditional compression methods, such as quantization, often require predefined compression ratios and separate compression processes for each setting, complicating deployment in variable memory environments. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{BitStack}, a novel, training-free weight compression approach that enables megabyte-level trade-offs between memory usage and model performance. By leveraging weight decomposition, BitStack can dynamically adjust the model size with minimal transmission between running memory and storage devices. Our approach iteratively decomposes weight matrices while considering the significance of each parameter, resulting in an approximately 1-bit per parameter residual block in each decomposition iteration. These blocks are sorted and stacked in storage as basic transmission units, with different quantities loaded based on current memory availability. Extensive experiments across a wide range of tasks demonstrate that, despite offering fine-grained size control, BitStack consistently matches or surpasses strong quantization baselines, particularly at extreme compression ratios. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first decomposition-based method that effectively bridges the gap to practical compression techniques like quantization.

      <title>Towards Fast Algorithms for the Preference Consistency Problem Based on Hierarchical Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct and compare algorithmic approaches to solve the Preference Consistency Problem for preference statements based on hierarchical models. Instances of this problem contain a set of preference statements that are direct comparisons (strict and non-strict) between some alternatives, and a set of evaluation functions by which all alternatives can be rated. An instance is consistent based on hierarchical preference models, if there exists an hierarchical model on the evaluation functions that induces an order relation on the alternatives by which all relations given by the preference statements are satisfied. Deciding if an instance is consistent is known to be NP-complete for hierarchical models. We develop three approaches to solve this decision problem. The first involves a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) formulation, the other two are recursive algorithms that are based on properties of the problem by which the search space can be pruned. Our experiments on synthetic data show that the recursive algorithms are faster than solving the MILP formulation and that the ratio between the running times increases extremely quickly.</description>

      <title>Representative Social Choice: From Learning Theory to AI Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Social choice theory is the study of preference aggregation across a population, used both in mechanism design for human agents and in the democratic alignment of language models. In this study, we propose the representative social choice framework for the modeling of democratic representation in collective decisions, where the number of issues and individuals are too large for mechanisms to consider all preferences directly. These scenarios are widespread in real-world decision-making processes, such as jury trials, indirect elections, legislation processes, corporate governance, and, more recently, language model alignment. In representative social choice, the population is represented by a finite sample of individual-issue pairs based on which social choice decisions are made. We show that many of the deepest questions in representative social choice can be naturally formulated as statistical learning problems, and prove the generalization properties of social choice mechanisms using the theory of machine learning. We further formulate axioms for representative social choice, and prove Arrow-like impossibility theorems with new combinatorial tools of analysis. Our framework introduces the representative approach to social choice, opening up research directions at the intersection of social choice, learning theory, and AI alignment.</description>

      <title>Image Synthesis with Class-Aware Semantic Diffusion Models for Surgical Scene Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Surgical scene segmentation is essential for enhancing surgical precision, yet it is frequently compromised by the scarcity and imbalance of available data. To address these challenges, semantic image synthesis methods based on generative adversarial networks and diffusion models have been developed. However, these models often yield non-diverse images and fail to capture small, critical tissue classes, limiting their effectiveness. In response, we propose the Class-Aware Semantic Diffusion Model (CASDM), a novel approach which utilizes segmentation maps as conditions for image synthesis to tackle data scarcity and imbalance. Novel class-aware mean squared error and class-aware self-perceptual loss functions have been defined to prioritize critical, less visible classes, thereby enhancing image quality and relevance. Furthermore, to our knowledge, we are the first to generate multi-class segmentation maps using text prompts in a novel fashion to specify their contents. These maps are then used by CASDM to generate surgical scene images, enhancing datasets for training and validating segmentation models. Our evaluation, which assesses both image quality and downstream segmentation performance, demonstrates the strong effectiveness and generalisability of CASDM in producing realistic image-map pairs, significantly advancing surgical scene segmentation across diverse and challenging datasets.</description>

      <title>Localization, balance and affinity: a stronger multifaceted collaborative salient object detector in remote sensing images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite significant advancements in salient object detection(SOD) in optical remote sensing images(ORSI), challenges persist due to the intricate edge structures of ORSIs and the complexity of their contextual relationships. Current deep learning approaches encounter difficulties in accurately identifying boundary features and lack efficiency in collaboratively modeling the foreground and background by leveraging contextual features. To address these challenges, we propose a stronger multifaceted collaborative salient object detector in ORSIs, termed LBA-MCNet, which incorporates aspects of localization, balance, and affinity. The network focuses on accurately locating targets, balancing detailed features, and modeling image-level global context information. Specifically, we design the Edge Feature Adaptive Balancing and Adjusting(EFABA) module for precise edge localization, using edge features to guide attention to boundaries and preserve spatial details. Moreover, we design the Global Distributed Affinity Learning(GDAL) module to model global context. It captures global context by generating an affinity map from the encoders final layer, ensuring effective modeling of global patterns. Additionally, deep supervision during deconvolution further enhances feature representation. Finally, we compared with 28 state of the art approaches on three publicly available datasets. The results clearly demonstrate the superiority of our method.</description>

      <title>An Information Criterion for Controlled Disentanglement of Multimodal Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal representation learning seeks to relate and decompose information inherent in multiple modalities. By disentangling modality-specific information from information that is shared across modalities, we can improve interpretability and robustness and enable downstream tasks such as the generation of counterfactual outcomes. Separating the two types of information is challenging since they are often deeply entangled in many real-world applications. We propose Disentangled Self-Supervised Learning (DisentangledSSL), a novel self-supervised approach for learning disentangled representations. We present a comprehensive analysis of the optimality of each disentangled representation, particularly focusing on the scenario not covered in prior work where the so-called Minimum Necessary Information (MNI) point is not attainable. We demonstrate that DisentangledSSL successfully learns shared and modality-specific features on multiple synthetic and real-world datasets and consistently outperforms baselines on various downstream tasks, including prediction tasks for vision-language data, as well as molecule-phenotype retrieval tasks for biological data.</description>

      <title>Assessing the Impact of Packing on Machine Learning-Based Malware Detection and Classification Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The proliferation of malware, particularly through the use of packing, presents a significant challenge to static analysis and signature-based malware detection techniques. The application of packing to the original executable code renders extracting meaningful features and signatures challenging. To deal with the increasing amount of malware in the wild, researchers and anti-malware companies started harnessing machine learning capabilities with very promising results. However, little is known about the effects of packing on static machine learning-based malware detection and classification systems. This work addresses this gap by investigating the impact of packing on the performance of static machine learning-based models used for malware detection and classification, with a particular focus on those using visualisation techniques. To this end, we present a comprehensive analysis of various packing techniques and their effects on the performance of machine learning-based detectors and classifiers. Our findings highlight the limitations of current static detection and classification systems and underscore the need to be proactive to effectively counteract the evolving tactics of malware authors.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Modal Approach for Face Anti-Spoofing in Non-Calibrated Systems using Disparity Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Face recognition technologies are increasingly used in various applications, yet they are vulnerable to face spoofing attacks. These spoofing attacks often involve unique 3D structures, such as printed papers or mobile device screens. Although stereo-depth cameras can detect such attacks effectively, their high-cost limits their widespread adoption. Conversely, two-sensor systems without extrinsic calibration offer a cost-effective alternative but are unable to calculate depth using stereo techniques. In this work, we propose a method to overcome this challenge by leveraging facial attributes to derive disparity information and estimate relative depth for anti-spoofing purposes, using non-calibrated systems. We introduce a multi-modal anti-spoofing model, coined Disparity Model, that incorporates created disparity maps as a third modality alongside the two original sensor modalities. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the Disparity Model in countering various spoof attacks using a comprehensive dataset collected from the Intel RealSense ID Solution F455. Our method outperformed existing methods in the literature, achieving an Equal Error Rate (EER) of 1.71% and a False Negative Rate (FNR) of 2.77% at a False Positive Rate (FPR) of 1%. These errors are lower by 2.45% and 7.94% than the errors of the best comparison method, respectively. Additionally, we introduce a model ensemble that addresses 3D spoof attacks as well, achieving an EER of 2.04% and an FNR of 3.83% at an FPR of 1%. Overall, our work provides a state-of-the-art solution for the challenging task of anti-spoofing in non-calibrated systems that lack depth information.</description>

      <title>Navigating the Unknown: A Chat-Based Collaborative Interface for Personalized Exploratory Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rise of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized user interactions with knowledge-based systems, enabling chatbots to synthesize vast amounts of information and assist with complex, exploratory tasks. However, LLM-based chatbots often struggle to provide personalized support, particularly when users start with vague queries or lack sufficient contextual information. This paper introduces the Collaborative Assistant for Personalized Exploration (CARE), a system designed to enhance personalization in exploratory tasks by combining a multi-agent LLM framework with a structured user interface. CARE's interface consists of a Chat Panel, Solution Panel, and Needs Panel, enabling iterative query refinement and dynamic solution generation. The multi-agent framework collaborates to identify both explicit and implicit user needs, delivering tailored, actionable solutions. In a within-subject user study with 22 participants, CARE was consistently preferred over a baseline LLM chatbot, with users praising its ability to reduce cognitive load, inspire creativity, and provide more tailored solutions. Our findings highlight CARE's potential to transform LLM-based systems from passive information retrievers to proactive partners in personalized problem-solving and exploration.</description>

      <title>State- and context-dependent robotic manipulation and grasping via uncertainty-aware imitation learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generating context-adaptive manipulation and grasping actions is a challenging problem in robotics. Classical planning and control algorithms tend to be inflexible with regard to parameterization by external variables such as object shapes. In contrast, Learning from Demonstration (LfD) approaches, due to their nature as function approximators, allow for introducing external variables to modulate policies in response to the environment. In this paper, we utilize this property by introducing an LfD approach to acquire context-dependent grasping and manipulation strategies. We treat the problem as a kernel-based function approximation, where the kernel inputs include generic context variables describing task-dependent parameters such as the object shape. We build on existing work on policy fusion with uncertainty quantification to propose a state-dependent approach that automatically returns to demonstrations, avoiding unpredictable behavior while smoothly adapting to context changes. The approach is evaluated against the LASA handwriting dataset and on a real 7-DoF robot in two scenarios: adaptation to slippage while grasping and manipulating a deformable food item.</description>

      <title>Identifying General Mechanism Shifts in Linear Causal Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the linear causal representation learning setting where we observe a linear mixing of $d$ unknown latent factors, which follow a linear structural causal model. Recent work has shown that it is possible to recover the latent factors as well as the underlying structural causal model over them, up to permutation and scaling, provided that we have at least $d$ environments, each of which corresponds to perfect interventions on a single latent node (factor). After this powerful result, a key open problem faced by the community has been to relax these conditions: allow for coarser than perfect single-node interventions, and allow for fewer than $d$ of them, since the number of latent factors $d$ could be very large. In this work, we consider precisely such a setting, where we allow a smaller than $d$ number of environments, and also allow for very coarse interventions that can very coarsely \textit{change the entire causal graph over the latent factors}. On the flip side, we relax what we wish to extract to simply the \textit{list of nodes that have shifted between one or more environments}. We provide a surprising identifiability result that it is indeed possible, under some very mild standard assumptions, to identify the set of shifted nodes. Our identifiability proof moreover is a constructive one: we explicitly provide necessary and sufficient conditions for a node to be a shifted node, and show that we can check these conditions given observed data. Our algorithm lends itself very naturally to the sample setting where instead of just interventional distributions, we are provided datasets of samples from each of these distributions. We corroborate our results on both synthetic experiments as well as an interesting psychometric dataset. The code can be found at https://github.com/TianyuCodings/iLCS.</description>

      <title>Dynamical similarity analysis uniquely captures how computations develop in RNNs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Methods for analyzing representations in neural systems are increasingly popular tools in neuroscience and mechanistic interpretability. Measures comparing neural activations across conditions, architectures, and species give scalable ways to understand information transformation within different neural networks. However, recent findings show that some metrics respond to spurious signals, leading to misleading results. Establishing benchmark test cases is thus essential for identifying the most reliable metric and potential improvements. We propose that compositional learning in recurrent neural networks (RNNs) can provide a test case for dynamical representation alignment metrics. Implementing this case allows us to evaluate if metrics can identify representations that develop throughout learning and determine if representations identified by metrics reflect the network's actual computations. Building both attractor and RNN based test cases, we show that the recently proposed Dynamical Similarity Analysis (DSA) is more noise robust and reliably identifies behaviorally relevant representations compared to prior metrics (Procrustes, CKA). We also demonstrate how such test cases can extend beyond metric evaluation to study new architectures. Specifically, testing DSA in modern (Mamba) state space models suggests that these models, unlike RNNs, may not require changes in recurrent dynamics due to their expressive hidden states. Overall, we develop test cases that showcase how DSA's enhanced ability to detect dynamical motifs makes it highly effective for identifying ongoing computations in RNNs and revealing how networks learn tasks.</description>

      <title>In-Context Fine-Tuning for Time-Series Foundation Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.24087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent success of time-series foundation models for zero-shot forecasting, we present a methodology for $\textit{in-context fine-tuning}$ of a time-series foundation model. In particular, we design a pretrained foundation model that can be prompted (at inference time) with multiple time-series examples, in order to forecast a target time-series into the future. Our foundation model is specifically trained to utilize examples from multiple related time-series in its context window (in addition to the history of the target time-series) to help it adapt to the specific distribution of the target domain at inference time. We show that such a foundation model that uses in-context examples at inference time can obtain much better performance on popular forecasting benchmarks compared to supervised deep learning methods, statistical models, as well as other time-series foundation models. Interestingly, our in-context fine-tuning approach even rivals the performance of a foundation model that is explicitly fine-tuned on the target domain.</description>

      <title>3D-ViTac: Learning Fine-Grained Manipulation with Visuo-Tactile Sensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.24091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tactile and visual perception are both crucial for humans to perform fine-grained interactions with their environment. Developing similar multi-modal sensing capabilities for robots can significantly enhance and expand their manipulation skills. This paper introduces \textbf{3D-ViTac}, a multi-modal sensing and learning system designed for dexterous bimanual manipulation. Our system features tactile sensors equipped with dense sensing units, each covering an area of 3$mm^2$. These sensors are low-cost and flexible, providing detailed and extensive coverage of physical contacts, effectively complementing visual information. To integrate tactile and visual data, we fuse them into a unified 3D representation space that preserves their 3D structures and spatial relationships. The multi-modal representation can then be coupled with diffusion policies for imitation learning. Through concrete hardware experiments, we demonstrate that even low-cost robots can perform precise manipulations and significantly outperform vision-only policies, particularly in safe interactions with fragile items and executing long-horizon tasks involving in-hand manipulation.

      <title>Reinforcement Learning Gradients as Vitamin for Online Finetuning Decision Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decision Transformers have recently emerged as a new and compelling paradigm for offline Reinforcement Learning (RL), completing a trajectory in an autoregressive way. While improvements have been made to overcome initial shortcomings, online finetuning of decision transformers has been surprisingly under-explored. The widely adopted state-of-the-art Online Decision Transformer (ODT) still struggles when pretrained with low-reward offline data. In this paper, we theoretically analyze the online-finetuning of the decision transformer, showing that the commonly used Return-To-Go (RTG) that's far from the expected return hampers the online fine-tuning process. This problem, however, is well-addressed by the value function and advantage of standard RL algorithms. As suggested by our analysis, in our experiments, we hence find that simply adding TD3 gradients to the finetuning process of ODT effectively improves the online finetuning performance of ODT, especially if ODT is pretrained with low-reward offline data. These findings provide new directions to further improve decision transformers.</description>

      <title>Nearest Neighbor Normalization Improves Multimodal Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal models leverage large-scale pre-training to achieve strong but still imperfect performance on tasks such as image captioning, visual question answering, and cross-modal retrieval. In this paper, we present a simple and efficient method for correcting errors in trained contrastive image-text retrieval models with no additional training, called Nearest Neighbor Normalization (NNN). We show an improvement on retrieval metrics in both text retrieval and image retrieval for all of the contrastive models that we tested (CLIP, BLIP, ALBEF, SigLIP, BEiT) and for both of the datasets that we used (MS-COCO and Flickr30k). NNN requires a reference database, but does not require any training on this database, and can even increase the retrieval accuracy of a model after finetuning.</description>

      <title>AIDOVECL: AI-generated Dataset of Outpainted Vehicles for Eye-level Classification and Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Image labeling is a critical bottleneck in the development of computer vision technologies, often constraining the potential of machine learning models due to the time-intensive nature of manual annotations. This work introduces a novel approach that leverages outpainting to address the problem of annotated data scarcity by generating artificial contexts and annotations, significantly reducing manual labeling efforts. We apply this technique to a particularly acute challenge in autonomous driving, urban planning, and environmental monitoring: the lack of diverse, eye-level vehicle images in desired classes. Our dataset comprises AI-generated vehicle images obtained by detecting and cropping vehicles from manually selected seed images, which are then outpainted onto larger canvases to simulate varied real-world conditions. The outpainted images include detailed annotations, providing high-quality ground truth data. Advanced outpainting techniques and image quality assessments ensure visual fidelity and contextual relevance. Augmentation with outpainted vehicles improves overall performance metrics by up to 8\% and enhances prediction of underrepresented classes by up to 20\%. This approach, exemplifying outpainting as a self-annotating paradigm, presents a solution that enhances dataset versatility across multiple domains of machine learning.

      <title>Leveraging Large Language Models for Code Translation and Software Development in Scientific Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emergence of foundational models and generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) is poised to transform productivity in scientific computing, especially in code development, refactoring, and translating from one programming language to another. However, because the output of GenAI cannot be guaranteed to be correct, manual intervention remains necessary. Some of this intervention can be automated through task-specific tools, alongside additional methodologies for correctness verification and effective prompt development. We explored the application of GenAI in assisting with code translation, language interoperability, and codebase inspection within a legacy Fortran codebase used to simulate particle interactions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). In the process, we developed a tool, CodeScribe, which combines prompt engineering with user supervision to establish an efficient process for code conversion. In this paper, we demonstrate how CodeScribe assists in converting Fortran code to C++, generating Fortran-C APIs for integrating legacy systems with modern C++ libraries, and providing developer support for code organization and algorithm implementation. We also address the challenges of AI-driven code translation and highlight its benefits for enhancing productivity in scientific computing workflows.</description>

      <title>Constraint Back-translation Improves Complex Instruction Following of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) struggle to follow instructions with complex constraints in format, length, etc. Following the conventional instruction-tuning practice, previous works conduct post-training on complex instruction-response pairs generated by feeding complex instructions to advanced LLMs. However, even advanced LLMs cannot follow complex instructions well, thus limiting the quality of generated data. In this work, we find that existing datasets inherently contain implicit complex constraints and propose a novel data generation technique, constraint back-translation. Specifically, we take the high-quality instruction-response pairs in existing datasets and only adopt advanced LLMs to add complex constraints already met by the responses to the instructions, which naturally reduces costs and data noise. In the experiments, we adopt Llama3-70B-Instruct to back-translate constraints and create a high-quality complex instruction-response dataset, named CRAB. We present that post-training on CRAB improves multiple backbone LLMs' complex instruction-following ability, evaluated on extensive instruction-following benchmarks. We further find that constraint back-translation also serves as a useful auxiliary training objective in post-training. Our code, data, and models will be released to facilitate future research.</description>

      <title>DexMimicGen: Automated Data Generation for Bimanual Dexterous Manipulation via Imitation Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.24185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Imitation learning from human demonstrations is an effective means to teach robots manipulation skills. But data acquisition is a major bottleneck in applying this paradigm more broadly, due to the amount of cost and human effort involved. There has been significant interest in imitation learning for bimanual dexterous robots, like humanoids. Unfortunately, data collection is even more challenging here due to the challenges of simultaneously controlling multiple arms and multi-fingered hands. Automated data generation in simulation is a compelling, scalable alternative to fuel this need for data. To this end, we introduce DexMimicGen, a large-scale automated data generation system that synthesizes trajectories from a handful of human demonstrations for humanoid robots with dexterous hands. We present a collection of simulation environments in the setting of bimanual dexterous manipulation, spanning a range of manipulation behaviors and different requirements for coordination among the two arms. We generate 21K demos across these tasks from just 60 source human demos and study the effect of several data generation and policy learning decisions on agent performance. Finally, we present a real-to-sim-to-real pipeline and deploy it on a real-world humanoid can sorting task. Videos and more are at https://dexmimicgen.github.io/</description>

      <title>Chasing Better Deep Image Priors between Over- and Under-parameterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are well-known to act as over-parameterized deep image priors (DIP) that regularize various image inverse problems. Meanwhile, researchers also proposed extremely compact, under-parameterized image priors (e.g., deep decoder) that are strikingly competent for image restoration too, despite a loss of accuracy. These two extremes push us to think whether there exists a better solution in the middle: between over- and under-parameterized image priors, can one identify "intermediate" parameterized image priors that achieve better trade-offs between performance, efficiency, and even preserving strong transferability? Drawing inspirations from the lottery ticket hypothesis (LTH), we conjecture and study a novel "lottery image prior" (LIP) by exploiting DNN inherent sparsity, stated as: given an over-parameterized DNN-based image prior, it will contain a sparse subnetwork that can be trained in isolation, to match the original DNN's performance when being applied as a prior to various image inverse problems. Our results validate the superiority of LIPs: we can successfully locate the LIP subnetworks from over-parameterized DIPs at substantial sparsity ranges. Those LIP subnetworks significantly outperform deep decoders under comparably compact model sizes (by often fully preserving the effectiveness of their over-parameterized counterparts), and they also possess high transferability across different images as well as restoration task types. Besides, we also extend LIP to compressive sensing image reconstruction, where a pre-trained GAN generator is used as the prior (in contrast to untrained DIP or deep decoder), and confirm its validity in this setting too. To our best knowledge, this is the first time that LTH is demonstrated to be relevant in the context of inverse problems or image priors.</description>

      <title>Length-Induced Embedding Collapse in Transformer-based Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text embeddings enable various applications, but their performance deteriorates on longer texts. In this paper, we find that the performance degradation is due to a phenomenon called Length Collapse, where longer text embeddings collapse into a narrow space. This collapse results in a distributional inconsistency between embeddings of different text lengths, ultimately hurting the performance of downstream tasks. Theoretically, by considering the self-attention mechanism inherently functions as a low-pass filter, we prove that long sequences increase the attenuation rate of the low-pass filter effect of the self-attention mechanism. With layers going deeper, excessive low-pass filtering causes the token signals to retain only their Direct-Current (DC) component, which means the input token feature maps will collapse into a narrow space, especially in long texts. Based on the above analysis, we propose to mitigate the undesirable length collapse limitation by introducing a temperature in softmax(), which achieves a higher low-filter attenuation rate. The tuning-free method, called TempScale, can be plugged into multiple transformer-based embedding models. Empirically, we demonstrate that TempScale can improve existing embedding models, especially on long text inputs, bringing up to 0.53% performance gains on 40 datasets from Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB) and 0.82% performance gains on 4 datasets from LongEmbed, which specifically focuses on long context retrieval.</description>

      <title>DiffPano: Scalable and Consistent Text to Panorama Generation with Spherical Epipolar-Aware Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion-based methods have achieved remarkable achievements in 2D image or 3D object generation, however, the generation of 3D scenes and even $360^{\circ}$ images remains constrained, due to the limited number of scene datasets, the complexity of 3D scenes themselves, and the difficulty of generating consistent multi-view images. To address these issues, we first establish a large-scale panoramic video-text dataset containing millions of consecutive panoramic keyframes with corresponding panoramic depths, camera poses, and text descriptions. Then, we propose a novel text-driven panoramic generation framework, termed DiffPano, to achieve scalable, consistent, and diverse panoramic scene generation. Specifically, benefiting from the powerful generative capabilities of stable diffusion, we fine-tune a single-view text-to-panorama diffusion model with LoRA on the established panoramic video-text dataset. We further design a spherical epipolar-aware multi-view diffusion model to ensure the multi-view consistency of the generated panoramic images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DiffPano can generate scalable, consistent, and diverse panoramic images with given unseen text descriptions and camera poses.</description>

      <title>Zonal RL-RRT: Integrated RL-RRT Path Planning with Collision Probability and Zone Connectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Path planning in high-dimensional spaces poses significant challenges, particularly in achieving both time efficiency and a fair success rate. To address these issues, we introduce a novel path-planning algorithm, Zonal RL-RRT, that leverages kd-tree partitioning to segment the map into zones while addressing zone connectivity, ensuring seamless transitions between zones. By breaking down the complex environment into multiple zones and using Q-learning as the high-level decision-maker, our algorithm achieves a 3x improvement in time efficiency compared to basic sampling methods such as RRT and RRT* in forest-like maps. Our approach outperforms heuristic-guided methods like BIT* and Informed RRT* by 1.5x in terms of runtime while maintaining robust and reliable success rates across 2D to 6D environments. Compared to learning-based methods like NeuralRRT* and MPNetSMP, as well as the heuristic RRT*J, our algorithm demonstrates, on average, 1.5x better performance in the same environments. We also evaluate the effectiveness of our approach through simulations of the UR10e arm manipulator in the MuJoCo environment. A key observation of our approach lies in its use of zone partitioning and Reinforcement Learning (RL) for adaptive high-level planning allowing the algorithm to accommodate flexible policies across diverse environments, making it a versatile tool for advanced path planning.</description>

      <title>Understanding Optimization in Deep Learning with Central Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optimization in deep learning remains poorly understood, even in the simple setting of deterministic (i.e. full-batch) training. A key difficulty is that much of an optimizer's behavior is implicitly determined by complex oscillatory dynamics, referred to as the "edge of stability." The main contribution of this paper is to show that an optimizer's implicit behavior can be explicitly captured by a "central flow:" a differential equation which models the time-averaged optimization trajectory. We show that these flows can empirically predict long-term optimization trajectories of generic neural networks with a high degree of numerical accuracy. By interpreting these flows, we reveal for the first time 1) the precise sense in which RMSProp adapts to the local loss landscape, and 2) an "acceleration via regularization" mechanism, wherein adaptive optimizers implicitly navigate towards low-curvature regions in which they can take larger steps. This mechanism is key to the efficacy of these adaptive optimizers. Overall, we believe that central flows constitute a promising tool for reasoning about optimization in deep learning.</description>

      <title>Teaching Embodied Reinforcement Learning Agents: Informativeness and Diversity of Language Use</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In real-world scenarios, it is desirable for embodied agents to have the ability to leverage human language to gain explicit or implicit knowledge for learning tasks. Despite recent progress, most previous approaches adopt simple low-level instructions as language inputs, which may not reflect natural human communication. It's not clear how to incorporate rich language use to facilitate task learning. To address this question, this paper studies different types of language inputs in facilitating reinforcement learning (RL) embodied agents. More specifically, we examine how different levels of language informativeness (i.e., feedback on past behaviors and future guidance) and diversity (i.e., variation of language expressions) impact agent learning and inference. Our empirical results based on four RL benchmarks demonstrate that agents trained with diverse and informative language feedback can achieve enhanced generalization and fast adaptation to new tasks. These findings highlight the pivotal role of language use in teaching embodied agents new tasks in an open world. Project website: https://github.com/sled-group/Teachable_RL</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.24220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The accurate prediction of geometric state evolution in complex systems is critical for advancing scientific domains such as quantum chemistry and material modeling. Traditional experimental and computational methods face challenges in terms of environmental constraints and computational demands, while current deep learning approaches still fall short in terms of precision and generality. In this work, we introduce the Geometric Diffusion Bridge (GDB), a novel generative modeling framework that accurately bridges initial and target geometric states. GDB leverages a probabilistic approach to evolve geometric state distributions, employing an equivariant diffusion bridge derived by a modified version of Doob's $h$-transform for connecting geometric states. This tailored diffusion process is anchored by initial and target geometric states as fixed endpoints and governed by equivariant transition kernels. Moreover, trajectory data can be seamlessly leveraged in our GDB framework by using a chain of equivariant diffusion bridges, providing a more detailed and accurate characterization of evolution dynamics. Theoretically, we conduct a thorough examination to confirm our framework's ability to preserve joint distributions of geometric states and capability to completely model the underlying dynamics inducing trajectory distributions with negligible error. Experimental evaluations across various real-world scenarios show that GDB surpasses existing state-of-the-art approaches, opening up a new pathway for accurately bridging geometric states and tackling crucial scientific challenges with improved accuracy and applicability.</description>

      <title>Knowledge Equivalence in Digital Twins of Intelligent Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2204.07481v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A digital twin contains up-to-date data-driven models of the physical world being studied and can use simulation to optimise the physical world. However, the analysis made by the digital twin is valid and reliable only when the model is equivalent to the physical world. Maintaining such an equivalent model is challenging, especially when the physical systems being modelled are intelligent and autonomous. The paper focuses in particular on digital twin models of intelligent systems where the systems are knowledge-aware but with limited capability. The digital twin improves the acting of the physical system at a meta-level by accumulating more knowledge in the simulated environment. The modelling of such an intelligent physical system requires replicating the knowledge-awareness capability in the virtual space. Novel equivalence maintaining techniques are needed, especially in synchronising the knowledge between the model and the physical system. This paper proposes the notion of knowledge equivalence and an equivalence maintaining approach by knowledge comparison and updates. A quantitative analysis of the proposed approach confirms that compared to state equivalence, knowledge equivalence maintenance can tolerate deviation thus reducing unnecessary updates and achieve more Pareto efficient solutions for the trade-off between update overhead and simulation reliability.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Attention and Cognitive Control Costs Using Temporally-Layered Architectures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.18701v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The current reinforcement learning framework focuses exclusively on performance, often at the expense of efficiency. In contrast, biological control achieves remarkable performance while also optimizing computational energy expenditure and decision frequency. We propose a Decision Bounded Markov Decision Process (DB-MDP), that constrains the number of decisions and computational energy available to agents in reinforcement learning environments. Our experiments demonstrate that existing reinforcement learning algorithms struggle within this framework, leading to either failure or suboptimal performance. To address this, we introduce a biologically-inspired, Temporally Layered Architecture (TLA), enabling agents to manage computational costs through two layers with distinct time scales and energy requirements. TLA achieves optimal performance in decision-bounded environments and in continuous control environments, it matches state-of-the-art performance while utilizing a fraction of the compute cost. Compared to current reinforcement learning algorithms that solely prioritize performance, our approach significantly lowers computational energy expenditure while maintaining performance. These findings establish a benchmark and pave the way for future research on energy and time-aware control.</description>

      <title>Natural Counterfactuals With Necessary Backtracking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01607v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Counterfactual reasoning is pivotal in human cognition and especially important for providing explanations and making decisions. While Judea Pearl's influential approach is theoretically elegant, its generation of a counterfactual scenario often requires too much deviation from the observed scenarios to be feasible, as we show using simple examples. To mitigate this difficulty, we propose a framework of \emph{natural counterfactuals} and a method for generating counterfactuals that are more feasible with respect to the actual data distribution. Our methodology incorporates a certain amount of backtracking when needed, allowing changes in causally preceding variables to minimize deviations from realistic scenarios. Specifically, we introduce a novel optimization framework that permits but also controls the extent of backtracking with a naturalness criterion. Empirical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. The code is available at https://github.com/GuangyuanHao/natural_counterfactuals.</description>

      <title>Can Large Language Model Agents Simulate Human Trust Behavior?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04559v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have been increasingly adopted as simulation tools to model humans in social science and role-playing applications. However, one fundamental question remains: can LLM agents really simulate human behavior? In this paper, we focus on one elemental behavior in human interactions, trust, and investigate whether LLM agents can simulate human trust behavior. We first find that LLM agents generally exhibit trust behavior, referred to as agent trust, under the framework of Trust Games, which are widely recognized in behavioral economics. Then, we discover that GPT-4 agents manifest high behavioral alignment with humans in terms of trust behavior, indicating the feasibility of simulating human trust behavior with LLM agents. In addition, we probe the biases of agent trust and differences in agent trust towards other LLM agents and humans. We also explore the intrinsic properties of agent trust under conditions including external manipulations and advanced reasoning strategies. Our study provides new insights into the behaviors of LLM agents and the fundamental analogy between LLMs and humans beyond value alignment. We further illustrate broader implications of our discoveries for applications where trust is paramount.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07963v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Leveraging planning during learning and decision-making is central to the long-term development of intelligent agents. Recent works have successfully combined tree-based search methods and self-play learning mechanisms to this end. However, these methods typically face scaling challenges due to the sequential nature of their search. While practical engineering solutions can partly overcome this, they often result in a negative impact on performance. In this paper, we introduce SPO: Sequential Monte Carlo Policy Optimisation, a model-based reinforcement learning algorithm grounded within the Expectation Maximisation (EM) framework. We show that SPO provides robust policy improvement and efficient scaling properties. The sample-based search makes it directly applicable to both discrete and continuous action spaces without modifications. We demonstrate statistically significant improvements in performance relative to model-free and model-based baselines across both continuous and discrete environments. Furthermore, the parallel nature of SPO's search enables effective utilisation of hardware accelerators, yielding favourable scaling laws.</description>

      <title>Expectation Alignment: Handling Reward Misspecification in the Presence of Expectation Mismatch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08791v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Detecting and handling misspecified objectives, such as reward functions, has been widely recognized as one of the central challenges within the domain of Artificial Intelligence (AI) safety research. However, even with the recognition of the importance of this problem, we are unaware of any works that attempt to provide a clear definition for what constitutes (a) misspecified objectives and (b) successfully resolving such misspecifications. In this work, we use the theory of mind, i.e., the human user's beliefs about the AI agent, as a basis to develop a formal explanatory framework called Expectation Alignment (EAL) to understand the objective misspecification and its causes. Our EAL framework not only acts as an explanatory framework for existing works but also provides us with concrete insights into the limitations of existing methods to handle reward misspecification and novel solution strategies. We use these insights to propose a new interactive algorithm that uses the specified reward to infer potential user expectations about the system behavior. We show how one can efficiently implement this algorithm by mapping the inference problem into linear programs. We evaluate our method on a set of standard Markov Decision Process (MDP) benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Proving Olympiad Algebraic Inequalities without Human Demonstrations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14219v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solving Olympiad-level mathematical problems represents a significant advancement in machine intelligence and automated reasoning. Current machine learning methods, however, struggle to solve Olympiad-level problems beyond Euclidean plane geometry due to a lack of large-scale, high-quality datasets. The challenge is even greater in algebraic systems, which involve infinite reasoning spaces within finite conditions. To address these issues, we propose AIPS, an Algebraic Inequality Proving System capable of autonomously generating complex inequality theorems and effectively solving Olympiad-level inequality problems without requiring human demonstrations. During proof search in a mixed reasoning manner, a value curriculum learning strategy on generated datasets is implemented to improve proving performance, demonstrating strong mathematical intuitions. On a test set of 20 International Mathematical Olympiad-level inequality problems, AIPS successfully solved 10, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, AIPS automatically generated a vast array of non-trivial theorems without human intervention, some of which have been evaluated by professional contestants and deemed to reach the level of the International Mathematical Olympiad. Notably, one theorem was selected as a competition problem in a major city 2024 Mathematical Olympiad.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15187v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The use of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has improved Large Language Models (LLMs) in collaborating with external data, yet significant challenges exist in real-world scenarios. In areas such as academic literature and finance question answering, data are often found in raw text and tables in HTML or PDF formats, which can be lengthy and highly unstructured. In this paper, we introduce a benchmark suite, namely Unstructured Document Analysis (UDA), that involves 2,965 real-world documents and 29,590 expert-annotated Q&amp;A pairs. We revisit popular LLM- and RAG-based solutions for document analysis and evaluate the design choices and answer qualities across multiple document domains and diverse query types. Our evaluation yields interesting findings and highlights the importance of data parsing and retrieval. We hope our benchmark can shed light and better serve real-world document analysis applications.

      <title>GenRL: Multimodal-foundation world models for generalization in embodied agents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18043v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Learning generalist embodied agents, able to solve multitudes of tasks in different domains is a long-standing problem. Reinforcement learning (RL) is hard to scale up as it requires a complex reward design for each task. In contrast, language can specify tasks in a more natural way. Current foundation vision-language models (VLMs) generally require fine-tuning or other adaptations to be adopted in embodied contexts, due to the significant domain gap. However, the lack of multimodal data in such domains represents an obstacle to developing foundation models for embodied applications. In this work, we overcome these problems by presenting multimodal-foundation world models, able to connect and align the representation of foundation VLMs with the latent space of generative world models for RL, without any language annotations. The resulting agent learning framework, GenRL, allows one to specify tasks through vision and/or language prompts, ground them in the embodied domain's dynamics, and learn the corresponding behaviors in imagination. As assessed through large-scale multi-task benchmarking in locomotion and manipulation domains, GenRL enables multi-task generalization from language and visual prompts. Furthermore, by introducing a data-free policy learning strategy, our approach lays the groundwork for foundational policy learning using generative world models.

      <title>Coding Reliable LLM-based Integrated Task and Knowledge Agents with GenieWorksheets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05674v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) present an opportunity to create automated assistants that can help users navigate complex tasks. However, existing approaches have limitations in handling conditional logic, integrating knowledge sources, and consistently following instructions. Researchers and industry professionals often employ ad hoc pipelines to construct conversational agents. These pipelines aim to maintain context, address failure cases, and minimize hallucinations, yet frequently fail to achieve these objectives. To this end, we present Genie - a programmable framework for creating task-oriented conversational agents that are designed to handle complex user interactions and knowledge queries. Unlike LLMs, Genie provides reliable grounded responses, with controllable agent policies through its expressive specification, Genie Worksheet. In contrast to dialog trees, it is resilient to diverse user queries, helpful with knowledge sources, and offers ease of programming policies through its declarative paradigm. The agents built using Genie outperforms the state-of-the-art method on complex logic domains in STARV2 dataset by up to 20.5%. Additionally, through a real-user study involving 62 participants, we show that Genie beats the GPT-4 with function calling baseline by 21.1%, 20.1%, and 61% on execution accuracy, dialogue act accuracy, and goal completion rate, respectively, on three diverse real-world domains</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Quantification of Surrogate Models using Conformal Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09881v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data-driven surrogate models have shown immense potential as quick, inexpensive approximations to complex numerical and experimental modelling tasks. However, most surrogate models of physical systems do not quantify their uncertainty, rendering their predictions unreliable, requiring further validation. Though Bayesian approximations offer some solace in estimating the error associated with these models, they cannot provide guarantees, and the quality of their inferences depends on the availability of prior information and good approximations to posteriors for complex problems. This is particularly pertinent to multi-variable or spatio-temporal problems. Our work constructs and formalises a conformal prediction framework that satisfies marginal coverage for spatio-temporal predictions in a model-agnostic manner, requiring near-zero computational costs. We provide an extensive empirical study of the application of the framework to ascertain valid error bars that provide guaranteed coverage across the surrogate model's domain of operation. The application scope of our work extends across a large range of spatio-temporal models, from solving partial differential equations to weather forecasting. Through the applications, the paper looks at providing statistically valid error bars for deterministic models, as well as crafting guarantees to the error bars of probabilistic models. Our conformal prediction formalisation provides guaranteed coverage of the surrogate model, regardless of model architecture, and its training regime and is unbothered by the curse of dimensionality.</description>

Abstract: Robotic Process Automation (RPA) has emerged as a game-changing technology in data extraction, revolutionizing the way organizations process and analyze large volumes of documents such as invoices, purchase orders, and payment advices. This study investigates the use of RPA for structured data extraction and evaluates its advantages over manual processes. By comparing human-performed tasks with those executed by RPA software bots, we assess efficiency and accuracy in data extraction from invoices, focusing on the effectiveness of the RPA system. Through four distinct scenarios involving varying numbers of invoices, we measure efficiency in terms of time and effort required for task completion, as well as accuracy by comparing error rates between manual and RPA processes. Our findings highlight the significant efficiency gains achieved by RPA, with bots completing tasks in significantly less time compared to manual efforts across all cases. Moreover, the RPA system consistently achieves perfect accuracy, mitigating the risk of errors and enhancing process reliability. These results underscore the transformative potential of RPA in optimizing operational efficiency, reducing human labor costs, and improving overall business performance.</description>

      <title>Models Can and Should Embrace the Communicative Nature of Human-Generated Math</title>

Abstract: Math is constructed by people for people: just as natural language corpora reflect not just propositions but the communicative goals of language users, the math data that models are trained on reflects not just idealized mathematical entities but rich communicative intentions. While there are important advantages to treating math in a purely symbolic manner, we here hypothesize that there are benefits to treating math as situated linguistic communication and that language models are well suited for this goal, in ways that are not fully appreciated. We illustrate these points with two case studies. First, we ran an experiment in which we found that language models interpret the equals sign in a humanlike way -- generating systematically different word problems for the same underlying equation arranged in different ways. Second, we found that language models prefer proofs to be ordered in naturalistic ways, even though other orders would be logically equivalent. We advocate for AI systems that learn from and represent the communicative intentions latent in human-generated math.</description>

      <title>Search for Efficient Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17372v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have long held sway in the realms of artificial intelligence research. Numerous efficient techniques, including weight pruning, quantization, and distillation, have been embraced to compress LLMs, targeting memory reduction and inference acceleration, which underscore the redundancy in LLMs. However, most model compression techniques concentrate on weight optimization, overlooking the exploration of optimal architectures. Besides, traditional architecture search methods, limited by the elevated complexity with extensive parameters, struggle to demonstrate their effectiveness on LLMs. In this paper, we propose a training-free architecture search framework to identify optimal subnets that preserve the fundamental strengths of the original LLMs while achieving inference acceleration. Furthermore, after generating subnets that inherit specific weights from the original LLMs, we introduce a reformation algorithm that utilizes the omitted weights to rectify the inherited weights with a small amount of calibration data. Compared with SOTA training-free structured pruning works that can generate smaller networks, our method demonstrates superior performance across standard benchmarks. Furthermore, our generated subnets can directly reduce the usage of GPU memory and achieve inference acceleration. Code: https://github.com/shawnricecake/search-llm</description>

      <title>Gene-Metabolite Association Prediction with Interactive Knowledge Transfer Enhanced Graph for Metabolite Production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18475v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of metabolic engineering, the quest for efficient and precise gene target identification for metabolite production enhancement presents significant challenges. Traditional approaches, whether knowledge-based or model-based, are notably time-consuming and labor-intensive, due to the vast scale of research literature and the approximation nature of genome-scale metabolic model (GEM) simulations. Therefore, we propose a new task, Gene-Metabolite Association Prediction based on metabolic graphs, to automate the process of candidate gene discovery for a given pair of metabolite and candidate-associated genes, as well as presenting the first benchmark containing 2474 metabolites and 1947 genes of two commonly used microorganisms Saccharomyces cerevisiae (SC) and Issatchenkia orientalis (IO). This task is challenging due to the incompleteness of the metabolic graphs and the heterogeneity among distinct metabolisms. To overcome these limitations, we propose an Interactive Knowledge Transfer mechanism based on Metabolism Graph (IKT4Meta), which improves the association prediction accuracy by integrating the knowledge from different metabolism graphs. First, to build a bridge between two graphs for knowledge transfer, we utilize Pretrained Language Models (PLMs) with external knowledge of genes and metabolites to help generate inter-graph links, significantly alleviating the impact of heterogeneity. Second, we propagate intra-graph links from different metabolic graphs using inter-graph links as anchors. Finally, we conduct the gene-metabolite association prediction based on the enriched metabolism graphs, which integrate the knowledge from multiple microorganisms. Experiments on both types of organisms demonstrate that our proposed methodology outperforms baselines by up to 12.3% across various link prediction frameworks.</description>

      <title>Identifying Equivalent Training Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.09160v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Study of the nonlinear evolution deep neural network (DNN) parameters undergo during training has uncovered regimes of distinct dynamical behavior. While a detailed understanding of these phenomena has the potential to advance improvements in training efficiency and robustness, the lack of methods for identifying when DNN models have equivalent dynamics limits the insight that can be gained from prior work. Topological conjugacy, a notion from dynamical systems theory, provides a precise definition of dynamical equivalence, offering a possible route to address this need. However, topological conjugacies have historically been challenging to compute. By leveraging advances in Koopman operator theory, we develop a framework for identifying conjugate and non-conjugate training dynamics. To validate our approach, we demonstrate that comparing Koopman eigenvalues can correctly identify a known equivalence between online mirror descent and online gradient descent. We then utilize our approach to: (a) identify non-conjugate training dynamics between shallow and wide fully connected neural networks; (b) characterize the early phase of training dynamics in convolutional neural networks; (c) uncover non-conjugate training dynamics in Transformers that do and do not undergo grokking. Our results, across a range of DNN architectures, illustrate the flexibility of our framework and highlight its potential for shedding new light on training dynamics.</description>

      <title>Deep Graph Neural Networks via Posteriori-Sampling-based Node-Adaptive Residual Module</title>

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), a type of neural network that can learn from graph-structured data through neighborhood information aggregation, have shown superior performance in various downstream tasks. However, as the number of layers increases, node representations become indistinguishable, which is known as over-smoothing. To address this issue, many residual methods have emerged. In this paper, we focus on the over-smoothing issue and related residual methods. Firstly, we revisit over-smoothing from the perspective of overlapping neighborhood subgraphs, and based on this, we explain how residual methods can alleviate over-smoothing by integrating multiple orders neighborhood subgraphs to avoid the indistinguishability of the single high-order neighborhood subgraphs. Additionally, we reveal the drawbacks of previous residual methods, such as the lack of node adaptability and severe loss of high-order neighborhood subgraph information, and propose a \textbf{Posterior-Sampling-based, Node-Adaptive Residual module (PSNR)}. We theoretically demonstrate that PSNR can alleviate the drawbacks of previous residual methods. Furthermore, extensive experiments verify the superiority of the PSNR module in fully observed node classification and missing feature scenarios.

      <title>Heterogeneous Knowledge for Augmented Modular Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.01158v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing modular Reinforcement Learning (RL) architectures are generally based on reusable components, also allowing for "plug-and-play" integration. However, these modules are homogeneous in nature - in fact, they essentially provide policies obtained via RL through the maximization of individual reward functions. Consequently, such solutions still lack the ability to integrate and process multiple types of information (i.e., heterogeneous knowledge representations), such as rules, sub-goals, and skills from various sources. In this paper, we discuss several practical examples of heterogeneous knowledge and propose Augmented Modular Reinforcement Learning (AMRL) to address these limitations. Our framework uses a selector to combine heterogeneous modules and seamlessly incorporate different types of knowledge representations and processing mechanisms. Our results demonstrate the performance and efficiency improvements, also in terms of generalization, that can be achieved by augmenting traditional modular RL with heterogeneous knowledge sources and processing mechanisms. Finally, we examine the safety, robustness, and interpretability issues stemming from the introduction of knowledge heterogeneity.</description>

      <title>Rapid Plug-in Defenders</title>

Abstract: In the realm of daily services, the deployment of deep neural networks underscores the paramount importance of their reliability. However, the vulnerability of these networks to adversarial attacks, primarily evasion-based, poses a concerning threat to their functionality. Common methods for enhancing robustness involve heavy adversarial training or leveraging learned knowledge from clean data, both necessitating substantial computational resources. This inherent time-intensive nature severely limits the agility of large foundational models to swiftly counter adversarial perturbations. To address this challenge, this paper focuses on the Rapid Plug-in Defender (RaPiD) problem, aiming to rapidly counter adversarial perturbations without altering the deployed model. Drawing inspiration from the generalization and the universal computation ability of pre-trained transformer models, we propose a novel method termed CeTaD (Considering Pre-trained Transformers as Defenders) for RaPiD, optimized for efficient computation. CeTaD strategically fine-tunes the normalization layer parameters within the defender using a limited set of clean and adversarial examples. Our evaluation centers on assessing CeTaD's effectiveness, transferability, and the impact of different components in scenarios involving one-shot adversarial examples. The proposed method is capable of rapidly adapting to various attacks and different application scenarios without altering the target model and clean training data. We also explore the influence of varying training data conditions on CeTaD's performance. Notably, CeTaD exhibits adaptability across differentiable service models and proves the potential of continuous learning.</description>

      <title>Invisible Image Watermarks Are Provably Removable Using Generative AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.01953v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Invisible watermarks safeguard images' copyrights by embedding hidden messages only detectable by owners. They also prevent people from misusing images, especially those generated by AI models. We propose a family of regeneration attacks to remove these invisible watermarks. The proposed attack method first adds random noise to an image to destroy the watermark and then reconstructs the image. This approach is flexible and can be instantiated with many existing image-denoising algorithms and pre-trained generative models such as diffusion models. Through formal proofs and extensive empirical evaluations, we demonstrate that pixel-level invisible watermarks are vulnerable to this regeneration attack. Our results reveal that, across four different pixel-level watermarking schemes, the proposed method consistently achieves superior performance compared to existing attack techniques, with lower detection rates and higher image quality. However, watermarks that keep the image semantically similar can be an alternative defense against our attacks. Our finding underscores the need for a shift in research/industry emphasis from invisible watermarks to semantic-preserving watermarks.

      <title>End-to-End Driving via Self-Supervised Imitation Learning Using Camera and LiDAR Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.14329v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In autonomous driving, the end-to-end (E2E) driving approach that predicts vehicle control signals directly from sensor data is rapidly gaining attention. To learn a safe E2E driving system, one needs an extensive amount of driving data and human intervention. Vehicle control data is constructed by many hours of human driving, and it is challenging to construct large vehicle control datasets. Often, publicly available driving datasets are collected with limited driving scenes, and collecting vehicle control data is only available by vehicle manufacturers. To address these challenges, this letter proposes the first fully self-supervised learning framework, self-supervised imitation learning (SSIL), for E2E driving, based on the self-supervised regression learning framework. The proposed SSIL framework can learn E2E driving networks without using driving command data. To construct pseudo steering angle data, proposed SSIL predicts a pseudo target from the vehicle's poses at the current and previous time points that are estimated with light detection and ranging sensors. In addition, we propose two modified E2E driving networks that predict driving commands depending on high-level instruction. Our numerical experiments with three different benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed SSIL framework achieves very comparable E2E driving accuracy with the supervised learning counterpart.</description>

      <title>Subwords as Skills: Tokenization for Sparse-Reward Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.04459v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Exploration in sparse-reward reinforcement learning is difficult due to the requirement of long, coordinated sequences of actions in order to achieve any reward. Moreover, in continuous action spaces there are an infinite number of possible actions, which only increases the difficulty of exploration. One class of methods designed to address these issues forms temporally extended actions, often called skills, from interaction data collected in the same domain, and optimizes a policy on top of this new action space. Typically such methods require a lengthy pretraining phase, especially in continuous action spaces, in order to form the skills before reinforcement learning can begin. Given prior evidence that the full range of the continuous action space is not required in such tasks, we propose a novel approach to skill-generation with two components. First we discretize the action space through clustering, and second we leverage a tokenization technique borrowed from natural language processing to generate temporally extended actions. Such a method outperforms baselines for skill-generation in several challenging sparse-reward domains, and requires orders-of-magnitude less computation in skill-generation and online rollouts.

      <title>Low-light Pedestrian Detection in Visible and Infrared Image Feeds: Issues and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08557v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pedestrian detection has become a cornerstone for several high-level tasks, including autonomous driving, intelligent transportation, and traffic surveillance. There are several works focussed on pedestrian detection using visible images, mainly in the daytime. However, this task is very intriguing when the environmental conditions change to poor lighting or nighttime. Recently, new ideas have been spurred to use alternative sources, such as Far InfraRed (FIR) temperature sensor feeds for detecting pedestrians in low-light conditions. This study reviews recent developments in low-light pedestrian detection approaches. It systematically categorizes and analyses various algorithms from region-based to non-region-based and graph-based learning methodologies by highlighting their methodologies, implementation issues, and challenges. It also outlines the key benchmark datasets that can be used for research and development of advanced pedestrian detection algorithms, particularly in low-light situations.</description>

Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) models are trained using historical data to classify new, unseen data. However, traditional computing resources often struggle to handle the immense amount of data, commonly known as Big Data, within a reasonable time frame. Quantum Computing (QC) provides a novel approach to information processing, offering the potential to process classical data exponentially faster than classical computing through quantum algorithms. By mapping Quantum Machine Learning (QML) algorithms into the quantum mechanical domain, we can potentially achieve exponential improvements in data processing speed, reduced resource requirements, and enhanced accuracy and efficiency. In this article, we delve into both the QC and ML fields, exploring the interplay of ideas between them, as well as the current capabilities and limitations of hardware. We investigate the history of quantum computing, examine existing QML algorithms, and present a simplified procedure for setting up simulations of QML algorithms, making it accessible and understandable for readers. Furthermore, we conduct simulations on a dataset using both traditional machine learning and quantum machine learning approaches. We then compare their respective performances by utilizing a quantum simulator.</description>

      <title>TaskBench: Benchmarking Large Language Models for Task Automation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.18760v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the remarkable progress of large language models (LLMs) has sparked interest in task automation, which involves decomposing complex tasks described by user instructions into sub-tasks and invoking external tools to execute them, playing a central role in autonomous agents. However, there is a lack of systematic and standardized benchmarks to promote the development of LLMs in task automation. To address this, we introduce TaskBench, a comprehensive framework to evaluate the capability of LLMs in task automation. Specifically, task automation can be divided into three critical stages: task decomposition, tool selection, and parameter prediction. To tackle the complexities inherent in these stages, we introduce the concept of Tool Graph to represent decomposed tasks and adopt a back-instruct method to generate high-quality user instructions. We propose TaskEval, a multi-faceted evaluation methodology that assesses LLM performance across these three stages. Our approach combines automated construction with rigorous human verification, ensuring high consistency with human evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that TaskBench effectively reflects the capabilities of various LLMs in task automation. It provides insights into model performance across different task complexities and domains, pushing the boundaries of what current models can achieve. TaskBench offers a scalable, adaptable, and reliable benchmark for advancing LLM-based autonomous agents.</description>

      <title>Strong but simple: A Baseline for Domain Generalized Dense Perception by CLIP-based Transfer Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02021v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Domain generalization (DG) remains a significant challenge for perception based on deep neural networks (DNNs), where domain shifts occur due to synthetic data, lighting, weather, or location changes. Vision-language models (VLMs) marked a large step for the generalization capabilities and have been already applied to various tasks. Very recently, first approaches utilized VLMs for domain generalized segmentation and object detection and obtained strong generalization. However, all these approaches rely on complex modules, feature augmentation frameworks or additional models. Surprisingly and in contrast to that, we found that simple fine-tuning of vision-language pre-trained models yields competitive or even stronger generalization results while being extremely simple to apply. Moreover, we found that vision-language pre-training consistently provides better generalization than the previous standard of vision-only pre-training. This challenges the standard of using ImageNet-based transfer learning for domain generalization. Fully fine-tuning a vision-language pre-trained model is capable of reaching the domain generalization SOTA when training on the synthetic GTA5 dataset. Moreover, we confirm this observation for object detection on a novel synthetic-to-real benchmark. We further obtain superior generalization capabilities by reaching 77.9% mIoU on the popular Cityscapes-to-ACDC benchmark. We also found improved in-domain generalization, leading to an improved SOTA of 86.4% mIoU on the Cityscapes test set marking the first place on the leaderboard.</description>

      <title>Tree of Attacks: Jailbreaking Black-Box LLMs Automatically</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02119v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) display versatile functionality, they continue to generate harmful, biased, and toxic content, as demonstrated by the prevalence of human-designed jailbreaks. In this work, we present Tree of Attacks with Pruning (TAP), an automated method for generating jailbreaks that only requires black-box access to the target LLM. TAP utilizes an attacker LLM to iteratively refine candidate (attack) prompts until one of the refined prompts jailbreaks the target. In addition, before sending prompts to the target, TAP assesses them and prunes the ones unlikely to result in jailbreaks, reducing the number of queries sent to the target LLM. In empirical evaluations, we observe that TAP generates prompts that jailbreak state-of-the-art LLMs (including GPT4-Turbo and GPT4o) for more than 80% of the prompts. This significantly improves upon the previous state-of-the-art black-box methods for generating jailbreaks while using a smaller number of queries than them. Furthermore, TAP is also capable of jailbreaking LLMs protected by state-of-the-art guardrails, e.g., LlamaGuard.</description>

      <title>Weak Supervision Performance Evaluation via Partial Identification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.04601v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Programmatic Weak Supervision (PWS) enables supervised model training without direct access to ground truth labels, utilizing weak labels from heuristics, crowdsourcing, or pre-trained models. However, the absence of ground truth complicates model evaluation, as traditional metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall cannot be directly calculated. In this work, we present a novel method to address this challenge by framing model evaluation as a partial identification problem and estimating performance bounds using Fr\'echet bounds. Our approach derives reliable bounds on key metrics without requiring labeled data, overcoming core limitations in current weak supervision evaluation techniques. Through scalable convex optimization, we obtain accurate and computationally efficient bounds for metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, even in high-dimensional settings. This framework offers a robust approach to assessing model quality without ground truth labels, enhancing the practicality of weakly supervised learning for real-world applications.</description>

Abstract: Protecting the copyright of large language models (LLMs) has become crucial due to their resource-intensive training and accompanying carefully designed licenses. However, identifying the original base model of an LLM is challenging due to potential parameter alterations. In this study, we introduce HuRef, a human-readable fingerprint for LLMs that uniquely identifies the base model without interfering with training or exposing model parameters to the public. We first observe that the vector direction of LLM parameters remains stable after the model has converged during pretraining, with negligible perturbations through subsequent training steps, including continued pretraining, supervised fine-tuning, and RLHF, which makes it a sufficient condition to identify the base model. The necessity is validated by continuing to train an LLM with an extra term to drive away the model parameters' direction and the model becomes damaged. However, this direction is vulnerable to simple attacks like dimension permutation or matrix rotation, which significantly change it without affecting performance. To address this, leveraging the Transformer structure, we systematically analyze potential attacks and define three invariant terms that identify an LLM's base model. Due to the potential risk of information leakage, we cannot publish invariant terms directly. Instead, we map them to a Gaussian vector using an encoder, then convert it into a natural image using StyleGAN2, and finally publish the image. In our black-box setting, all fingerprinting steps are internally conducted by the LLMs owners. To ensure the published fingerprints are honestly generated, we introduced Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP). Experimental results across various LLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. The code is available at https://github.com/LUMIA-Group/HuRef.</description>

      <title>Algebraic Positional Encodings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16045v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel positional encoding strategy for Transformer-style models, addressing the shortcomings of existing, often ad hoc, approaches. Our framework provides a flexible mapping from the algebraic specification of a domain to an interpretation as orthogonal operators. This design preserves the algebraic characteristics of the source domain, ensuring that the model upholds its desired structural properties. Our scheme can accommodate various structures, ncluding sequences, grids and trees, as well as their compositions. We conduct a series of experiments to demonstrate the practical applicability of our approach. Results suggest performance on par with or surpassing the current state-of-the-art, without hyper-parameter optimizations or "task search" of any kind.

      <title>End-to-end Learnable Clustering for Intent Learning in Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05975v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Intent learning, which aims to learn users' intents for user understanding and item recommendation, has become a hot research spot in recent years. However, existing methods suffer from complex and cumbersome alternating optimization, limiting performance and scalability. To this end, we propose a novel intent learning method termed \underline{ELCRec}, by unifying behavior representation learning into an \underline{E}nd-to-end \underline{L}earnable \underline{C}lustering framework, for effective and efficient \underline{Rec}ommendation. Concretely, we encode user behavior sequences and initialize the cluster centers (latent intents) as learnable neurons. Then, we design a novel learnable clustering module to separate different cluster centers, thus decoupling users' complex intents. Meanwhile, it guides the network to learn intents from behaviors by forcing behavior embeddings close to cluster centers. This allows simultaneous optimization of recommendation and clustering via mini-batch data. Moreover, we propose intent-assisted contrastive learning by using cluster centers as self-supervision signals, further enhancing mutual promotion. Both experimental results and theoretical analyses demonstrate the superiority of ELCRec from six perspectives. Compared to the runner-up, ELCRec improves NDCG@5 by 8.9\% and reduces computational costs by 22.5\% on the Beauty dataset. Furthermore, due to the scalability and universal applicability, we deploy this method on the industrial recommendation system with 130 million page views and achieve promising results. The codes are available on GitHub (https://github.com/yueliu1999/ELCRec). A collection (papers, codes, datasets) of deep group recommendation/intent learning methods is available on GitHub (https://github.com/yueliu1999/Awesome-Deep-Group-Recommendation).</description>

      <title>Pruning for Protection: Increasing Jailbreak Resistance in Aligned LLMs Without Fine-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10862v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the impact of model compression on the way Large Language Models (LLMs) process prompts, particularly concerning jailbreak resistance. We show that moderate WANDA pruning can enhance resistance to jailbreaking attacks without fine-tuning, while maintaining performance on standard benchmarks. To systematically evaluate this safety enhancement, we introduce a dataset of 225 harmful tasks across five categories. Our analysis of LLaMA-2 Chat, Vicuna 1.3, and Mistral Instruct v0.2 reveals that pruning benefits correlate with initial model safety levels. We interpret these results by examining changes in attention patterns and perplexity shifts, demonstrating that pruned models exhibit sharper attention and increased sensitivity to artificial jailbreak constructs. We extend our evaluation to the AdvBench harmful behavior tasks and the GCG attack method. We find that LLaMA-2 is much safer on AdvBench prompts than on our dataset when evaluated with manual jailbreak attempts, and that pruning is effective against both automated attacks and manual jailbreaking on Advbench.</description>

      <title>Self-Labeling the Job Shop Scheduling Problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.11849v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work proposes a self-supervised training strategy designed for combinatorial problems. An obstacle in applying supervised paradigms to such problems is the need for costly target solutions often produced with exact solvers. Inspired by semi- and self-supervised learning, we show that generative models can be trained by sampling multiple solutions and using the best one according to the problem objective as a pseudo-label. In this way, we iteratively improve the model generation capability by relying only on its self-supervision, eliminating the need for optimality information. We validate this Self-Labeling Improvement Method (SLIM) on the Job Shop Scheduling (JSP), a complex combinatorial problem that is receiving much attention from the neural combinatorial community. We propose a generative model based on the well-known Pointer Network and train it with SLIM. Experiments on popular benchmarks demonstrate the potential of this approach as the resulting models outperform constructive heuristics and state-of-the-art learning proposals for the JSP. Lastly, we prove the robustness of SLIM to various parameters and its generality by applying it to the Traveling Salesman Problem.</description>

      <title>Factuality of Large Language Models: A Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02420v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), especially when instruction-tuned for chat, have become part of our daily lives, freeing people from the process of searching, extracting, and integrating information from multiple sources by offering a straightforward answer to a variety of questions in a single place. Unfortunately, in many cases, LLM responses are factually incorrect, which limits their applicability in real-world scenarios. As a result, research on evaluating and improving the factuality of LLMs has attracted a lot of attention recently. In this survey, we critically analyze existing work with the aim to identify the major challenges and their associated causes, pointing out to potential solutions for improving the factuality of LLMs, and analyzing the obstacles to automated factuality evaluation for open-ended text generation. We further offer an outlook on where future research should go.</description>

      <title>Learning from Teaching Regularization: Generalizable Correlations Should be Easy to Imitate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02769v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generalization remains a central challenge in machine learning. In this work, we propose Learning from Teaching (LoT), a novel regularization technique for deep neural networks to enhance generalization. Inspired by the human ability to capture concise and abstract patterns, we hypothesize that generalizable correlations are expected to be easier to imitate. LoT operationalizes this concept to improve the generalization of the main model with auxiliary student learners. The student learners are trained by the main model and, in turn, provide feedback to help the main model capture more generalizable and imitable correlations. Our experimental results across several domains, including Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, and methodologies like Reinforcement Learning, demonstrate that the introduction of LoT brings significant benefits compared to training models on the original dataset. The results suggest the effectiveness and efficiency of LoT in identifying generalizable information at the right scales while discarding spurious data correlations, thus making LoT a valuable addition to current machine learning.

      <title>Discovery of the Hidden World with Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03941v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Revealing the underlying causal mechanisms in the real world is the key to the development of science. Despite the progress in the past decades, traditional causal discovery approaches (CDs) mainly rely on high-quality measured variables, usually given by human experts, to find causal relations. The lack of well-defined high-level variables in many real-world applications has already been a longstanding roadblock to a broader application of CDs. To this end, this paper presents Causal representatiOn AssistanT (COAT) that introduces large language models (LLMs) to bridge the gap. LLMs are trained on massive observations of the world and have demonstrated great capability in extracting key information from unstructured data. Therefore, it is natural to employ LLMs to assist with proposing useful high-level factors and crafting their measurements. Meanwhile, COAT also adopts CDs to find causal relations among the identified variables as well as to provide feedback to LLMs to iteratively refine the proposed factors. We show that LLMs and CDs are mutually beneficial and the constructed feedback provably also helps with the factor proposal. We construct and curate several synthetic and real-world benchmarks including analysis of human reviews and diagnosis of neuropathic and brain tumors, to comprehensively evaluate COAT. Extensive empirical results confirm the effectiveness and reliability of COAT with significant improvements.</description>

      <title>DiffTORI: Differentiable Trajectory Optimization for Deep Reinforcement and Imitation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05421v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces DiffTORI, which utilizes Differentiable Trajectory Optimization as the policy representation to generate actions for deep Reinforcement and Imitation learning. Trajectory optimization is a powerful and widely used algorithm in control, parameterized by a cost and a dynamics function. The key to our approach is to leverage the recent progress in differentiable trajectory optimization, which enables computing the gradients of the loss with respect to the parameters of trajectory optimization. As a result, the cost and dynamics functions of trajectory optimization can be learned end-to-end. DiffTORI addresses the ``objective mismatch'' issue of prior model-based RL algorithms, as the dynamics model in DiffTORI is learned to directly maximize task performance by differentiating the policy gradient loss through the trajectory optimization process. We further benchmark DiffTORI for imitation learning on standard robotic manipulation task suites with high-dimensional sensory observations and compare our method to feed-forward policy classes as well as Energy-Based Models (EBM) and Diffusion. Across 15 model-based RL tasks and 35 imitation learning tasks with high-dimensional image and point cloud inputs, DiffTORI outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods in both domains.</description>

      <title>Fight Back Against Jailbreaking via Prompt Adversarial Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06255v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved tremendous success in various applications, they are also susceptible to jailbreaking attacks. Several primary defense strategies have been proposed to protect LLMs from producing harmful information, mostly focusing on model fine-tuning or heuristical defense designs. However, how to achieve intrinsic robustness through prompt optimization remains an open problem. In this paper, motivated by adversarial training paradigms for achieving reliable robustness, we propose an approach named Prompt Adversarial Tuning (PAT) that trains a prompt control attached to the user prompt as a guard prefix. To achieve our defense goal whilst maintaining natural performance, we optimize the control prompt with both adversarial and benign prompts. Comprehensive experiments show that our method is effective against both grey-box and black-box attacks, reducing the success rate of advanced attacks to nearly 0%, while maintaining the model's utility on the benign task and incurring only negligible computational overhead, charting a new perspective for future explorations in LLM security. Our code is available at https://github.com/PKU-ML/PAT.</description>

      <title>NeuralSolver: Learning Algorithms For Consistent and Efficient Extrapolation Across General Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15393v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We contribute NeuralSolver, a novel recurrent solver that can efficiently and consistently extrapolate, i.e., learn algorithms from smaller problems (in terms of observation size) and execute those algorithms in large problems. Contrary to previous recurrent solvers, NeuralSolver can be naturally applied in both same-size problems, where the input and output sizes are the same, and in different-size problems, where the size of the input and output differ. To allow for this versatility, we design NeuralSolver with three main components: a recurrent module, that iteratively processes input information at different scales, a processing module, responsible for aggregating the previously processed information, and a curriculum-based training scheme, that improves the extrapolation performance of the method. To evaluate our method we introduce a set of novel different-size tasks and we show that NeuralSolver consistently outperforms the prior state-of-the-art recurrent solvers in extrapolating to larger problems, considering smaller training problems and requiring less parameters than other approaches.</description>

      <title>Faster Neighborhood Attention: Reducing the O(n^2) Cost of Self Attention at the Threadblock Level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04690v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neighborhood attention reduces the cost of self attention by restricting each token's attention span to its nearest neighbors. This restriction, parameterized by a window size and dilation factor, draws a spectrum of possible attention patterns between linear projection and self attention. Neighborhood attention, and more generally sliding window attention patterns, have long been bounded by infrastructure, particularly in higher-rank spaces (2-D and 3-D), calling for the development of custom kernels, which have been limited in either functionality, or performance, if not both. In this work, we aim to massively improve upon existing infrastructure by providing two new methods for implementing neighborhood attention. We first show that neighborhood attention can be represented as a batched GEMM problem, similar to standard attention, and implement it for 1-D and 2-D neighborhood attention. These kernels on average provide 895% and 272% improvement in full precision runtime compared to existing naive CUDA kernels for 1-D and 2-D neighborhood attention respectively. We find that aside from being heavily bound by memory bandwidth, certain inherent inefficiencies exist in all unfused implementations of neighborhood attention, which in most cases undo their theoretical efficiency gain. Motivated by the progress made into fused dot-product attention kernels, we developed fused neighborhood attention; an adaptation of fused dot-product attention kernels that allow fine-grained control over attention across different spatial axes. Known for reducing the quadratic time complexity of self attention to a linear complexity, neighborhood attention can now enjoy a reduced and constant memory footprint, and record-breaking half precision runtime. We observe that our fused implementation successfully circumvents some of the unavoidable inefficiencies in unfused implementations...</description>

      <title>ERBench: An Entity-Relationship based Automatically Verifiable Hallucination Benchmark for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05266v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved unprecedented performances in various applications, yet evaluating them is still challenging. Existing benchmarks are either manually constructed or are automatic, but lack the ability to evaluate the thought process of LLMs with arbitrary complexity. We contend that utilizing existing relational databases based on the entity-relationship (ER) model is a promising approach for constructing benchmarks as they contain structured knowledge that can be used to question LLMs. Unlike knowledge graphs, which are also used to evaluate LLMs, relational databases have integrity constraints that can be used to better construct complex in-depth questions and verify answers: (1) functional dependencies can be used to pinpoint critical keywords that an LLM must know to properly answer a given question containing certain attribute values; and (2) foreign key constraints can be used to join relations and construct multi-hop questions, which can be arbitrarily long and used to debug intermediate answers. We thus propose ERBench, which uses these integrity constraints to convert any database into an LLM benchmark. ERBench supports continuous evaluation as databases change, multimodal questions, and various prompt engineering techniques. In our experiments, we construct LLM benchmarks using databases of multiple domains and make an extensive comparison of contemporary LLMs. We show how ERBench can properly evaluate any LLM by not only checking for answer correctness, but also effectively verifying the rationales by looking for the right keywords.</description>

      <title>Policy Mirror Descent with Lookahead</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14156v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Policy Mirror Descent (PMD) stands as a versatile algorithmic framework encompassing several seminal policy gradient algorithms such as natural policy gradient, with connections with state-of-the-art reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms such as TRPO and PPO. PMD can be seen as a soft Policy Iteration algorithm implementing regularized 1-step greedy policy improvement. However, 1-step greedy policies might not be the best choice and recent remarkable empirical successes in RL such as AlphaGo and AlphaZero have demonstrated that greedy approaches with respect to multiple steps outperform their 1-step counterpart. In this work, we propose a new class of PMD algorithms called $h$-PMD which incorporates multi-step greedy policy improvement with lookahead depth $h$ to the PMD update rule. To solve discounted infinite horizon Markov Decision Processes with discount factor $\gamma$, we show that $h$-PMD which generalizes the standard PMD enjoys a faster dimension-free $\gamma^h$-linear convergence rate, contingent on the computation of multi-step greedy policies. We propose an inexact version of $h$-PMD where lookahead action values are estimated. Under a generative model, we establish a sample complexity for $h$-PMD which improves over prior work. Finally, we extend our result to linear function approximation to scale to large state spaces. Under suitable assumptions, our sample complexity only involves dependence on the dimension of the feature map space instead of the state space size.</description>

Abstract: Software process models are essential to facilitate collaboration and communication among software teams to solve complex development tasks. Inspired by these software engineering practices, we present FlowGen - a code generation framework that emulates software process models based on multiple Large Language Model (LLM) agents. We emulate three process models, FlowGenWaterfall, FlowGenTDD, and FlowGenScrum, by assigning LLM agents to embody roles (i.e., requirement engineer, architect, developer, tester, and scrum master) that correspond to everyday development activities and organize their communication patterns. The agents work collaboratively using chain-of-thought and prompt composition with continuous self-refinement to improve the code quality. We use GPT3.5 as our underlying LLM and several baselines (RawGPT, CodeT, Reflexion) to evaluate code generation on four benchmarks: HumanEval, HumanEval-ET, MBPP, and MBPP-ET. Our findings show that FlowGenScrum excels compared to other process models, achieving a Pass@1 of 75.2, 65.5, 82.5, and 56.7 in HumanEval, HumanEval-ET, MBPP, and MBPP-ET, respectively (an average of 15% improvement over RawGPT). Compared with other state-of-the-art techniques, FlowGenScrum achieves a higher Pass@1 in MBPP compared to CodeT, with both outperforming Reflexion. Notably, integrating CodeT into FlowGenScrum resulted in statistically significant improvements, achieving the highest Pass@1 scores. Our analysis also reveals that the development activities impacted code smell and exception handling differently, with design and code review adding more exception handling and reducing code smells. Finally, FlowGen models maintain stable Pass@1 scores across GPT3.5 versions and temperature values, highlighting the effectiveness of software process models in enhancing the quality and stability of LLM-generated code.</description>

      <title>Who Evaluates the Evaluations? Objectively Scoring Text-to-Image Prompt Coherence Metrics with T2IScoreScore (TS2)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04251v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With advances in the quality of text-to-image (T2I) models has come interest in benchmarking their prompt faithfulness -- the semantic coherence of generated images to the prompts they were conditioned on. A variety of T2I faithfulness metrics have been proposed, leveraging advances in cross-modal embeddings and vision-language models (VLMs). However, these metrics are not rigorously compared and benchmarked, instead presented with correlation to human Likert scores over a set of easy-to-discriminate images against seemingly weak baselines.
  We introduce T2IScoreScore, a curated set of semantic error graphs containing a prompt and a set of increasingly erroneous images. These allow us to rigorously judge whether a given prompt faithfulness metric can correctly order images with respect to their objective error count and significantly discriminate between different error nodes, using meta-metric scores derived from established statistical tests. Surprisingly, we find that the state-of-the-art VLM-based metrics (e.g., TIFA, DSG, LLMScore, VIEScore) we tested fail to significantly outperform simple (and supposedly worse) feature-based metrics like CLIPScore, particularly on a hard subset of naturally-occurring T2I model errors. TS2 will enable the development of better T2I prompt faithfulness metrics through more rigorous comparison of their conformity to expected orderings and separations under objective criteria.</description>

      <title>EPIC: Effective Prompting for Imbalanced-Class Data Synthesis in Tabular Data Classification via Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12404v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable in-context learning capabilities across diverse applications. In this work, we explore the effectiveness of LLMs for generating realistic synthetic tabular data, identifying key prompt design elements to optimize performance. We introduce EPIC, a novel approach that leverages balanced, grouped data samples and consistent formatting with unique variable mapping to guide LLMs in generating accurate synthetic data across all classes, even for imbalanced datasets. Evaluations on real-world datasets show that EPIC achieves state-of-the-art machine learning classification performance, significantly improving generation efficiency. These findings highlight the effectiveness of EPIC for synthetic tabular data generation, particularly in addressing class imbalance.

Abstract: Large Models (LMs) have heightened expectations for the potential of general AI as they are akin to human intelligence. This paper shows that recent large models such as Stable Diffusion and DALL-E3 also share the vulnerability of human intelligence, namely the "white bear phenomenon". We investigate the causes of the white bear phenomenon by analyzing their representation space. Based on this analysis, we propose a simple prompt-based attack method, which generates figures prohibited by the LM provider's policy. To counter these attacks, we introduce prompt-based defense strategies inspired by cognitive therapy techniques, successfully mitigating attacks by up to 48.22\%.</description>

      <title>A Theory of Synaptic Neural Balance: From Local to Global Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09688v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a general theory of synaptic neural balance and how it can emerge or be enforced in neural networks. For a given regularizer, a neuron is said to be in balance if the total cost of its input weights is equal to the total cost of its output weights. The basic example is provided by feedforward networks of ReLU units trained with $L_2$ regularizers, which exhibit balance after proper training. The theory explains this phenomenon and extends it in several directions. The first direction is the extension to bilinear and other activation functions. The second direction is the extension to more general regularizers, including all $L_p$ regularizers. The third direction is the extension to non-layered architectures, recurrent architectures, convolutional architectures, as well as architectures with mixed activation functions. Gradient descent on the error function alone does not converge in general to a balanced state, where every neuron is in balance, even when starting from a balanced state. However, gradient descent on the regularized error function ought to converge to a balanced state, and thus network balance can be used to assess learning progress. The theory is based on two local neuronal operations: scaling which is commutative, and balancing which is not commutative. Given any initial set of weights, when local balancing operations are applied to each neuron in a stochastic manner, global order always emerges through the convergence of the stochastic balancing algorithm to the same unique set of balanced weights. The reason for this is the existence of an underlying strictly convex optimization problem where the relevant variables are constrained to a linear, only architecture-dependent, manifold. Simulations show that balancing neurons prior to learning, or during learning in alternation with gradient descent steps, can improve learning speed and final performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10624v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a constrained Markov Decision Problem (CMDP) where the goal of an agent is to maximize the expected discounted sum of rewards over an infinite horizon while ensuring that the expected discounted sum of costs exceeds a certain threshold. Building on the idea of momentum-based acceleration, we develop the Primal-Dual Accelerated Natural Policy Gradient (PD-ANPG) algorithm that ensures an $\epsilon$ global optimality gap and $\epsilon$ constraint violation with $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}((1-\gamma)^{-7}\epsilon^{-2})$ sample complexity for general parameterized policies where $\gamma$ denotes the discount factor. This improves the state-of-the-art sample complexity in general parameterized CMDPs by a factor of $\mathcal{O}((1-\gamma)^{-1}\epsilon^{-2})$ and achieves the theoretical lower bound in $\epsilon^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>PipeFusion: Patch-level Pipeline Parallelism for Diffusion Transformers Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14430v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents PipeFusion, an innovative parallel methodology to tackle the high latency issues associated with generating high-resolution images using diffusion transformers (DiTs) models. PipeFusion partitions images into patches and the model layers across multiple GPUs. It employs a patch-level pipeline parallel strategy to orchestrate communication and computation efficiently. By capitalizing on the high similarity between inputs from successive diffusion steps, PipeFusion reuses one-step stale feature maps to provide context for the current pipeline step. This approach notably reduces communication costs compared to existing DiTs inference parallelism, including tensor parallel, sequence parallel and DistriFusion. PipeFusion also exhibits superior memory efficiency, because it can distribute model parameters across multiple devices, making it more suitable for DiTs with large parameter sizes, such as Flux.1. Experimental results demonstrate that PipeFusion achieves state-of-the-art performance on 8xL40 PCIe GPUs for Pixart, Stable-Diffusion 3 and Flux.1 models.Our Source code is available at https://github.com/xdit-project/xDiT.</description>

      <title>Fisher Flow Matching for Generative Modeling over Discrete Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14664v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative modeling over discrete data has recently seen numerous success stories, with applications spanning language modeling, biological sequence design, and graph-structured molecular data. The predominant generative modeling paradigm for discrete data is still autoregressive, with more recent alternatives based on diffusion or flow-matching falling short of their impressive performance in continuous data settings, such as image or video generation. In this work, we introduce Fisher-Flow, a novel flow-matching model for discrete data. Fisher-Flow takes a manifestly geometric perspective by considering categorical distributions over discrete data as points residing on a statistical manifold equipped with its natural Riemannian metric: the $\textit{Fisher-Rao metric}$. As a result, we demonstrate discrete data itself can be continuously reparameterised to points on the positive orthant of the $d$-hypersphere $\mathbb{S}^d_+$, which allows us to define flows that map any source distribution to target in a principled manner by transporting mass along (closed-form) geodesics of $\mathbb{S}^d_+$. Furthermore, the learned flows in Fisher-Flow can be further bootstrapped by leveraging Riemannian optimal transport leading to improved training dynamics. We prove that the gradient flow induced by Fisher-Flow is optimal in reducing the forward KL divergence. We evaluate Fisher-Flow on an array of synthetic and diverse real-world benchmarks, including designing DNA Promoter, and DNA Enhancer sequences. Empirically, we find that Fisher-Flow improves over prior diffusion and flow-matching models on these benchmarks.</description>

      <title>G3: An Effective and Adaptive Framework for Worldwide Geolocalization Using Large Multi-Modality Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14702v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Worldwide geolocalization aims to locate the precise location at the coordinate level of photos taken anywhere on the Earth. It is very challenging due to 1) the difficulty of capturing subtle location-aware visual semantics, and 2) the heterogeneous geographical distribution of image data. As a result, existing studies have clear limitations when scaled to a worldwide context. They may easily confuse distant images with similar visual contents, or cannot adapt to various locations worldwide with different amounts of relevant data. To resolve these limitations, we propose G3, a novel framework based on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). In particular, G3 consists of three steps, i.e., Geo-alignment, Geo-diversification, and Geo-verification to optimize both retrieval and generation phases of worldwide geolocalization. During Geo-alignment, our solution jointly learns expressive multi-modal representations for images, GPS and textual descriptions, which allows us to capture location-aware semantics for retrieving nearby images for a given query. During Geo-diversification, we leverage a prompt ensembling method that is robust to inconsistent retrieval performance for different image queries. Finally, we combine both retrieved and generated GPS candidates in Geo-verification for location prediction. Experiments on two well-established datasets IM2GPS3k and YFCC4k verify the superiority of G3 compared to other state-of-the-art methods. Our code and data are available online for reproduction.</description>

      <title>Implicit Personalization in Language Models: A Systematic Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14808v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Implicit Personalization (IP) is a phenomenon of language models inferring a user's background from the implicit cues in the input prompts and tailoring the response based on this inference. While previous work has touched upon various instances of this problem, there lacks a unified framework to study this behavior. This work systematically studies IP through a rigorous mathematical formulation, a multi-perspective moral reasoning framework, and a set of case studies. Our theoretical foundation for IP relies on a structural causal model and introduces a novel method, indirect intervention, to estimate the causal effect of a mediator variable that cannot be directly intervened upon. Beyond the technical approach, we also introduce a set of moral reasoning principles based on three schools of moral philosophy to study when IP may or may not be ethically appropriate. Equipped with both mathematical and ethical insights, we present three diverse case studies illustrating the varied nature of the IP problem and offer recommendations for future research. Our code is at https://github.com/jiarui-liu/IP, and our data is at https://huggingface.co/datasets/Jerry999/ImplicitPersonalizationData.</description>

      <title>Transfer Learning for Diffusion Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16876v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models, a specific type of generative model, have achieved unprecedented performance in recent years and consistently produce high-quality synthetic samples. A critical prerequisite for their notable success lies in the presence of a substantial number of training samples, which can be impractical in real-world applications due to high collection costs or associated risks. Consequently, various finetuning and regularization approaches have been proposed to transfer knowledge from existing pre-trained models to specific target domains with limited data. This paper introduces the Transfer Guided Diffusion Process (TGDP), a novel approach distinct from conventional finetuning and regularization methods. We prove that the optimal diffusion model for the target domain integrates pre-trained diffusion models on the source domain with additional guidance from a domain classifier. We further extend TGDP to a conditional version for modeling the joint distribution of data and its corresponding labels, together with two additional regularization terms to enhance the model performance. We validate the effectiveness of TGDP on both simulated and real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>Efficient multi-prompt evaluation of LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17202v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Most popular benchmarks for comparing LLMs rely on a limited set of prompt templates, which may not fully capture the LLMs' abilities and can affect the reproducibility of results on leaderboards. Many recent works empirically verify prompt sensitivity and advocate for changes in LLM evaluation. In this paper, we consider the problem of estimating the performance distribution across many prompt variants instead of finding a single prompt to evaluate with. We introduce PromptEval, a method for estimating performance across a large set of prompts borrowing strength across prompts and examples to produce accurate estimates under practical evaluation budgets. The resulting distribution can be used to obtain performance quantiles to construct various robust performance metrics (e.g., top 95% quantile or median). We prove that PromptEval consistently estimates the performance distribution and demonstrate its efficacy empirically on three prominent LLM benchmarks: MMLU, BIG-bench Hard, and LMentry; for example, PromptEval can accurately estimate performance quantiles across 100 prompt templates on MMLU with a budget equivalent to two single-prompt evaluations. Moreover, we show how PromptEval can be useful in LLM-as-a-judge and best prompt identification applications.</description>

      <title>TransVIP: Speech to Speech Translation System with Voice and Isochrony Preservation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17809v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is a rising interest and trend in research towards directly translating speech from one language to another, known as end-to-end speech-to-speech translation. However, most end-to-end models struggle to outperform cascade models, i.e., a pipeline framework by concatenating speech recognition, machine translation and text-to-speech models. The primary challenges stem from the inherent complexities involved in direct translation tasks and the scarcity of data. In this study, we introduce a novel model framework TransVIP that leverages diverse datasets in a cascade fashion yet facilitates end-to-end inference through joint probability. Furthermore, we propose two separated encoders to preserve the speaker's voice characteristics and isochrony from the source speech during the translation process, making it highly suitable for scenarios such as video dubbing. Our experiments on the French-English language pair demonstrate that our model outperforms the current state-of-the-art speech-to-speech translation model.</description>

      <title>Preference Learning Algorithms Do Not Learn Preference Rankings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19534v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Preference learning algorithms (e.g., RLHF and DPO) are frequently used to steer LLMs to produce generations that are more preferred by humans, but our understanding of their inner workings is still limited. In this work, we study the conventional wisdom that preference learning trains models to assign higher likelihoods to more preferred outputs than less preferred outputs, measured via ranking accuracy. Surprisingly, we find that most state-of-the-art preference-tuned models achieve a ranking accuracy of less than 60% on common preference datasets. We furthermore derive the idealized ranking accuracy that a preference-tuned LLM would achieve if it optimized the DPO or RLHF objective perfectly. We demonstrate that existing models exhibit a significant alignment gap -- i.e., a gap between the observed and idealized ranking accuracies. We attribute this discrepancy to the DPO objective, which is empirically and theoretically ill-suited to fix even mild ranking errors in the reference model, and derive a simple and efficient formula for quantifying the difficulty of learning a given preference datapoint. Finally, we demonstrate that ranking accuracy strongly correlates with the empirically popular win rate metric when the model is close to the reference model used in the objective, shedding further light on the differences between on-policy (e.g., RLHF) and off-policy (e.g., DPO) preference learning algorithms.</description>

      <title>Learning Image Priors through Patch-based Diffusion Models for Solving Inverse Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02462</link>

Abstract: Diffusion models can learn strong image priors from underlying data distribution and use them to solve inverse problems, but the training process is computationally expensive and requires lots of data. Such bottlenecks prevent most existing works from being feasible for high-dimensional and high-resolution data such as 3D images. This paper proposes a method to learn an efficient data prior for the entire image by training diffusion models only on patches of images. Specifically, we propose a patch-based position-aware diffusion inverse solver, called PaDIS, where we obtain the score function of the whole image through scores of patches and their positional encoding and utilize this as the prior for solving inverse problems. First of all, we show that this diffusion model achieves an improved memory efficiency and data efficiency while still maintaining the capability to generate entire images via positional encoding. Additionally, the proposed PaDIS model is highly flexible and can be plugged in with different diffusion inverse solvers (DIS). We demonstrate that the proposed PaDIS approach enables solving various inverse problems in both natural and medical image domains, including CT reconstruction, deblurring, and superresolution, given only patch-based priors. Notably, PaDIS outperforms previous DIS methods trained on entire image priors in the case of limited training data, demonstrating the data efficiency of our proposed approach by learning patch-based prior.</description>

      <title>M3LEO: A Multi-Modal, Multi-Label Earth Observation Dataset Integrating Interferometric SAR and Multispectral Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04230v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Satellite-based remote sensing has revolutionised the way we address global challenges. Huge quantities of Earth Observation (EO) data are generated by satellite sensors daily, but processing these large datasets for use in ML pipelines is technically and computationally challenging. While some preprocessed Earth observation datasets exist, their content is often limited to optical or near-optical wavelength data, which is ineffective at night or in adverse weather conditions. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), an active sensing technique based on microwave length radiation, offers a viable alternative. However, the application of machine learning to SAR has been limited due to a lack of ML-ready data and pipelines, particularly for the full diversity of SAR data, including polarimetry, coherence and interferometry. In this work, we introduce M3LEO, a multi-modal, multi-label Earth observation dataset that includes polarimetric, interferometric, and coherence SAR data derived from Sentinel-1, alongside multispectral Sentinel-2 imagery and auxiliary data describing terrain properties such as land use. M3LEO spans approximately 17M 4x4 km data chips from six diverse geographic regions. The dataset is complemented by a flexible PyTorch Lightning framework configured using Hydra to accommodate its use across diverse ML applications in Earth observation. We provide tools to process any dataset available on popular platforms such as Google Earth Engine for seamless integration with our framework. We show that the distribution shift in self-supervised embeddings is substantial across geographic regions, even when controlling for terrain properties.

      <title>BERTs are Generative In-Context Learners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04823v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While in-context learning is commonly associated with causal language models, such as GPT, we demonstrate that this capability also 'emerges' in masked language models. Through an embarrassingly simple inference technique, we enable an existing masked model, DeBERTa, to perform generative tasks without additional training or architectural changes. Our evaluation reveals that the masked and causal language models behave very differently, as they clearly outperform each other on different categories of tasks. These complementary strengths suggest that the field's focus on causal models for in-context learning may be limiting - both architectures can develop these capabilities, but with distinct advantages; pointing toward promising hybrid approaches that combine the strengths of both objectives.</description>

      <title>TLCM: Training-efficient Latent Consistency Model for Image Generation with 2-8 Steps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05768v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Distilling latent diffusion models (LDMs) into ones that are fast to sample from is attracting growing research interest. However, the majority of existing methods face two critical challenges: (1) They hinge on long training using a huge volume of real data. (2) They routinely lead to quality degradation for generation, especially in text-image alignment. This paper proposes a novel training-efficient Latent Consistency Model (TLCM) to overcome these challenges. Our method first accelerates LDMs via data-free multistep latent consistency distillation (MLCD), and then data-free latent consistency distillation is proposed to efficiently guarantee the inter-segment consistency in MLCD. Furthermore, we introduce bags of techniques, e.g., distribution matching, adversarial learning, and preference learning, to enhance TLCM's performance at few-step inference without any real data. TLCM demonstrates a high level of flexibility by enabling adjustment of sampling steps within the range of 2 to 8 while still producing competitive outputs compared to full-step approaches. Notably, TLCM enjoys the data-free merit by employing synthetic data from the teacher for distillation. With just 70 training hours on an A100 GPU, a 3-step TLCM distilled from SDXL achieves an impressive CLIP Score of 33.68 and an Aesthetic Score of 5.97 on the MSCOCO-2017 5K benchmark, surpassing various accelerated models and even outperforming the teacher model in human preference metrics. We also demonstrate the versatility of TLCMs in applications including image style transfer, controllable generation, and Chinese-to-image generation.</description>

      <title>MambaLRP: Explaining Selective State Space Sequence Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07592v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent sequence modeling approaches using selective state space sequence models, referred to as Mamba models, have seen a surge of interest. These models allow efficient processing of long sequences in linear time and are rapidly being adopted in a wide range of applications such as language modeling, demonstrating promising performance. To foster their reliable use in real-world scenarios, it is crucial to augment their transparency. Our work bridges this critical gap by bringing explainability, particularly Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP), to the Mamba architecture. Guided by the axiom of relevance conservation, we identify specific components in the Mamba architecture, which cause unfaithful explanations. To remedy this issue, we propose MambaLRP, a novel algorithm within the LRP framework, which ensures a more stable and reliable relevance propagation through these components. Our proposed method is theoretically sound and excels in achieving state-of-the-art explanation performance across a diverse range of models and datasets. Moreover, MambaLRP facilitates a deeper inspection of Mamba architectures, uncovering various biases and evaluating their significance. It also enables the analysis of previous speculations regarding the long-range capabilities of Mamba models.</description>

      <title>Large Language Model Unlearning via Embedding-Corrupted Prompts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07933v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have advanced to encompass extensive knowledge across diverse domains. Yet controlling what a large language model should not know is important for ensuring alignment and thus safe use. However, accurately and efficiently unlearning knowledge from an LLM remains challenging due to the potential collateral damage caused by the fuzzy boundary between retention and forgetting, and the large computational requirements for optimization across state-of-the-art models with hundreds of billions of parameters. In this work, we present \textbf{Embedding-COrrupted (ECO) Prompts}, a lightweight unlearning framework for large language models to address both the challenges of knowledge entanglement and unlearning efficiency. Instead of relying on the LLM itself to unlearn, we enforce an unlearned state during inference by employing a prompt classifier to identify and safeguard prompts to forget. We learn corruptions added to prompt embeddings via zeroth order optimization toward the unlearning objective offline and corrupt prompts flagged by the classifier during inference. We find that these embedding-corrupted prompts not only lead to desirable outputs that satisfy the unlearning objective but also closely approximate the output from a model that has never been trained on the data intended for forgetting. Through extensive experiments on unlearning, we demonstrate the superiority of our method in achieving promising unlearning at \textit{nearly zero side effects} in general domains and domains closely related to the unlearned ones. Additionally, we highlight the scalability of our method to 100 LLMs, ranging from 0.5B to 236B parameters, incurring no additional cost as the number of parameters increases. We have made our code publicly available at \url{https://github.com/chrisliu298/llm-unlearn-eco}.</description>

      <title>Ab Initio Structure Solutions from Nanocrystalline Powder Diffraction Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10796v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A major challenge in materials science is the determination of the structure of nanometer sized objects. Here we present a novel approach that uses a generative machine learning model based on diffusion processes that is trained on 45,229 known structures. The model factors both the measured diffraction pattern as well as relevant statistical priors on the unit cell of atomic cluster structures. Conditioned only on the chemical formula and the information-scarce finite-size broadened powder diffraction pattern, we find that our model, PXRDnet, can successfully solve simulated nanocrystals as small as 10 angstroms across 200 materials of varying symmetry and complexity, including structures from all seven crystal systems. We show that our model can successfully and verifiably determine structural candidates four out of five times, with average error among these candidates being only 7% (as measured by post-Rietveld refinement R-factor). Furthermore, PXRDnet is capable of solving structures from noisy diffraction patterns gathered in real-world experiments. We suggest that data driven approaches, bootstrapped from theoretical simulation, will ultimately provide a path towards determining the structure of previously unsolved nano-materials.</description>

      <title>Refusal in Language Models Is Mediated by a Single Direction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11717v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conversational large language models are fine-tuned for both instruction-following and safety, resulting in models that obey benign requests but refuse harmful ones. While this refusal behavior is widespread across chat models, its underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. In this work, we show that refusal is mediated by a one-dimensional subspace, across 13 popular open-source chat models up to 72B parameters in size. Specifically, for each model, we find a single direction such that erasing this direction from the model's residual stream activations prevents it from refusing harmful instructions, while adding this direction elicits refusal on even harmless instructions. Leveraging this insight, we propose a novel white-box jailbreak method that surgically disables refusal with minimal effect on other capabilities. Finally, we mechanistically analyze how adversarial suffixes suppress propagation of the refusal-mediating direction. Our findings underscore the brittleness of current safety fine-tuning methods. More broadly, our work showcases how an understanding of model internals can be leveraged to develop practical methods for controlling model behavior.</description>

      <title>NovoBench: Benchmarking Deep Learning-based De Novo Peptide Sequencing Methods in Proteomics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11906v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tandem mass spectrometry has played a pivotal role in advancing proteomics, enabling the high-throughput analysis of protein composition in biological tissues. Many deep learning methods have been developed for \emph{de novo} peptide sequencing task, i.e., predicting the peptide sequence for the observed mass spectrum. However, two key challenges seriously hinder the further advancement of this important task. Firstly, since there is no consensus for the evaluation datasets, the empirical results in different research papers are often not comparable, leading to unfair comparison. Secondly, the current methods are usually limited to amino acid-level or peptide-level precision and recall metrics. In this work, we present the first unified benchmark NovoBench for \emph{de novo} peptide sequencing, which comprises diverse mass spectrum data, integrated models, and comprehensive evaluation metrics. Recent impressive methods, including DeepNovo, PointNovo, Casanovo, InstaNovo, AdaNovo and $\pi$-HelixNovo are integrated into our framework. In addition to amino acid-level and peptide-level precision and recall, we evaluate the models' performance in terms of identifying post-tranlational modifications (PTMs), efficiency and robustness to peptide length, noise peaks and missing fragment ratio, which are important influencing factors while seldom be considered. Leveraging this benchmark, we conduct a large-scale study of current methods, report many insightful findings that open up new possibilities for future development.</description>

      <title>DistillNeRF: Perceiving 3D Scenes from Single-Glance Images by Distilling Neural Fields and Foundation Model Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12095v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose DistillNeRF, a self-supervised learning framework addressing the challenge of understanding 3D environments from limited 2D observations in outdoor autonomous driving scenes. Our method is a generalizable feedforward model that predicts a rich neural scene representation from sparse, single-frame multi-view camera inputs with limited view overlap, and is trained self-supervised with differentiable rendering to reconstruct RGB, depth, or feature images. Our first insight is to exploit per-scene optimized Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) by generating dense depth and virtual camera targets from them, which helps our model to learn enhanced 3D geometry from sparse non-overlapping image inputs. Second, to learn a semantically rich 3D representation, we propose distilling features from pre-trained 2D foundation models, such as CLIP or DINOv2, thereby enabling various downstream tasks without the need for costly 3D human annotations. To leverage these two insights, we introduce a novel model architecture with a two-stage lift-splat-shoot encoder and a parameterized sparse hierarchical voxel representation. Experimental results on the NuScenes and Waymo NOTR datasets demonstrate that DistillNeRF significantly outperforms existing comparable state-of-the-art self-supervised methods for scene reconstruction, novel view synthesis, and depth estimation; and it allows for competitive zero-shot 3D semantic occupancy prediction, as well as open-world scene understanding through distilled foundation model features. Demos and code will be available at https://distillnerf.github.io/.</description>

      <title>TSI-Bench: Benchmarking Time Series Imputation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12747v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Effective imputation is a crucial preprocessing step for time series analysis. Despite the development of numerous deep learning algorithms for time series imputation, the community lacks standardized and comprehensive benchmark platforms to effectively evaluate imputation performance across different settings. Moreover, although many deep learning forecasting algorithms have demonstrated excellent performance, whether their modelling achievements can be transferred to time series imputation tasks remains unexplored. To bridge these gaps, we develop TSI-Bench, the first (to our knowledge) comprehensive benchmark suite for time series imputation utilizing deep learning techniques. The TSI-Bench pipeline standardizes experimental settings to enable fair evaluation of imputation algorithms and identification of meaningful insights into the influence of domain-appropriate missing rates and patterns on model performance. Furthermore, TSI-Bench innovatively provides a systematic paradigm to tailor time series forecasting algorithms for imputation purposes. Our extensive study across 34,804 experiments, 28 algorithms, and 8 datasets with diverse missingness scenarios demonstrates TSI-Bench's effectiveness in diverse downstream tasks and potential to unlock future directions in time series imputation research and analysis. All source code and experiment logs are released at https://github.com/WenjieDu/AwesomeImputation.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Hidden Structure of Self-Attention via Kernel Principal Component Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13762v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The remarkable success of transformers in sequence modeling tasks, spanning various applications in natural language processing and computer vision, is attributed to the critical role of self-attention. Similar to the development of most deep learning models, the construction of these attention mechanisms relies on heuristics and experience. In our work, we derive self-attention from kernel principal component analysis (kernel PCA) and show that self-attention projects its query vectors onto the principal component axes of its key matrix in a feature space. We then formulate the exact formula for the value matrix in self-attention, theoretically and empirically demonstrating that this value matrix captures the eigenvectors of the Gram matrix of the key vectors in self-attention. Leveraging our kernel PCA framework, we propose Attention with Robust Principal Components (RPC-Attention), a novel class of robust attention that is resilient to data contamination. We empirically demonstrate the advantages of RPC-Attention over softmax attention on the ImageNet-1K object classification, WikiText-103 language modeling, and ADE20K image segmentation task.</description>

      <title>VLM Agents Generate Their Own Memories: Distilling Experience into Embodied Programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14596v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large-scale generative language and vision-language models excel in in-context learning for decision making. However, they require high-quality exemplar demonstrations to be included in their context window. In this work, we ask: Can LLMs and VLMs generate their own examples from generic, sub-optimal demonstrations? We propose In-Context Abstraction Learning (ICAL), a method that builds a memory of multimodal experience from sub-optimal demonstrations and human feedback. Given a task demonstration that may contain inefficiencies or mistakes, a VLM abstracts the trajectory into a generalized program by correcting inefficient actions and annotating cognitive abstractions: causal relationships, object state changes, temporal subgoals, and task-relevant visual elements. These abstractions are iteratively improved through human feedback while the agent attempts to execute the trajectory. The resulting examples, when used as exemplars in the prompt, significantly improve decision-making in retrieval-augmented LLM and VLM agents. Moreover, as the agent's library of examples grows, it becomes more efficient, relying less on human feedback and requiring fewer environment interactions per demonstration. Our ICAL agent surpasses the state-of-the-art in dialogue-based instruction following in TEACh, multimodal web agents in VisualWebArena, and action anticipation in Ego4D. In TEACh, we achieve a 12.6% improvement in goal-condition success. In VisualWebArena, our task success rate improves over the SOTA from 14.3% to 22.7% using GPT4V. In Ego4D action forecasting, we improve over few-shot GPT-4V and remain competitive with supervised models. We show finetuning our retrieval-augmented in-context agent yields additional improvements. Our approach significantly reduces reliance on manual prompt engineering and consistently outperforms in-context learning from action plans that lack such abstractions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14657v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce OpenDebateEvidence, a comprehensive dataset for argument mining and summarization sourced from the American Competitive Debate community. This dataset includes over 3.5 million documents with rich metadata, making it one of the most extensive collections of debate evidence. OpenDebateEvidence captures the complexity of arguments in high school and college debates, providing valuable resources for training and evaluation. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of fine-tuning state-of-the-art large language models for argumentative abstractive summarization across various methods, models, and datasets. By providing this comprehensive resource, we aim to advance computational argumentation and support practical applications for debaters, educators, and researchers. OpenDebateEvidence is publicly available to support further research and innovation in computational argumentation. Access it here: https://huggingface.co/datasets/Yusuf5/OpenCaselist</description>

      <title>NAVSIM: Data-Driven Non-Reactive Autonomous Vehicle Simulation and Benchmarking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15349v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Benchmarking vision-based driving policies is challenging. On one hand, open-loop evaluation with real data is easy, but these results do not reflect closed-loop performance. On the other, closed-loop evaluation is possible in simulation, but is hard to scale due to its significant computational demands. Further, the simulators available today exhibit a large domain gap to real data. This has resulted in an inability to draw clear conclusions from the rapidly growing body of research on end-to-end autonomous driving. In this paper, we present NAVSIM, a middle ground between these evaluation paradigms, where we use large datasets in combination with a non-reactive simulator to enable large-scale real-world benchmarking. Specifically, we gather simulation-based metrics, such as progress and time to collision, by unrolling bird's eye view abstractions of the test scenes for a short simulation horizon. Our simulation is non-reactive, i.e., the evaluated policy and environment do not influence each other. As we demonstrate empirically, this decoupling allows open-loop metric computation while being better aligned with closed-loop evaluations than traditional displacement errors. NAVSIM enabled a new competition held at CVPR 2024, where 143 teams submitted 463 entries, resulting in several new insights. On a large set of challenging scenarios, we observe that simple methods with moderate compute requirements such as TransFuser can match recent large-scale end-to-end driving architectures such as UniAD. Our modular framework can potentially be extended with new datasets, data curation strategies, and metrics, and will be continually maintained to host future challenges. Our code is available at https://github.com/autonomousvision/navsim.</description>

      <title>ProgressGym: Alignment with a Millennium of Moral Progress</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.20087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.20087v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Frontier AI systems, including large language models (LLMs), hold increasing influence over the epistemology of human users. Such influence can reinforce prevailing societal values, potentially contributing to the lock-in of misguided moral beliefs and, consequently, the perpetuation of problematic moral practices on a broad scale. We introduce progress alignment as a technical solution to mitigate this imminent risk. Progress alignment algorithms learn to emulate the mechanics of human moral progress, thereby addressing the susceptibility of existing alignment methods to contemporary moral blindspots. To empower research in progress alignment, we introduce ProgressGym, an experimental framework allowing the learning of moral progress mechanics from history, in order to facilitate future progress in real-world moral decisions. Leveraging 9 centuries of historical text and 18 historical LLMs, ProgressGym enables codification of real-world progress alignment challenges into concrete benchmarks. Specifically, we introduce three core challenges: tracking evolving values (PG-Follow), preemptively anticipating moral progress (PG-Predict), and regulating the feedback loop between human and AI value shifts (PG-Coevolve). Alignment methods without a temporal dimension are inapplicable to these tasks. In response, we present lifelong and extrapolative algorithms as baseline methods of progress alignment, and build an open leaderboard soliciting novel algorithms and challenges. The framework and the leaderboard are available at https://github.com/PKU-Alignment/ProgressGym and https://huggingface.co/spaces/PKU-Alignment/ProgressGym-LeaderBoard respectively.</description>

      <title>OmniJARVIS: Unified Vision-Language-Action Tokenization Enables Open-World Instruction Following Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00114v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents OmniJARVIS, a novel Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model for open-world instruction-following agents in Minecraft. Compared to prior works that either emit textual goals to separate controllers or produce the control command directly, OmniJARVIS seeks a different path to ensure both strong reasoning and efficient decision-making capabilities via unified tokenization of multimodal interaction data. First, we introduce a self-supervised approach to learn a behavior encoder that produces discretized tokens for behavior trajectories $\tau = \{o_0, a_0, \dots\}$ and an imitation learning policy decoder conditioned on these tokens. These additional behavior tokens will be augmented to the vocabulary of pretrained Multimodal Language Models. With this encoder, we then pack long-term multimodal interactions involving task instructions, memories, thoughts, observations, textual responses, behavior trajectories, etc into unified token sequences and model them with autoregressive transformers. Thanks to the semantically meaningful behavior tokens, the resulting VLA model, OmniJARVIS, can reason (by producing chain-of-thoughts), plan, answer questions, and act (by producing behavior tokens for the imitation learning policy decoder). OmniJARVIS demonstrates excellent performances on a comprehensive collection of atomic, programmatic, and open-ended tasks in open-world Minecraft. Our analysis further unveils the crucial design principles in interaction data formation, unified tokenization, and its scaling potentials. The dataset, models, and code will be released at https://craftjarvis.org/OmniJARVIS.</description>

      <title>Maximum Entropy Inverse Reinforcement Learning of Diffusion Models with Energy-Based Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00626v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a maximum entropy inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) approach for improving the sample quality of diffusion generative models, especially when the number of generation time steps is small. Similar to how IRL trains a policy based on the reward function learned from expert demonstrations, we train (or fine-tune) a diffusion model using the log probability density estimated from training data. Since we employ an energy-based model (EBM) to represent the log density, our approach boils down to the joint training of a diffusion model and an EBM. Our IRL formulation, named Diffusion by Maximum Entropy IRL (DxMI), is a minimax problem that reaches equilibrium when both models converge to the data distribution. The entropy maximization plays a key role in DxMI, facilitating the exploration of the diffusion model and ensuring the convergence of the EBM. We also propose Diffusion by Dynamic Programming (DxDP), a novel reinforcement learning algorithm for diffusion models, as a subroutine in DxMI. DxDP makes the diffusion model update in DxMI efficient by transforming the original problem into an optimal control formulation where value functions replace back-propagation in time. Our empirical studies show that diffusion models fine-tuned using DxMI can generate high-quality samples in as few as 4 and 10 steps. Additionally, DxMI enables the training of an EBM without MCMC, stabilizing EBM training dynamics and enhancing anomaly detection performance.</description>

      <title>On Statistical Rates and Provably Efficient Criteria of Latent Diffusion Transformers (DiTs)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01079v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the statistical and computational limits of latent Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) under the low-dimensional linear latent space assumption. Statistically, we study the universal approximation and sample complexity of the DiTs score function, as well as the distribution recovery property of the initial data. Specifically, under mild data assumptions, we derive an approximation error bound for the score network of latent DiTs, which is sub-linear in the latent space dimension. Additionally, we derive the corresponding sample complexity bound and show that the data distribution generated from the estimated score function converges toward a proximate area of the original one. Computationally, we characterize the hardness of both forward inference and backward computation of latent DiTs, assuming the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH). For forward inference, we identify efficient criteria for all possible latent DiTs inference algorithms and showcase our theory by pushing the efficiency toward almost-linear time inference. For backward computation, we leverage the low-rank structure within the gradient computation of DiTs training for possible algorithmic speedup. Specifically, we show that such speedup achieves almost-linear time latent DiTs training by casting the DiTs gradient as a series of chained low-rank approximations with bounded error. Under the low-dimensional assumption, we show that the statistical rates and the computational efficiency are all dominated by the dimension of the subspace, suggesting that latent DiTs have the potential to bypass the challenges associated with the high dimensionality of initial data.</description>

      <title>Text-Aware Diffusion for Policy Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01903v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Training an agent to achieve particular goals or perform desired behaviors is often accomplished through reinforcement learning, especially in the absence of expert demonstrations. However, supporting novel goals or behaviors through reinforcement learning requires the ad-hoc design of appropriate reward functions, which quickly becomes intractable. To address this challenge, we propose Text-Aware Diffusion for Policy Learning (TADPoLe), which uses a pretrained, frozen text-conditioned diffusion model to compute dense zero-shot reward signals for text-aligned policy learning. We hypothesize that large-scale pretrained generative models encode rich priors that can supervise a policy to behave not only in a text-aligned manner, but also in alignment with a notion of naturalness summarized from internet-scale training data. In our experiments, we demonstrate that TADPoLe is able to learn policies for novel goal-achievement and continuous locomotion behaviors specified by natural language, in both Humanoid and Dog environments. The behaviors are learned zero-shot without ground-truth rewards or expert demonstrations, and are qualitatively more natural according to human evaluation. We further show that TADPoLe performs competitively when applied to robotic manipulation tasks in the Meta-World environment, without having access to any in-domain demonstrations.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Complex Instruction-Following with Multiple Constraints Composition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03978v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Instruction following is one of the fundamental capabilities of large language models (LLMs). As the ability of LLMs is constantly improving, they have been increasingly applied to deal with complex human instructions in real-world scenarios. Therefore, how to evaluate the ability of complex instruction-following of LLMs has become a critical research problem. Existing benchmarks mainly focus on modeling different types of constraints in human instructions while neglecting the composition of different constraints, which is an indispensable constituent in complex instructions. To this end, we propose ComplexBench, a benchmark for comprehensively evaluating the ability of LLMs to follow complex instructions composed of multiple constraints. We propose a hierarchical taxonomy for complex instructions, including 4 constraint types, 19 constraint dimensions, and 4 composition types, and manually collect a high-quality dataset accordingly. To make the evaluation reliable, we augment LLM-based evaluators with rules to effectively verify whether generated texts can satisfy each constraint and composition. Furthermore, we obtain the final evaluation score based on the dependency structure determined by different composition types. ComplexBench identifies significant deficiencies in existing LLMs when dealing with complex instructions with multiple constraints composition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05516v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While significant advancements have been made in music generation and differentiable sound synthesis within machine learning and computer audition, the simulation of instrument vibration guided by physical laws has been underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce a novel model for simulating the spatio-temporal motion of nonlinear strings, integrating modal synthesis and spectral modeling within a neural network framework. Our model leverages physical properties and fundamental frequencies as inputs, outputting string states across time and space that solve the partial differential equation characterizing the nonlinear string. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that the proposed architecture achieves superior accuracy in string motion simulation compared to existing baseline architectures. The code and demo are available online.</description>

      <title>H-STAR: LLM-driven Hybrid SQL-Text Adaptive Reasoning on Tables</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05952v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tabular reasoning involves interpreting natural language queries about tabular data, which presents a unique challenge of combining language understanding with structured data analysis. Existing methods employ either textual reasoning, which excels in semantic interpretation but struggles with mathematical operations, or symbolic reasoning, which handles computations well but lacks semantic understanding. This paper introduces a novel algorithm H-STAR that integrates both symbolic and semantic (textual) approaches in a two-stage process to address these limitations. H-STAR employs: (1) step-wise table extraction using `multi-view' column retrieval followed by row extraction, and (2) adaptive reasoning that adapts reasoning strategies based on question types, utilizing semantic reasoning for direct lookup and complex lexical queries while augmenting textual reasoning with symbolic reasoning support for quantitative and logical tasks. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that H-STAR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods across three tabular question-answering (QA) and fact-verification datasets, underscoring its effectiveness and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Subject-driven Text-to-Image Generation via Preference-based Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12164v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Text-to-image generative models have recently attracted considerable interest, enabling the synthesis of high-quality images from textual prompts. However, these models often lack the capability to generate specific subjects from given reference images or to synthesize novel renditions under varying conditions. Methods like DreamBooth and Subject-driven Text-to-Image (SuTI) have made significant progress in this area. Yet, both approaches primarily focus on enhancing similarity to reference images and require expensive setups, often overlooking the need for efficient training and avoiding overfitting to the reference images. In this work, we present the $\lambda$-Harmonic reward function, which provides a reliable reward signal and enables early stopping for faster training and effective regularization. By combining the Bradley-Terry preference model, the $\lambda$-Harmonic reward function also provides preference labels for subject-driven generation tasks. We propose Reward Preference Optimization (RPO), which offers a simpler setup (requiring only $3\%$ of the negative samples used by DreamBooth) and fewer gradient steps for fine-tuning. Unlike most existing methods, our approach does not require training a text encoder or optimizing text embeddings and achieves text-image alignment by fine-tuning only the U-Net component. Empirically, $\lambda$-Harmonic proves to be a reliable approach for model selection in subject-driven generation tasks. Based on preference labels and early stopping validation from the $\lambda$-Harmonic reward function, our algorithm achieves a state-of-the-art CLIP-I score of 0.833 and a CLIP-T score of 0.314 on DreamBench.</description>

      <title>Embracing Events and Frames with Hierarchical Feature Refinement Network for Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12582v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In frame-based vision, object detection faces substantial performance degradation under challenging conditions due to the limited sensing capability of conventional cameras. Event cameras output sparse and asynchronous events, providing a potential solution to solve these problems. However, effectively fusing two heterogeneous modalities remains an open issue. In this work, we propose a novel hierarchical feature refinement network for event-frame fusion. The core concept is the design of the coarse-to-fine fusion module, denoted as the cross-modality adaptive feature refinement (CAFR) module. In the initial phase, the bidirectional cross-modality interaction (BCI) part facilitates information bridging from two distinct sources. Subsequently, the features are further refined by aligning the channel-level mean and variance in the two-fold adaptive feature refinement (TAFR) part. We conducted extensive experiments on two benchmarks: the low-resolution PKU-DDD17-Car dataset and the high-resolution DSEC dataset. Experimental results show that our method surpasses the state-of-the-art by an impressive margin of $\textbf{8.0}\%$ on the DSEC dataset. Besides, our method exhibits significantly better robustness (\textbf{69.5}\% versus \textbf{38.7}\%) when introducing 15 different corruption types to the frame images. The code can be found at the link (https://github.com/HuCaoFighting/FRN).</description>

      <title>FSP-Laplace: Function-Space Priors for the Laplace Approximation in Bayesian Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13711v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Laplace approximations are popular techniques for endowing deep networks with epistemic uncertainty estimates as they can be applied without altering the predictions of the trained network, and they scale to large models and datasets. While the choice of prior strongly affects the resulting posterior distribution, computational tractability and lack of interpretability of the weight space typically limit the Laplace approximation to isotropic Gaussian priors, which are known to cause pathological behavior as depth increases. As a remedy, we directly place a prior on function space. More precisely, since Lebesgue densities do not exist on infinite-dimensional function spaces, we recast training as finding the so-called weak mode of the posterior measure under a Gaussian process (GP) prior restricted to the space of functions representable by the neural network. Through the GP prior, one can express structured and interpretable inductive biases, such as regularity or periodicity, directly in function space, while still exploiting the implicit inductive biases that allow deep networks to generalize. After model linearization, the training objective induces a negative log-posterior density to which we apply a Laplace approximation, leveraging highly scalable methods from matrix-free linear algebra. Our method provides improved results where prior knowledge is abundant (as is the case in many scientific inference tasks). At the same time, it stays competitive for black-box supervised learning problems, where neural networks typically excel.</description>

Abstract: One important property of DIstribution Correction Estimation (DICE) methods is that the solution is the optimal stationary distribution ratio between the optimized and data collection policy. In this work, we show that DICE-based methods can be viewed as a transformation from the behavior distribution to the optimal policy distribution. Based on this, we propose a novel approach, Diffusion-DICE, that directly performs this transformation using diffusion models. We find that the optimal policy's score function can be decomposed into two terms: the behavior policy's score function and the gradient of a guidance term which depends on the optimal distribution ratio. The first term can be obtained from a diffusion model trained on the dataset and we propose an in-sample learning objective to learn the second term. Due to the multi-modality contained in the optimal policy distribution, the transformation in Diffusion-DICE may guide towards those local-optimal modes. We thus generate a few candidate actions and carefully select from them to approach global-optimum. Different from all other diffusion-based offline RL methods, the guide-then-select paradigm in Diffusion-DICE only uses in-sample actions for training and brings minimal error exploitation in the value function. We use a didatic toycase example to show how previous diffusion-based methods fail to generate optimal actions due to leveraging these errors and how Diffusion-DICE successfully avoids that. We then conduct extensive experiments on benchmark datasets to show the strong performance of Diffusion-DICE. Project page at https://ryanxhr.github.io/Diffusion-DICE/.</description>

      <title>Breaking the Hourglass Phenomenon of Residual Quantization: Enhancing the Upper Bound of Generative Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21488v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative retrieval (GR) has emerged as a transformative paradigm in search and recommender systems, leveraging numeric-based identifier representations to enhance efficiency and generalization. Notably, methods like TIGER employing Residual Quantization-based Semantic Identifiers (RQ-SID), have shown significant promise in e-commerce scenarios by effectively managing item IDs. However, a critical issue termed the "\textbf{Hourglass}" phenomenon, occurs in RQ-SID, where intermediate codebook tokens become overly concentrated, hindering the full utilization of generative retrieval methods. This paper analyses and addresses this problem by identifying data sparsity and long-tailed distribution as the primary causes. Through comprehensive experiments and detailed ablation studies, we analyze the impact of these factors on codebook utilization and data distribution. Our findings reveal that the "Hourglass" phenomenon substantially impacts the performance of RQ-SID in generative retrieval. We propose effective solutions to mitigate this issue, thereby significantly enhancing the effectiveness of generative retrieval in real-world E-commerce applications.</description>

      <title>Large Model Strategic Thinking, Small Model Efficiency: Transferring Theory of Mind in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05241v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As the performance of larger, newer Large Language Models continues to improve for strategic Theory of Mind (ToM) tasks, the demand for these state-of-the-art models increases commensurately. However, their deployment is costly both in terms of processing power and time. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of creating smaller, highly-performing specialized algorithms by way of fine-tuning. To do this, we first present a large pre-trained model with 20 unique scenarios that combine different social contexts with games of varying social dilemmas, record its answers, and use them for Q&amp;A fine-tuning on a smaller model of the same family. Our focus is on in-context game-theoretic decision-making, the same domain within which human interaction occurs and that requires both a theory of mind (or a semblance thereof) and an understanding of social dynamics. The smaller model is therefore trained not just on the answers provided, but also on the motivations provided by the larger model, which should contain advice and guidelines to navigate both strategic dilemmas and social cues. We find that the fine-tuned smaller language model consistently bridged the gap in performance between the smaller pre-trained version of the model and its larger relative and that its improvements extended in areas and contexts beyond the ones provided in the training examples, including on out-of-sample scenarios that include completely different game structures. On average for all games, through fine-tuning, the smaller model showed a 46% improvement measured as alignment towards the behavior of the larger model, with 100% representing indistinguishable behavior. When presented with out-of-sample social contexts and games, the fine-tuned model still displays remarkable levels of alignment, reaching an improvement of 18% and 28% respectively.</description>

      <title>A Survey of the Self Supervised Learning Mechanisms for Vision Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17059v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep supervised learning models require high volume of labeled data to attain sufficiently good results. Although, the practice of gathering and annotating such big data is costly and laborious. Recently, the application of self supervised learning (SSL) in vision tasks has gained significant attention. The intuition behind SSL is to exploit the synchronous relationships within the data as a form of self-supervision, which can be versatile. In the current big data era, most of the data is unlabeled, and the success of SSL thus relies in finding ways to utilize this vast amount of unlabeled data available. Thus it is better for deep learning algorithms to reduce reliance on human supervision and instead focus on self-supervision based on the inherent relationships within the data. With the advent of ViTs, which have achieved remarkable results in computer vision, it is crucial to explore and understand the various SSL mechanisms employed for training these models specifically in scenarios where there is limited labelled data available. In this survey, we develop a comprehensive taxonomy of systematically classifying the SSL techniques based upon their representations and pre-training tasks being applied. Additionally, we discuss the motivations behind SSL, review popular pre-training tasks, and highlight the challenges and advancements in this field. Furthermore, we present a comparative analysis of different SSL methods, evaluate their strengths and limitations, and identify potential avenues for future research.</description>

      <title>Seemingly Plausible Distractors in Multi-Hop Reasoning: Are Large Language Models Attentive Readers?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05197v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: State-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) are accredited with an increasing number of different capabilities, ranging from reading comprehension, over advanced mathematical and reasoning skills to possessing scientific knowledge. In this paper we focus on their multi-hop reasoning capability: the ability to identify and integrate information from multiple textual sources.
  Given the concerns with the presence of simplifying cues in existing multi-hop reasoning benchmarks, which allow models to circumvent the reasoning requirement, we set out to investigate, whether LLMs are prone to exploiting such simplifying cues. We find evidence that they indeed circumvent the requirement to perform multi-hop reasoning, but they do so in more subtle ways than what was reported about their fine-tuned pre-trained language model (PLM) predecessors. Motivated by this finding, we propose a challenging multi-hop reasoning benchmark, by generating seemingly plausible multi-hop reasoning chains, which ultimately lead to incorrect answers. We evaluate multiple open and proprietary state-of-the-art LLMs, and find that their performance to perform multi-hop reasoning is affected, as indicated by up to 45% relative decrease in F1 score when presented with such seemingly plausible alternatives. We conduct a deeper analysis and find evidence that while LLMs tend to ignore misleading lexical cues, misleading reasoning paths indeed present a significant challenge.</description>

      <title>SongCreator: Lyrics-based Universal Song Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06029v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Music is an integral part of human culture, embodying human intelligence and creativity, of which songs compose an essential part. While various aspects of song generation have been explored by previous works, such as singing voice, vocal composition and instrumental arrangement, etc., generating songs with both vocals and accompaniment given lyrics remains a significant challenge, hindering the application of music generation models in the real world. In this light, we propose SongCreator, a song-generation system designed to tackle this challenge. The model features two novel designs: a meticulously designed dual-sequence language model (DSLM) to capture the information of vocals and accompaniment for song generation, and a series of attention mask strategies for DSLM, which allows our model to understand, generate and edit songs, making it suitable for various songrelated generation tasks by utilizing specific attention masks. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of SongCreator by achieving state-of-the-art or competitive performances on all eight tasks. Notably, it surpasses previous works by a large margin in lyrics-to-song and lyrics-to-vocals. Additionally, it is able to independently control the acoustic conditions of the vocals and accompaniment in the generated song through different audio prompts, exhibiting its potential applicability. Our samples are available at https://thuhcsi.github.io/SongCreator/.</description>

      <title>ProbTalk3D: Non-Deterministic Emotion Controllable Speech-Driven 3D Facial Animation Synthesis Using VQ-VAE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07966v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Audio-driven 3D facial animation synthesis has been an active field of research with attention from both academia and industry. While there are promising results in this area, recent approaches largely focus on lip-sync and identity control, neglecting the role of emotions and emotion control in the generative process. That is mainly due to the lack of emotionally rich facial animation data and algorithms that can synthesize speech animations with emotional expressions at the same time. In addition, majority of the models are deterministic, meaning given the same audio input, they produce the same output motion. We argue that emotions and non-determinism are crucial to generate diverse and emotionally-rich facial animations. In this paper, we propose ProbTalk3D a non-deterministic neural network approach for emotion controllable speech-driven 3D facial animation synthesis using a two-stage VQ-VAE model and an emotionally rich facial animation dataset 3DMEAD. We provide an extensive comparative analysis of our model against the recent 3D facial animation synthesis approaches, by evaluating the results objectively, qualitatively, and with a perceptual user study. We highlight several objective metrics that are more suitable for evaluating stochastic outputs and use both in-the-wild and ground truth data for subjective evaluation. To our knowledge, that is the first non-deterministic 3D facial animation synthesis method incorporating a rich emotion dataset and emotion control with emotion labels and intensity levels. Our evaluation demonstrates that the proposed model achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art emotion-controlled, deterministic and non-deterministic models. We recommend watching the supplementary video for quality judgement. The entire codebase is publicly available (https://github.com/uuembodiedsocialai/ProbTalk3D/).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11169v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Medical imaging analysis faces challenges such as data scarcity, high annotation costs, and privacy concerns. This paper introduces the Medical AI for Synthetic Imaging (MAISI), an innovative approach using the diffusion model to generate synthetic 3D computed tomography (CT) images to address those challenges. MAISI leverages the foundation volume compression network and the latent diffusion model to produce high-resolution CT images (up to a landmark volume dimension of 512 x 512 x 768 ) with flexible volume dimensions and voxel spacing. By incorporating ControlNet, MAISI can process organ segmentation, including 127 anatomical structures, as additional conditions and enables the generation of accurately annotated synthetic images that can be used for various downstream tasks. Our experiment results show that MAISI's capabilities in generating realistic, anatomically accurate images for diverse regions and conditions reveal its promising potential to mitigate challenges using synthetic data.</description>

      <title>LLM-Agent-UMF: LLM-based Agent Unified Modeling Framework for Seamless Integration of Multi Active/Passive Core-Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11393v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In an era where vast amounts of data are collected and processed from diverse sources, there is a growing demand to develop sophisticated AI systems capable of intelligently fusing and analyzing this information. To address these challenges, researchers have turned towards integrating tools into LLM-powered agents to enhance the overall information fusion process. However, the conjunction of these technologies and the proposed enhancements in several state-of-the-art works followed a non-unified software architecture resulting in a lack of modularity and terminological inconsistencies among researchers. To address these issues, we propose a novel LLM-based Agent Unified Modeling Framework (LLM-Agent-UMF) that aims to establish a clear foundation for agent development from both functional and software architectural perspectives. Our framework distinguishes between the different components of an LLM-based agent, setting LLMs, and tools apart from a new element, the core-agent, playing the role of the central coordinator of the agent. This pivotal entity comprises five modules: planning, memory, profile, action, and security - the latter often neglected in previous works. By classifying core-agents into passive and active types based on their authoritative natures, we propose various multi-core agent architectures that combine unique characteristics of distinctive agents to tackle complex tasks more efficiently. We evaluate our framework by applying it to thirteen state-of-the-art agents, thereby demonstrating its alignment with their functionalities and clarifying the overlooked architectural aspects. Moreover, we thoroughly assess five of our proposed architectures through the integration of existing agents into new hybrid active/passive core-agents architectures. This analysis provides insights into potential improvements and highlights challenges involved in combining specific agents.</description>

      <title>DynaMo: In-Domain Dynamics Pretraining for Visuo-Motor Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12192v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Imitation learning has proven to be a powerful tool for training complex visuomotor policies. However, current methods often require hundreds to thousands of expert demonstrations to handle high-dimensional visual observations. A key reason for this poor data efficiency is that visual representations are predominantly either pretrained on out-of-domain data or trained directly through a behavior cloning objective. In this work, we present DynaMo, a new in-domain, self-supervised method for learning visual representations. Given a set of expert demonstrations, we jointly learn a latent inverse dynamics model and a forward dynamics model over a sequence of image embeddings, predicting the next frame in latent space, without augmentations, contrastive sampling, or access to ground truth actions. Importantly, DynaMo does not require any out-of-domain data such as Internet datasets or cross-embodied datasets. On a suite of six simulated and real environments, we show that representations learned with DynaMo significantly improve downstream imitation learning performance over prior self-supervised learning objectives, and pretrained representations. Gains from using DynaMo hold across policy classes such as Behavior Transformer, Diffusion Policy, MLP, and nearest neighbors. Finally, we ablate over key components of DynaMo and measure its impact on downstream policy performance. Robot videos are best viewed at https://dynamo-ssl.github.io</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15905v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a speech-conditioned Large Language Model (LLM) integrated with a Mixture of Experts (MoE) based connector to address the challenge of Code-Switching (CS) in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). Specifically, we propose an Insertion and Deletion of Interruption Token (IDIT) mechanism for better transfer text generation ability of LLM to speech recognition task. We also present a connecter with MoE architecture that manages multiple languages efficiently. To further enhance the collaboration of multiple experts and leverage the understanding capabilities of LLM, we propose a two-stage progressive training strategy: 1) The connector is unfrozen and trained with language-specialized experts to map speech representations to the text space. 2) The connector and LLM LoRA adaptor are trained with the proposed IDIT mechanism and all experts are activated to learn general representations. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models, including end-to-end and large-scale audio-language models.</description>

      <title>Modern Hopfield Networks meet Encoded Neural Representations -- Addressing Practical Considerations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16408v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Content-addressable memories such as Modern Hopfield Networks (MHN) have been studied as mathematical models of auto-association and storage/retrieval in the human declarative memory, yet their practical use for large-scale content storage faces challenges. Chief among them is the occurrence of meta-stable states, particularly when handling large amounts of high dimensional content. This paper introduces Hopfield Encoding Networks (HEN), a framework that integrates encoded neural representations into MHNs to improve pattern separability and reduce meta-stable states. We show that HEN can also be used for retrieval in the context of hetero association of images with natural language queries, thus removing the limitation of requiring access to partial content in the same domain. Experimental results demonstrate substantial reduction in meta-stable states and increased storage capacity while still enabling perfect recall of a significantly larger number of inputs advancing the practical utility of associative memory networks for real-world tasks.</description>

      <title>MIO: A Foundation Model on Multimodal Tokens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17692v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce MIO, a novel foundation model built on multimodal tokens, capable of understanding and generating speech, text, images, and videos in an end-to-end, autoregressive manner. While the emergence of large language models (LLMs) and multimodal large language models (MM-LLMs) propels advancements in artificial general intelligence through their versatile capabilities, they still lack true any-to-any understanding and generation. Recently, the release of GPT-4o has showcased the remarkable potential of any-to-any LLMs for complex real-world tasks, enabling omnidirectional input and output across images, speech, and text. However, it is closed-source and does not support the generation of multimodal interleaved sequences. To address this gap, we present MIO, which is trained on a mixture of discrete tokens across four modalities using causal multimodal modeling. MIO undergoes a four-stage training process: (1) alignment pre-training, (2) interleaved pre-training, (3) speech-enhanced pre-training, and (4) comprehensive supervised fine-tuning on diverse textual, visual, and speech tasks. Our experimental results indicate that MIO exhibits competitive, and in some cases superior, performance compared to previous dual-modal baselines, any-to-any model baselines, and even modality-specific baselines. Moreover, MIO demonstrates advanced capabilities inherent to its any-to-any feature, such as interleaved video-text generation, chain-of-visual-thought reasoning, visual guideline generation, instructional image editing, etc.</description>

      <title>Unconditional stability of a recurrent neural circuit implementing divisive normalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18946</link>

Abstract: Stability in recurrent neural models poses a significant challenge, particularly in developing biologically plausible neurodynamical models that can be seamlessly trained. Traditional cortical circuit models are notoriously difficult to train due to expansive nonlinearities in the dynamical system, leading to an optimization problem with nonlinear stability constraints that are difficult to impose. Conversely, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) excel in tasks involving sequential data but lack biological plausibility and interpretability. In this work, we address these challenges by linking dynamic divisive normalization (DN) to the stability of ORGaNICs, a biologically plausible recurrent cortical circuit model that dynamically achieves DN and that has been shown to simulate a wide range of neurophysiological phenomena. By using the indirect method of Lyapunov, we prove the remarkable property of unconditional local stability for an arbitrary-dimensional ORGaNICs circuit when the recurrent weight matrix is the identity. We thus connect ORGaNICs to a system of coupled damped harmonic oscillators, which enables us to derive the circuit's energy function, providing a normative principle of what the circuit, and individual neurons, aim to accomplish. Further, for a generic recurrent weight matrix, we prove the stability of the 2D model and demonstrate empirically that stability holds in higher dimensions. Finally, we show that ORGaNICs can be trained by backpropagation through time without gradient clipping/scaling, thanks to its intrinsic stability property and adaptive time constants, which address the problems of exploding, vanishing, and oscillating gradients. By evaluating the model's performance on RNN benchmarks, we find that ORGaNICs outperform alternative neurodynamical models on static image classification tasks and perform comparably to LSTMs on sequential tasks.</description>

      <title>FINALLY: fast and universal speech enhancement with studio-like quality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05920v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the challenge of speech enhancement in real-world recordings, which often contain various forms of distortion, such as background noise, reverberation, and microphone artifacts. We revisit the use of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for speech enhancement and theoretically show that GANs are naturally inclined to seek the point of maximum density within the conditional clean speech distribution, which, as we argue, is essential for the speech enhancement task. We study various feature extractors for perceptual loss to facilitate the stability of adversarial training, developing a methodology for probing the structure of the feature space. This leads us to integrate WavLM-based perceptual loss into MS-STFT adversarial training pipeline, creating an effective and stable training procedure for the speech enhancement model. The resulting speech enhancement model, which we refer to as FINALLY, builds upon the HiFi++ architecture, augmented with a WavLM encoder and a novel training pipeline. Empirical results on various datasets confirm our model's ability to produce clear, high-quality speech at 48 kHz, achieving state-of-the-art performance in the field of speech enhancement.

      <title>Mars: Situated Inductive Reasoning in an Open-World Environment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08126v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) trained on massive corpora have shown remarkable success in knowledge-intensive tasks. Yet, most of them rely on pre-stored knowledge. Inducing new general knowledge from a specific environment and performing reasoning with the acquired knowledge -- \textit{situated inductive reasoning}, is crucial and challenging for machine intelligence. In this paper, we design Mars, an interactive environment devised for situated inductive reasoning. It introduces counter-commonsense game mechanisms by modifying terrain, survival setting and task dependency while adhering to certain principles. In Mars, agents need to actively interact with their surroundings, derive useful rules and perform decision-making tasks in specific contexts. We conduct experiments on various RL-based and LLM-based methods, finding that they all struggle on this challenging situated inductive reasoning benchmark. Furthermore, we explore \textit{Induction from Reflection}, where we instruct agents to perform inductive reasoning from history trajectory. The superior performance underscores the importance of inductive reasoning in Mars. Through Mars, we aim to galvanize advancements in situated inductive reasoning and set the stage for developing the next generation of AI systems that can reason in an adaptive and context-sensitive way.</description>

      <title>Flex-MoE: Modeling Arbitrary Modality Combination via the Flexible Mixture-of-Experts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08245v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal learning has gained increasing importance across various fields, offering the ability to integrate data from diverse sources such as images, text, and personalized records, which are frequently observed in medical domains. However, in scenarios where some modalities are missing, many existing frameworks struggle to accommodate arbitrary modality combinations, often relying heavily on a single modality or complete data. This oversight of potential modality combinations limits their applicability in real-world situations. To address this challenge, we propose Flex-MoE (Flexible Mixture-of-Experts), a new framework designed to flexibly incorporate arbitrary modality combinations while maintaining robustness to missing data. The core idea of Flex-MoE is to first address missing modalities using a new missing modality bank that integrates observed modality combinations with the corresponding missing ones. This is followed by a uniquely designed Sparse MoE framework. Specifically, Flex-MoE first trains experts using samples with all modalities to inject generalized knowledge through the generalized router ($\mathcal{G}$-Router). The $\mathcal{S}$-Router then specializes in handling fewer modality combinations by assigning the top-1 gate to the expert corresponding to the observed modality combination. We evaluate Flex-MoE on the ADNI dataset, which encompasses four modalities in the Alzheimer's Disease domain, as well as on the MIMIC-IV dataset. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of Flex-MoE highlighting its ability to model arbitrary modality combinations in diverse missing modality scenarios.

      <title>Learning General Representation of 12-Lead Electrocardiogram with a Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08559v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a self-supervised learning method for 12-lead Electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis, named ECG Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (ECG-JEPA). ECG-JEPA employs a masking strategy to learn semantic representations of ECG data. Unlike existing methods, ECG-JEPA predicts at the hidden representation level rather than reconstructing raw data. This approach offers several advantages in the ECG domain: (1) it avoids producing unnecessary details, such as noise, which is common in standard ECG; and (2) it addresses the limitations of na\"ive L2 loss between raw signals. Another key contribution is the introduction of a special masked attention tailored for 12-lead ECG data, Cross-Pattern Attention (CroPA). CroPA enables the model to effectively capture inter-patch relationships. Additionally, ECG-JEPA is highly scalable, allowing efficient training on large datasets. Our code is openly available https://github.com/sehunfromdaegu/ECG_JEPA.</description>

      <title>Can In-context Learning Really Generalize to Out-of-distribution Tasks?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09695v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the mechanism of in-context learning (ICL) on out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks that were not encountered during training. To achieve this, we conduct synthetic experiments where the objective is to learn OOD mathematical functions through ICL using a GPT-2 model. We reveal that Transformers may struggle to learn OOD task functions through ICL. Specifically, ICL performance resembles implementing a function within the pretraining hypothesis space and optimizing it with gradient descent based on the in-context examples. Additionally, we investigate ICL's well-documented ability to learn unseen abstract labels in context. We demonstrate that such ability only manifests in the scenarios without distributional shifts and, therefore, may not serve as evidence of new-task-learning ability. Furthermore, we assess ICL's performance on OOD tasks when the model is pretrained on multiple tasks. Both empirical and theoretical analyses demonstrate the existence of the \textbf{low-test-error preference} of ICL, where it tends to implement the pretraining function that yields low test error in the testing context. We validate this through numerical experiments. This new theoretical result, combined with our empirical findings, elucidates the mechanism of ICL in addressing OOD tasks.</description>

      <title>Will LLMs Replace the Encoder-Only Models in Temporal Relation Classification?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10476v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The automatic detection of temporal relations among events has been mainly investigated with encoder-only models such as RoBERTa. Large Language Models (LLM) have recently shown promising performance in temporal reasoning tasks such as temporal question answering. Nevertheless, recent studies have tested the LLMs' performance in detecting temporal relations of closed-source models only, limiting the interpretability of those results. In this work, we investigate LLMs' performance and decision process in the Temporal Relation Classification task. First, we assess the performance of seven open and closed-sourced LLMs experimenting with in-context learning and lightweight fine-tuning approaches. Results show that LLMs with in-context learning significantly underperform smaller encoder-only models based on RoBERTa. Then, we delve into the possible reasons for this gap by applying explainable methods. The outcome suggests a limitation of LLMs in this task due to their autoregressive nature, which causes them to focus only on the last part of the sequence. Additionally, we evaluate the word embeddings of these two models to better understand their pre-training differences. The code and the fine-tuned models can be found respectively on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Burning RED: Unlocking Subtask-Driven Reinforcement Learning and Risk-Awareness in Average-Reward Markov Decision Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10578v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Average-reward Markov decision processes (MDPs) provide a foundational framework for sequential decision-making under uncertainty. However, average-reward MDPs have remained largely unexplored in reinforcement learning (RL) settings, with the majority of RL-based efforts having been allocated to episodic and discounted MDPs. In this work, we study a unique structural property of average-reward MDPs and utilize it to introduce Reward-Extended Differential (or RED) reinforcement learning: a novel RL framework that can be used to effectively and efficiently solve various subtasks simultaneously in the average-reward setting. We introduce a family of RED learning algorithms for prediction and control, including proven-convergent algorithms for the tabular case. We then showcase the power of these algorithms by demonstrating how they can be used to learn a policy that optimizes, for the first time, the well-known conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) risk measure in a fully-online manner, without the use of an explicit bi-level optimization scheme or an augmented state-space.</description>

      <title>Stabilize the Latent Space for Image Autoregressive Modeling: A Unified Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12490v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Latent-based image generative models, such as Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) and Mask Image Models (MIMs), have achieved notable success in image generation tasks. These models typically leverage reconstructive autoencoders like VQGAN or VAE to encode pixels into a more compact latent space and learn the data distribution in the latent space instead of directly from pixels. However, this practice raises a pertinent question: Is it truly the optimal choice? In response, we begin with an intriguing observation: despite sharing the same latent space, autoregressive models significantly lag behind LDMs and MIMs in image generation. This finding contrasts sharply with the field of NLP, where the autoregressive model GPT has established a commanding presence. To address this discrepancy, we introduce a unified perspective on the relationship between latent space and generative models, emphasizing the stability of latent space in image generative modeling. Furthermore, we propose a simple but effective discrete image tokenizer to stabilize the latent space for image generative modeling by applying K-Means on the latent features of self-supervised learning models. Experimental results show that image autoregressive modeling with our tokenizer (DiGIT) benefits both image understanding and image generation with the next token prediction principle, which is inherently straightforward for GPT models but challenging for other generative models. Remarkably, for the first time, a GPT-style autoregressive model for images outperforms LDMs, which also exhibits substantial improvement akin to GPT when scaling up model size. Our findings underscore the potential of an optimized latent space and the integration of discrete tokenization in advancing the capabilities of image generative models. The code is available at \url{https://github.com/DAMO-NLP-SG/DiGIT}.</description>

      <title>Provable Benefits of Complex Parameterizations for Structured State Space Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14067v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Structured state space models (SSMs), the core engine behind prominent neural networks such as S4 and Mamba, are linear dynamical systems adhering to a specified structure, most notably diagonal. In contrast to typical neural network modules, whose parameterizations are real, SSMs often use complex parameterizations. Theoretically explaining the benefits of complex parameterizations for SSMs is an open problem. The current paper takes a step towards its resolution, by establishing formal gaps between real and complex diagonal SSMs. Firstly, we prove that while a moderate dimension suffices in order for a complex SSM to express all mappings of a real SSM, a much higher dimension is needed for a real SSM to express mappings of a complex SSM. Secondly, we prove that even if the dimension of a real SSM is high enough to express a given mapping, typically, doing so requires the parameters of the real SSM to hold exponentially large values, which cannot be learned in practice. In contrast, a complex SSM can express any given mapping with moderate parameter values. Experiments corroborate our theory, and suggest a potential extension of the theory that accounts for selectivity, a new architectural feature yielding state of the art performance.</description>

      <title>On the Sparsity of the Strong Lottery Ticket Hypothesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14754v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Considerable research efforts have recently been made to show that a random neural network $N$ contains subnetworks capable of accurately approximating any given neural network that is sufficiently smaller than $N$, without any training. This line of research, known as the Strong Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (SLTH), was originally motivated by the weaker Lottery Ticket Hypothesis, which states that a sufficiently large random neural network $N$ contains \emph{sparse} subnetworks that can be trained efficiently to achieve performance comparable to that of training the entire network $N$. Despite its original motivation, results on the SLTH have so far not provided any guarantee on the size of subnetworks. Such limitation is due to the nature of the main technical tool leveraged by these results, the Random Subset Sum (RSS) Problem. Informally, the RSS Problem asks how large a random i.i.d. sample $\Omega$ should be so that we are able to approximate any number in $[-1,1]$, up to an error of $ \epsilon$, as the sum of a suitable subset of $\Omega$. We provide the first proof of the SLTH in classical settings, such as dense and equivariant networks, with guarantees on the sparsity of the subnetworks. Central to our results, is the proof of an essentially tight bound on the Random Fixed-Size Subset Sum Problem (RFSS), a variant of the RSS Problem in which we only ask for subsets of a given size, which is of independent interest.</description>

      <title>SSL-NBV: A Self-Supervised-Learning-Based Next-Best-View algorithm for Efficient 3D Plant Reconstruction by a Robot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14790v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The 3D reconstruction of plants is challenging due to their complex shape causing many occlusions. Next-Best-View (NBV) methods address this by iteratively selecting new viewpoints to maximize information gain (IG). Deep-learning-based NBV (DL-NBV) methods demonstrate higher computational efficiency over classic voxel-based NBV approaches but current methods require extensive training using ground-truth plant models, making them impractical for real-world plants. These methods, moreover, rely on offline training with pre-collected data, limiting adaptability in changing agricultural environments. This paper proposes a self-supervised learning-based NBV method (SSL-NBV) that uses a deep neural network to predict the IG for candidate viewpoints. The method allows the robot to gather its own training data during task execution by comparing new 3D sensor data to the earlier gathered data and by employing weakly-supervised learning and experience replay for efficient online learning. Comprehensive evaluations were conducted in simulation and real-world environments using cross-validation. The results showed that SSL-NBV required fewer views for plant reconstruction than non-NBV methods and was over 800 times faster than a voxel-based method. SSL-NBV reduced training annotations by over 90% compared to a baseline DL-NBV. Furthermore, SSL-NBV could adapt to novel scenarios through online fine-tuning. Also using real plants, the results showed that the proposed method can learn to effectively plan new viewpoints for 3D plant reconstruction. Most importantly, SSL-NBV automated the entire network training and uses continuous online learning, allowing it to operate in changing agricultural environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15081v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Probabilistic programming is becoming increasingly popular thanks to its ability to specify problems with a certain degree of uncertainty. In this work, we focus on term rewriting, a well-known computational formalism. In particular, we consider systems that combine traditional rewriting rules with probabilities. Then, we define a distribution semantics for such systems that can be used to model the probability of reducing a term to some value. We also show how to compute a set of "explanations" for a given reduction, which can be used to compute its probability. Finally, we illustrate our approach with several examples and outline a couple of extensions that may prove useful to improve the expressive power of probabilistic rewrite systems.</description>

      <title>Compute-Constrained Data Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16208v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data selection can reduce the amount of training data needed to finetune LLMs; however, the efficacy of data selection scales directly with its compute. Motivated by the practical challenge of compute-constrained finetuning, we consider the setting in which both the cost of selecting data and training are budgeted for. We first formalize the problem of data selection with a cost-aware utility function, and model the data selection problem as trading off initial-selection cost for training gain. We run a comprehensive sweep of experiments across multiple tasks, varying compute budget by scaling finetuning tokens, model sizes, and data selection compute. These experiments show the validity of this model in real-world experiments. Interestingly we find that many powerful data selection methods are almost never compute-optimal, and that cheaper data selection alternatives dominate both from a theoretical and empirical perspective.</description>

      <title>From PDFs to Structured Data: Utilizing LLM Analysis in Sports Database Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17619v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) in processing semi-structured data from PDF documents into structured formats, specifically examining their application in updating the Finnish Sports Clubs Database. Through action research methodology, we developed and evaluated an AI-assisted approach utilizing OpenAI's GPT-4 and Anthropic's Claude 3 Opus models to process data from 72 sports federation membership reports. The system achieved a 90% success rate in automated processing, successfully handling 65 of 72 files without errors and converting over 7,900 rows of data. While the initial development time was comparable to traditional manual processing (three months), the implemented system shows potential for reducing future processing time by approximately 90%. Key challenges included handling multilingual content, processing multi-page datasets, and managing extraneous information. The findings suggest that while LLMs demonstrate significant potential for automating semi-structured data processing tasks, optimal results are achieved through a hybrid approach combining AI automation with selective human oversight. This research contributes to the growing body of literature on practical LLM applications in organizational data management and provides insights into the transformation of traditional data processing workflows.</description>

      <title>Offline Reinforcement Learning with OOD State Correction and OOD Action Suppression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19400v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In offline reinforcement learning (RL), addressing the out-of-distribution (OOD) action issue has been a focus, but we argue that there exists an OOD state issue that also impairs performance yet has been underexplored. Such an issue describes the scenario when the agent encounters states out of the offline dataset during the test phase, leading to uncontrolled behavior and performance degradation. To this end, we propose SCAS, a simple yet effective approach that unifies OOD state correction and OOD action suppression in offline RL. Technically, SCAS achieves value-aware OOD state correction, capable of correcting the agent from OOD states to high-value in-distribution states. Theoretical and empirical results show that SCAS also exhibits the effect of suppressing OOD actions. On standard offline RL benchmarks, SCAS achieves excellent performance without additional hyperparameter tuning. Moreover, benefiting from its OOD state correction feature, SCAS demonstrates enhanced robustness against environmental perturbations.</description>

      <title>Brain-like Functional Organization within Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19542v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The human brain has long inspired the pursuit of artificial intelligence (AI). Recently, neuroimaging studies provide compelling evidence of alignment between the computational representation of artificial neural networks (ANNs) and the neural responses of the human brain to stimuli, suggesting that ANNs may employ brain-like information processing strategies. While such alignment has been observed across sensory modalities--visual, auditory, and linguistic--much of the focus has been on the behaviors of artificial neurons (ANs) at the population level, leaving the functional organization of individual ANs that facilitates such brain-like processes largely unexplored. In this study, we bridge this gap by directly coupling sub-groups of artificial neurons with functional brain networks (FBNs), the foundational organizational structure of the human brain. Specifically, we extract representative patterns from temporal responses of ANs in large language models (LLMs), and use them as fixed regressors to construct voxel-wise encoding models to predict brain activity recorded by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). This framework links the AN sub-groups to FBNs, enabling the delineation of brain-like functional organization within LLMs. Our findings reveal that LLMs (BERT and Llama 1-3) exhibit brain-like functional architecture, with sub-groups of artificial neurons mirroring the organizational patterns of well-established FBNs. Notably, the brain-like functional organization of LLMs evolves with the increased sophistication and capability, achieving an improved balance between the diversity of computational behaviors and the consistency of functional specializations. This research represents the first exploration of brain-like functional organization within LLMs, offering novel insights to inform the development of artificial general intelligence (AGI) with human brain principles.</description>

      <title>Meta-Learning Approaches for Improving Detection of Unseen Speech Deepfakes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20578v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current speech deepfake detection approaches perform satisfactorily against known adversaries; however, generalization to unseen attacks remains an open challenge. The proliferation of speech deepfakes on social media underscores the need for systems that can generalize to unseen attacks not observed during training. We address this problem from the perspective of meta-learning, aiming to learn attack-invariant features to adapt to unseen attacks with very few samples available. This approach is promising since generating of a high-scale training dataset is often expensive or infeasible. Our experiments demonstrated an improvement in the Equal Error Rate (EER) from 21.67% to 10.42% on the InTheWild dataset, using just 96 samples from the unseen dataset. Continuous few-shot adaptation ensures that the system remains up-to-date.</description>

      <title>Shopping MMLU: A Massive Multi-Task Online Shopping Benchmark for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20745v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Online shopping is a complex multi-task, few-shot learning problem with a wide and evolving range of entities, relations, and tasks. However, existing models and benchmarks are commonly tailored to specific tasks, falling short of capturing the full complexity of online shopping. Large Language Models (LLMs), with their multi-task and few-shot learning abilities, have the potential to profoundly transform online shopping by alleviating task-specific engineering efforts and by providing users with interactive conversations. Despite the potential, LLMs face unique challenges in online shopping, such as domain-specific concepts, implicit knowledge, and heterogeneous user behaviors. Motivated by the potential and challenges, we propose Shopping MMLU, a diverse multi-task online shopping benchmark derived from real-world Amazon data. Shopping MMLU consists of 57 tasks covering 4 major shopping skills: concept understanding, knowledge reasoning, user behavior alignment, and multi-linguality, and can thus comprehensively evaluate the abilities of LLMs as general shop assistants. With Shopping MMLU, we benchmark over 20 existing LLMs and uncover valuable insights about practices and prospects of building versatile LLM-based shop assistants. Shopping MMLU can be publicly accessed at https://github.com/KL4805/ShoppingMMLU. In addition, with Shopping MMLU, we host a competition in KDD Cup 2024 with over 500 participating teams. The winning solutions and the associated workshop can be accessed at our website https://amazon-kddcup24.github.io/.</description>

      <title>LLMCBench: Benchmarking Large Language Model Compression for Efficient Deployment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21352v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their strong intelligence ability, the high demand for computation and storage hinders their practical application. To this end, many model compression techniques are proposed to increase the efficiency of LLMs. However, current researches only validate their methods on limited models, datasets, metrics, etc, and still lack a comprehensive evaluation under more general scenarios. So it is still a question of which model compression approach we should use under a specific case. To mitigate this gap, we present the Large Language Model Compression Benchmark (LLMCBench), a rigorously designed benchmark with an in-depth analysis for LLM compression algorithms. We first analyze the actual model production requirements and carefully design evaluation tracks and metrics. Then, we conduct extensive experiments and comparison using multiple mainstream LLM compression approaches. Finally, we perform an in-depth analysis based on the evaluation and provide useful insight for LLM compression design. We hope our LLMCBench can contribute insightful suggestions for LLM compression algorithm design and serve as a foundation for future research. Our code is available at https://github.com/AboveParadise/LLMCBench.</description>

      <title>From Explicit Rules to Implicit Reasoning in an Interpretable Violence Monitoring System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21991v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, research based on pre-trained models has demonstrated outstanding performance in violence surveillance tasks. However, these black-box systems face challenges regarding explainability during training and inference processes. An important question is how to incorporate explicit knowledge into these implicit models, thereby designing expert-driven and interpretable violence surveillance systems. This paper proposes a new paradigm for weakly supervised violence monitoring (WSVM) called Rule base Violence monitoring (RuleVM). The proposed RuleVM uses a dual-branch structure for different designs for images and text. One of the branches is called the implicit branch, which uses only visual features for coarse-grained binary classification. In this branch, image feature extraction is divided into two channels: one responsible for extracting scene frames and the other focusing on extracting actions. The other branch is called the explicit branch, which utilizes language-image alignment to perform fine-grained classification. For the language channel design in the explicit branch, the proposed RuleCLIP uses the state-of-the-art YOLO-World model to detect objects and actions in video frames, and association rules are identified through data mining methods as descriptions of the video. Leveraging the dual-branch architecture, RuleVM achieves interpretable coarse-grained and fine-grained violence surveillance. Extensive experiments were conducted on two commonly used benchmarks, and the results show that RuleCLIP achieved the best performance in both coarse-grained and fine-grained detection, significantly outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, interpretability experiments uncovered some interesting rules, such as the observation that as the number of people increases, the risk level of violent behavior also rises.</description>

      <title>TractShapeNet: Efficient Multi-Shape Learning with 3D Tractography Point Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22099v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Brain imaging studies have demonstrated that diffusion MRI tractography geometric shape descriptors can inform the study of the brain's white matter pathways and their relationship to brain function. In this work, we investigate the possibility of utilizing a deep learning model to compute shape measures of the brain's white matter connections. We introduce a novel framework, TractShapeNet, that leverages a point cloud representation of tractography to compute five shape measures: length, span, volume, total surface area, and irregularity. We assess the performance of the method on a large dataset including 1065 healthy young adults. Experiments for shape measure computation demonstrate that our proposed TractShapeNet outperforms other point cloud-based neural network models in both the Pearson correlation coefficient and normalized error metrics. We compare the inference runtime results with the conventional shape computation tool DSI-Studio. Our results demonstrate that a deep learning approach enables faster and more efficient shape measure computation. We also conduct experiments on two downstream language cognition prediction tasks, showing that shape measures from TractShapeNet perform similarly to those computed by DSI-Studio. Our code will be available at: https://github.com/SlicerDMRI/TractShapeNet.</description>

      <title>Policy Gradient for Robust Markov Decision Processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22114v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a generic policy gradient method with the global optimality guarantee for robust Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). While policy gradient methods are widely used for solving dynamic decision problems due to their scalable and efficient nature, adapting these methods to account for model ambiguity has been challenging, often making it impractical to learn robust policies. This paper introduces a novel policy gradient method, Double-Loop Robust Policy Mirror Descent (DRPMD), for solving robust MDPs. DRPMD employs a general mirror descent update rule for the policy optimization with adaptive tolerance per iteration, guaranteeing convergence to a globally optimal policy. We provide a comprehensive analysis of DRPMD, including new convergence results under both direct and softmax parameterizations, and provide novel insights into the inner problem solution through Transition Mirror Ascent (TMA). Additionally, we propose innovative parametric transition kernels for both discrete and continuous state-action spaces, broadening the applicability of our approach. Empirical results validate the robustness and global convergence of DRPMD across various challenging robust MDP settings.</description>

      <title>Debiasing Alternative Data for Credit Underwriting Using Causal Inference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22382v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Alternative data provides valuable insights for lenders to evaluate a borrower's creditworthiness, which could help expand credit access to underserved groups and lower costs for borrowers. But some forms of alternative data have historically been excluded from credit underwriting because it could act as an illegal proxy for a protected class like race or gender, causing redlining. We propose a method for applying causal inference to a supervised machine learning model to debias alternative data so that it might be used for credit underwriting. We demonstrate how our algorithm can be used against a public credit dataset to improve model accuracy across different racial groups, while providing theoretically robust nondiscrimination guarantees.</description>

      <title>DiffLight: A Partial Rewards Conditioned Diffusion Model for Traffic Signal Control with Missing Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22938v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The application of reinforcement learning in traffic signal control (TSC) has been extensively researched and yielded notable achievements. However, most existing works for TSC assume that traffic data from all surrounding intersections is fully and continuously available through sensors. In real-world applications, this assumption often fails due to sensor malfunctions or data loss, making TSC with missing data a critical challenge. To meet the needs of practical applications, we introduce DiffLight, a novel conditional diffusion model for TSC under data-missing scenarios in the offline setting. Specifically, we integrate two essential sub-tasks, i.e., traffic data imputation and decision-making, by leveraging a Partial Rewards Conditioned Diffusion (PRCD) model to prevent missing rewards from interfering with the learning process. Meanwhile, to effectively capture the spatial-temporal dependencies among intersections, we design a Spatial-Temporal transFormer (STFormer) architecture. In addition, we propose a Diffusion Communication Mechanism (DCM) to promote better communication and control performance under data-missing scenarios. Extensive experiments on five datasets with various data-missing scenarios demonstrate that DiffLight is an effective controller to address TSC with missing data. The code of DiffLight is released at https://github.com/lokol5579/DiffLight-release.</description>

      <title>Why Gradient Subspace? Identifying and Mitigating LoRA's Bottlenecks in Federated Fine-Tuning of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23111v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various domains, particularly in task generalization for both text and vision data. While fine-tuning these models can significantly enhance their performance on specific downstream tasks, it often requires high-quality data that cannot be shared due to privacy concerns. Federated Learning (FL) offers a promising solution for collaborative training without direct data sharing. However, many parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategies for LLMs in FL, particularly those based on Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), face limitations. In this paper, we critically analyze the convergence and performance guarantees of popular FL frameworks utilizing LoRA, highlighting its suboptimal nature due to constrained subspace learning of low-rank matrices. This limitation hinders effective fine-tuning of LLMs in federated settings. Through rigorous analytical and empirical evaluations, we demonstrate that direct weight averaging outperforms LoRA-based strategies, leading to superior performance for fine-tuned models. Our comprehensive comparison exposes inefficiencies in LoRA approaches and underscores the advantages of direct weight aggregation. We extend our analysis to low-rank gradient-based optimizers, such as GaLore, used during local training steps. Our findings show that GaLore is a more effective alternative, outperforming federated LoRA methods like FlexLoRA and FFA-LoRA across both text and image modalities. While privacy remains paramount in FL discourse, our focus is on assessing performance outcomes of federated fine-tuned models and evaluating various FL frameworks from both theoretical and empirical perspectives. Our findings advocate reassessing the reliance on LoRA within FL contexts, paving the way for more efficient training methodologies.</description>

      <title>Grounding by Trying: LLMs with Reinforcement Learning-Enhanced Retrieval</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23214v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The hallucinations of large language models (LLMs) are increasingly mitigated by allowing LLMs to search for information and to ground their answers in real sources. Unfortunately, LLMs often struggle with posing the right search queries, especially when dealing with complex or otherwise indirect topics. Observing that LLMs can learn to search for relevant facts by $\textit{trying}$ different queries and learning to up-weight queries that successfully produce relevant results, we introduce $\underline{Le}$arning to $\underline{Re}$trieve by $\underline{T}$rying (LeReT), a reinforcement learning framework that explores search queries and uses preference-based optimization to improve their quality. LeReT can improve the absolute retrieval accuracy by up to 29% and the downstream generator evaluations by 17%. The simplicity and flexibility of LeReT allows it to be applied to arbitrary off-the-shelf retrievers and makes it a promising technique for improving general LLM pipelines.

Abstract: Visual content and accompanied audio signals naturally formulate a joint representation to improve audio-visual (AV) related applications. While studies develop various AV representation learning frameworks, the importance of AV data alignment is usually undermined for achieving high-quality representation. We observe that an audio signal may contain background noise interference. Also, non-synchronization may appear between audio and video streams. These non-strict data alignment limits representation quality and downgrade application performance. In this paper, we propose to improve AV joint representations from a data-centric perspective by aligning audio signals to visual data. Our alignment is conducted in an agentic workflow controlled by an LLM-based assistant named AVAgent. For each input AV data pair, our AVAgent uses a multi-modal LLM to convert audio and visual data into language descriptions separately (i.e., tool use). Then, AVAgent reasons whether this paired data is aligned well and plans to edit the audio signal if needed (i.e., planning). The audio editing is executed by predefined actions that filter noise or augment data. Moreover, we use a VLM to evaluate how modified audio signals match the visual content and provide feedback to AVAgent (i.e., reflection). The tool use, planning, and reflection steps operate cyclically to become an agentic workflow where audio signals are gradually aligned to visual content. To this end, existing methods can directly leverage the aligned AV data via our agentic workflow to improve AV joint representations. The experimental results comprehensively demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed approach against previous baselines in diverse downstream tasks.</description>
