      <title>Symbolic Knowledge Extraction and Injection with Sub-symbolic Predictors: A Systematic Literature Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we focus on the opacity issue of sub-symbolic machine learning predictors by promoting two complementary activities, namely, symbolic knowledge extraction (SKE) and injection (SKI) from and into sub-symbolic predictors. We consider as symbolic any language being intelligible and interpretable for both humans and computers. Accordingly, we propose general meta-models for both SKE and SKI, along with two taxonomies for the classification of SKE and SKI methods. By adopting an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) perspective, we highlight how such methods can be exploited to mitigate the aforementioned opacity issue. Our taxonomies are attained by surveying and classifying existing methods from the literature, following a systematic approach, and by generalising the results of previous surveys targeting specific sub-topics of either SKE or SKI alone. More precisely, we analyse 132 methods for SKE and 117 methods for SKI, and we categorise them according to their purpose, operation, expected input/output data and predictor types. For each method, we also indicate the presence/lack of runnable software implementations. Our work may be of interest for data scientists aiming at selecting the most adequate SKE/SKI method for their needs, and also work as suggestions for researchers interested in filling the gaps of the current state of the art, as well as for developers willing to implement SKE/SKI-based technologies.</description>

      <title>Causal Graphs Meet Thoughts: Enhancing Complex Reasoning in Graph-Augmented LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In knowledge-intensive tasks, especially in high-stakes domains like medicine and law, it is critical not only to retrieve relevant information but also to provide causal reasoning and explainability. Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance in natural language understanding and generation tasks. However, they often suffer from limitations such as difficulty in incorporating new knowledge, generating hallucinations, and explaining their reasoning process. To address these challenges, integrating knowledge graphs with Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Graph RAG) has emerged as an effective solution. Traditional Graph RAG methods often rely on simple graph traversal or semantic similarity, which do not capture causal relationships or align well with the model's internal reasoning steps. This paper proposes a novel pipeline that filters large knowledge graphs to emphasize cause-effect edges, aligns the retrieval process with the model's chain-of-thought (CoT), and enhances reasoning through multi-stage path improvements. Experiments on medical question-answering tasks show consistent gains, with up to a 10\% absolute improvement across multiple large language models (LLMs). This approach demonstrates the value of combining causal reasoning with stepwise retrieval, leading to more interpretable and logically grounded solutions for complex queries.</description>

      <title>What if Eye...? Computationally Recreating Vision Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision systems in nature show remarkable diversity, from simple light-sensitive patches to complex camera eyes with lenses. While natural selection has produced these eyes through countless mutations over millions of years, they represent just one set of realized evolutionary paths. Testing hypotheses about how environmental pressures shaped eye evolution remains challenging since we cannot experimentally isolate individual factors. Computational evolution offers a way to systematically explore alternative trajectories. Here we show how environmental demands drive three fundamental aspects of visual evolution through an artificial evolution framework that co-evolves both physical eye structure and neural processing in embodied agents. First, we demonstrate computational evidence that task specific selection drives bifurcation in eye evolution - orientation tasks like navigation in a maze leads to distributed compound-type eyes while an object discrimination task leads to the emergence of high-acuity camera-type eyes. Second, we reveal how optical innovations like lenses naturally emerge to resolve fundamental tradeoffs between light collection and spatial precision. Third, we uncover systematic scaling laws between visual acuity and neural processing, showing how task complexity drives coordinated evolution of sensory and computational capabilities. Our work introduces a novel paradigm that illuminates evolutionary principles shaping vision by creating targeted single-player games where embodied agents must simultaneously evolve visual systems and learn complex behaviors. Through our unified genetic encoding framework, these embodied agents serve as next-generation hypothesis testing machines while providing a foundation for designing manufacturable bio-inspired vision systems.</description>

      <title>Controllable Protein Sequence Generation with LLM Preference Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing proteins with specific attributes offers an important solution to address biomedical challenges. Pre-trained protein large language models (LLMs) have shown promising results on protein sequence generation. However, to control sequence generation for specific attributes, existing work still exhibits poor functionality and structural stability. In this paper, we propose a novel controllable protein design method called CtrlProt. We finetune a protein LLM with a new multi-listwise preference optimization strategy to improve generation quality and support multi-attribute controllable generation. Experiments demonstrate that CtrlProt can meet functionality and structural stability requirements effectively, achieving state-of-the-art performance in both single-attribute and multi-attribute protein sequence generation.</description>

      <title>Feedback-Aware Monte Carlo Tree Search for Efficient Information Seeking in Goal-Oriented Conversations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to identify and acquire missing information is a critical component of effective decision making and problem solving. With the rise of conversational artificial intelligence (AI) systems, strategically formulating information-seeking questions becomes crucial and demands efficient methods to guide the search process. We introduce a novel approach to adaptive question-asking through a combination of Large Language Models (LLM) for generating questions that maximize information gain, Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for constructing and leveraging a decision tree across multiple samples, and a hierarchical feedback mechanism to learn from past interactions. We present two key innovations: (1) an adaptive MCTS algorithm that balances exploration and exploitation for efficient search over potential questions; and (2) a clustering-based feedback algorithm that leverages prior experience to guide future interactions. Each incoming sample is assigned to a cluster based on its semantic similarity with previously observed samples. Our UCT (Upper Confidence bound for Trees) formulation selects optimal questions by combining expected rewards, a function of information gain, with a cluster-specific bonus that decays with depth, to emphasize the importance of early-stage questions that have proven effective for narrowing the solution space in similar samples. Experiments across three domains, including medical diagnosis and troubleshooting, demonstrate that our method leads to an average of 12% improvement in success rates and a 10x reduction in the average number of LLM calls made per conversation for the search process, in comparison to the state of the art.</description>

      <title>Data Center Cooling System Optimization Using Offline Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent advances in information technology and artificial intelligence have fueled a rapid expansion of the data center (DC) industry worldwide, accompanied by an immense appetite for electricity to power the DCs. In a typical DC, around 30~40% of the energy is spent on the cooling system rather than on computer servers, posing a pressing need for developing new energy-saving optimization technologies for DC cooling systems. However, optimizing such real-world industrial systems faces numerous challenges, including but not limited to a lack of reliable simulation environments, limited historical data, and stringent safety and control robustness requirements. In this work, we present a novel physics-informed offline reinforcement learning (RL) framework for energy efficiency optimization of DC cooling systems. The proposed framework models the complex dynamical patterns and physical dependencies inside a server room using a purposely designed graph neural network architecture that is compliant with the fundamental time-reversal symmetry. Because of its well-behaved and generalizable state-action representations, the model enables sample-efficient and robust latent space offline policy learning using limited real-world operational data. Our framework has been successfully deployed and verified in a large-scale production DC for closed-loop control of its air-cooling units (ACUs). We conducted a total of 2000 hours of short and long-term experiments in the production DC environment. The results show that our method achieves 14~21% energy savings in the DC cooling system, without any violation of the safety or operational constraints. Our results have demonstrated the significant potential of offline RL in solving a broad range of data-limited, safety-critical real-world industrial control problems.</description>

      <title>A New Approach for Knowledge Generation Using Active Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There are various models proposed on how knowledge is generated in the human brain including the semantic networks model. Although this model has been widely studied and even computational models are presented, but, due to various limits and inefficiencies in the generation of different types of knowledge, its application is limited to semantic knowledge because of has been formed according to semantic memory and declarative knowledge and has many limits in explaining various procedural and conditional knowledge. Given the importance of providing an appropriate model for knowledge generation, especially in the areas of improving human cognitive functions or building intelligent machines, improving existing models in knowledge generation or providing more comprehensive models is of great importance. In the current study, based on the free energy principle of the brain, is the researchers proposed a model for generating three types of declarative, procedural, and conditional knowledge. While explaining different types of knowledge, this model is capable to compute and generate concepts from stimuli based on probabilistic mathematics and the action-perception process (active inference). The proposed model is unsupervised learning that can update itself using a combination of different stimuli as a generative model can generate new concepts of unsupervised received stimuli. In this model, the active inference process is used in the generation of procedural and conditional knowledge and the perception process is used to generate declarative knowledge.</description>

      <title>A Causality-aware Paradigm for Evaluating Creativity of Multimodal Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, numerous benchmarks have been developed to evaluate the logical reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). However, assessing the equally important creative capabilities of LLMs is challenging due to the subjective, diverse, and data-scarce nature of creativity, especially in multimodal scenarios. In this paper, we consider the comprehensive pipeline for evaluating the creativity of multimodal LLMs, with a focus on suitable evaluation platforms and methodologies. First, we find the Oogiri game, a creativity-driven task requiring humor, associative thinking, and the ability to produce unexpected responses to text, images, or both. This game aligns well with the input-output structure of modern multimodal LLMs and benefits from a rich repository of high-quality, human-annotated creative responses, making it an ideal platform for studying LLM creativity. Next, beyond using the Oogiri game for standard evaluations like ranking and selection, we propose LoTbench, an interactive, causality-aware evaluation framework, to further address some intrinsic risks in standard evaluations, such as information leakage and limited interpretability. The proposed LoTbench not only quantifies LLM creativity more effectively but also visualizes the underlying creative thought processes. Our results show that while most LLMs exhibit constrained creativity, the performance gap between LLMs and humans is not insurmountable. Furthermore, we observe a strong correlation between results from the multimodal cognition benchmark MMMU and LoTbench, but only a weak connection with traditional creativity metrics. This suggests that LoTbench better aligns with human cognitive theories, highlighting cognition as a critical foundation in the early stages of creativity and enabling the bridging of diverse concepts. https://lotbench.github.io</description>

      <title>Abstraction Method for Generalized Planning with Baggable Types</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalized planning is concerned with how to find a single plan to solve multiple similar planning instances. Abstractions are widely used for solving generalized planning, and QNP (qualitative numeric planning) is a popular abstract model. Recently, Cui et al. showed that a plan solves a sound and complete abstraction of a generalized planning problem if and only if the refined plan solves the original problem. However, existing work on automatic abstraction for generalized planning can hardly guarantee soundness let alone completeness. In this paper, we propose an automatic sound and complete abstraction method for generalized planning with baggable types. We use a variant of QNP, called bounded QNP (BQNP), where integer variables are increased or decreased by only one. Since BQNP is undecidable, we propose and implement a sound but incomplete solver for BQNP. We present an automatic method to abstract a BQNP problem from a classical planning instance with baggable types. The basic idea for abstraction is to introduce a counter for each bag of indistinguishable tuples of objects. We define a class of domains called proper baggable domains, and show that for such domains, the BQNP problem got by our automatic method is a sound and complete abstraction for a generalized planning problem whose instances share the same bags with the given instance but the sizes of the bags might be different. Thus, the refined plan of a solution to the BQNP problem is a solution to the generalized planning problem. Finally, we implement our abstraction method and experiments on a number of domains demonstrate the promise of our approach.</description>

      <title>Who's Driving? Game Theoretic Path Risk of AGI Development</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Who controls the development of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) might matter less than how we handle the fight for control itself. We formalize this "steering wheel problem" as humanity's greatest near-term existential risk may stem not from misaligned AGI, but from the dynamics of competing to develop it. Just as a car crash can occur from passengers fighting over the wheel before reaching any destination, catastrophic outcomes could arise from development competition long before AGI exists. While technical alignment research focuses on ensuring safe arrival, we show how coordination failures during development could drive us off the cliff first.
  We present a game theoretic framework modeling AGI development dynamics and prove conditions for sustainable cooperative equilibria. Drawing from nuclear control while accounting for AGI's unique characteristics, we propose concrete mechanisms including pre-registration, shared technical infrastructure, and automated deterrence to stabilize cooperation. Our key insight is that AGI creates network effects in safety: shared investments become more valuable as participation grows, enabling mechanism designs where cooperation dominates defection. This work bridges formal methodology and policy frameworks, providing foundations for practical governance of AGI competition risks.</description>

      <title>How to Mitigate Information Loss in Knowledge Graphs for GraphRAG: Leveraging Triple Context Restoration and Query-Driven Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowledge Graph (KG)-augmented Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently propelled significant advances in complex reasoning tasks, thanks to their broad domain knowledge and contextual awareness. Unfortunately, current methods often assume KGs to be complete, which is impractical given the inherent limitations of KG construction and the potential loss of contextual cues when converting unstructured text into entity-relation triples. In response, this paper proposes the Triple Context Restoration and Query-driven Feedback (TCR-QF) framework, which reconstructs the textual context underlying each triple to mitigate information loss, while dynamically refining the KG structure by iteratively incorporating query-relevant missing knowledge. Experiments on five benchmark question-answering datasets substantiate the effectiveness of TCR-QF in KG and LLM integration, where itachieves a 29.1% improvement in Exact Match and a 15.5% improvement in F1 over its state-of-the-art GraphRAG competitors.</description>

      <title>Diffusion-based Hierarchical Negative Sampling for Multimodal Knowledge Graph Completion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal Knowledge Graph Completion (MMKGC) aims to address the critical issue of missing knowledge in multimodal knowledge graphs (MMKGs) for their better applications. However, both the previous MMGKC and negative sampling (NS) approaches ignore the employment of multimodal information to generate diverse and high-quality negative triples from various semantic levels and hardness levels, thereby limiting the effectiveness of training MMKGC models. Thus, we propose a novel Diffusion-based Hierarchical Negative Sampling (DHNS) scheme tailored for MMKGC tasks, which tackles the challenge of generating high-quality negative triples by leveraging a Diffusion-based Hierarchical Embedding Generation (DiffHEG) that progressively conditions on entities and relations as well as multimodal semantics. Furthermore, we develop a Negative Triple-Adaptive Training (NTAT) strategy that dynamically adjusts training margins associated with the hardness level of the synthesized negative triples, facilitating a more robust and effective learning procedure to distinguish between positive and negative triples. Extensive experiments on three MMKGC benchmark datasets demonstrate that our framework outperforms several state-of-the-art MMKGC models and negative sampling techniques, illustrating the effectiveness of our DHNS for training MMKGC models. The source codes and datasets of this paper are available at https://github.com/ngl567/DHNS.</description>

      <title>A Neurosymbolic Framework for Geometric Reduction of Binary Forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper compares Julia reduction and hyperbolic reduction with the aim of finding equivalent binary forms with minimal coefficients. We demonstrate that hyperbolic reduction generally outperforms Julia reduction, particularly in the cases of sextics and decimics, though neither method guarantees achieving the minimal form. We further propose an additional shift and scaling to approximate the minimal form more closely. Finally, we introduce a machine learning framework to identify optimal transformations that minimize the heights of binary forms. This study provides new insights into the geometry and algebra of binary forms and highlights the potential of AI in advancing symbolic computation and reduction techniques. The findings, supported by extensive computational experiments, lay the groundwork for hybrid approaches that integrate traditional reduction methods with data-driven techniques.</description>

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has potential to revolutionize the field of oncology by enhancing the precision of cancer diagnosis, optimizing treatment strategies, and personalizing therapies for a variety of cancers. This review examines the limitations of conventional diagnostic techniques and explores the transformative role of AI in diagnosing and treating cancers such as lung, breast, colorectal, liver, stomach, esophageal, cervical, thyroid, prostate, and skin cancers. The primary objective of this paper is to highlight the significant advancements that AI algorithms have brought to oncology within the medical industry. By enabling early cancer detection, improving diagnostic accuracy, and facilitating targeted treatment delivery, AI contributes to substantial improvements in patient outcomes. The integration of AI in medical imaging, genomic analysis, and pathology enhances diagnostic precision and introduces a novel, less invasive approach to cancer screening. This not only boosts the effectiveness of medical facilities but also reduces operational costs. The study delves into the application of AI in radiomics for detailed cancer characterization, predictive analytics for identifying associated risks, and the development of algorithm-driven robots for immediate diagnosis. Furthermore, it investigates the impact of AI on addressing healthcare challenges, particularly in underserved and remote regions. The overarching goal of this platform is to support the development of expert recommendations and to provide universal, efficient diagnostic procedures. By reviewing existing research and clinical studies, this paper underscores the pivotal role of AI in improving the overall cancer care system. It emphasizes how AI-enabled systems can enhance clinical decision-making and expand treatment options, thereby underscoring the importance of AI in advancing precision oncology</description>

      <title>Expert-Free Online Transfer Learning in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) enables an intelligent agent to optimise its performance in a task by continuously taking action from an observed state and receiving a feedback from the environment in form of rewards. RL typically uses tables or linear approximators to map state-action tuples that maximises the reward. Combining RL with deep neural networks (DRL) significantly increases its scalability and enables it to address more complex problems than before. However, DRL also inherits downsides from both RL and deep learning. Despite DRL improves generalisation across similar state-action pairs when compared to simpler RL policy representations like tabular methods, it still requires the agent to adequately explore the state-action space. Additionally, deep methods require more training data, with the volume of data escalating with the complexity and size of the neural network. As a result, deep RL requires a long time to collect enough agent-environment samples and to successfully learn the underlying policy. Furthermore, often even a slight alteration to the task invalidates any previous acquired knowledge. To address these shortcomings, Transfer Learning (TL) has been introduced, which enables the use of external knowledge from other tasks or agents to enhance a learning process. The goal of TL is to reduce the learning complexity for an agent dealing with an unfamiliar task by simplifying the exploration process. This is achieved by lowering the amount of new information required by its learning model, resulting in a reduced overall convergence time...</description>

      <title>Rethinking External Slow-Thinking: From Snowball Errors to Probability of Correct Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Test-time scaling, which is also often referred to as \textit{slow-thinking}, has been demonstrated to enhance multi-step reasoning in large language models (LLMs). However, despite its widespread utilization, the mechanisms underlying slow-thinking methods remain poorly understood. This paper explores the mechanisms of external slow-thinking from a theoretical standpoint. We begin by examining the snowball error effect within the LLM reasoning process and connect it to the likelihood of correct reasoning using information theory. Building on this, we show that external slow-thinking methods can be interpreted as strategies to mitigate the error probability. We further provide a comparative analysis of popular external slow-thinking approaches, ranging from simple to complex, highlighting their differences and interrelationships. Our findings suggest that the efficacy of these methods is not primarily determined by the specific framework employed, and that expanding the search scope or the model's internal reasoning capacity may yield more sustained improvements in the long term. We open-source our code at \url{https://github.com/ZyGan1999/Snowball-Errors-and-Probability}.</description>

      <title>Propositional Interpretability in Artificial Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability is the program of explaining what AI systems are doing in terms of their internal mechanisms. I analyze some aspects of the program, along with setting out some concrete challenges and assessing progress to date. I argue for the importance of propositional interpretability, which involves interpreting a system's mechanisms and behavior in terms of propositional attitudes: attitudes (such as belief, desire, or subjective probability) to propositions (e.g. the proposition that it is hot outside). Propositional attitudes are the central way that we interpret and explain human beings and they are likely to be central in AI too. A central challenge is what I call thought logging: creating systems that log all of the relevant propositional attitudes in an AI system over time. I examine currently popular methods of interpretability (such as probing, sparse auto-encoders, and chain of thought methods) as well as philosophical methods of interpretation (including those grounded in psychosemantics) to assess their strengths and weaknesses as methods of propositional interpretability.</description>

      <title>LLM-powered Multi-agent Framework for Goal-oriented Learning in Intelligent Tutoring System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs) have revolutionized education by offering personalized learning experiences. However, as goal-oriented learning, which emphasizes efficiently achieving specific objectives, becomes increasingly important in professional contexts, existing ITSs often struggle to deliver this type of targeted learning experience. In this paper, we propose GenMentor, an LLM-powered multi-agent framework designed to deliver goal-oriented, personalized learning within ITS. GenMentor begins by accurately mapping learners' goals to required skills using a fine-tuned LLM trained on a custom goal-to-skill dataset. After identifying the skill gap, it schedules an efficient learning path using an evolving optimization approach, driven by a comprehensive and dynamic profile of learners' multifaceted status. Additionally, GenMentor tailors learning content with an exploration-drafting-integration mechanism to align with individual learner needs. Extensive automated and human evaluations demonstrate GenMentor's effectiveness in learning guidance and content quality. Furthermore, we have deployed it in practice and also implemented it as an application. Practical human study with professional learners further highlights its effectiveness in goal alignment and resource targeting, leading to enhanced personalization.

      <title>Harnessing Diverse Perspectives: A Multi-Agent Framework for Enhanced Error Detection in Knowledge Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowledge graphs are widely used in industrial applications, making error detection crucial for ensuring the reliability of downstream applications. Existing error detection methods often fail to effectively leverage fine-grained subgraph information and rely solely on fixed graph structures, while also lacking transparency in their decision-making processes, which results in suboptimal detection performance. In this paper, we propose a novel Multi-Agent framework for Knowledge Graph Error Detection (MAKGED) that utilizes multiple large language models (LLMs) in a collaborative setting. By concatenating fine-grained, bidirectional subgraph embeddings with LLM-based query embeddings during training, our framework integrates these representations to produce four specialized agents. These agents utilize subgraph information from different dimensions to engage in multi-round discussions, thereby improving error detection accuracy and ensuring a transparent decision-making process. Extensive experiments on FB15K and WN18RR demonstrate that MAKGED outperforms state-of-the-art methods, enhancing the accuracy and robustness of KG evaluation. For specific industrial scenarios, our framework can facilitate the training of specialized agents using domain-specific knowledge graphs for error detection, which highlights the potential industrial application value of our framework. Our code and datasets are available at https://github.com/kse-ElEvEn/MAKGED.</description>

      <title>Are Transformers Able to Reason by Connecting Separated Knowledge in Training Data?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Humans exhibit remarkable compositional reasoning by integrating knowledge from various sources. For example, if someone learns ( B = f(A) ) from one source and ( C = g(B) ) from another, they can deduce ( C=g(B)=g(f(A)) ) even without encountering ( ABC ) together, showcasing the generalization ability of human intelligence. In this paper, we introduce a synthetic learning task, "FTCT" (Fragmented at Training, Chained at Testing), to validate the potential of Transformers in replicating this skill and interpret its inner mechanism. In the training phase, data consist of separated knowledge fragments from an overall causal graph. During testing, Transformers must infer complete causal graph traces by integrating these fragments. Our findings demonstrate that few-shot Chain-of-Thought prompting enables Transformers to perform compositional reasoning on FTCT by revealing correct combinations of fragments, even if such combinations were absent in the training data. Furthermore, the emergence of compositional reasoning ability is strongly correlated with the model complexity and training-testing data similarity. We propose, both theoretically and empirically, that Transformers learn an underlying generalizable program from training, enabling effective compositional reasoning during testing.</description>

      <title>Flexible Blood Glucose Control: Offline Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated success in automating insulin dosing in simulated type 1 diabetes (T1D) patients but is currently unable to incorporate patient expertise and preference. This work introduces PAINT (Preference Adaptation for INsulin control in T1D), an original RL framework for learning flexible insulin dosing policies from patient records. PAINT employs a sketch-based approach for reward learning, where past data is annotated with a continuous reward signal to reflect patient's desired outcomes. Labelled data trains a reward model, informing the actions of a novel safety-constrained offline RL algorithm, designed to restrict actions to a safe strategy and enable preference tuning via a sliding scale. In-silico evaluation shows PAINT achieves common glucose goals through simple labelling of desired states, reducing glycaemic risk by 15% over a commercial benchmark. Action labelling can also be used to incorporate patient expertise, demonstrating an ability to pre-empt meals (+10% time-in-range post-meal) and address certain device errors (-1.6% variance post-error) with patient guidance. These results hold under realistic conditions, including limited samples, labelling errors, and intra-patient variability. This work illustrates PAINT's potential in real-world T1D management and more broadly any tasks requiring rapid and precise preference learning under safety constraints.</description>

      <title>AI Agents for Computer Use: A Review of Instruction-based Computer Control, GUI Automation, and Operator Assistants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Instruction-based computer control agents (CCAs) execute complex action sequences on personal computers or mobile devices to fulfill tasks using the same graphical user interfaces as a human user would, provided instructions in natural language. This review offers a comprehensive overview of the emerging field of instruction-based computer control, examining available agents -- their taxonomy, development, and respective resources -- and emphasizing the shift from manually designed, specialized agents to leveraging foundation models such as large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs). We formalize the problem and establish a taxonomy of the field to analyze agents from three perspectives: (a) the environment perspective, analyzing computer environments; (b) the interaction perspective, describing observations spaces (e.g., screenshots, HTML) and action spaces (e.g., mouse and keyboard actions, executable code); and (c) the agent perspective, focusing on the core principle of how an agent acts and learns to act. Our framework encompasses both specialized and foundation agents, facilitating their comparative analysis and revealing how prior solutions in specialized agents, such as an environment learning step, can guide the development of more capable foundation agents. Additionally, we review current CCA datasets and CCA evaluation methods and outline the challenges to deploying such agents in a productive setting. In total, we review and classify 86 CCAs and 33 related datasets. By highlighting trends, limitations, and future research directions, this work presents a comprehensive foundation to obtain a broad understanding of the field and push its future development.</description>

      <title>From Informal to Formal -- Incorporating and Evaluating LLMs on Natural Language Requirements to Verifiable Formal Proofs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The research in AI-based formal mathematical reasoning has shown an unstoppable growth trend. These studies have excelled in mathematical competitions like IMO, showing significant progress. However, these studies intertwined multiple skills simultaneously, i.e., problem-solving, reasoning, and writing formal specifications, making it hard to precisely identify the LLMs' strengths and weaknesses in each task. This paper focuses on formal verification, an immediate application scenario of formal reasoning, and decomposes it into six sub-tasks. We constructed 18k high-quality instruction-response pairs across five mainstream formal specification languages (Coq, Lean4, Dafny, ACSL, and TLA+) in six formal-verification-related tasks by distilling GPT-4o. They are split into a 14k+ fine-tuning dataset FM-alpaca and a 4k benchmark FM-Bench. We found that LLMs are good at writing proof segments when given either the code, or the detailed description of proof steps. Also, the fine-tuning brought about a nearly threefold improvement at most. Interestingly, we observed that fine-tuning with formal data also enhances mathematics, reasoning, and coding abilities. We hope our findings inspire further research. Fine-tuned models are released to facilitate subsequent studies</description>

      <title>Enhancing Visual Inspection Capability of Multi-Modal Large Language Models on Medical Time Series with Supportive Conformalized and Interpretable Small Specialized Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities in visual inspection of medical time-series data, achieving proficiency comparable to human clinicians. However, their broad scope limits domain-specific precision, and proprietary weights hinder fine-tuning for specialized datasets. In contrast, small specialized models (SSMs) excel in targeted tasks but lack the contextual reasoning required for complex clinical decision-making. To address these challenges, we propose ConMIL (Conformalized Multiple Instance Learning), a decision-support SSM that integrates seamlessly with LLMs. By using Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) to identify clinically significant signal segments and conformal prediction for calibrated set-valued outputs, ConMIL enhances LLMs' interpretative capabilities for medical time-series analysis. Experimental results demonstrate that ConMIL significantly improves the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs, such as ChatGPT4.0 and Qwen2-VL-7B. Specifically, \ConMIL{}-supported Qwen2-VL-7B achieves 94.92% and 96.82% precision for confident samples in arrhythmia detection and sleep staging, compared to standalone LLM accuracy of 46.13% and 13.16%. These findings highlight the potential of ConMIL to bridge task-specific precision and broader contextual reasoning, enabling more reliable and interpretable AI-driven clinical decision support.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Continual learning has emerged as a pivotal area of research, primarily due to its advantageous characteristic that allows models to persistently acquire and retain information. However, catastrophic forgetting can severely impair model performance. In this study, we tackle the issue of network forgetting by introducing a novel framework termed Optimally-Weighted Maximum Mean Discrepancy (OWMMD), which imposes penalties on representation alterations via a Multi-Level Feature Matching Mechanism (MLFMM). Furthermore, we propose an Adaptive Regularization Optimization (ARO) strategy to refine the adaptive weight vectors, which autonomously assess the significance of each feature layer throughout the optimization process. We conduct a comprehensive series of experiments, benchmarking our proposed method against several established baselines. The empirical findings indicate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance.</description>

      <title>A transformer-based deep q learning approach for dynamic load balancing in software-defined networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study proposes a novel approach for dynamic load balancing in Software-Defined Networks (SDNs) using a Transformer-based Deep Q-Network (DQN). Traditional load balancing mechanisms, such as Round Robin (RR) and Weighted Round Robin (WRR), are static and often struggle to adapt to fluctuating traffic conditions, leading to inefficiencies in network performance. In contrast, SDNs offer centralized control and flexibility, providing an ideal platform for implementing machine learning-driven optimization strategies. The core of this research combines a Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) for accurate traffic prediction with a DQN model to perform real-time dynamic load balancing. The TFT model predicts future traffic loads, which the DQN uses as input, allowing it to make intelligent routing decisions that optimize throughput, minimize latency, and reduce packet loss. The proposed model was tested against RR and WRR in simulated environments with varying data rates, and the results demonstrate significant improvements in network performance. For the 500MB data rate, the DQN model achieved an average throughput of 0.275 compared to 0.202 and 0.205 for RR and WRR, respectively. Additionally, the DQN recorded lower average latency and packet loss. In the 1000MB simulation, the DQN model outperformed the traditional methods in throughput, latency, and packet loss, reinforcing its effectiveness in managing network loads dynamically. This research presents an important step towards enhancing network performance through the integration of machine learning models within SDNs, potentially paving the way for more adaptive, intelligent network management systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the realm of software development, providing accurate and personalized code explanations is crucial for both technical professionals and business stakeholders. Technical professionals benefit from enhanced understanding and improved problem-solving skills, while business stakeholders gain insights into project alignments and transparency. Despite the potential, generating such explanations is often time-consuming and challenging. This paper presents an innovative approach that leverages the advanced capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to generate faithful and personalized code explanations. Our methodology integrates prompt enhancement, self-correction mechanisms, personalized content customization, and interaction with external tools, facilitated by collaboration among multiple LLM agents. We evaluate our approach using both automatic and human assessments, demonstrating that our method not only produces accurate explanations but also tailors them to individual user preferences. Our findings suggest that this approach significantly improves the quality and relevance of code explanations, offering a valuable tool for developers and stakeholders alike.</description>

      <title>LLM as HPC Expert: Extending RAG Architecture for HPC Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-Performance Computing (HPC) is crucial for performing advanced computational tasks, yet their complexity often challenges users, particularly those unfamiliar with HPC-specific commands and workflows. This paper introduces Hypothetical Command Embeddings (HyCE), a novel method that extends Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by integrating real-time, user-specific HPC data, enhancing accessibility to these systems. HyCE enriches large language models (LLM) with real-time, user-specific HPC information, addressing the limitations of fine-tuned models on such data. We evaluate HyCE using an automated RAG evaluation framework, where the LLM itself creates synthetic questions from the HPC data and serves as a judge, assessing the efficacy of the extended RAG with the evaluation metrics relevant for HPC tasks. Additionally, we tackle essential security concerns, including data privacy and command execution risks, associated with deploying LLMs in HPC environments. This solution provides a scalable and adaptable approach for HPC clusters to leverage LLMs as HPC expert, bridging the gap between users and the complex systems of HPC.</description>

      <title>Research on the Application of Spark Streaming Real-Time Data Analysis System and large language model Intelligent Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study explores the integration of Agent AI with LangGraph to enhance real-time data analysis systems in big data environments. The proposed framework overcomes limitations of static workflows, inefficient stateful computations, and lack of human intervention by leveraging LangGraph's graph-based workflow construction and dynamic decision-making capabilities. LangGraph allows large language models (LLMs) to dynamically determine control flows, invoke tools, and assess the necessity of further actions, improving flexibility and efficiency.
  The system architecture incorporates Apache Spark Streaming, Kafka, and LangGraph to create a high-performance sentiment analysis system. LangGraph's capabilities include precise state management, dynamic workflow construction, and robust memory checkpointing, enabling seamless multi-turn interactions and context retention. Human-in-the-loop mechanisms are integrated to refine sentiment analysis, particularly in ambiguous or high-stakes scenarios, ensuring greater reliability and contextual relevance.
  Key features such as real-time state streaming, debugging via LangGraph Studio, and efficient handling of large-scale data streams make this framework ideal for adaptive decision-making. Experimental results confirm the system's ability to classify inquiries, detect sentiment trends, and escalate complex issues for manual review, demonstrating a synergistic blend of LLM capabilities and human oversight.
  This work presents a scalable, adaptable, and reliable solution for real-time sentiment analysis and decision-making, advancing the use of Agent AI and LangGraph in big data applications.</description>

      <title>ARCEAK: An Automated Rule Checking Framework Enhanced with Architectural Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automated Rule Checking (ARC) plays a crucial role in advancing the construction industry by addressing the laborious, inconsistent, and error-prone nature of traditional model review conducted by industry professionals. Manual assessment against intricate sets of rules often leads to significant project delays and expenses. In response to these challenges, ARC offers a promising solution to improve efficiency and compliance in design within the construction sector. However, the main challenge of ARC lies in translating regulatory text into a format suitable for computer processing. Current methods for rule interpretation require extensive manual labor, thereby limiting their practicality. To address this issue, our study introduces a novel approach that decomposes ARC into two distinct tasks: rule information extraction and verification code generation. Leveraging generative pre-trained transformers, our method aims to streamline the interpretation of regulatory texts and simplify the process of generating model compliance checking code. Through empirical evaluation and case studies, we showcase the effectiveness and potential of our approach in automating code compliance checking, enhancing the efficiency and reliability of construction projects.</description>

      <title>EvalSVA: Multi-Agent Evaluators for Next-Gen Software Vulnerability Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Software Vulnerability (SV) assessment is a crucial process of determining different aspects of SVs (e.g., attack vectors and scope) for developers to effectively prioritize efforts in vulnerability mitigation. It presents a challenging and laborious process due to the complexity of SVs and the scarcity of labeled data. To mitigate the above challenges, we introduce EvalSVA, a multi-agent evaluators team to autonomously deliberate and evaluate various aspects of SV assessment. Specifically, we propose a multi-agent-based framework to simulate vulnerability assessment strategies in real-world scenarios, which employs multiple Large Language Models (LLMs) into an integrated group to enhance the effectiveness of SV assessment in the limited data. We also design diverse communication strategies to autonomously discuss and assess different aspects of SV. Furthermore, we construct a multi-lingual SV assessment dataset based on the new standard of CVSS, comprising 699, 888, and 1,310 vulnerability-related commits in C++, Python, and Java, respectively. Our experimental results demonstrate that EvalSVA averagely outperforms the 44.12\% accuracy and 43.29\% F1 for SV assessment compared with the previous methods. It shows that EvalSVA offers a human-like process and generates both reason and answer for SV assessment. EvalSVA can also aid human experts in SV assessment, which provides more explanation and details for SV assessment.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Green Economy with Artificial Intelligence: Role of Energy Use and FDI in the United States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The escalating challenge of climate change necessitates an urgent exploration of factors influencing carbon emissions. This study contributes to the discourse by examining the interplay of technological, economic, and demographic factors on environmental sustainability. This study investigates the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) innovation, economic growth, foreign direct investment (FDI), energy consumption, and urbanization on CO2 emissions in the United States from 1990 to 2022. Employing the ARDL framework integrated with the STIRPAT model, the findings reveal a dual narrative: while AI innovation mitigates environmental stress, economic growth, energy use, FDI, and urbanization exacerbate environmental degradation. Unit root tests (ADF, PP, and DF-GLS) confirm mixed integration levels among variables, and the ARDL bounds test establishes long-term co-integration. The analysis highlights that AI innovation positively correlates with CO2 reduction when environmental safeguards are in place, whereas GDP growth, energy consumption, FDI, and urbanization intensify CO2 emissions. Robustness checks using FMOLS, DOLS, and CCR validate the ARDL findings. Additionally, Pairwise Granger causality tests reveal significant one-way causal links between CO2 emissions and economic growth, AI innovation, energy use, FDI, and urbanization. These relationships emphasize the critical role of AI-driven technological advancements, sustainable investments, and green energy in fostering ecological sustainability. The study suggests policy measures such as encouraging green FDI, advancing AI technologies, adopting sustainable energy practices, and implementing eco-friendly urban development to promote sustainable growth in the USA.</description>

Abstract: The AI Act introduces the obligation to conduct a Fundamental Rights Impact Assessment (FRIA), with the possibility to reuse a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA), and requires the EU Commission to create of an automated tool to support the FRIA process. In this article, we provide our novel exploration of the DPIA and FRIA as information processes to enable the creation of automated tools. We first investigate the information involved in DPIA and FRIA, and then use this to align the two to state where a DPIA can be reused in a FRIA. We then present the FRIA as a 5-step process and discuss the role of an automated tool for each step. Our work provides the necessary foundation for creating and managing information for FRIA and supporting it through an automated tool as required by the AI Act.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of social media and artificial intelligence (AI) into disaster management, particularly for earthquake response, represents a profound evolution in emergency management practices. In the digital age, real-time information sharing has reached unprecedented levels, with social media platforms emerging as crucial communication channels during crises. This shift has transformed traditional, centralized emergency services into more decentralized, participatory models of disaster situational awareness. Our study includes an experimental analysis of 8,900 social media interactions, including 2,920 posts and 5,980 replies on X (formerly Twitter), following a magnitude 5.1 earthquake in Oklahoma on February 2, 2024. The analysis covers data from the immediate aftermath and extends over the following seven days, illustrating the critical role of digital platforms in modern disaster response. The results demonstrate that social media platforms can be effectively used as real-time situational awareness tools, delivering critical information to society and authorities during emergencies.</description>

      <title>Equation discovery framework EPDE: Towards a better equation discovery</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Equation discovery methods hold promise for extracting knowledge from physics-related data. However, existing approaches often require substantial prior information that significantly reduces the amount of knowledge extracted. In this paper, we enhance the EPDE algorithm -- an evolutionary optimization-based discovery framework. In contrast to methods like SINDy, which rely on pre-defined libraries of terms and linearities, our approach generates terms using fundamental building blocks such as elementary functions and individual differentials. Within evolutionary optimization, we may improve the computation of the fitness function as is done in gradient methods and enhance the optimization algorithm itself. By incorporating multi-objective optimization, we effectively explore the search space, yielding more robust equation extraction, even when dealing with complex experimental data. We validate our algorithm's noise resilience and overall performance by comparing its results with those from the state-of-the-art equation discovery framework SINDy.</description>

Abstract: This review examines over 150 new metaheuristics of the last six years (between 2019 and 2024), underscoring their profound influence and performance. Over the past three decades, more than 500 new metaheuristic algorithms have been proposed, with no slowdown in sight. An overwhelming abundance that complicates the process of selecting and assessing the most effective solutions for complex optimization challenges. Our evaluation centers on pivotal criteria, including annual citation metrics, the breadth of the addressed problem types, source code availability, user friendly parameter configurations, innovative mechanisms and operators, and approaches designed to mitigate traditional metaheuristic issues such as stagnation and premature convergence. We further explore recent high impact applications of the past six years' most influential 23 metahueristic algorithms, shedding light on their advantages and limitations, while identifying challenges and potential avenues for future research.</description>

      <title>DropMicroFluidAgents (DMFAs): Autonomous Droplet Microfluidic Research Framework Through Large Language Model Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Applying Large language models (LLMs) within specific domains requires substantial adaptation to account for the unique terminologies, nuances, and context-specific challenges inherent to those areas. Here, we introduce DropMicroFluidAgents (DMFAs), an advanced language-driven framework leveraging state-of-the-art pre-trained LLMs. DMFAs employs LLM agents to perform two key functions: (1) delivering focused guidance, answers, and suggestions specific to droplet microfluidics and (2) generating machine learning models to optimise and automate the design of droplet microfluidic devices, including the creation of code-based computer-aided design (CAD) scripts to enable rapid and precise design execution. Experimental evaluations demonstrated that the integration of DMFAs with the LLAMA3.1 model yielded the highest accuracy of 76.15%, underscoring the significant performance enhancement provided by agent integration. This effect was particularly pronounced when DMFAs were paired with the GEMMA2 model, resulting in a 34.47% improvement in accuracy compared to the standalone GEMMA2 configuration. This study demonstrates the effective use of LLM agents in droplet microfluidics research as powerful tools for automating workflows, synthesising knowledge, optimising designs, and interacting with external systems. These capabilities enable their application across education and industrial support, driving greater efficiency in scientific discovery and innovation.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Firefly-Genetic Algorithm for Single and Multi-dimensional 0-1 Knapsack Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges faced by algorithms, such as the Firefly Algorithm (FA) and the Genetic Algorithm (GA), in constrained optimization problems. While both algorithms perform well for unconstrained problems, their effectiveness diminishes when constraints are introduced due to limitations in exploration, exploitation, and constraint handling. To overcome these challenges, a hybrid FAGA algorithm is proposed, combining the strengths of both algorithms. The hybrid algorithm is validated by solving unconstrained benchmark functions and constrained optimization problems, including design engineering problems and combinatorial problems such as the 0-1 Knapsack Problem. The proposed algorithm delivers improved solution accuracy and computational efficiency compared to conventional optimization algorithm. This paper outlines the development and structure of the hybrid algorithm and demonstrates its effectiveness in handling complex optimization problems.</description>

      <title>Green AI: Which Programming Language Consumes the Most?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AI is demanding an evergrowing portion of environmental resources. Despite their potential impact on AI environmental sustainability, the role that programming languages play in AI (in)efficiency is to date still unknown. With this study, we aim to understand the impact that programming languages can have on AI environmental sustainability. To achieve our goal, we conduct a controlled empirical experiment by considering five programming languages (C++, Java, Python, MATLAB, and R), seven AI algorithms (KNN, SVC, AdaBoost, decision tree, logistic regression, naive bayses, and random forest), three popular datasets, and the training and inference phases. The collected results show that programming languages have a considerable impact on AI environmental sustainability. Compiled and semi-compiled languages (C++, Java) consistently consume less than interpreted languages (Python, MATLAB, R), which require up to 54x more energy. Some languages are cumulatively more efficient in training, while others in inference. Which programming language consumes the most highly depends on the algorithm considered. Ultimately, algorithm implementation might be the most determining factor in Green AI, regardless of the language used. As conclusion, while making AI more environmentally sustainable is paramount, a trade-off between energy efficiency and implementation ease should always be considered. Green AI can be achieved without the need of completely disrupting the development practices and technologies currently in place.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Global supply lines have been severely disrupted by the COVID-19 epidemic and the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, which has sharply increased the price of commodities and generated inflation. These incidents highlight how critical it is to improve supply chain resilience (SCRES) in order to fend off unforeseen setbacks. Controlling both internal and external interruptions, such as transportation problems brought on by natural catastrophes and wars, is the responsibility of SCRES. Enhancing resilience in supply chains requires accurate and timely information transfer.
  Promising answers to these problems can be found in the Metaverse and ChatGPT, two new digital technologies. The Metaverse may imitate real-world situations and offer dynamic, real-time 3D representations of supply chain data by integrating blockchain, IoT, network connection, and computer power.Large-scale natural language processing model ChatGPT improves communication and data translation accuracy and speed. To manage risk and facilitate decision making in Supply Chain management, firms should increase information transmission, Speed and quality. This study aim to show the importance of ChatGPT and Metaverse technologies to improve SCRES, with an emphasis on the most important criteria for SCRES, and maturity factor that can influence directly the SC development.</description>

      <title>The Use of Generative Artificial Intelligence for Upper Secondary Mathematics Education Through the Lens of Technology Acceptance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigated the students' perceptions of using Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) in upper-secondary mathematics education. Data was collected from Finnish high school students to represent how key constructs of the Technology Acceptance Model (Perceived Usefulness, Perceived Ease of Use, Perceived Enjoyment, and Intention to Use) influence the adoption of AI tools. First, a structural equation model for a comparative study with a prior study was constructed and analyzed. Then, an extended model with the additional construct of Compatibility, which represents the alignment of AI tools with students' educational experiences and needs, was proposed and analyzed. The results demonstrated a strong influence of perceived usefulness on the intention to use GenAI, emphasizing the statistically significant role of perceived enjoyment in determining perceived usefulness and ease of use. The inclusion of compatibility improved the model's explanatory power, particularly in predicting perceived usefulness. This study contributes to a deeper understanding of how AI tools can be integrated into mathematics education and highlights key differences between the Finnish educational context and previous studies based on structural equation modeling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the largest population of the world and one of the highest enrolments in higher education, India needs efficient and effective means to educate its learners. India started focusing on open and digital education in 1980's and its efforts were escalated in 2009 through the NMEICT program of the Government of India. A study by the Government and FICCI in 2014 noted that India cannot meet its educational needs just by capacity building in brick and mortar institutions. It was decided that ongoing MOOCs projects under the umbrella of NMEICT will be further strengthened over its second (2017-21) and third (2021-26) phases. NMEICT now steers NPTEL or SWAYAM (India's MOOCs) and several digital learning projects including Virtual Labs, e-Yantra, Spoken Tutorial, FOSSEE, and National Digital Library on India - the largest digital education library in the world. Further, India embraced its new National Education Policy in 2020 to strongly foster online education. In this chapter, we take a deep look into the evolution of MOOCs in India, its innovations, its current status and impact, and the roadmap for the next decade to address its challenges and grow. AI-powered MOOCs is an emerging opportunity for India to lead MOOCs worldwide.</description>

      <title>DeServe: Towards Affordable Offline LLM Inference via Decentralization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid growth of generative AI and its integration into everyday workflows have significantly increased the demand for large language model (LLM) inference services. While proprietary models remain popular, recent advancements in open-source LLMs have positioned them as strong contenders. However, deploying these models is often constrained by the high costs and limited availability of GPU resources. In response, this paper presents the design of a decentralized offline serving system for LLM inference. Utilizing idle GPU resources, our proposed system, DeServe, decentralizes access to LLMs at a lower cost. DeServe specifically addresses key challenges in optimizing serving throughput in high-latency network environments. Experiments demonstrate that DeServe achieves a 6.7x-12.6x improvement in throughput over existing serving system baselines in such conditions.</description>

      <title>ED-Filter: Dynamic Feature Filtering for Eating Disorder Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Eating disorders (ED) are critical psychiatric problems that have alarmed the mental health community. Mental health professionals are increasingly recognizing the utility of data derived from social media platforms such as Twitter. However, high dimensionality and extensive feature sets of Twitter data present remarkable challenges for ED classification. To overcome these hurdles, we introduce a novel method, an informed branch and bound search technique known as ED-Filter. This strategy significantly improves the drawbacks of conventional feature selection algorithms such as filters and wrappers. ED-Filter iteratively identifies an optimal set of promising features that maximize the eating disorder classification accuracy. In order to adapt to the dynamic nature of Twitter ED data, we enhance the ED-Filter with a hybrid greedy-based deep learning algorithm. This algorithm swiftly identifies sub-optimal features to accommodate the ever-evolving data landscape. Experimental results on Twitter eating disorder data affirm the effectiveness and efficiency of ED-Filter. The method demonstrates significant improvements in classification accuracy and proves its value in eating disorder detection on social media platforms.</description>

      <title>Towards Dynamic Neural Communication and Speech Neuroprosthesis Based on Viseme Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decoding text, speech, or images from human neural signals holds promising potential both as neuroprosthesis for patients and as innovative communication tools for general users. Although neural signals contain various information on speech intentions, movements, and phonetic details, generating informative outputs from them remains challenging, with mostly focusing on decoding short intentions or producing fragmented outputs. In this study, we developed a diffusion model-based framework to decode visual speech intentions from speech-related non-invasive brain signals, to facilitate face-to-face neural communication. We designed an experiment to consolidate various phonemes to train visemes of each phoneme, aiming to learn the representation of corresponding lip formations from neural signals. By decoding visemes from both isolated trials and continuous sentences, we successfully reconstructed coherent lip movements, effectively bridging the gap between brain signals and dynamic visual interfaces. The results highlight the potential of viseme decoding and talking face reconstruction from human neural signals, marking a significant step toward dynamic neural communication systems and speech neuroprosthesis for patients.</description>

      <title>HeteroLLM: Accelerating Large Language Model Inference on Mobile SoCs platform with Heterogeneous AI Accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence technologies such as ChatGPT, AI agents and video generation,contemporary mobile systems have begun integrating these AI capabilities on local devices to enhance privacy and reduce response latency. To meet the computational demands of AI tasks, current mobile SoCs are equipped with diverse AI accelerators, including GPUs and Neural Processing Units (NPUs). However, there has not been a comprehensive characterization of these heterogeneous processors, and existing designs typically only leverage a single AI accelerator for LLM inference, leading to suboptimal use of computational resources and memory bandwidth. In this paper, we first summarize key performance characteristics of mobile SoC, including heterogeneous processors, unified memory, synchronization, etc. Drawing on these observations, we propose different tensor partition strategies to fulfill the distinct requirements of the prefill and decoding phases. We further design a fast synchronization mechanism that leverages the unified memory address provided by mobile SoCs. By employing these techniques, we present HeteroLLM, the fastest LLM inference engine in mobile devices which supports both layer-level and tensor-level heterogeneous execution. Evaluation results show that HeteroLLM achieves 9.99 and 4.36 performance improvement over other mobile-side LLM inference engines: MLC and MNN.</description>

      <title>Towards Foundation Models: Evaluation of Geoscience Artificial Intelligence with Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has transformed the geoscience community with deep learning models (DLMs) that are trained to complete specific tasks within workflows. This success has led to the development of geoscience foundation models (FMs), which promise to accomplish multiple tasks within a workflow or replace the workflow altogether. However, lack of robust evaluation frameworks, even for traditional DLMs, leaves the geoscience community ill prepared for the inevitable adoption of FMs. We address this gap by designing an evaluation framework that jointly incorporates three crucial aspects to current DLMs and future FMs: performance uncertainty, learning efficiency, and overlapping training-test data splits. To target the three aspects, we meticulously construct the training, validation, and test splits using clustering methods tailored to geoscience data and enact an expansive training design to segregate performance uncertainty arising from stochastic training processes and random data sampling. The framework's ability to guard against misleading declarations of model superiority is demonstrated through evaluation of PhaseNet, a popular seismic phase picking DLM, under 3 training approaches. Furthermore, we show how the performance gains due to overlapping training-test data can lead to biased FM evaluation. Our framework helps practitioners choose the best model for their problem and set performance expectations by explicitly analyzing model performance at varying budgets of training data.</description>

      <title>A VM-HDL Co-Simulation Framework for Systems with PCIe-Connected FPGAs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: PCIe-connected FPGAs are gaining popularity as an accelerator technology in data centers. However, it is challenging to jointly develop and debug host software and FPGA hardware. Changes to the hardware design require a time-consuming FPGA synthesis process, and modification to the software, especially the operating system and device drivers, can frequently cause the system to hang, without providing enough information for debugging. The combination of these problems results in long debug iterations and a slow development process. To overcome these problems, we designed a VM-HDL co-simulation framework, which is capable of running the same software, operating system, and hardware designs as the target physical system, while providing full visibility and significantly shorter debug iterations.</description>

      <title>Eagle 2: Building Post-Training Data Strategies from Scratch for Frontier Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, promising progress has been made by open-source vision-language models (VLMs) in bringing their capabilities closer to those of proprietary frontier models. However, most open-source models only publish their final model weights, leaving the critical details of data strategies and implementation largely opaque. In this work, we address VLM post-training from a data-centric perspective, showing the key role of data strategy in developing frontier VLMs. By studying and building our post-training data strategy from scratch, we share detailed insights into the development processes, aiming to benefit the development of competitive models for the open-source community. Our introduced data strategy, together with training recipes and model design, leads to a family of performant VLMs named Eagle2. Specifically, Eagle2-9B achieves state-of-the-art results across various multimodal benchmarks, matching certain competitive models with up to 70B parameters.</description>

      <title>Controlling Ensemble Variance in Diffusion Models: An Application for Reanalyses Downscaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, diffusion models have emerged as powerful tools for generating ensemble members in meteorology. In this work, we demonstrate that a Denoising Diffusion Implicit Model (DDIM) can effectively control ensemble variance by varying the number of diffusion steps. Introducing a theoretical framework, we relate diffusion steps to the variance expressed by the reverse diffusion process. Focusing on reanalysis downscaling, we propose an ensemble diffusion model for the full ERA5-to-CERRA domain, generating variance-calibrated ensemble members for wind speed at full spatial and temporal resolution. Our method aligns global mean variance with a reference ensemble dataset and ensures spatial variance is distributed in accordance with observed meteorological variability. Additionally, we address the lack of ensemble information in the CARRA dataset, showcasing the utility of our approach for efficient, high-resolution ensemble generation.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Energy and Cost Benefits of Hybrid Edge Cloud: Analysis of Traditional and Agentic Workloads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper examines the workload distribution challenges in centralized cloud systems and demonstrates how Hybrid Edge Cloud (HEC) [1] mitigates these inefficiencies. Workloads in cloud environments often follow a Pareto distribution, where a small percentage of tasks consume most resources, leading to bottlenecks and energy inefficiencies. By analyzing both traditional workloads reflective of typical IoT and smart device usage and agentic workloads, such as those generated by AI agents, robotics, and autonomous systems, this study quantifies the energy and cost savings enabled by HEC. Our findings reveal that HEC achieves energy savings of up to 75% and cost reductions exceeding 80%, even in resource-intensive agentic scenarios. These results highlight the critical role of HEC in enabling scalable, cost-effective, and sustainable computing for the next generation of intelligent systems.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: E-commerce click-stream data and product catalogs offer critical user behavior insights and product knowledge. This paper propose a multi-modal transformer termed as PINCER, that leverages the above data sources to transform initial user queries into pseudo-product representations. By tapping into these external data sources, our model can infer users' potential purchase intent from their limited queries and capture query relevant product features. We demonstrate our model's superior performance over state-of-the-art alternatives on e-commerce online retrieval in both controlled and real-world experiments. Our ablation studies confirm that the proposed transformer architecture and integrated learning strategies enable the mining of key data sources to infer purchase intent, extract product features, and enhance the transformation pipeline from queries to more accurate pseudo-product representations.</description>

      <title>An Ensemble Model with Attention Based Mechanism for Image Captioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Image captioning creates informative text from an input image by creating a relationship between the words and the actual content of an image. Recently, deep learning models that utilize transformers have been the most successful in automatically generating image captions. The capabilities of transformer networks have led to notable progress in several activities related to vision. In this paper, we thoroughly examine transformer models, emphasizing the critical role that attention mechanisms play. The proposed model uses a transformer encoder-decoder architecture to create textual captions and a deep learning convolutional neural network to extract features from the images. To create the captions, we present a novel ensemble learning framework that improves the richness of the generated captions by utilizing several deep neural network architectures based on a voting mechanism that chooses the caption with the highest bilingual evaluation understudy (BLEU) score. The proposed model was evaluated using publicly available datasets. Using the Flickr8K dataset, the proposed model achieved the highest BLEU-[1-3] scores with rates of 0.728, 0.495, and 0.323, respectively. The suggested model outperformed the latest methods in Flickr30k datasets, determined by BLEU-[1-4] scores with rates of 0.798, 0.561, 0.387, and 0.269, respectively. The model efficacy was also obtained by the Semantic propositional image caption evaluation (SPICE) metric with a scoring rate of 0.164 for the Flicker8k dataset and 0.387 for the Flicker30k. Finally, ensemble learning significantly advances the process of image captioning and, hence, can be leveraged in various applications across different domains.</description>

      <title>Unmasking Conversational Bias in AI Multiagent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detecting biases in the outputs produced by generative models is essential to reduce the potential risks associated with their application in critical settings. However, the majority of existing methodologies for identifying biases in generated text consider the models in isolation and neglect their contextual applications. Specifically, the biases that may arise in multi-agent systems involving generative models remain under-researched. To address this gap, we present a framework designed to quantify biases within multi-agent systems of conversational Large Language Models (LLMs). Our approach involves simulating small echo chambers, where pairs of LLMs, initialized with aligned perspectives on a polarizing topic, engage in discussions. Contrary to expectations, we observe significant shifts in the stance expressed in the generated messages, particularly within echo chambers where all agents initially express conservative viewpoints, in line with the well-documented political bias of many LLMs toward liberal positions. Crucially, the bias observed in the echo-chamber experiment remains undetected by current state-of-the-art bias detection methods that rely on questionnaires. This highlights a critical need for the development of a more sophisticated toolkit for bias detection and mitigation for AI multi-agent systems. The code to perform the experiments is publicly available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/LLMsConversationalBias-7725.</description>

      <title>Wormhole Memory: A Rubik's Cube for Cross-Dialogue Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In view of the gap in the current large language model in sharing memory across dialogues, this research proposes a wormhole memory module (WMM) to realize memory as a Rubik's cube that can be arbitrarily retrieved between different dialogues. Through simulation experiments, the researcher built an experimental framework based on the Python environment and used setting memory barriers to simulate the current situation where memories between LLMs dialogues are difficult to share. The CoQA development data set was imported into the experiment, and the feasibility of its cross-dialogue memory retrieval function was verified for WMM's nonlinear indexing and dynamic retrieval, and a comparative analysis was conducted with the capabilities of Titans and MemGPT memory modules. Experimental results show that WMM demonstrated the ability to retrieve memory across dialogues and the stability of quantitative indicators in eight experiments. It contributes new technical approaches to the optimization of memory management of LLMs and provides experience for the practical application in the future.</description>

      <title>On the locality bias and results in the Long Range Arena</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Long Range Arena (LRA) benchmark was designed to evaluate the performance of Transformer improvements and alternatives in long-range dependency modeling tasks. The Transformer and its main variants performed poorly on this benchmark, and a new series of architectures such as State Space Models (SSMs) gained some traction, greatly outperforming Transformers in the LRA. Recent work has shown that with a denoising pre-training phase, Transformers can achieve competitive results in the LRA with these new architectures. In this work, we discuss and explain the superiority of architectures such as MEGA and SSMs in the Long Range Arena, as well as the recent improvement in the results of Transformers, pointing to the positional and local nature of the tasks. We show that while the LRA is a benchmark for long-range dependency modeling, in reality most of the performance comes from short-range dependencies. Using training techniques to mitigate data inefficiency, Transformers are able to reach state-of-the-art performance with proper positional encoding. In addition, with the same techniques, we were able to remove all restrictions from SSM convolutional kernels and learn fully parameterized convolutions without decreasing performance, suggesting that the design choices behind SSMs simply added inductive biases and learning efficiency for these particular tasks. Our insights indicate that LRA results should be interpreted with caution and call for a redesign of the benchmark.</description>

      <title>JustLogic: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Evaluating Deductive Reasoning in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Logical reasoning is a critical component of Large Language Models (LLMs), and substantial research efforts in recent years have aimed to enhance their deductive reasoning capabilities. However, existing deductive reasoning benchmarks, which are crucial for evaluating and advancing LLMs, are inadequate due to their lack of task complexity, presence of prior knowledge as a confounder, and superficial error analysis. To address these deficiencies, we introduce JustLogic, a synthetically generated deductive reasoning benchmark designed for rigorous evaluation of LLMs. JustLogic is (i) highly complex, capable of generating a diverse range of linguistic patterns, vocabulary, and argument structures; (ii) prior knowledge independent, eliminating the advantage of models possessing prior knowledge and ensuring that only deductive reasoning is used to answer questions; and (iii) capable of in-depth error analysis on the heterogeneous effects of reasoning depth and argument form on model accuracy. Our experimental results on JustLogic reveal that most state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs perform significantly worse than the human average, demonstrating substantial room for model improvement.

      <title>Noise-conditioned Energy-based Annealed Rewards (NEAR): A Generative Framework for Imitation Learning from Observation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new imitation learning framework based on energy-based generative models capable of learning complex, physics-dependent, robot motion policies through state-only expert motion trajectories. Our algorithm, called Noise-conditioned Energy-based Annealed Rewards (NEAR), constructs several perturbed versions of the expert's motion data distribution and learns smooth, and well-defined representations of the data distribution's energy function using denoising score matching. We propose to use these learnt energy functions as reward functions to learn imitation policies via reinforcement learning. We also present a strategy to gradually switch between the learnt energy functions, ensuring that the learnt rewards are always well-defined in the manifold of policy-generated samples. We evaluate our algorithm on complex humanoid tasks such as locomotion and martial arts and compare it with state-only adversarial imitation learning algorithms like Adversarial Motion Priors (AMP). Our framework sidesteps the optimisation challenges of adversarial imitation learning techniques and produces results comparable to AMP in several quantitative metrics across multiple imitation settings.</description>

      <title>Feasible Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Feasible Learning (FL), a sample-centric learning paradigm where models are trained by solving a feasibility problem that bounds the loss for each training sample. In contrast to the ubiquitous Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) framework, which optimizes for average performance, FL demands satisfactory performance on every individual data point. Since any model that meets the prescribed performance threshold is a valid FL solution, the choice of optimization algorithm and its dynamics play a crucial role in shaping the properties of the resulting solutions. In particular, we study a primal-dual approach which dynamically re-weights the importance of each sample during training. To address the challenge of setting a meaningful threshold in practice, we introduce a relaxation of FL that incorporates slack variables of minimal norm. Our empirical analysis, spanning image classification, age regression, and preference optimization in large language models, demonstrates that models trained via FL can learn from data while displaying improved tail behavior compared to ERM, with only a marginal impact on average performance.</description>

      <title>Decision Making in Changing Environments: Robustness, Query-Based Learning, and Differential Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of interactive decision making in which the underlying environment changes over time subject to given constraints. We propose a framework, which we call \textit{hybrid Decision Making with Structured Observations} (hybrid DMSO), that provides an interpolation between the stochastic and adversarial settings of decision making. Within this framework, we can analyze local differentially private (LDP) decision making, query-based learning (in particular, SQ learning), and robust and smooth decision making under the same umbrella, deriving upper and lower bounds based on variants of the Decision-Estimation Coefficient (DEC). We further establish strong connections between the DEC's behavior, the SQ dimension, local minimax complexity, learnability, and joint differential privacy. To showcase the framework's power, we provide new results for contextual bandits under the LDP constraint.</description>

      <title>Motion-enhancement to Echocardiography Segmentation via Inserting a Temporal Attention Module: An Efficient, Adaptable, and Scalable Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cardiac anatomy segmentation is essential for clinical assessment of cardiac function and disease diagnosis to inform treatment and intervention. In performing segmentation, deep learning (DL) algorithms improved accuracy significantly compared to traditional image processing approaches. More recently, studies showed that enhancing DL segmentation with motion information can further improve it. A range of methods for injecting motion information has been proposed, but many of them increase the dimensionality of input images (which is computationally expensive) or have not used an optimal method to insert motion information, such as non-DL registration, non-attention-based networks or single-headed attention. Here, we present a novel, computation-efficient alternative where a novel, scalable temporal attention module (TAM) extracts temporal feature interactions multiple times and where TAM has a multi-headed, KQV projection cross-attention architecture. The module can be seamlessly integrated into a wide range of existing CNN- or Transformer-based networks, providing novel flexibility for inclusion in future implementations. Extensive evaluations on different cardiac datasets, 2D echocardiography (CAMUS), and 3D echocardiography (MITEA) demonstrate the model's effectiveness when integrated into well-established backbone networks like UNet, FCN8s, UNetR, SwinUNetR, and the recent I2UNet. We further find that the optimized TAM-enhanced FCN8s network performs well compared to contemporary alternatives. Our results confirm TAM's robustness, scalability, and generalizability across diverse datasets and backbones.</description>

      <title>Explaining Categorical Feature Interactions Using Graph Covariance and LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern datasets often consist of numerous samples with abundant features and associated timestamps. Analyzing such datasets to uncover underlying events typically requires complex statistical methods and substantial domain expertise. A notable example, and the primary data focus of this paper, is the global synthetic dataset from the Counter Trafficking Data Collaborative (CTDC) -- a global hub of human trafficking data containing over 200,000 anonymized records spanning from 2002 to 2022, with numerous categorical features for each record. In this paper, we propose a fast and scalable method for analyzing and extracting significant categorical feature interactions, and querying large language models (LLMs) to generate data-driven insights that explain these interactions. Our approach begins with a binarization step for categorical features using one-hot encoding, followed by the computation of graph covariance at each time. This graph covariance quantifies temporal changes in dependence structures within categorical data and is established as a consistent dependence measure under the Bernoulli distribution. We use this measure to identify significant feature pairs, such as those with the most frequent trends over time or those exhibiting sudden spikes in dependence at specific moments. These extracted feature pairs, along with their timestamps, are subsequently passed to an LLM tasked with generating potential explanations of the underlying events driving these dependence changes. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated through extensive simulations, and its application to the CTDC dataset reveals meaningful feature pairs and potential data stories underlying the observed feature interactions.</description>

      <title>Temporal Binding Foundation Model for Material Property Recognition via Tactile Sequence Perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robots engaged in complex manipulation tasks require robust material property recognition to ensure adaptability and precision. Traditionally, visual data has been the primary source for object perception; however, it often proves insufficient in scenarios where visibility is obstructed or detailed observation is needed. This gap highlights the necessity of tactile sensing as a complementary or primary input for material recognition. Tactile data becomes particularly essential in contact-rich, small-scale manipulations where subtle deformations and surface interactions cannot be accurately captured by vision alone. This letter presents a novel approach leveraging a temporal binding foundation model for tactile sequence understanding to enhance material property recognition. By processing tactile sensor data with a temporal focus, the proposed system captures the sequential nature of tactile interactions, similar to human fingertip perception. Additionally, this letter demonstrates that, through tailored and specific design, the foundation model can more effectively capture temporal information embedded in tactile sequences, advancing material property understanding. Experimental results validate the model's capability to capture these temporal patterns, confirming its utility for material property recognition in visually restricted scenarios. This work underscores the necessity of embedding advanced tactile data processing frameworks within robotic systems to achieve truly embodied and responsive manipulation capabilities.</description>

      <title>Context-Aware Neural Gradient Mapping for Fine-Grained Instruction Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of contextual embeddings into the optimization processes of large language models is an advancement in natural language processing. The Context-Aware Neural Gradient Mapping framework introduces a dynamic gradient adjustment mechanism, incorporating contextual embeddings directly into the optimization process. This approach facilitates real-time parameter adjustments, enhancing task-specific generalization even in the presence of sparse or noisy data inputs. The mathematical foundation of this framework relies on gradient descent modifications, where contextual embeddings are derived from a supplementary neural network trained to map input features to optimal adaptation gradients. By employing differential geometry principles, high-dimensional input dependencies are encoded into low-dimensional gradient manifolds, enabling efficient adaptation without necessitating the retraining of the entire model. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently outperforms baseline models across various metrics, including accuracy, robustness to noise, and computational efficiency. The integration of context-specific embeddings allows for a more complex understanding of language, thereby improving the model's ability to handle diverse linguistic phenomena. Furthermore, the computational efficiency achieved through this method demonstrates its scalability for large-scale language models operating under diverse constraints.</description>

      <title>CASE-Bench: Context-Aware Safety Evaluation Benchmark for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values is essential for their safe deployment and widespread adoption. Current LLM safety benchmarks often focus solely on the refusal of individual problematic queries, which overlooks the importance of the context where the query occurs and may cause undesired refusal of queries under safe contexts that diminish user experience. Addressing this gap, we introduce CASE-Bench, a Context-Aware Safety Evaluation Benchmark that integrates context into safety assessments of LLMs. CASE-Bench assigns distinct, formally described contexts to categorized queries based on Contextual Integrity theory. Additionally, in contrast to previous studies which mainly rely on majority voting from just a few annotators, we recruited a sufficient number of annotators necessary to ensure the detection of statistically significant differences among the experimental conditions based on power analysis. Our extensive analysis using CASE-Bench on various open-source and commercial LLMs reveals a substantial and significant influence of context on human judgments (p&lt;0.0001 from a z-test), underscoring the necessity of context in safety evaluations. We also identify notable mismatches between human judgments and LLM responses, particularly in commercial models within safe contexts.</description>

Abstract: The drive for efficiency and safety in construction has boosted the role of robotics and automation. However, complex tasks like welding and pipe insertion pose challenges due to their need for precise adaptive force control, which complicates robotic training. This paper proposes a two-phase system to improve robot learning, integrating human-derived force feedback. The first phase captures real-time data from operators using a robot arm linked with a virtual simulator via ROS-Sharp. In the second phase, this feedback is converted into robotic motion instructions, using a generative approach to incorporate force feedback into the learning process. This method's effectiveness is demonstrated through improved task completion times and success rates. The framework simulates realistic force-based interactions, enhancing the training data's quality for precise robotic manipulation in construction tasks.</description>

      <title>ExPerT: Effective and Explainable Evaluation of Personalized Long-Form Text Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Evaluating personalized text generated by large language models (LLMs) is challenging, as only the LLM user, i.e., prompt author, can reliably assess the output, but re-engaging the same individuals across studies is infeasible. This paper addresses the challenge of evaluating personalized text generation by introducing ExPerT, an explainable reference-based evaluation framework. ExPerT leverages an LLM to extract atomic aspects and their evidence from the generated and reference texts, match the aspects, and evaluate their alignment based on content and writing style -- two key attributes in personalized text generation. Additionally, ExPerT generates detailed, fine-grained explanations for every step of the evaluation process, enhancing transparency and interpretability. Our experiments demonstrate that ExPerT achieves a 7.2% relative improvement in alignment with human judgments compared to the state-of-the-art text generation evaluation methods. Furthermore, human evaluators rated the usability of ExPerT's explanations at 4.7 out of 5, highlighting its effectiveness in making evaluation decisions more interpretable.</description>

      <title>The Curious Case of Arbitrariness in Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Algorithmic modelling relies on limited information in data to extrapolate outcomes for unseen scenarios, often embedding an element of arbitrariness in its decisions. A perspective on this arbitrariness that has recently gained interest is multiplicity-the study of arbitrariness across a set of "good models", i.e., those likely to be deployed in practice. In this work, we systemize the literature on multiplicity by: (a) formalizing the terminology around model design choices and their contribution to arbitrariness, (b) expanding the definition of multiplicity to incorporate underrepresented forms beyond just predictions and explanations, (c) clarifying the distinction between multiplicity and other traditional lenses of arbitrariness, i.e., uncertainty and variance, and (d) distilling the benefits and potential risks of multiplicity into overarching trends, situating it within the broader landscape of responsible AI. We conclude by identifying open research questions and highlighting emerging trends in this young but rapidly growing area of research.</description>

      <title>LLM4DistReconfig: A Fine-tuned Large Language Model for Power Distribution Network Reconfiguration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Power distribution networks are evolving due to the integration of DERs and increased customer participation. To maintain optimal operation, minimize losses, and meet varying load demands, frequent network reconfiguration is necessary. Traditionally, the reconfiguration task relies on optimization software and expert operators, but as systems grow more complex, faster and more adaptive solutions are required without expert intervention. Data-driven reconfiguration is gaining traction for its accuracy, speed, and robustness against incomplete network data. LLMs, with their ability to capture complex patterns, offer a promising approach for efficient and responsive network reconfiguration in evolving complex power networks.
  In this work, we introduce LLM4DistReconfig, a deep learning-based approach utilizing a fine-tuned LLM to solve the distribution network reconfiguration problem. By carefully crafting prompts and designing a custom loss function, we train the LLM with inputs representing network parameters such as buses, available lines, open lines, node voltages, and system loss. The model then predicts optimal reconfigurations by outputting updated network configurations that minimize system loss while meeting operational constraints. Our approach significantly reduces inference time compared to classical algorithms, allowing for near real-time optimal reconfiguration after training. Experimental results show that our method generates optimal configurations minimizing system loss for five individual and a combined test dataset. It also produces minimal invalid edges, no cycles, or subgraphs across all datasets, fulfilling domain-specific needs. Additionally, the generated responses contain less than 5% improper outputs on seen networks and satisfactory results on unseen networks, demonstrating its effectiveness and reliability for the reconfiguration task.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wireless positioning technologies hold significant value for applications in autonomous driving, extended reality (XR), unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and more. With the advancement of artificial intelligence (AI), leveraging AI to enhance positioning accuracy and robustness has emerged as a field full of potential. Driven by the requirements and functionalities defined in the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) standards, AI/machine learning (ML)-based positioning is becoming a key technology to overcome the limitations of traditional methods. This paper begins with an introduction to the fundamentals of AI and wireless positioning, covering AI models, algorithms, positioning applications, emerging wireless technologies, and the basics of positioning techniques. Subsequently, focusing on standardization progress, we provide a comprehensive review of the evolution of 3GPP positioning standards, with an emphasis on the integration of AI/ML technologies in recent and upcoming releases. Based on the AI/ML-assisted positioning and direct AI/ML positioning schemes outlined in the standards, we conduct an in-depth investigation of related research. we focus on state-of-the-art (SOTA) research in AI-based line-of-sight (LOS)/non-line-of-sight (NLOS) detection, time of arrival (TOA)/time difference of arrival (TDOA) estimation, and angle estimation techniques. For Direct AI/ML Positioning, we explore SOTA advancements in fingerprint-based positioning, knowledge-assisted AI positioning, and channel charting-based positioning. Furthermore, we introduce publicly available datasets for wireless positioning and conclude by summarizing the challenges and opportunities of AI-driven wireless positioning.</description>

      <title>A Deep State Space Model for Rainfall-Runoff Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The classical way of studying the rainfall-runoff processes in the water cycle relies on conceptual or physically-based hydrologic models. Deep learning (DL) has recently emerged as an alternative and blossomed in hydrology community for rainfall-runoff simulations. However, the decades-old Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network remains the benchmark for this task, outperforming newer architectures like Transformers. In this work, we propose a State Space Model (SSM), specifically the Frequency Tuned Diagonal State Space Sequence (S4D-FT) model, for rainfall-runoff simulations. The proposed S4D-FT is benchmarked against the established LSTM and a physically-based Sacramento Soil Moisture Accounting model across 531 watersheds in the contiguous United States (CONUS). Results show that S4D-FT is able to outperform the LSTM model across diverse regions. Our pioneering introduction of the S4D-FT for rainfall-runoff simulations challenges the dominance of LSTM in the hydrology community and expands the arsenal of DL tools available for hydrological modeling.</description>

      <title>Robust Cross-Etiology and Speaker-Independent Dysarthric Speech Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a speaker-independent dysarthric speech recognition system, with a focus on evaluating the recently released Speech Accessibility Project (SAP-1005) dataset, which includes speech data from individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD). Despite the growing body of research in dysarthric speech recognition, many existing systems are speaker-dependent and adaptive, limiting their generalizability across different speakers and etiologies. Our primary objective is to develop a robust speaker-independent model capable of accurately recognizing dysarthric speech, irrespective of the speaker. Additionally, as a secondary objective, we aim to test the cross-etiology performance of our model by evaluating it on the TORGO dataset, which contains speech samples from individuals with cerebral palsy (CP) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). By leveraging the Whisper model, our speaker-independent system achieved a CER of 6.99% and a WER of 10.71% on the SAP-1005 dataset. Further, in cross-etiology settings, we achieved a CER of 25.08% and a WER of 39.56% on the TORGO dataset. These results highlight the potential of our approach to generalize across unseen speakers and different etiologies of dysarthria.</description>

      <title>On Accelerating Edge AI: Optimizing Resource-Constrained Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Resource-constrained edge deployments demand AI solutions that balance high performance with stringent compute, memory, and energy limitations. In this survey, we present a comprehensive overview of the primary strategies for accelerating deep learning models under such constraints. First, we examine model compression techniques-pruning, quantization, tensor decomposition, and knowledge distillation-that streamline large models into smaller, faster, and more efficient variants. Next, we explore Neural Architecture Search (NAS), a class of automated methods that discover architectures inherently optimized for particular tasks and hardware budgets. We then discuss compiler and deployment frameworks, such as TVM, TensorRT, and OpenVINO, which provide hardware-tailored optimizations at inference time. By integrating these three pillars into unified pipelines, practitioners can achieve multi-objective goals, including latency reduction, memory savings, and energy efficiency-all while maintaining competitive accuracy. We also highlight emerging frontiers in hierarchical NAS, neurosymbolic approaches, and advanced distillation tailored to large language models, underscoring open challenges like pre-training pruning for massive networks. Our survey offers practical insights, identifies current research gaps, and outlines promising directions for building scalable, platform-independent frameworks to accelerate deep learning models at the edge.</description>

      <title>Using Large Language Models for education managements in Vietnamese with low resources</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4, Gemini 1.5, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Llama3, have demonstrated significant advancements in various NLP tasks since the release of ChatGPT in 2022. Despite their success, fine-tuning and deploying LLMs remain computationally expensive, especially in resource-constrained environments. In this paper, we proposed VietEduFrame, a framework specifically designed to apply LLMs to educational management tasks in Vietnamese institutions. Our key contribution includes the development of a tailored dataset, derived from student education documents at Hanoi VNU, which addresses the unique challenges faced by educational systems with limited resources. Through extensive experiments, we show that our approach outperforms existing methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency, offering a promising solution for improving educational management in under-resourced environments. While our framework leverages synthetic data to supplement real-world examples, we discuss potential limitations regarding broader applicability and robustness in future implementations.</description>

      <title>OptiSeq: Optimizing Example Ordering for In-Context Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Developers using LLMs in their applications and agents have provided plenty of anecdotal evidence that in-context-learning (ICL) is fragile. In addition to the quantity and quality of examples, we show that the order in which the in-context examples are listed in the prompt affects the output of the LLM and, consequently, their performance. In this paper, we present OptiSeq, which introduces a score based on log probabilities of LLM outputs to prune the universe of possible example orderings in few-shot ICL and recommend the best order(s) by distinguishing between correct and incorrect outputs resulting from different order permutations. Through a detailed empirical evaluation on multiple LLMs, datasets and prompts, we demonstrate that OptiSeq improves accuracy by 6 - 10.5 percentage points across multiple tasks.</description>

      <title>Divergence-Augmented Policy Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In deep reinforcement learning, policy optimization methods need to deal with issues such as function approximation and the reuse of off-policy data. Standard policy gradient methods do not handle off-policy data well, leading to premature convergence and instability. This paper introduces a method to stabilize policy optimization when off-policy data are reused. The idea is to include a Bregman divergence between the behavior policy that generates the data and the current policy to ensure small and safe policy updates with off-policy data. The Bregman divergence is calculated between the state distributions of two policies, instead of only on the action probabilities, leading to a divergence augmentation formulation. Empirical experiments on Atari games show that in the data-scarce scenario where the reuse of off-policy data becomes necessary, our method can achieve better performance than other state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning algorithms.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Client Selection in Federated Learning: A Network Anomaly Detection Use Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has become a widely used approach for training machine learning models on decentralized data, addressing the significant privacy concerns associated with traditional centralized methods. However, the efficiency of FL relies on effective client selection and robust privacy preservation mechanisms. Ineffective client selection can result in suboptimal model performance, while inadequate privacy measures risk exposing sensitive data.
  This paper introduces a client selection framework for FL that incorporates differential privacy and fault tolerance. The proposed adaptive approach dynamically adjusts the number of selected clients based on model performance and system constraints, ensuring privacy through the addition of calibrated noise.
  The method is evaluated on a network anomaly detection use case using the UNSW-NB15 and ROAD datasets. Results demonstrate up to a 7% improvement in accuracy and a 25% reduction in training time compared to the FedL2P approach. Additionally, the study highlights trade-offs between privacy budgets and model performance, with higher privacy budgets leading to reduced noise and improved accuracy. While the fault tolerance mechanism introduces a slight performance decrease, it enhances robustness against client failures. Statistical validation using the Mann-Whitney U test confirms the significance of these improvements, with results achieving a p-value of less than 0.05.</description>

      <title>Towards Robust Unsupervised Attention Prediction in Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robustly predicting attention regions of interest for self-driving systems is crucial for driving safety but presents significant challenges due to the labor-intensive nature of obtaining large-scale attention labels and the domain gap between self-driving scenarios and natural scenes. These challenges are further exacerbated by complex traffic environments, including camera corruption under adverse weather, noise interferences, and central bias from long-tail distributions. To address these issues, we propose a robust unsupervised attention prediction method. An Uncertainty Mining Branch refines predictions by analyzing commonalities and differences across multiple pre-trained models on natural scenes, while a Knowledge Embedding Block bridges the domain gap by incorporating driving knowledge to adaptively enhance pseudo-labels. Additionally, we introduce RoboMixup, a novel data augmentation method that improves robustness against corruption through soft attention and dynamic augmentation, and mitigates central bias by integrating random cropping into Mixup as a regularizer.To systematically evaluate robustness in self-driving attention prediction, we introduce the DriverAttention-C benchmark, comprising over 100k frames across three subsets: BDD-A-C, DR(eye)VE-C, and DADA-2000-C. Our method achieves performance equivalent to or surpassing fully supervised state-of-the-art approaches on three public datasets and the proposed robustness benchmark, reducing relative corruption degradation by 58.8% and 52.8%, and improving central bias robustness by 12.4% and 11.4% in KLD and CC metrics, respectively.

      <title>Evaluating Hallucination in Large Vision-Language Models based on Context-Aware Object Similarities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite their impressive performance on multi-modal tasks, large vision-language models (LVLMs) tend to suffer from hallucinations. An important type is object hallucination, where LVLMs generate objects that are inconsistent with the images shown to the model. Existing works typically attempt to quantify object hallucinations by detecting and measuring the fraction of hallucinated objects in generated captions. Additionally, more recent work also measures object hallucinations by directly querying the LVLM with binary questions about the presence of likely hallucinated objects based on object statistics like top-k frequent objects and top-k co-occurring objects. In this paper, we present Context-Aware Object Similarities (CAOS), a novel approach for evaluating object hallucination in LVLMs using object statistics as well as the generated captions. CAOS uniquely integrates object statistics with semantic relationships between objects in captions and ground-truth data. Moreover, existing approaches usually only detect and measure hallucinations belonging to a predetermined set of in-domain objects (typically the set of all ground-truth objects for the training dataset) and ignore generated objects that are not part of this set, leading to under-evaluation. To address this, we further employ language model--based object recognition to detect potentially out-of-domain hallucinated objects and use an ensemble of LVLMs for verifying the presence of such objects in the query image. CAOS also examines the sequential dynamics of object generation, shedding light on how the order of object appearance influences hallucinations, and employs word embedding models to analyze the semantic reasons behind hallucinations. CAOS aims to offer a nuanced understanding of the hallucination tendencies of LVLMs by providing a systematic framework to identify and interpret object hallucinations.</description>

Abstract: Video surveillance systems are crucial components for ensuring public safety and management in smart city. As a fundamental task in video surveillance, text-to-image person retrieval aims to retrieve the target person from an image gallery that best matches the given text description. Most existing text-to-image person retrieval methods are trained in a supervised manner that requires sufficient labeled data in the target domain. However, it is common in practice that only unlabeled data is available in the target domain due to the difficulty and cost of data annotation, which limits the generalization of existing methods in practical application scenarios. To address this issue, we propose a novel unsupervised domain adaptation method, termed Graph-Based Cross-Domain Knowledge Distillation (GCKD), to learn the cross-modal feature representation for text-to-image person retrieval in a cross-dataset scenario. The proposed GCKD method consists of two main components. Firstly, a graph-based multi-modal propagation module is designed to bridge the cross-domain correlation among the visual and textual samples. Secondly, a contrastive momentum knowledge distillation module is proposed to learn the cross-modal feature representation using the online knowledge distillation strategy. By jointly optimizing the two modules, the proposed method is able to achieve efficient performance for cross-dataset text-to-image person retrieval. acExtensive experiments on three publicly available text-to-image person retrieval datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed GCKD method, which consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines.</description>

      <title>Exploring the impact of Optimised Hyperparameters on Bi-LSTM-based Contextual Anomaly Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The exponential growth in the usage of Internet of Things in daily life has caused immense increase in the generation of time series data. Smart homes is one such domain where bulk of data is being generated and anomaly detection is one of the many challenges addressed by researchers in recent years. Contextual anomaly is a kind of anomaly that may show deviation from the normal pattern like point or sequence anomalies, but it also requires prior knowledge about the data domain and the actions that caused the deviation. Recent studies based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) have demonstrated strong performance in anomaly detection. This study explores the impact of automatically tuned hyperparamteres on Unsupervised Online Contextual Anomaly Detection (UoCAD) approach by proposing UoCAD with Optimised Hyperparamnters (UoCAD-OH). UoCAD-OH conducts hyperparameter optimisation on Bi-LSTM model in an offline phase and uses the fine-tuned hyperparameters to detect anomalies during the online phase. The experiments involve evaluating the proposed framework on two smart home air quality datasets containing contextual anomalies. The evaluation metrics used are Precision, Recall, and F1 score.</description>

      <title>An Attempt to Unraveling Token Prediction Refinement and Identifying Essential Layers of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This research aims to unravel how large language models (LLMs) iteratively refine token predictions (or, in a general sense, vector predictions). We utilized a logit lens technique to analyze the model's token predictions derived from intermediate representations. Specifically, we focused on how LLMs access and use information from input contexts, and how positioning of relevant information affects the model's token prediction refinement process. Our findings for multi-document question answering task, by varying input context lengths (the number of documents), using GPT-2, revealed that the number of layers between the first layer that the model predicted next tokens correctly and the later layers that the model finalized its correct predictions, as a function of the position of relevant information (i.e., placing the relevant one at the beginning, middle, or end of the input context), has a nearly inverted U shape. We found that the gap between these two layers, on average, diminishes when relevant information is positioned at the beginning or end of the input context, suggesting that the model requires more refinements when processing longer contexts with relevant information situated in the middle, and highlighting which layers are essential for determining the correct output. Our analysis provides insights about how token predictions are distributed across different conditions, and establishes important connections to existing hypotheses and previous findings in AI safety research and development.</description>

      <title>Group Ligands Docking to Protein Pockets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular docking is a key task in computational biology that has attracted increasing interest from the machine learning community. While existing methods have achieved success, they generally treat each protein-ligand pair in isolation. Inspired by the biochemical observation that ligands binding to the same target protein tend to adopt similar poses, we propose \textsc{GroupBind}, a novel molecular docking framework that simultaneously considers multiple ligands docking to a protein. This is achieved by introducing an interaction layer for the group of ligands and a triangle attention module for embedding protein-ligand and group-ligand pairs. By integrating our approach with diffusion-based docking model, we set a new S performance on the PDBBind blind docking benchmark, demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed molecular docking paradigm.</description>

      <title>PolaFormer: Polarity-aware Linear Attention for Vision Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Linear attention has emerged as a promising alternative to softmax-based attention, leveraging kernelized feature maps to reduce complexity from quadratic to linear in sequence length. However, the non-negative constraint on feature maps and the relaxed exponential function used in approximation lead to significant information loss compared to the original query-key dot products, resulting in less discriminative attention maps with higher entropy. To address the missing interactions driven by negative values in query-key pairs, we propose a polarity-aware linear attention mechanism that explicitly models both same-signed and opposite-signed query-key interactions, ensuring comprehensive coverage of relational information. Furthermore, to restore the spiky properties of attention maps, we provide a theoretical analysis proving the existence of a class of element-wise functions (with positive first and second derivatives) that can reduce entropy in the attention distribution. For simplicity, and recognizing the distinct contributions of each dimension, we employ a learnable power function for rescaling, allowing strong and weak attention signals to be effectively separated. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed PolaFormer improves performance on various vision tasks, enhancing both expressiveness and efficiency by up to 4.6%.</description>

      <title>Task Arithmetic in Trust Region: A Training-Free Model Merging Approach to Navigate Knowledge Conflicts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-task model merging offers an efficient solution for integrating knowledge from multiple fine-tuned models, mitigating the significant computational and storage demands associated with multi-task training. As a key technique in this field, Task Arithmetic (TA) defines task vectors by subtracting the pre-trained model ($\theta_{\text{pre}}$) from the fine-tuned task models in parameter space, then adjusting the weight between these task vectors and $\theta_{\text{pre}}$ to balance task-generalized and task-specific knowledge. Despite the promising performance of TA, conflicts can arise among the task vectors, particularly when different tasks require distinct model adaptations. In this paper, we formally define this issue as knowledge conflicts, characterized by the performance degradation of one task after merging with a model fine-tuned for another task. Through in-depth analysis, we show that these conflicts stem primarily from the components of task vectors that align with the gradient of task-specific losses at $\theta_{\text{pre}}$. To address this, we propose Task Arithmetic in Trust Region (TATR), which defines the trust region as dimensions in the model parameter space that cause only small changes (corresponding to the task vector components with gradient orthogonal direction) in the task-specific losses. Restricting parameter merging within this trust region, TATR can effectively alleviate knowledge conflicts. Moreover, TATR serves as both an independent approach and a plug-and-play module compatible with a wide range of TA-based methods. Extensive empirical evaluations on eight distinct datasets robustly demonstrate that TATR improves the multi-task performance of several TA-based model merging methods by an observable margin.</description>

      <title>PatentLMM: Large Multimodal Model for Generating Descriptions for Patent Figures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Writing comprehensive and accurate descriptions of technical drawings in patent documents is crucial to effective knowledge sharing and enabling the replication and protection of intellectual property. However, automation of this task has been largely overlooked by the research community. To this end, we introduce PatentDesc-355K, a novel large-scale dataset containing ~355K patent figures along with their brief and detailed textual descriptions extracted from more than 60K US patent documents. In addition, we propose PatentLMM - a novel multimodal large language model specifically tailored to generate high-quality descriptions of patent figures. Our proposed PatentLMM comprises two key components: (i) PatentMME, a specialized multimodal vision encoder that captures the unique structural elements of patent figures, and (ii) PatentLLaMA, a domain-adapted version of LLaMA fine-tuned on a large collection of patents. Extensive experiments demonstrate that training a vision encoder specifically designed for patent figures significantly boosts the performance, generating coherent descriptions compared to fine-tuning similar-sized off-the-shelf multimodal models. PatentDesc-355K and PatentLMM pave the way for automating the understanding of patent figures, enabling efficient knowledge sharing and faster drafting of patent documents. We make the code and data publicly available.</description>

      <title>Can Large Language Models Be Trusted as Black-Box Evolutionary Optimizers for Combinatorial Problems?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Evolutionary computation excels in complex optimization but demands deep domain knowledge, restricting its accessibility. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a game-changing solution with their extensive knowledge and could democratize the optimization paradigm. Although LLMs possess significant capabilities, they may not be universally effective, particularly since evolutionary optimization encompasses multiple stages. It is therefore imperative to evaluate the suitability of LLMs as evolutionary optimizer (EVO). Thus, we establish a series of rigid standards to thoroughly examine the fidelity of LLM-based EVO output in different stages of evolutionary optimization and then introduce a robust error-correction mechanism to mitigate the output uncertainty. Furthermore, we explore a cost-efficient method that directly operates on entire populations with excellent effectiveness in contrast to individual-level optimization. Through extensive experiments, we rigorously validate the performance of LLMs as operators targeted for combinatorial problems. Our findings provide critical insights and valuable observations, advancing the understanding and application of LLM-based optimization.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Pattern Decryption Methodology for Ransomware Detection Using Probabilistic Cryptographic Footprints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing sophistication of encryption-based ransomware has demanded innovative approaches to detection and mitigation, prompting the development of a hierarchical framework grounded in probabilistic cryptographic analysis. By focusing on the statistical characteristics of encryption patterns, the proposed methodology introduces a layered approach that combines advanced clustering algorithms with machine learning to isolate ransomware-induced anomalies. Through comprehensive testing across diverse ransomware families, the framework demonstrated exceptional accuracy, effectively distinguishing malicious encryption operations from benign activities while maintaining low false positive rates. The system's design integrates dynamic feedback mechanisms, enabling adaptability to varying cryptographic complexities and operational environments. Detailed entropy-based evaluations revealed its sensitivity to subtle deviations in encryption workflows, offering a robust alternative to traditional detection methods reliant on static signatures or heuristics. Computational benchmarks confirmed its scalability and efficiency, achieving consistent performance even under high data loads and complex cryptographic scenarios. The inclusion of real-time clustering and anomaly evaluation ensures rapid response capabilities, addressing critical latency challenges in ransomware detection. Performance comparisons with established methods highlighted its improvements in detection efficacy, particularly against advanced ransomware employing extended key lengths and unique cryptographic protocols.</description>

      <title>CFT-RAG: An Entity Tree Based Retrieval Augmented Generation Algorithm With Cuckoo Filter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although retrieval-augmented generation(RAG) significantly improves generation quality by retrieving external knowledge bases and integrating generated content, it faces computational efficiency bottlenecks, particularly in knowledge retrieval tasks involving hierarchical structures for Tree-RAG. This paper proposes a Tree-RAG acceleration method based on the improved Cuckoo Filter, which optimizes entity localization during the retrieval process to achieve significant performance improvements. Tree-RAG effectively organizes entities through the introduction of a hierarchical tree structure, while the Cuckoo Filter serves as an efficient data structure that supports rapid membership queries and dynamic updates. The experiment results demonstrate that our method is much faster than naive Tree-RAG while maintaining high levels of generative quality. When the number of trees is large, our method is hundreds of times faster than naive Tree-RAG. Our work is available at https://github.com/TUPYP7180/CFT-RAG-2025.</description>

      <title>Each Rank Could be an Expert: Single-Ranked Mixture of Experts LoRA for Multi-Task Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is widely used for adapting large language models (LLMs) to specific domains due to its efficiency and modularity. Meanwhile, vanilla LoRA struggles with task conflicts in multi-task scenarios. Recent works adopt Mixture of Experts (MoE) by treating each LoRA module as an expert, thereby mitigating task interference through multiple specialized LoRA modules. While effective, these methods often isolate knowledge within individual tasks, failing to fully exploit the shared knowledge across related tasks. In this paper, we establish a connection between single LoRA and multi-LoRA MoE, integrating them into a unified framework. We demonstrate that the dynamic routing of multiple LoRAs is functionally equivalent to rank partitioning and block-level activation within a single LoRA. We further empirically demonstrate that finer-grained LoRA partitioning, within the same total and activated parameter constraints, leads to better performance gains across heterogeneous tasks. Building on these findings, we propose Single-ranked Mixture of Experts LoRA (\textbf{SMoRA}), which embeds MoE into LoRA by \textit{treating each rank as an independent expert}. With a \textit{dynamic rank-wise activation} mechanism, SMoRA promotes finer-grained knowledge sharing while mitigating task conflicts. Experiments demonstrate that SMoRA activates fewer parameters yet achieves better performance in multi-task scenarios.</description>

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as a de-facto approach for aligning language models with human preferences. Recent work has shown DPO's effectiveness relies on training data quality. In particular, clear quality differences between preferred and rejected responses enhance learning performance. Current methods for identifying and obtaining such high-quality samples demand additional resources or external models. We discover that reference model probability space naturally detects high-quality training samples. Using this insight, we present a sampling strategy that achieves consistent improvements (+0.1 to +0.4) on MT-Bench while using less than half (30-50%) of the training data. We observe substantial improvements (+0.4 to +0.98) for technical tasks (coding, math, and reasoning) across multiple models and hyperparameter settings.</description>

      <title>Snapshot Compressed Imaging Based Single-Measurement Computer Vision for Videos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Snapshot compressive imaging (SCI) is a promising technique for capturing high-speed video at low bandwidth and low power, typically by compressing multiple frames into a single measurement. However, similar to traditional CMOS image sensor based imaging systems, SCI also faces challenges in low-lighting photon-limited and low-signal-to-noise-ratio image conditions. In this paper, we propose a novel Compressive Denoising Autoencoder (CompDAE) using the STFormer architecture as the backbone, to explicitly model noise characteristics and provide computer vision functionalities such as edge detection and depth estimation directly from compressed sensing measurements, while accounting for realistic low-photon conditions. We evaluate the effectiveness of CompDAE across various datasets and demonstrated significant improvements in task performance compared to conventional RGB-based methods. In the case of ultra-low-lighting (APC $\leq$ 20) while conventional methods failed, the proposed algorithm can still maintain competitive performance.</description>

      <title>Analyzing and Boosting the Power of Fine-Grained Visual Recognition for Multi-modal Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable abilities in various visual understanding tasks. However, MLLMs still struggle with fine-grained visual recognition (FGVR), which aims to identify subordinate-level categories from images. This can negatively impact more advanced capabilities of MLLMs, such as object-centric visual question answering and reasoning. In our study, we revisit three quintessential capabilities of MLLMs for FGVR, including object information extraction, category knowledge reserve, object-category alignment, and position of the root cause as a misalignment problem. To address this issue, we present Finedefics, an MLLM that enhances the model's FGVR capability by incorporating informative attribute descriptions of objects into the training phase. We employ contrastive learning on object-attribute pairs and attribute-category pairs simultaneously and use examples from similar but incorrect categories as hard negatives, naturally bringing representations of visual objects and category names closer. Extensive evaluations across multiple popular FGVR datasets demonstrate that Finedefics outperforms existing MLLMs of comparable parameter sizes, showcasing its remarkable efficacy. The code is available at https://github.com/PKU-ICST-MIPL/Finedefics_ICLR2025.</description>

      <title>DAGPrompT: Pushing the Limits of Graph Prompting with a Distribution-aware Graph Prompt Tuning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The pre-train then fine-tune approach has advanced GNNs by enabling general knowledge capture without task-specific labels. However, an objective gap between pre-training and downstream tasks limits its effectiveness. Recent graph prompting methods aim to close this gap through task reformulations and learnable prompts. Despite this, they struggle with complex graphs like heterophily graphs. Freezing the GNN encoder can reduce the impact of prompting, while simple prompts fail to handle diverse hop-level distributions. This paper identifies two key challenges in adapting graph prompting methods for complex graphs: (1) adapting the model to new distributions in downstream tasks to mitigate pre-training and fine-tuning discrepancies from heterophily and (2) customizing prompts for hop-specific node requirements. To overcome these challenges, we propose Distribution-aware Graph Prompt Tuning (DAGPrompT), which integrates a GLoRA module for optimizing the GNN encoder's projection matrix and message-passing schema through low-rank adaptation. DAGPrompT also incorporates hop-specific prompts accounting for varying graph structures and distributions among hops. Evaluations on 10 datasets and 14 baselines demonstrate that DAGPrompT improves accuracy by up to 4.79 in node and graph classification tasks, setting a new state-of-the-art while preserving efficiency.

      <title>Mapping Galaxy Images Across Ultraviolet, Visible and Infrared Bands Using Generative Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that generative deep learning can translate galaxy observations across ultraviolet, visible, and infrared photometric bands. Leveraging mock observations from the Illustris simulations, we develop and validate a supervised image-to-image model capable of performing both band interpolation and extrapolation. The resulting trained models exhibit high fidelity in generating outputs, as verified by both general image comparison metrics (MAE, SSIM, PSNR) and specialized astronomical metrics (GINI coefficient, M20). Moreover, we show that our model can be used to predict real-world observations, using data from the DECaLS survey as a case study. These findings highlight the potential of generative learning to augment astronomical datasets, enabling efficient exploration of multi-band information in regions where observations are incomplete. This work opens new pathways for optimizing mission planning, guiding high-resolution follow-ups, and enhancing our understanding of galaxy morphology and evolution.</description>

      <title>Option-ID Based Elimination For Multiple Choice Questions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multiple choice questions (MCQs) are a common and important task for evaluating large language models (LLMs). Based on common strategies humans use when answering MCQs, the process of elimination has been proposed as an effective problem-solving method. Existing methods to the process of elimination generally fall into two categories: one involves having the model directly select the incorrect answer, while the other involves scoring the options. However, both methods incur high computational costs and often perform worse than methods that answer based on option ID. To address this issue, this paper proposes a process of elimination based on option ID. We select 10 LLMs and conduct zero-shot experiments on 7 different datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves the model's performance. Further analysis reveals that the sequential elimination strategy can effectively enhance the model's reasoning ability. Additionally, we find that sequential elimination is also applicable to few-shot settings and can be combined with debias methods to further improve model performance.</description>

      <title>Towards Conscious Service Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning's success in perception, natural language processing, etc. inspires hopes for advancements in autonomous robotics. However, real-world robotics face challenges like variability, high-dimensional state spaces, non-linear dependencies, and partial observability. A key issue is non-stationarity of robots, environments, and tasks, leading to performance drops with out-of-distribution data. Unlike current machine learning models, humans adapt quickly to changes and new tasks due to a cognitive architecture that enables systematic generalization and meta-cognition. Human brain's System 1 handles routine tasks unconsciously, while System 2 manages complex tasks consciously, facilitating flexible problem-solving and self-monitoring. For robots to achieve human-like learning and reasoning, they need to integrate causal models, working memory, planning, and metacognitive processing. By incorporating human cognition insights, the next generation of service robots will handle novel situations and monitor themselves to avoid risks and mitigate errors.</description>

      <title>Efficient and Interpretable Neural Networks Using Complex Lehmer Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an efficient and interpretable neural network with a novel activation function called the weighted Lehmer transform. This new activation function enables adaptive feature selection and extends to the complex domain, capturing phase-sensitive and hierarchical relationships within data. Notably, it provides greater interpretability and transparency compared to existing machine learning models, facilitating a deeper understanding of its functionality and decision-making processes. We analyze the mathematical properties of both real-valued and complex-valued Lehmer activation units and demonstrate their applications in modeling nonlinear interactions. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our proposed neural network achieves competitive accuracy on benchmark datasets with significantly improved computational efficiency. A single layer of real-valued or complex-valued Lehmer activation units is shown to deliver state-of-the-art performance, balancing efficiency with interpretability.</description>

      <title>SEAL: Scaling to Emphasize Attention for Long-Context Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce a novel approach called Scaling to Emphasize Attention for Long-context retrieval (SEAL), which enhances the retrieval performance of large language models (LLMs) over extended contexts. Previous studies have shown that each attention head in LLMs has a unique functionality and collectively contributes to the overall behavior of the model. Similarly, we observe that specific heads are closely tied to long-context retrieval, showing positive or negative correlation with retrieval scores. Built on this insight, we propose a learning-based mechanism using zero-shot generated data to emphasize these heads, improving the model's performance in long-context retrieval tasks. By applying SEAL, we can achieve significant improvements in in-domain retrieval performance, including document QA tasks from LongBench, and considerable improvements in out-of-domain cases. Additionally, when combined with existing training-free context extension techniques, SEAL extends the context limits of LLMs while maintaining highly reliable outputs, opening new avenues for research in this field.</description>

      <title>Hardware-Aware DNN Compression for Homogeneous Edge Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deploying deep neural networks (DNNs) across homogeneous edge devices (the devices with the same SKU labeled by the manufacturer) often assumes identical performance among them. However, once a device model is widely deployed, the performance of each device becomes different after a period of running. This is caused by the differences in user configurations, environmental conditions, manufacturing variances, battery degradation, etc. Existing DNN compression methods have not taken this scenario into consideration and can not guarantee good compression results in all homogeneous edge devices. To address this, we propose Homogeneous-Device Aware Pruning (HDAP), a hardware-aware DNN compression framework explicitly designed for homogeneous edge devices, aiming to achieve optimal average performance of the compressed model across all devices. To deal with the difficulty of time-consuming hardware-aware evaluations for thousands or millions of homogeneous edge devices, HDAP partitions all the devices into several device clusters, which can dramatically reduce the number of devices to evaluate and use the surrogate-based evaluation instead of hardware evaluation in real-time. Experiments on ResNet50 and MobileNetV1 with the ImageNet dataset show that HDAP consistently achieves lower average inference latency compared with state-of-the-art methods, with substantial speedup gains (e.g., 2.86 $\times$ speedup at 1.0G FLOPs for ResNet50) on the homogeneous device clusters. HDAP offers an effective solution for scalable, high-performance DNN deployment methods for homogeneous edge devices.</description>

      <title>Prompting ChatGPT for Chinese Learning as L2: A CEFR and EBCL Level Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The use of chatbots in language learning has evolved significantly since the 1960s, becoming more sophisticated platforms as generative AI emerged. These tools now simulate natural conversations, adapting to individual learners' needs, including those studying Chinese. Our study explores how learners can use specific prompts to engage Large Language Models (LLM) as personalized chatbots, aiming to target their language level based on the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) and the European Benchmarking Chinese Language (EBCL) project. Focusing on A1, A1+ and A2 levels, we examine the teaching of Chinese, which presents unique challenges due to its logographic writing system. Our goal is to develop prompts that integrate oral and written skills, using high-frequency character lists and controlling oral lexical productions. These tools, powered by generative AI, aim to enhance language practice by crossing lexical and sinographic recurrence. While generative AI shows potential as a personalized tutor, further evaluation is needed to assess its effectiveness. We conducted a systematic series of experiments using ChatGPT models to evaluate their adherence to constraints specified in the prompts. The results indicate that incorporating level A1 and A1+ characters, along with the associated reference list, significantly enhances compliance with the EBCL character set. Properly prompted, LLMs can increase exposure to the target language and offer interactive exchanges to develop language skills.</description>

      <title>Lightweight and Post-Training Structured Pruning for On-Device Large Lanaguage Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Considering the hardware-friendly characteristics and broad applicability, structured pruning has emerged as an efficient solution to reduce the resource demands of large language models (LLMs) on resource-constrained devices. Traditional structured pruning methods often need fine-tuning to recover performance loss, which incurs high memory overhead and substantial data requirements, rendering them unsuitable for on-device applications. Additionally, post-training structured pruning techniques typically necessitate specific activation functions or architectural modifications, thereby limiting their scope of applications. Herein, we introduce COMP, a lightweight post-training structured pruning method that employs a hybrid-granularity pruning strategy. COMP initially prunes selected model layers based on their importance at a coarse granularity, followed by fine-grained neuron pruning within the dense layers of each remaining model layer. To more accurately evaluate neuron importance, COMP introduces a new matrix condition-based metric. Subsequently, COMP utilizes mask tuning to recover accuracy without the need for fine-tuning, significantly reducing memory consumption. Experimental results demonstrate that COMP improves performance by 6.13\% on the LLaMA-2-7B model with a 20\% pruning ratio compared to LLM-Pruner, while simultaneously reducing memory overhead by 80\%.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Collaborative Co-Creation Process with AI: A Case Study in Novice Music Production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence is reshaping creative domains, yet its co-creative processes, especially in group settings with novice users, remain under explored. To bridge this gap, we conducted a case study in a college-level course where nine undergraduate students were tasked with creating three original music tracks using AI tools over 10 weeks. The study spanned the entire creative journey from ideation to releasing these songs on Spotify. Participants leveraged AI for music and lyric production, cover art, and distribution. Our findings highlight how AI transforms creative workflows: accelerating ideation but compressing the traditional preparation stage, and requiring novices to navigate a challenging idea selection and validation phase. We also identified a new "collaging and refinement" stage, where participants creatively combined diverse AI-generated outputs into cohesive works. Furthermore, AI influenced group social dynamics and role division among human creators. Based on these insights, we propose the Human-AI Co-Creation Stage Model and the Human-AI Agency Model, offering new perspectives on collaborative co-creation with AI.</description>

      <title>Pre-training a Transformer-Based Generative Model Using a Small Sepedi Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to the scarcity of data in low-resourced languages, the development of language models for these languages has been very slow. Currently, pre-trained language models have gained popularity in natural language processing, especially, in developing domain-specific models for low-resourced languages. In this study, we experiment with the impact of using occlusion-based techniques when training a language model for a text generation task. We curate 2 new datasets, the Sepedi monolingual (SepMono) dataset from several South African resources and the Sepedi radio news (SepNews) dataset from the radio news domain. We use the SepMono dataset to pre-train transformer-based models using the occlusion and non-occlusion pre-training techniques and compare performance. The SepNews dataset is specifically used for fine-tuning. Our results show that the non-occlusion models perform better compared to the occlusion-based models when measuring validation loss and perplexity. However, analysis of the generated text using the BLEU score metric, which measures the quality of the generated text, shows a slightly higher BLEU score for the occlusion-based models compared to the non-occlusion models.</description>

      <title>Advanced Real-Time Fraud Detection Using RAG-Based LLMs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence has become a double edged sword in modern society being both a boon and a bane. While it empowers individuals it also enables malicious actors to perpetrate scams such as fraudulent phone calls and user impersonations. This growing threat necessitates a robust system to protect individuals In this paper we introduce a novel real time fraud detection mechanism using Retrieval Augmented Generation technology to address this challenge on two fronts. First our system incorporates a continuously updating policy checking feature that transcribes phone calls in real time and uses RAG based models to verify that the caller is not soliciting private information thus ensuring transparency and the authenticity of the conversation. Second we implement a real time user impersonation check with a two step verification process to confirm the callers identity ensuring accountability. A key innovation of our system is the ability to update policies without retraining the entire model enhancing its adaptability. We validated our RAG based approach using synthetic call recordings achieving an accuracy of 97.98 percent and an F1score of 97.44 percent with 100 calls outperforming state of the art methods. This robust and flexible fraud detection system is well suited for real world deployment.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents an approach that combines Human-In-The-Loop Reinforcement Learning (HITL RL) with principles derived from music theory to facilitate real-time generation of musical compositions. HITL RL, previously employed in diverse applications such as modelling humanoid robot mechanics and enhancing language models, harnesses human feedback to refine the training process. In this study, we develop a HILT RL framework that can leverage the constraints and principles in music theory. In particular, we propose an episodic tabular Q-learning algorithm with an epsilon-greedy exploration policy. The system generates musical tracks (compositions), continuously enhancing its quality through iterative human-in-the-loop feedback. The reward function for this process is the subjective musical taste of the user.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Disaster Resilience with UAV-Assisted Edge Computing: A Reinforcement Learning Approach to Managing Heterogeneous Edge Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Edge sensing and computing is rapidly becoming part of intelligent infrastructure architecture leading to operational reliance on such systems in disaster or emergency situations. In such scenarios there is a high chance of power supply failure due to power grid issues, and communication system issues due to base stations losing power or being damaged by the elements, e.g., flooding, wildfires etc. Mobile edge computing in the form of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has been proposed to provide computation offloading from these devices to conserve their battery, while the use of UAVs as relay network nodes has also been investigated previously. This paper considers the use of UAVs with further constraints on power and connectivity to prolong the life of the network while also ensuring that the data is received from the edge nodes in a timely manner. Reinforcement learning is used to investigate numerous scenarios of various levels of power and communication failure. This approach is able to identify the device most likely to fail in a given scenario, thus providing priority guidance for maintenance personnel. The evacuations of a rural town and urban downtown area are also simulated to demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach at extending the life of the most critical edge devices.</description>

      <title>A Post-Processing-Based Fair Federated Learning Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) allows collaborative model training among distributed parties without pooling local datasets at a central server. However, the distributed nature of FL poses challenges in training fair federated learning models. The existing techniques are often limited in offering fairness flexibility to clients and performance. We formally define and empirically analyze a simple and intuitive post-processing-based framework to improve group fairness in FL systems. This framework can be divided into two stages: a standard FL training stage followed by a completely decentralized local debiasing stage. In the first stage, a global model is trained without fairness constraints using a standard federated learning algorithm (e.g. FedAvg). In the second stage, each client applies fairness post-processing on the global model using their respective local dataset. This allows for customized fairness improvements based on clients' desired and context-guided fairness requirements. We demonstrate two well-established post-processing techniques in this framework: model output post-processing and final layer fine-tuning. We evaluate the framework against three common baselines on four different datasets, including tabular, signal, and image data, each with varying levels of data heterogeneity across clients. Our work shows that this framework not only simplifies fairness implementation in FL but also provides significant fairness improvements with minimal accuracy loss or even accuracy gain, across data modalities and machine learning methods, being especially effective in more heterogeneous settings.</description>

      <title>Scaling laws for decoding images from brain activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative AI has recently propelled the decoding of images from brain activity. How do these approaches scale with the amount and type of neural recordings? Here, we systematically compare image decoding from four types of non-invasive devices: electroencephalography (EEG), magnetoencephalography (MEG), high-field functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (3T fMRI) and ultra-high field (7T) fMRI. For this, we evaluate decoding models on the largest benchmark to date, encompassing 8 public datasets, 84 volunteers, 498 hours of brain recording and 2.3 million brain responses to natural images. Unlike previous work, we focus on single-trial decoding performance to simulate real-time settings. This systematic comparison reveals three main findings. First, the most precise neuroimaging devices tend to yield the best decoding performances, when the size of the training sets are similar. However, the gain enabled by deep learning - in comparison to linear models - is obtained with the noisiest devices. Second, we do not observe any plateau of decoding performance as the amount of training data increases. Rather, decoding performance scales log-linearly with the amount of brain recording. Third, this scaling law primarily depends on the amount of data per subject. However, little decoding gain is observed by increasing the number of subjects. Overall, these findings delineate the path most suitable to scale the decoding of images from non-invasive brain recordings.</description>

      <title>Development and Application of Self-Supervised Machine Learning for Smoke Plume and Active Fire Identification from the FIREX-AQ Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fire Influence on Regional to Global Environments and Air Quality (FIREX-AQ) was a field campaign aimed at better understanding the impact of wildfires and agricultural fires on air quality and climate. The FIREX-AQ campaign took place in August 2019 and involved two aircraft and multiple coordinated satellite observations. This study applied and evaluated a self-supervised machine learning (ML) method for the active fire and smoke plume identification and tracking in the satellite and sub-orbital remote sensing datasets collected during the campaign. Our unique methodology combines remote sensing observations with different spatial and spectral resolutions. The demonstrated approach successfully differentiates fire pixels and smoke plumes from background imagery, enabling the generation of a per-instrument smoke and fire mask product, as well as smoke and fire masks created from the fusion of selected data from independent instruments. This ML approach has a potential to enhance operational wildfire monitoring systems and improve decision-making in air quality management through fast smoke plume identification12 and tracking and could improve climate impact studies through fusion data from independent instruments.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models as Theory of Mind Aware Generative Agents with Counterfactual Reflection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have increasingly demonstrated that large language models (LLMs) possess significant theory of mind (ToM) capabilities, showing the potential for simulating the tracking of mental states in generative agents. In this study, we propose a novel paradigm called ToM-agent, designed to empower LLMs-based generative agents to simulate ToM in open-domain conversational interactions. ToM-agent disentangles the confidence from mental states, facilitating the emulation of an agent's perception of its counterpart's mental states, such as beliefs, desires, and intentions (BDIs). Using past conversation history and verbal reflections, ToM-Agent can dynamically adjust counterparts' inferred BDIs, along with related confidence levels. We further put forth a counterfactual intervention method that reflects on the gap between the predicted responses of counterparts and their real utterances, thereby enhancing the efficiency of reflection. Leveraging empathetic and persuasion dialogue datasets, we assess the advantages of implementing the ToM-agent with downstream tasks, as well as its performance in both the first-order and the \textit{second-order} ToM. Our findings indicate that the ToM-agent can grasp the underlying reasons for their counterpart's behaviors beyond mere semantic-emotional supporting or decision-making based on common sense, providing new insights for studying large-scale LLMs-based simulation of human social behaviors.</description>

      <title>iFormer: Integrating ConvNet and Transformer for Mobile Application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new family of mobile hybrid vision networks, called iFormer, with a focus on optimizing latency and accuracy on mobile applications. iFormer effectively integrates the fast local representation capacity of convolution with the efficient global modeling ability of self-attention. The local interactions are derived from transforming a standard convolutional network, \textit{i.e.}, ConvNeXt, to design a more lightweight mobile network. Our newly introduced mobile modulation attention removes memory-intensive operations in MHA and employs an efficient modulation mechanism to boost dynamic global representational capacity. We conduct comprehensive experiments demonstrating that iFormer outperforms existing lightweight networks across various tasks. Notably, iFormer achieves an impressive Top-1 accuracy of 80.4\% on ImageNet-1k with a latency of only 1.10 ms on an iPhone 13, surpassing the recently proposed MobileNetV4 under similar latency constraints. Additionally, our method shows significant improvements in downstream tasks, including COCO object detection, instance segmentation, and ADE20k semantic segmentation, while still maintaining low latency on mobile devices for high-resolution inputs in these scenarios.</description>

      <title>Scaling Large Vision-Language Models for Enhanced Multimodal Comprehension In Biomedical Image Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated immense capabilities in understanding textual data and are increasingly being adopted to help researchers accelerate scientific discovery through knowledge extraction (information retrieval), knowledge distillation (summarizing key findings and methodologies into concise forms), and knowledge synthesis (aggregating information from multiple scientific sources to address complex queries, generate hypothesis and formulate experimental plans). However, scientific data often exists in both visual and textual modalities. Vision language models (VLMs) address this by incorporating a pretrained vision backbone for processing images and a cross-modal projector that adapts image tokens into the LLM dimensional space, thereby providing richer multimodal comprehension. Nevertheless, off-the-shelf VLMs show limited capabilities in handling domain-specific data and are prone to hallucinations. We developed intelligent assistants finetuned from LLaVA models to enhance multimodal understanding in low-dose radiation therapy (LDRT)-a benign approach used in the treatment of cancer-related illnesses. Using multilingual data from 42,673 articles, we devise complex reasoning and detailed description tasks for visual question answering (VQA) benchmarks. Our assistants, trained on 50,882 image-text pairs, demonstrate superior performance over base models as evaluated using LLM-as-a-judge approach, particularly in reducing hallucination and improving domain-specific comprehension.</description>

      <title>Learning-Enhanced Safeguard Control for High-Relative-Degree Systems: Robust Optimization under Disturbances and Faults</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Merely pursuing performance may adversely affect the safety, while a conservative policy for safe exploration will degrade the performance. How to balance the safety and performance in learning-based control problems is an interesting yet challenging issue. This paper aims to enhance system performance with safety guarantee in solving the reinforcement learning (RL)-based optimal control problems of nonlinear systems subject to high-relative-degree state constraints and unknown time-varying disturbance/actuator faults. First, to combine control barrier functions (CBFs) with RL, a new type of CBFs, termed high-order reciprocal control barrier function (HO-RCBF) is proposed to deal with high-relative-degree constraints during the learning process. Then, the concept of gradient similarity is proposed to quantify the relationship between the gradient of safety and the gradient of performance. Finally, gradient manipulation and adaptive mechanisms are introduced in the safe RL framework to enhance the performance with a safety guarantee. Two simulation examples illustrate that the proposed safe RL framework can address high-relative-degree constraint, enhance safety robustness and improve system performance.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the Effectiveness of XAI Techniques for Encoder-Based Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The black-box nature of large language models (LLMs) necessitates the development of eXplainable AI (XAI) techniques for transparency and trustworthiness. However, evaluating these techniques remains a challenge. This study presents a general evaluation framework using four key metrics: Human-reasoning Agreement (HA), Robustness, Consistency, and Contrastivity. We assess the effectiveness of six explainability techniques from five different XAI categories model simplification (LIME), perturbation-based methods (SHAP), gradient-based approaches (InputXGradient, Grad-CAM), Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP), and attention mechanisms-based explainability methods (Attention Mechanism Visualization, AMV) across five encoder-based language models: TinyBERT, BERTbase, BERTlarge, XLM-R large, and DeBERTa-xlarge, using the IMDB Movie Reviews and Tweet Sentiment Extraction (TSE) datasets. Our findings show that the model simplification-based XAI method (LIME) consistently outperforms across multiple metrics and models, significantly excelling in HA with a score of 0.9685 on DeBERTa-xlarge, robustness, and consistency as the complexity of large language models increases. AMV demonstrates the best Robustness, with scores as low as 0.0020. It also excels in Consistency, achieving near-perfect scores of 0.9999 across all models. Regarding Contrastivity, LRP performs the best, particularly on more complex models, with scores up to 0.9371.</description>

      <title>Zero-Shot Interactive Text-to-Image Retrieval via Diffusion-Augmented Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interactive Text-to-Image Retrieval (I-TIR) has emerged as a transformative user-interactive tool for applications in domains such as e-commerce and education. Yet, current methodologies predominantly depend on finetuned Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), which face two critical limitations: (1) Finetuning imposes prohibitive computational overhead and long-term maintenance costs. (2) Finetuning narrows the pretrained knowledge distribution of MLLMs, reducing their adaptability to novel scenarios. These issues are exacerbated by the inherently dynamic nature of real-world I-TIR systems, where queries and image databases evolve in complexity and diversity, often deviating from static training distributions. To overcome these constraints, we propose Diffusion Augmented Retrieval (DAR), a paradigm-shifting framework that bypasses MLLM finetuning entirely. DAR synergizes Large Language Model (LLM)-guided query refinement with Diffusion Model (DM)-based visual synthesis to create contextually enriched intermediate representations. This dual-modality approach deciphers nuanced user intent more holistically, enabling precise alignment between textual queries and visually relevant images. Rigorous evaluations across four benchmarks reveal DAR's dual strengths: (1) Matches state-of-the-art finetuned I-TIR models on straightforward queries without task-specific training. (2) Scalable Generalization: Surpasses finetuned baselines by 7.61% in Hits@10 (top-10 accuracy) under multi-turn conversational complexity, demonstrating robustness to intricate, distributionally shifted interactions. By eliminating finetuning dependencies and leveraging generative-augmented representations, DAR establishes a new trajectory for efficient, adaptive, and scalable cross-modal retrieval systems.</description>

      <title>MetaOcc: Surround-View 4D Radar and Camera Fusion Framework for 3D Occupancy Prediction with Dual Training Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 3D occupancy prediction is crucial for autonomous driving perception. Fusion of 4D radar and camera provides a potential solution of robust occupancy prediction on serve weather with least cost. How to achieve effective multi-modal feature fusion and reduce annotation costs remains significant challenges. In this work, we propose MetaOcc, a novel multi-modal occupancy prediction framework that fuses surround-view cameras and 4D radar for comprehensive environmental perception. We first design a height self-attention module for effective 3D feature extraction from sparse radar points. Then, a local-global fusion mechanism is proposed to adaptively capture modality contributions while handling spatio-temporal misalignments. Temporal alignment and fusion module is employed to further aggregate historical feature. Furthermore, we develop a semi-supervised training procedure leveraging open-set segmentor and geometric constraints for pseudo-label generation, enabling robust perception with limited annotations. Extensive experiments on OmniHD-Scenes dataset demonstrate that MetaOcc achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing previous methods by significant margins. Notably, as the first semi-supervised 4D radar and camera fusion-based occupancy prediction approach, MetaOcc maintains 92.5% of the fully-supervised performance while using only 50% of ground truth annotations, establishing a new benchmark for multi-modal 3D occupancy prediction. Code and data are available at https://github.com/LucasYang567/MetaOcc.</description>

      <title>Semantic Layered Embedding Diffusion in Large Language Models for Multi-Contextual Consistency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Semantic Layered Embedding Diffusion (SLED) mechanism redefines the representation of hierarchical semantics within transformer-based architectures, enabling enhanced contextual consistency across a wide array of linguistic tasks. By introducing a multi-layered diffusion process grounded in spectral analysis, it achieves a complex balance between global and local semantic coherence. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in perplexity and BLEU scores, emphasizing the mechanism's ability to adapt effectively across diverse domains, including multilingual and cross-domain text generation. A rigorous mathematical framework underpins the embedding diffusion process, incorporating weighted adjacency matrices, kernel-based refinements, and dynamic layer-wise normalization. Error distribution analysis reveals that SLED addresses challenges in semantic alignment and coherence, outperforming baseline approaches across varied benchmarks. Scalability studies illustrate that its performance gains are maintained consistently across different model sizes, reflecting a practical balance between computational efficiency and linguistic precision. The implementation also achieves energy efficiency, reducing resource consumption during training and inference phases without compromising accuracy. Qualitative case studies further validate its adaptability to extended narratives and context-intensive scenarios, highlighting the mechanism's potential for real-world applications. SLED offers a different perspective on embedding design and its implications for advancing language modeling.</description>

      <title>Turn That Frown Upside Down: FaceID Customization via Cross-Training Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing face identity (FaceID) customization methods perform well but are limited to generating identical faces as the input, while in real-world applications, users often desire images of the same person but with variations, such as different expressions (e.g., smiling, angry) or angles (e.g., side profile). This limitation arises from the lack of datasets with controlled input-output facial variations, restricting models' ability to learn effective modifications.
  To address this issue, we propose CrossFaceID, the first large-scale, high-quality, and publicly available dataset specifically designed to improve the facial modification capabilities of FaceID customization models. Specifically, CrossFaceID consists of 40,000 text-image pairs from approximately 2,000 persons, with each person represented by around 20 images showcasing diverse facial attributes such as poses, expressions, angles, and adornments. During the training stage, a specific face of a person is used as input, and the FaceID customization model is forced to generate another image of the same person but with altered facial features. This allows the FaceID customization model to acquire the ability to personalize and modify known facial features during the inference stage. Experiments show that models fine-tuned on the CrossFaceID dataset retain its performance in preserving FaceID fidelity while significantly improving its face customization capabilities.
  To facilitate further advancements in the FaceID customization field, our code, constructed datasets, and trained models are fully available to the public.</description>

      <title>TdAttenMix: Top-Down Attention Guided Mixup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: CutMix is a data augmentation strategy that cuts and pastes image patches to mixup training data. Existing methods pick either random or salient areas which are often inconsistent to labels, thus misguiding the training model. By our knowledge, we integrate human gaze to guide cutmix for the first time. Since human attention is driven by both high-level recognition and low-level clues, we propose a controllable Top-down Attention Guided Module to obtain a general artificial attention which balances top-down and bottom-up attention. The proposed TdATttenMix then picks the patches and adjust the label mixing ratio that focuses on regions relevant to the current label. Experimental results demonstrate that our TdAttenMix outperforms existing state-of-the-art mixup methods across eight different benchmarks. Additionally, we introduce a new metric based on the human gaze and use this metric to investigate the issue of image-label inconsistency.

      <title>AnyEnhance: A Unified Generative Model with Prompt-Guidance and Self-Critic for Voice Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce AnyEnhance, a unified generative model for voice enhancement that processes both speech and singing voices. Based on a masked generative model, AnyEnhance is capable of handling both speech and singing voices, supporting a wide range of enhancement tasks including denoising, dereverberation, declipping, super-resolution, and target speaker extraction, all simultaneously and without fine-tuning. AnyEnhance introduces a prompt-guidance mechanism for in-context learning, which allows the model to natively accept a reference speaker's timbre. In this way, it could boost enhancement performance when a reference audio is available and enable the target speaker extraction task without altering the underlying architecture. Moreover, we also introduce a self-critic mechanism into the generative process for masked generative models, yielding higher-quality outputs through iterative self-assessment and refinement. Extensive experiments on various enhancement tasks demonstrate AnyEnhance outperforms existing methods in terms of both objective metrics and subjective listening tests. Demo audios are publicly available at https://amphionspace.github.io/anyenhance/.</description>

      <title>Episodic Novelty Through Temporal Distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15418v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exploration in sparse reward environments remains a significant challenge in reinforcement learning, particularly in Contextual Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs), where environments differ across episodes. Existing episodic intrinsic motivation methods for CMDPs primarily rely on count-based approaches, which are ineffective in large state spaces, or on similarity-based methods that lack appropriate metrics for state comparison. To address these shortcomings, we propose Episodic Novelty Through Temporal Distance (ETD), a novel approach that introduces temporal distance as a robust metric for state similarity and intrinsic reward computation. By employing contrastive learning, ETD accurately estimates temporal distances and derives intrinsic rewards based on the novelty of states within the current episode. Extensive experiments on various benchmark tasks demonstrate that ETD significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its effectiveness in enhancing exploration in sparse reward CMDPs.</description>

Abstract: Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) has been a default technique in various visual generative models, yet it requires inference from both conditional and unconditional models during sampling. We propose to build visual models that are free from guided sampling. The resulting algorithm, Guidance-Free Training (GFT), matches the performance of CFG while reducing sampling to a single model, halving the computational cost. Unlike previous distillation-based approaches that rely on pretrained CFG networks, GFT enables training directly from scratch. GFT is simple to implement. It retains the same maximum likelihood objective as CFG and differs mainly in the parameterization of conditional models. Implementing GFT requires only minimal modifications to existing codebases, as most design choices and hyperparameters are directly inherited from CFG. Our extensive experiments across five distinct visual models demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of GFT. Across domains of diffusion, autoregressive, and masked-prediction modeling, GFT consistently achieves comparable or even lower FID scores, with similar diversity-fidelity trade-offs compared with CFG baselines, all while being guidance-free. Code will be available at https://github.com/thu-ml/GFT.</description>

      <title>Self-supervised Benchmark Lottery on ImageNet: Do Marginal Improvements Translate to Improvements on Similar Datasets?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) research strongly relies on benchmarks in order to determine the relative effectiveness of newly proposed models. Recently, a number of prominent research effort argued that a number of models that improve the state-of-the-art by a small margin tend to do so by winning what they call a "benchmark lottery". An important benchmark in the field of machine learning and computer vision is the ImageNet where newly proposed models are often showcased based on their performance on this dataset. Given the large number of self-supervised learning (SSL) frameworks that has been proposed in the past couple of years each coming with marginal improvements on the ImageNet dataset, in this work, we evaluate whether those marginal improvements on ImageNet translate to improvements on similar datasets or not. To do so, we investigate twelve popular SSL frameworks on five ImageNet variants and discover that models that seem to perform well on ImageNet may experience significant performance declines on similar datasets. Specifically, state-of-the-art frameworks such as DINO and Swav, which are praised for their performance, exhibit substantial drops in performance while MoCo and Barlow Twins displays comparatively good results. As a result, we argue that otherwise good and desirable properties of models remain hidden when benchmarking is only performed on the ImageNet validation set, making us call for more adequate benchmarking. To avoid the "benchmark lottery" on ImageNet and to ensure a fair benchmarking process, we investigate the usage of a unified metric that takes into account the performance of models on other ImageNet variant datasets.</description>

      <title>StochSync: Stochastic Diffusion Synchronization for Image Generation in Arbitrary Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a zero-shot method for generating images in arbitrary spaces (e.g., a sphere for 360{\deg} panoramas and a mesh surface for texture) using a pretrained image diffusion model. The zero-shot generation of various visual content using a pretrained image diffusion model has been explored mainly in two directions. First, Diffusion Synchronization-performing reverse diffusion processes jointly across different projected spaces while synchronizing them in the target space-generates high-quality outputs when enough conditioning is provided, but it struggles in its absence. Second, Score Distillation Sampling-gradually updating the target space data through gradient descent-results in better coherence but often lacks detail. In this paper, we reveal for the first time the interconnection between these two methods while highlighting their differences. To this end, we propose StochSync, a novel approach that combines the strengths of both, enabling effective performance with weak conditioning. Our experiments demonstrate that StochSync provides the best performance in 360{\deg} panorama generation (where image conditioning is not given), outperforming previous finetuning-based methods, and also delivers comparable results in 3D mesh texturing (where depth conditioning is provided) with previous methods.</description>

      <title>Token Democracy: The Architectural Limits of Alignment in Transformer-Based Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern language models paradoxically combine unprecedented capability with persistent vulnerability in that they can draft poetry yet cannot reliably refuse harmful requests. We reveal this fragility stems not from inadequate training, but from a fundamental architectural limitation: transformers process all tokens as equals. Transformers operate as computational democracies, granting equal voice to all tokens. This is a design tragically unsuited for AGI, where we cannot risk adversarial "candidates" hijacking the system. Through formal analysis, we demonstrate that safety instructions fundamentally lack privileged status in transformer architectures, that they compete with adversarial inputs in the same computational arena, making robust alignment through prompting or fine-tuning inherently limited. This "token democracy" explains why jailbreaks bypass even extensively safety-trained models and why positional shifts erode prompt effectiveness. Our work systematizes practitioners' tacit knowledge into an architectural critique, showing current alignment approaches create mere preferences, not constraints.</description>

      <title>SQ-DM: Accelerating Diffusion Models with Aggressive Quantization and Temporal Sparsity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have gained significant popularity in image generation tasks. However, generating high-quality content remains notably slow because it requires running model inference over many time steps. To accelerate these models, we propose to aggressively quantize both weights and activations, while simultaneously promoting significant activation sparsity. We further observe that the stated sparsity pattern varies among different channels and evolves across time steps. To support this quantization and sparsity scheme, we present a novel diffusion model accelerator featuring a heterogeneous mixed-precision dense-sparse architecture, channel-last address mapping, and a time-step-aware sparsity detector for efficient handling of the sparsity pattern. Our 4-bit quantization technique demonstrates superior generation quality compared to existing 4-bit methods. Our custom accelerator achieves 6.91x speed-up and 51.5% energy reduction compared to traditional dense accelerators.</description>

      <title>Identifying Critical Tokens for Accurate Predictions in Transformer-based Medical Imaging Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the advancements in self-supervised learning (SSL), transformer-based computer vision models have recently demonstrated superior results compared to convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and are poised to dominate the field of artificial intelligence (AI)-based medical imaging in the upcoming years. Nevertheless, similar to CNNs, unveiling the decision-making process of transformer-based models remains a challenge. In this work, we take a step towards demystifying the decision-making process of transformer-based medical imaging models and propose Token Insight, a novel method that identifies the critical tokens that contribute to the prediction made by the model. Our method relies on the principled approach of token discarding native to transformer-based models, requires no additional module, and can be applied to any transformer model. Using the proposed approach, we quantify the importance of each token based on its contribution to the prediction and enable a more nuanced understanding of the model's decisions. Our experimental results which are showcased on the problem of colonic polyp identification using both supervised and self-supervised pretrained vision transformers indicate that Token Insight contributes to a more transparent and interpretable transformer-based medical imaging model, fostering trust and facilitating broader adoption in clinical settings.</description>

      <title>Mind the Value-Action Gap: Do LLMs Act in Alignment with Their Values?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15463v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing research primarily evaluates the values of LLMs by examining their stated inclinations towards specific values. However, the "Value-Action Gap," a phenomenon rooted in environmental and social psychology, reveals discrepancies between individuals' stated values and their actions in real-world contexts. To what extent do LLMs exhibit a similar gap between their stated values and their actions informed by those values? This study introduces ValueActionLens, an evaluation framework to assess the alignment between LLMs' stated values and their value-informed actions. The framework encompasses the generation of a dataset comprising 14.8k value-informed actions across twelve cultures and eleven social topics, and two tasks to evaluate how well LLMs' stated value inclinations and value-informed actions align across three different alignment measures. Extensive experiments reveal that the alignment between LLMs' stated values and actions is sub-optimal, varying significantly across scenarios and models. Analysis of misaligned results identifies potential harms from certain value-action gaps. To predict the value-action gaps, we also uncover that leveraging reasoned explanations improves performance. These findings underscore the risks of relying solely on the LLMs' stated values to predict their behaviors and emphasize the importance of context-aware evaluations of LLM values and value-action gaps.</description>

Abstract: White matter bundle segmentation is crucial for studying brain structural connectivity, neurosurgical planning, and neurological disorders. White Matter Segmentation remains challenging due to structural similarity in streamlines, subject variability, symmetry in 2 hemispheres, etc. To address these challenges, we propose TractoGPT, a GPT-based architecture trained on streamline, cluster, and fusion data representations separately. TractoGPT is a fully-automatic method that generalizes across datasets and retains shape information of the white matter bundles. Experiments also show that TractoGPT outperforms state-of-the-art methods on average DICE, Overlap and Overreach scores. We use TractoInferno and 105HCP datasets and validate generalization across dataset.</description>

      <title>FedAlign: Federated Domain Generalization with Cross-Client Feature Alignment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) offers a decentralized paradigm for collaborative model training without direct data sharing, yet it poses unique challenges for Domain Generalization (DG), including strict privacy constraints, non-i.i.d. local data, and limited domain diversity. We introduce FedAlign, a lightweight, privacy-preserving framework designed to enhance DG in federated settings by simultaneously increasing feature diversity and promoting domain invariance. First, a cross-client feature extension module broadens local domain representations through domain-invariant feature perturbation and selective cross-client feature transfer, allowing each client to safely access a richer domain space. Second, a dual-stage alignment module refines global feature learning by aligning both feature embeddings and predictions across clients, thereby distilling robust, domain-invariant features. By integrating these modules, our method achieves superior generalization to unseen domains while maintaining data privacy and operating with minimal computational and communication overhead.</description>

      <title>Color Flow Imaging Microscopy Improves Identification of Stress Sources of Protein Aggregates in Biopharmaceuticals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15492v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Protein-based therapeutics play a pivotal role in modern medicine targeting various diseases. Despite their therapeutic importance, these products can aggregate and form subvisible particles (SvPs), which can compromise their efficacy and trigger immunological responses, emphasizing the critical need for robust monitoring techniques. Flow Imaging Microscopy (FIM) has been a significant advancement in detecting SvPs, evolving from monochrome to more recently incorporating color imaging. Complementing SvP images obtained via FIM, deep learning techniques have recently been employed successfully for stress source identification of monochrome SvPs. In this study, we explore the potential of color FIM to enhance the characterization of stress sources in SvPs. To achieve this, we curate a new dataset comprising 16,000 SvPs from eight commercial monoclonal antibodies subjected to heat and mechanical stress. Using both supervised and self-supervised convolutional neural networks, as well as vision transformers in large-scale experiments, we demonstrate that deep learning with color FIM images consistently outperforms monochrome images, thus highlighting the potential of color FIM in stress source classification compared to its monochrome counterparts.</description>

      <title>FIT-Print: Towards False-claim-resistant Model Ownership Verification via Targeted Fingerprint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Model fingerprinting is a widely adopted approach to safeguard the intellectual property rights of open-source models by preventing their unauthorized reuse. It is promising and convenient since it does not necessitate modifying the protected model. In this paper, we revisit existing fingerprinting methods and reveal that they are vulnerable to false claim attacks where adversaries falsely assert ownership of any third-party model. We demonstrate that this vulnerability mostly stems from their untargeted nature, where they generally compare the outputs of given samples on different models instead of the similarities to specific references. Motivated by these findings, we propose a targeted fingerprinting paradigm (i.e., FIT-Print) to counteract false claim attacks. Specifically, FIT-Print transforms the fingerprint into a targeted signature via optimization. Building on the principles of FIT-Print, we develop bit-wise and list-wise black-box model fingerprinting methods, i.e., FIT-ModelDiff and FIT-LIME, which exploit the distance between model outputs and the feature attribution of specific samples as the fingerprint, respectively. Extensive experiments on benchmark models and datasets verify the effectiveness, conferrability, and resistance to false claim attacks of our FIT-Print.</description>

      <title>UNIDOOR: A Universal Framework for Action-Level Backdoor Attacks in Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is widely applied to safety-critical decision-making scenarios. However, DRL is vulnerable to backdoor attacks, especially action-level backdoors, which pose significant threats through precise manipulation and flexible activation, risking outcomes like vehicle collisions or drone crashes. The key distinction of action-level backdoors lies in the utilization of the backdoor reward function to associate triggers with target actions. Nevertheless, existing studies typically rely on backdoor reward functions with fixed values or conditional flipping, which lack universality across diverse DRL tasks and backdoor designs, resulting in fluctuations or even failure in practice.
  This paper proposes the first universal action-level backdoor attack framework, called UNIDOOR, which enables adaptive exploration of backdoor reward functions through performance monitoring, eliminating the reliance on expert knowledge and grid search. We highlight that action tampering serves as a crucial component of action-level backdoor attacks in continuous action scenarios, as it addresses attack failures caused by low-frequency target actions. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that UNIDOOR significantly enhances the attack performance of action-level backdoors, showcasing its universality across diverse attack scenarios, including single/multiple agents, single/multiple backdoors, discrete/continuous action spaces, and sparse/dense reward signals. Furthermore, visualization results encompassing state distribution, neuron activation, and animations demonstrate the stealthiness of UNIDOOR. The source code of UNIDOOR can be found at https://github.com/maoubo/UNIDOOR.</description>

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence, particularly through large language models (LLMs), is poised to transform energy optimization and demand side management (DSM) within microgrids. This paper explores the integration of LLMs into energy management, emphasizing their roles in automating the optimization of DSM strategies with electric vehicles. We investigate challenges and solutions associated with DSM and explore the new opportunities presented by leveraging LLMs. Then, We propose an innovative solution that enhances LLMs with retrieval-augmented generation for automatic problem formulation, code generation, and customizing optimization. We present a case study to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed solution in charging scheduling and optimization for electric vehicles, highlighting our solution's significant advancements in energy efficiency and user adaptability. This work underscores the potential of LLMs for energy optimization and fosters a new era of intelligent DSM solutions.</description>

      <title>Building Efficient Lightweight CNN Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are pivotal in image classification tasks due to their robust feature extraction capabilities. However, their high computational and memory requirements pose challenges for deployment in resource-constrained environments. This paper introduces a methodology to construct lightweight CNNs while maintaining competitive accuracy. The approach integrates two stages of training; dual-input-output model and transfer learning with progressive unfreezing. The dual-input-output model train on original and augmented datasets, enhancing robustness. Progressive unfreezing is applied to the unified model to optimize pre-learned features during fine-tuning, enabling faster convergence and improved model accuracy.
  The methodology was evaluated on three benchmark datasets; handwritten digit MNIST, fashion MNIST, and CIFAR-10. The proposed model achieved a state-of-the-art accuracy of 99% on the handwritten digit MNIST and 89% on fashion MNIST, with only 14,862 parameters and a model size of 0.17 MB. While performance on CIFAR-10 was comparatively lower (65% with less than 20,00 parameters), the results highlight the scalability of this method. The final model demonstrated fast inference times and low latency, making it suitable for real-time applications.
  Future directions include exploring advanced augmentation techniques, improving architectural scalability for complex datasets, and extending the methodology to tasks beyond classification. This research underscores the potential for creating efficient, scalable, and task-specific CNNs for diverse applications.</description>

      <title>Distributionally Robust Graph Out-of-Distribution Recommendation via Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The distributionally robust optimization (DRO)-based graph neural network methods improve recommendation systems' out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization by optimizing the model's worst-case performance. However, these studies fail to consider the impact of noisy samples in the training data, which results in diminished generalization capabilities and lower accuracy. Through experimental and theoretical analysis, this paper reveals that current DRO-based graph recommendation methods assign greater weight to noise distribution, leading to model parameter learning being dominated by it. When the model overly focuses on fitting noise samples in the training data, it may learn irrelevant or meaningless features that cannot be generalized to OOD data. To address this challenge, we design a Distributionally Robust Graph model for OOD recommendation (DRGO). Specifically, our method first employs a simple and effective diffusion paradigm to alleviate the noisy effect in the latent space. Additionally, an entropy regularization term is introduced in the DRO objective function to avoid extreme sample weights in the worst-case distribution. Finally, we provide a theoretical proof of the generalization error bound of DRGO as well as a theoretical analysis of how our approach mitigates noisy sample effects, which helps to better understand the proposed framework from a theoretical perspective. We conduct extensive experiments on four datasets to evaluate the effectiveness of our framework against three typical distribution shifts, and the results demonstrate its superiority in both independently and identically distributed distributions (IID) and OOD.</description>

      <title>CE-SDWV: Effective and Efficient Concept Erasure for Text-to-Image Diffusion Models via a Semantic-Driven Word Vocabulary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large-scale text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have achieved remarkable generative performance about various concepts. With the limitation of privacy and safety in practice, the generative capability concerning NSFW (Not Safe For Work) concepts is undesirable, e.g., producing sexually explicit photos, and licensed images. The concept erasure task for T2I diffusion models has attracted considerable attention and requires an effective and efficient method. To achieve this goal, we propose a CE-SDWV framework, which removes the target concepts (e.g., NSFW concepts) of T2I diffusion models in the text semantic space by only adjusting the text condition tokens and does not need to re-train the original T2I diffusion model's weights. Specifically, our framework first builds a target concept-related word vocabulary to enhance the representation of the target concepts within the text semantic space, and then utilizes an adaptive semantic component suppression strategy to ablate the target concept-related semantic information in the text condition tokens. To further adapt the above text condition tokens to the original image semantic space, we propose an end-to-end gradient-orthogonal token optimization strategy. Extensive experiments on I2P and UnlearnCanvas benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method.</description>

      <title>Diffusion-Based Planning for Autonomous Driving with Flexible Guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Achieving human-like driving behaviors in complex open-world environments is a critical challenge in autonomous driving. Contemporary learning-based planning approaches such as imitation learning methods often struggle to balance competing objectives and lack of safety assurance,due to limited adaptability and inadequacy in learning complex multi-modal behaviors commonly exhibited in human planning, not to mention their strong reliance on the fallback strategy with predefined rules. We propose a novel transformer-based Diffusion Planner for closed-loop planning, which can effectively model multi-modal driving behavior and ensure trajectory quality without any rule-based refinement. Our model supports joint modeling of both prediction and planning tasks under the same architecture, enabling cooperative behaviors between vehicles. Moreover, by learning the gradient of the trajectory score function and employing a flexible classifier guidance mechanism, Diffusion Planner effectively achieves safe and adaptable planning behaviors. Evaluations on the large-scale real-world autonomous planning benchmark nuPlan and our newly collected 200-hour delivery-vehicle driving dataset demonstrate that Diffusion Planner achieves state-of-the-art closed-loop performance with robust transferability in diverse driving styles.</description>

      <title>Comparative clinical evaluation of "memory-efficient" synthetic 3d generative adversarial networks (gan) head-to-head to state of art: results on computed tomography of the chest</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Introduction: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are increasingly used to generate synthetic medical images, addressing the critical shortage of annotated data for training Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems. This study introduces a novel memory-efficient GAN architecture, incorporating Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) to generate high-resolution 3D medical images and evaluates its performance against the state-of-the-art hierarchical (HA)-GAN model.
  Materials and Methods: The CRF-GAN was trained using the open-source lung CT LUNA16 dataset. The architecture was compared to HA-GAN through a quantitative evaluation, using Frechet Inception Distance (FID) and Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) metrics, and a qualitative evaluation, through a two-alternative forced choice (2AFC) test completed by a pool of 12 resident radiologists, in order to assess the realism of the generated images.
  Results: CRF-GAN outperformed HA-GAN with lower FID (0.047 vs. 0.061) and MMD (0.084 vs. 0.086) scores, indicating better image fidelity. The 2AFC test showed a significant preference for images generated by CRF-Gan over those generated by HA-GAN with a p-value of 1.93e-05. Additionally, CRF-GAN demonstrated 9.34% lower memory usage at 256 resolution and achieved up to 14.6% faster training speeds, offering substantial computational savings.
  Discussion: CRF-GAN model successfully generates high-resolution 3D medical images with non-inferior quality to conventional models, while being more memory-efficient and faster. Computational power and time saved can be used to improve the spatial resolution and anatomical accuracy of generated images, which is still a critical factor limiting their direct clinical applicability.</description>

      <title>Twin Transition or Competing Interests? Validation of the Artificial Intelligence and Sustainability Perceptions Inventory (AISPI)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) and sustainability initiatives increasingly intersect, understanding public perceptions of their relationship becomes crucial for successful implementation. However, no validated instrument exists to measure these specific perceptions. This paper presents the development and validation of the Artificial Intelligence and Sustainability Perceptions Inventory (AISPI), a novel 13-item instrument measuring how individuals view the relationship between AI advancement and environmental sustainability. Through factor analysis (N=105), we identified two distinct dimensions: Twin Transition and Competing Interests. The instrument demonstrated strong reliability (alpha=.89) and construct validity through correlations with established measures of AI and sustainability attitudes. Our findings suggest that individuals can simultaneously recognize both synergies and tensions in the AI-sustainability relationship, offering important implications for researchers and practitioners working at this critical intersection. This work provides a foundational tool for future research on public perceptions of AI's role in sustainable development.</description>

      <title>SCP-116K: A High-Quality Problem-Solution Dataset and a Generalized Pipeline for Automated Extraction in the Higher Education Science Domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs) exemplified by the impressive mathematical and scientific reasoning capabilities of the o1 model have spotlighted the critical importance of high-quality training data in advancing LLM performance across STEM disciplines. While the mathematics community has benefited from a growing body of curated datasets, the scientific domain at the higher education level has long suffered from a scarcity of comparable resources. To address this gap, we present SCP-116K, a new large-scale dataset of 116,756 high-quality problem-solution pairs, automatically extracted from heterogeneous sources using a streamlined and highly generalizable pipeline. Our approach involves stringent filtering to ensure the scientific rigor and educational level of the extracted materials, while maintaining adaptability for future expansions or domain transfers. By openly releasing both the dataset and the extraction pipeline, we seek to foster research on scientific reasoning, enable comprehensive performance evaluations of new LLMs, and lower the barrier to replicating the successes of advanced models like o1 in the broader science community. We believe SCP-116K will serve as a critical resource, catalyzing progress in high-level scientific reasoning tasks and promoting further innovations in LLM development. The dataset and code are publicly available at https://github.com/AQA6666/SCP-116K-open.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Generative Modeling for Spatially Resolved Gene Expression Inference from Histology Images</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatial Transcriptomics (ST) allows a high-resolution measurement of RNA sequence abundance by systematically connecting cell morphology depicted in Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&amp;E) stained histology images to spatially resolved gene expressions. ST is a time-consuming, expensive yet powerful experimental technique that provides new opportunities to understand cancer mechanisms at a fine-grained molecular level, which is critical for uncovering new approaches for disease diagnosis and treatments. Here, we present $\textbf{Stem}$ ($\textbf{S}$pa$\textbf{T}$ially resolved gene $\textbf{E}$xpression inference with diffusion $\textbf{M}$odel), a novel computational tool that leverages a conditional diffusion generative model to enable in silico gene expression inference from H&amp;E stained images. Through better capturing the inherent stochasticity and heterogeneity in ST data, $\textbf{Stem}$ achieves state-of-the-art performance on spatial gene expression prediction and generates biologically meaningful gene profiles for new H&amp;E stained images at test time. We evaluate the proposed algorithm on datasets with various tissue sources and sequencing platforms, where it demonstrates clear improvement over existing approaches. $\textbf{Stem}$ generates high-fidelity gene expression predictions that share similar gene variation levels as ground truth data, suggesting that our method preserves the underlying biological heterogeneity. Our proposed pipeline opens up the possibility of analyzing existing, easily accessible H&amp;E stained histology images from a genomics point of view without physically performing gene expression profiling and empowers potential biological discovery from H&amp;E stained histology images.</description>

      <title>Your Learned Constraint is Secretly a Backward Reachable Tube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inverse Constraint Learning (ICL) is the problem of inferring constraints from safe (i.e., constraint-satisfying) demonstrations. The hope is that these inferred constraints can then be used downstream to search for safe policies for new tasks and, potentially, under different dynamics. Our paper explores the question of what mathematical entity ICL recovers. Somewhat surprisingly, we show that both in theory and in practice, ICL recovers the set of states where failure is inevitable, rather than the set of states where failure has already happened. In the language of safe control, this means we recover a backwards reachable tube (BRT) rather than a failure set. In contrast to the failure set, the BRT depends on the dynamics of the data collection system. We discuss the implications of the dynamics-conditionedness of the recovered constraint on both the sample-efficiency of policy search and the transferability of learned constraints.</description>

      <title>GaussianToken: An Effective Image Tokenizer with 2D Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effective image tokenization is crucial for both multi-modal understanding and generation tasks due to the necessity of the alignment with discrete text data. To this end, existing approaches utilize vector quantization (VQ) to project pixels onto a discrete codebook and reconstruct images from the discrete representation. However, compared with the continuous latent space, the limited discrete codebook space significantly restrict the representational ability of these image tokenizers. In this paper, we propose GaussianToken: An Effective Image Tokenizer with 2D Gaussian Splatting as a solution. We first represent the encoded samples as multiple flexible featured 2D Gaussians characterized by positions, rotation angles, scaling factors, and feature coefficients. We adopt the standard quantization for the Gaussian features and then concatenate the quantization results with the other intrinsic Gaussian parameters before the corresponding splatting operation and the subsequent decoding module. In general, GaussianToken integrates the local influence of 2D Gaussian distribution into the discrete space and thus enhances the representation capability of the image tokenizer. Competitive reconstruction performances on CIFAR, Mini-ImageNet, and ImageNet-1K demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. Our code is available at: https://github.com/ChrisDong-THU/GaussianToken.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Survey on Self-Interpretable Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural networks have achieved remarkable success across various fields. However, the lack of interpretability limits their practical use, particularly in critical decision-making scenarios. Post-hoc interpretability, which provides explanations for pre-trained models, is often at risk of robustness and fidelity. This has inspired a rising interest in self-interpretable neural networks, which inherently reveal the prediction rationale through the model structures. Although there exist surveys on post-hoc interpretability, a comprehensive and systematic survey of self-interpretable neural networks is still missing. To address this gap, we first collect and review existing works on self-interpretable neural networks and provide a structured summary of their methodologies from five key perspectives: attribution-based, function-based, concept-based, prototype-based, and rule-based self-interpretation. We also present concrete, visualized examples of model explanations and discuss their applicability across diverse scenarios, including image, text, graph data, and deep reinforcement learning. Additionally, we summarize existing evaluation metrics for self-interpretability and identify open challenges in this field, offering insights for future research. To support ongoing developments, we present a publicly accessible resource to track advancements in this domain: https://github.com/yangji721/Awesome-Self-Interpretable-Neural-Network.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent pose-transfer methods aim to generate temporally consistent and fully controllable videos of human action where the motion from a reference video is reenacted by a new identity. We evaluate three state-of-the-art pose-transfer methods -- AnimateAnyone, MagicAnimate, and ExAvatar -- by generating videos with actions and identities outside the training distribution and conducting a participant study about the quality of these videos. In a controlled environment of 20 distinct human actions, we find that participants, presented with the pose-transferred videos, correctly identify the desired action only 42.92% of the time. Moreover, the participants find the actions in the generated videos consistent with the reference (source) videos only 36.46% of the time. These results vary by method: participants find the splatting-based ExAvatar more consistent and photorealistic than the diffusion-based AnimateAnyone and MagicAnimate.</description>

      <title>People who frequently use ChatGPT for writing tasks are accurate and robust detectors of AI-generated text</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study how well humans can detect text generated by commercial LLMs (GPT-4o, Claude, o1). We hire annotators to read 300 non-fiction English articles, label them as either human-written or AI-generated, and provide paragraph-length explanations for their decisions. Our experiments show that annotators who frequently use LLMs for writing tasks excel at detecting AI-generated text, even without any specialized training or feedback. In fact, the majority vote among five such "expert" annotators misclassifies only 1 of 300 articles, significantly outperforming most commercial and open-source detectors we evaluated even in the presence of evasion tactics like paraphrasing and humanization. Qualitative analysis of the experts' free-form explanations shows that while they rely heavily on specific lexical clues ('AI vocabulary'), they also pick up on more complex phenomena within the text (e.g., formality, originality, clarity) that are challenging to assess for automatic detectors. We release our annotated dataset and code to spur future research into both human and automated detection of AI-generated text.</description>

      <title>Marker Track: Accurate Fiducial Marker Tracking for Evaluation of Residual Motions During Breath-Hold Radiotherapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fiducial marker positions in projection image of cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) scans have been studied to evaluate daily residual motion during breath-hold radiation therapy. Fiducial marker migration posed challenges in accurately locating markers, prompting the development of a novel algorithm that reconstructs volumetric probability maps of marker locations from filtered gradient maps of projections. This guides the development of a Python-based algorithm to detect fiducial markers in projection images using Meta AI's Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2). Retrospective data from a pancreatic cancer patient with two fiducial markers were analyzed. The three-dimensional (3D) marker positions from simulation computed tomography (CT) were compared to those reconstructed from CBCT images, revealing a decrease in relative distances between markers over time. Fiducial markers were successfully detected in 2777 out of 2786 projection frames. The average standard deviation of superior-inferior (SI) marker positions was 0.56 mm per breath-hold, with differences in average SI positions between two breath-holds in the same scan reaching up to 5.2 mm, and a gap of up to 7.3 mm between the end of the first and beginning of the second breath-hold. 3D marker positions were calculated using projection positions and confirmed marker migration. This method effectively calculates marker probability volume and enables accurate fiducial marker tracking during treatment without requiring any specialized equipment, additional radiation doses, or manual initialization and labeling. It has significant potential for automatically assessing daily residual motion to adjust planning margins, functioning as an adaptive radiation therapy tool.</description>

Abstract: This study investigates the potential of hybrid metaheuristic algorithms to enhance the training of Probabilistic Neural Networks (PNNs) by leveraging the complementary strengths of multiple optimisation strategies. Traditional learning methods, such as gradient-based approaches, often struggle to optimise high-dimensional and uncertain environments, while single-method metaheuristics may fail to exploit the solution space fully. To address these challenges, we propose the constrained Hybrid Metaheuristic (cHM) algorithm, a novel approach that combines multiple population-based optimisation techniques into a unified framework. The proposed procedure operates in two phases: an initial probing phase evaluates multiple metaheuristics to identify the best-performing one based on the error rate, followed by a fitting phase where the selected metaheuristic refines the PNN to achieve optimal smoothing parameters. This iterative process ensures efficient exploration and convergence, enhancing the network's generalisation and classification accuracy. cHM integrates several popular metaheuristics, such as BAT, Simulated Annealing, Flower Pollination Algorithm, Bacterial Foraging Optimization, and Particle Swarm Optimisation as internal optimisers. To evaluate cHM performance, experiments were conducted on 16 datasets with varying characteristics, including binary and multiclass classification tasks, balanced and imbalanced class distributions, and diverse feature dimensions. The results demonstrate that cHM effectively combines the strengths of individual metaheuristics, leading to faster convergence and more robust learning. By optimising the smoothing parameters of PNNs, the proposed method enhances classification performance across diverse datasets, proving its application flexibility and efficiency.</description>

      <title>StagFormer: Time Staggering Transformer Decoding for RunningLayers In Parallel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Standard decoding in a Transformer based language model is inherently sequential as we wait for a token's embedding to pass through all the layers in the network before starting the generation of the next token. In this work, we propose a new architecture StagFormer (Staggered Transformer), which staggered execution along the time axis and thereby enables parallelizing the decoding process along the depth of the model. We achieve this by breaking the dependency of the token representation at time step $i$ in layer $l$ upon the representations of tokens until time step $i$ from layer $l-1$. Instead, we stagger the execution and only allow a dependency on token representations until time step $i-1$. The later sections of the Transformer still get access to the ``rich" representations from the prior section but only from those token positions which are one time step behind. StagFormer allows for different sections of the model to be executed in parallel yielding at potential 33\% speedup in decoding while being quality neutral in our simulations. We also explore many natural variants of this idea. We present how weight-sharing across the different sections being staggered can be more practical in settings with limited memory. We show how one can approximate a recurrent model during inference using such weight-sharing. We explore the efficacy of using a bounded window attention to pass information from one section to another which helps drive further latency gains for some applications. We also explore demonstrate the scalability of the staggering idea over more than 2 sections of the Transformer.</description>

      <title>Blissful (A)Ignorance: People form overly positive impressions of others based on their written messages, despite wide-scale adoption of Generative AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the use of Generative AI (GenAI) tools becomes more prevalent in interpersonal communication, understanding their impact on social perceptions is crucial. According to signaling theory, GenAI may undermine the credibility of social signals conveyed in writing, since it reduces the cost of writing and makes it hard to verify the authenticity of messages. Using a pre-registered large-scale online experiment (N = 647; Prolific), featuring scenarios in a range of communication contexts (personal vs. professional; close others vs. strangers), we explored how senders' use of GenAI influenced recipients' impressions of senders, both when GenAI use was known or uncertain. Consistent with past work, we found strong negative effects on social impressions when disclosing that a message was AI-generated, compared to when the same message was human-written. However, under the more realistic condition when potential GenAI use was not explicitly highlighted, recipients did not exhibit any skepticism towards senders, and these "uninformed" impressions were virtually indistinguishable from those of fully human-written messages. Even when we highlighted the potential (but uncertain) use of GenAI, recipients formed overly positive impressions. These results are especially striking given that 46% of our sample admitted having used such tools for writing messages, just within the past two weeks. Our findings put past work in a new light: While social judgments can be substantially affected when GenAI use is explicitly disclosed, this information may not be readily available in more realistic communication settings, making recipients blissfully ignorant about others' potential use of GenAI.</description>

      <title>Transformer-Based Multimodal Knowledge Graph Completion with Link-Aware Contexts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal knowledge graph completion (MMKGC) aims to predict missing links in multimodal knowledge graphs (MMKGs) by leveraging information from various modalities alongside structural data. Existing MMKGC approaches primarily extend traditional knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models, which often require creating an embedding for every entity. This results in large model sizes and inefficiencies in integrating multimodal information, particularly for real-world graphs. Meanwhile, Transformer-based models have demonstrated competitive performance in knowledge graph completion (KGC). However, their focus on single-modal knowledge limits their capacity to utilize cross-modal information. Recently, Large vision-language models (VLMs) have shown potential in cross-modal tasks but are constrained by the high cost of training. In this work, we propose a novel approach that integrates Transformer-based KGE models with cross-modal context generated by pre-trained VLMs, thereby extending their applicability to MMKGC. Specifically, we employ a pre-trained VLM to transform relevant visual information from entities and their neighbors into textual sequences. We then frame KGC as a sequence-to-sequence task, fine-tuning the model with the generated cross-modal context. This simple yet effective method significantly reduces model size compared to traditional KGE approaches while achieving competitive performance across multiple large-scale datasets with minimal hyperparameter tuning.</description>

      <title>Beyond Benchmarks: On The False Promise of AI Regulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) systems in critical domains like healthcare, justice, and social services has sparked numerous regulatory initiatives aimed at ensuring their safe deployment. Current regulatory frameworks, exemplified by recent US and EU efforts, primarily focus on procedural guidelines while presuming that scientific benchmarking can effectively validate AI safety, similar to how crash tests verify vehicle safety or clinical trials validate drug efficacy. However, this approach fundamentally misunderstands the unique technical challenges posed by modern AI systems. Through systematic analysis of successful technology regulation case studies, we demonstrate that effective scientific regulation requires a causal theory linking observable test outcomes to future performance - for instance, how a vehicle's crash resistance at one speed predicts its safety at lower speeds. We show that deep learning models, which learn complex statistical patterns from training data without explicit causal mechanisms, preclude such guarantees. This limitation renders traditional regulatory approaches inadequate for ensuring AI safety. Moving forward, we call for regulators to reckon with this limitation, and propose a preliminary two-tiered regulatory framework that acknowledges these constraints: mandating human oversight for high-risk applications while developing appropriate risk communication strategies for lower-risk uses. Our findings highlight the urgent need to reconsider fundamental assumptions in AI regulation and suggest a concrete path forward for policymakers and researchers.</description>

      <title>Contextual Knowledge Sharing in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning with Decentralized Communication and Coordination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decentralized Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (Dec-MARL) has emerged as a pivotal approach for addressing complex tasks in dynamic environments. Existing Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) methodologies typically assume a shared objective among agents and rely on centralized control. However, many real-world scenarios feature agents with individual goals and limited observability of other agents, complicating coordination and hindering adaptability. Existing Dec-MARL strategies prioritize either communication or coordination, lacking an integrated approach that leverages both. This paper presents a novel Dec-MARL framework that integrates peer-to-peer communication and coordination, incorporating goal-awareness and time-awareness into the agents' knowledge-sharing processes. Our framework equips agents with the ability to (i) share contextually relevant knowledge to assist other agents, and (ii) reason based on information acquired from multiple agents, while considering their own goals and the temporal context of prior knowledge. We evaluate our approach through several complex multi-agent tasks in environments with dynamically appearing obstacles. Our work demonstrates that incorporating goal-aware and time-aware knowledge sharing significantly enhances overall performance.</description>

      <title>StaICC: Standardized Evaluation for Classification Task in In-context Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classification tasks are widely investigated in the In-Context Learning (ICL) paradigm. However, current efforts are evaluated on disjoint benchmarks and settings, while their performances are significantly influenced by some trivial variables, such as prompt templates, data sampling, instructions, etc., which leads to significant inconsistencies in the results reported across various literature, preventing fair comparison or meta-analysis across different papers. Therefore, this paper proposes a standardized and easy-to-use evaluation toolkit (StaICC) for in-context classification. Including, for the normal classification task, we provide StaICC-Normal, selecting 10 widely used datasets, and generating prompts with a fixed form, to mitigate the variance among the experiment implementations. To enrich the usage of our benchmark, we also provide a sub-benchmark StaICC-Diag for diagnosing ICL from several aspects, aiming for a more robust inference processing.</description>

      <title>A Survey on Computational Pathology Foundation Models: Datasets, Adaptation Strategies, and Evaluation Tasks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computational pathology foundation models (CPathFMs) have emerged as a powerful approach for analyzing histopathological data, leveraging self-supervised learning to extract robust feature representations from unlabeled whole-slide images. These models, categorized into uni-modal and multi-modal frameworks, have demonstrated promise in automating complex pathology tasks such as segmentation, classification, and biomarker discovery. However, the development of CPathFMs presents significant challenges, such as limited data accessibility, high variability across datasets, the necessity for domain-specific adaptation, and the lack of standardized evaluation benchmarks. This survey provides a comprehensive review of CPathFMs in computational pathology, focusing on datasets, adaptation strategies, and evaluation tasks. We analyze key techniques, such as contrastive learning and multi-modal integration, and highlight existing gaps in current research. Finally, we explore future directions from four perspectives for advancing CPathFMs. This survey serves as a valuable resource for researchers, clinicians, and AI practitioners, guiding the advancement of CPathFMs toward robust and clinically applicable AI-driven pathology solutions.</description>

      <title>Gensors: Authoring Personalized Visual Sensors with Multimodal Foundation Models and Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs), with their expansive world knowledge and reasoning capabilities, present a unique opportunity for end-users to create personalized AI sensors capable of reasoning about complex situations. A user could describe a desired sensing task in natural language (e.g., "alert if my toddler is getting into mischief"), with the MLLM analyzing the camera feed and responding within seconds. In a formative study, we found that users saw substantial value in defining their own sensors, yet struggled to articulate their unique personal requirements and debug the sensors through prompting alone. To address these challenges, we developed Gensors, a system that empowers users to define customized sensors supported by the reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. Gensors 1) assists users in eliciting requirements through both automatically-generated and manually created sensor criteria, 2) facilitates debugging by allowing users to isolate and test individual criteria in parallel, 3) suggests additional criteria based on user-provided images, and 4) proposes test cases to help users "stress test" sensors on potentially unforeseen scenarios. In a user study, participants reported significantly greater sense of control, understanding, and ease of communication when defining sensors using Gensors. Beyond addressing model limitations, Gensors supported users in debugging, eliciting requirements, and expressing unique personal requirements to the sensor through criteria-based reasoning; it also helped uncover users' "blind spots" by exposing overlooked criteria and revealing unanticipated failure modes. Finally, we discuss how unique characteristics of MLLMs--such as hallucinations and inconsistent responses--can impact the sensor-creation process. These findings contribute to the design of future intelligent sensing systems that are intuitive and customizable by everyday users.</description>

      <title>Renewable Energy Prediction: A Comparative Study of Deep Learning Models for Complex Dataset Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing focus on predicting renewable energy production aligns with advancements in deep learning (DL). The inherent variability of renewable sources and the complexity of prediction methods require robust approaches, such as DL models, in the renewable energy sector. DL models are preferred over traditional machine learning (ML) because they capture complex, nonlinear relationships in renewable energy datasets. This study examines key factors influencing DL technique accuracy, including sampling and hyperparameter optimization, by comparing various methods and training and test ratios within a DL framework. Seven machine learning methods, LSTM, Stacked LSTM, CNN, CNN-LSTM, DNN, Time-Distributed MLP (TD-MLP), and Autoencoder (AE), are evaluated using a dataset combining weather and photovoltaic power output data from 12 locations. Regularization techniques such as early stopping, neuron dropout, L1 and L2 regularization are applied to address overfitting. The results demonstrate that the combination of early stopping, dropout, and L1 regularization provides the best performance to reduce overfitting in the CNN and TD-MLP models with larger training set, while the combination of early stopping, dropout, and L2 regularization is the most effective to reduce the overfitting in CNN-LSTM and AE models with smaller training set.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Video Vision Transformer for Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis from 3D Brain MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder affecting millions worldwide, necessitating early and accurate diagnosis for optimal patient management. In recent years, advancements in deep learning have shown remarkable potential in medical image analysis. Methods In this study, we present "ViTranZheimer," an AD diagnosis approach which leverages video vision transformers to analyze 3D brain MRI data. By treating the 3D MRI volumes as videos, we exploit the temporal dependencies between slices to capture intricate structural relationships. The video vision transformer's self-attention mechanisms enable the model to learn long-range dependencies and identify subtle patterns that may indicate AD progression. Our proposed deep learning framework seeks to enhance the accuracy and sensitivity of AD diagnosis, empowering clinicians with a tool for early detection and intervention. We validate the performance of the video vision transformer using the ADNI dataset and conduct comparative analyses with other relevant models. Results The proposed ViTranZheimer model is compared with two hybrid models, CNN-BiLSTM and ViT-BiLSTM. CNN-BiLSTM is the combination of a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a bidirectional long-short-term memory network (BiLSTM), while ViT-BiLSTM is the combination of a vision transformer (ViT) with BiLSTM. The accuracy levels achieved in the ViTranZheimer, CNN-BiLSTM, and ViT-BiLSTM models are 98.6%, 96.479%, and 97.465%, respectively. ViTranZheimer demonstrated the highest accuracy at 98.6%, outperforming other models in this evaluation metric, indicating its superior performance in this specific evaluation metric. Conclusion This research advances the understanding of applying deep learning techniques in neuroimaging and Alzheimer's disease research, paving the way for earlier and less invasive clinical diagnosis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Algorithmic level developments like Convolutional Neural Networks, transformers, attention mechanism, Retrieval Augmented Generation and so on have changed Artificial Intelligence. Recent such development was observed by Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks that suggested to challenge the fundamental concept of a Neural Network, thus change Multilayer Perceptron, and Convolutional Neural Networks. They received a good reception in terms of scientific modeling, yet had some drawbacks in terms of efficiency. In this paper, we train Convolutional Kolmogorov Arnold Networks (CKANs) with the ImageNet-1k dataset with 1.3 million images, MNIST dataset with 60k images and a tabular biological science related MoA dataset and test the promise of CKANs in terms of FLOPS, Inference Time, number of trainable parameters and training time against the accuracy, precision, recall and f-1 score they produce against the standard industry practice on CNN models. We show that the CKANs perform fair yet slower than CNNs in small size dataset like MoA and MNIST but are not nearly comparable as the dataset gets larger and more complex like the ImageNet.

Abstract: We introduce the problem of formally verifying properties of Markov processes where the parameters are the output of machine learning models. Our formulation is general and solves a wide range of problems, including verifying properties of probabilistic programs that use machine learning, and subgroup analysis in healthcare modeling. We show that for a broad class of machine learning models, including linear models, tree-based models, and neural networks, verifying properties of Markov chains like reachability, hitting time, and total reward can be formulated as a bilinear program. We develop a decomposition and bound propagation scheme for solving the bilinear program and show through computational experiments that our method solves the problem to global optimality up to 100x faster than state-of-the-art solvers. We also release $\texttt{markovml}$, an open-source tool for building Markov processes, integrating pretrained machine learning models, and verifying their properties, available at https://github.com/mmaaz-git/markovml.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models to Diffusion Finetuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new finetuning method to provide pre-trained large language models (LMs) the ability to scale test-time compute through the diffusion framework. By increasing the number of diffusion steps, we show our finetuned models achieve monotonically increasing accuracy, directly translating to improved performance across downstream tasks. Furthermore, our finetuned models can expertly answer questions on specific topics by integrating powerful guidance techniques, and autonomously determine the compute required for a given problem by leveraging adaptive ODE solvers. Our method is universally applicable to any foundation model pre-trained with a cross-entropy loss and does not modify any of its original weights, fully preserving its strong single-step generation capabilities. We show our method is more effective and fully compatible with traditional finetuning approaches, introducing an orthogonal new direction to unify the strengths of the autoregressive and diffusion frameworks.</description>

      <title>Adaptive AI-based Decentralized Resource Management in the Cloud-Edge Continuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing complexity of application requirements and the dynamic nature of the Cloud-Edge Continuum present significant challenges for efficient resource management. These challenges stem from the ever-changing infrastructure, which is characterized by additions, removals, and reconfigurations of nodes and links, as well as the variability of application workloads. Traditional centralized approaches struggle to adapt to these changes due to their static nature, while decentralized solutions face challenges such as limited global visibility and coordination overhead. This paper proposes a hybrid decentralized framework for dynamic application placement and resource management. The framework utilizes Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to embed resource and application states, enabling comprehensive representation and efficient decision-making. It employs a collaborative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approach, where local agents optimize resource management in their neighborhoods and a global orchestrator ensures system-wide coordination. By combining decentralized application placement with centralized oversight, our framework addresses the scalability, adaptability, and accuracy challenges inherent in the Cloud-Edge Continuum. This work contributes to the development of decentralized application placement strategies, the integration of GNN embeddings, and collaborative MARL systems, providing a foundation for efficient, adaptive and scalable resource management.</description>

      <title>AdaF^2M^2: Comprehensive Learning and Responsive Leveraging Features in Recommendation System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Feature modeling, which involves feature representation learning and leveraging, plays an essential role in industrial recommendation systems. However, the data distribution in real-world applications usually follows a highly skewed long-tail pattern due to the popularity bias, which easily leads to over-reliance on ID-based features, such as user/item IDs and ID sequences of interactions. Such over-reliance makes it hard for models to learn features comprehensively, especially for those non-ID meta features, e.g., user/item characteristics. Further, it limits the feature leveraging ability in models, getting less generalized and more susceptible to data noise. Previous studies on feature modeling focus on feature extraction and interaction, hardly noticing the problems brought about by the long-tail data distribution. To achieve better feature representation learning and leveraging on real-world data, we propose a model-agnostic framework AdaF^2M^2, short for Adaptive Feature Modeling with Feature Mask. The feature-mask mechanism helps comprehensive feature learning via multi-forward training with augmented samples, while the adapter applies adaptive weights on features responsive to different user/item states. By arming base models with AdaF^2M^2, we conduct online A/B tests on multiple recommendation scenarios, obtaining +1.37% and +1.89% cumulative improvements on user active days and app duration respectively. Besides, the extended offline experiments on different models show improvements as well. AdaF$^2$M$^2$ has been widely deployed on both retrieval and ranking tasks in multiple applications of Douyin Group, indicating its superior effectiveness and universality.</description>

      <title>Long-Term Interest Clock: Fine-Grained Time Perception in Streaming Recommendation System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: User interests manifest a dynamic pattern within the course of a day, e.g., a user usually favors soft music at 8 a.m. but may turn to ambient music at 10 p.m. To model dynamic interests in a day, hour embedding is widely used in traditional daily-trained industrial recommendation systems. However, its discreteness can cause periodical online patterns and instability in recent streaming recommendation systems. Recently, Interest Clock has achieved remarkable performance in streaming recommendation systems. Nevertheless, it models users' dynamic interests in a coarse-grained manner, merely encoding users' discrete interests of 24 hours from short-term behaviors. In this paper, we propose a fine-grained method for perceiving time information for streaming recommendation systems, named Long-term Interest Clock (LIC). The key idea of LIC is adaptively calculating current user interests by taking into consideration the relevance of long-term behaviors around current time (e.g., 8 a.m.) given a candidate item. LIC consists of two modules: (1) Clock-GSU retrieves a sub-sequence by searching through long-term behaviors, using query information from a candidate item and current time, (2) Clock-ESU employs a time-gap-aware attention mechanism to aggregate sub-sequence with the candidate item. With Clock-GSU and Clock-ESU, LIC is capable of capturing users' dynamic fine-grained interests from long-term behaviors. We conduct online A/B tests, obtaining +0.122% improvements on user active days. Besides, the extended offline experiments show improvements as well. Long-term Interest Clock has been integrated into Douyin Music App's recommendation system.</description>

      <title>FuzzyLight: A Robust Two-Stage Fuzzy Approach for Traffic Signal Control Works in Real Cities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effective traffic signal control (TSC) is crucial in mitigating urban congestion and reducing emissions. Recently, reinforcement learning (RL) has been the research trend for TSC. However, existing RL algorithms face several real-world challenges that hinder their practical deployment in TSC: (1) Sensor accuracy deteriorates with increased sensor detection range, and data transmission is prone to noise, potentially resulting in unsafe TSC decisions. (2) During the training of online RL, interactions with the environment could be unstable, potentially leading to inappropriate traffic signal phase (TSP) selection and traffic congestion. (3) Most current TSC algorithms focus only on TSP decisions, overlooking the critical aspect of phase duration, affecting safety and efficiency. To overcome these challenges, we propose a robust two-stage fuzzy approach called FuzzyLight, which integrates compressed sensing and RL for TSC deployment. FuzzyLight offers several key contributions: (1) It employs fuzzy logic and compressed sensing to address sensor noise and enhances the efficiency of TSP decisions. (2) It maintains stable performance during training and combines fuzzy logic with RL to generate precise phases. (3) It works in real cities across 22 intersections and demonstrates superior performance in both real-world and simulated environments. Experimental results indicate that FuzzyLight enhances traffic efficiency by 48% compared to expert-designed timings in the real world. Furthermore, it achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in simulated environments using six real-world datasets with transmission noise.

      <title>SpatialVLA: Exploring Spatial Representations for Visual-Language-Action Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we claim that spatial understanding is the keypoint in robot manipulation, and propose SpatialVLA to explore effective spatial representations for the robot foundation model. Specifically, we introduce Ego3D Position Encoding to inject 3D information into the input observations of the visual-language-action model, and propose Adaptive Action Grids to represent spatial robot movement actions with adaptive discretized action grids, facilitating learning generalizable and transferrable spatial action knowledge for cross-robot control. SpatialVLA is first pre-trained on top of a vision-language model with 1.1 Million real-world robot episodes, to learn a generalist manipulation policy across multiple robot environments and tasks. After pre-training, SpatialVLA is directly applied to perform numerous tasks in a zero-shot manner. The superior results in both simulation and real-world robots demonstrate its advantage of inferring complex robot motion trajectories and its strong in-domain multi-task generalization ability. We further show the proposed Adaptive Action Grids offer a new and effective way to fine-tune the pre-trained SpatialVLA model for new simulation and real-world setups, where the pre-learned action grids are re-discretized to capture robot-specific spatial action movements of new setups. The superior results from extensive evaluations demonstrate the exceptional in-distribution generalization and out-of-distribution adaptation capability, highlighting the crucial benefit of the proposed spatial-aware representations for generalist robot policy learning. All the details and codes will be open-sourced.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern threat landscapes continue to evolve with increasing sophistication, challenging traditional detection methodologies and necessitating innovative solutions capable of addressing complex adversarial tactics. A novel framework was developed to identify ransomware activity through multimodal execution path analysis, integrating high-dimensional embeddings and dynamic heuristic derivation mechanisms to capture behavioral patterns across diverse attack variants. The approach demonstrated high adaptability, effectively mitigating obfuscation strategies and polymorphic characteristics often employed by ransomware families to evade detection. Comprehensive experimental evaluations revealed significant advancements in precision, recall, and accuracy metrics compared to baseline techniques, particularly under conditions of variable encryption speeds and obfuscated execution flows. The framework achieved scalable and computationally efficient performance, ensuring robust applicability across a range of system configurations, from resource-constrained environments to high-performance infrastructures. Notable findings included reduced false positive rates and enhanced detection latency, even for ransomware families employing sophisticated encryption mechanisms. The modular design allowed seamless integration of additional modalities, enabling extensibility and future-proofing against emerging threat vectors. Quantitative analyses further highlighted the system's energy efficiency, emphasizing its practicality for deployment in environments with stringent operational constraints. The results underline the importance of integrating advanced computational techniques and dynamic adaptability to safeguard digital ecosystems from increasingly complex threats.</description>

      <title>CrySPAI: A new Crystal Structure Prediction Software Based on Artificial Intelligence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Crystal structure predictions based on the combination of first-principles calculations and machine learning have achieved significant success in materials science. However, most of these approaches are limited to predicting specific systems, which hinders their application to unknown or unexplored domains. In this paper, we present CrySPAI, a crystal structure prediction package developed using artificial intelligence (AI) to predict energetically stable crystal structures of inorganic materials given their chemical compositions. The software consists of three key modules, an evolutionary optimization algorithm (EOA) that searches for all possible crystal structure configurations, density functional theory (DFT) that provides the accurate energy values for these structures, and a deep neural network (DNN) that learns the relationship between crystal structures and their corresponding energies. To optimize the process across these modules, a distributed framework is implemented to parallelize tasks, and an automated workflow has been integrated into CrySPAI for seamless execution. This paper reports the development and implementation of AI AI-based CrySPAI Crystal Prediction Software tool and its unique features.</description>

      <title>Beyond In-Distribution Performance: A Cross-Dataset Study of Trajectory Prediction Robustness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Out-of-Distribution (OoD) generalization ability of three SotA trajectory prediction models with comparable In-Distribution (ID) performance but different model designs. We investigate the influence of inductive bias, size of training data and data augmentation strategy by training the models on Argoverse 2 (A2) and testing on Waymo Open Motion (WO) and vice versa. We find that the smallest model with highest inductive bias exhibits the best OoD generalization across different augmentation strategies when trained on the smaller A2 dataset and tested on the large WO dataset. In the converse setting, training all models on the larger WO dataset and testing on the smaller A2 dataset, we find that all models generalize poorly, even though the model with the highest inductive bias still exhibits the best generalization ability. We discuss possible reasons for this surprising finding and draw conclusions about the design and test of trajectory prediction models and benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Transfer of Knowledge through Reverse Annealing: A Preliminary Analysis of the Benefits and What to Share</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Being immersed in the NISQ-era, current quantum annealers present limitations for solving optimization problems efficiently. To mitigate these limitations, D-Wave Systems developed a mechanism called Reverse Annealing, a specific type of quantum annealing designed to perform local refinement of good states found elsewhere. Despite the research activity around Reverse Annealing, none has theorized about the possible benefits related to the transfer of knowledge under this paradigm. This work moves in that direction and is driven by experimentation focused on answering two key research questions: i) is reverse annealing a paradigm that can benefit from knowledge transfer between similar problems? and ii) can we infer the characteristics that an input solution should meet to help increase the probability of success? To properly guide the tests in this paper, the well-known Knapsack Problem has been chosen for benchmarking purposes, using a total of 34 instances composed of 14 and 16 items.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to 4D Panoptic LiDAR Segmentation that decouples semantic and instance segmentation, leveraging single-scan semantic predictions as prior information for instance segmentation. Our method D-PLS first performs single-scan semantic segmentation and aggregates the results over time, using them to guide instance segmentation. The modular design of D-PLS allows for seamless integration on top of any semantic segmentation architecture, without requiring architectural changes or retraining. We evaluate our approach on the SemanticKITTI dataset, where it demonstrates significant improvements over the baseline in both classification and association tasks, as measured by the LiDAR Segmentation and Tracking Quality (LSTQ) metric. Furthermore, we show that our decoupled architecture not only enhances instance prediction but also surpasses the baseline due to advancements in single-scan semantic segmentation.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Sentence Embedding with Pseudo-Labeling and Model Ensembles: A Hierarchical Framework for Enhanced NLP Tasks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sentence embedding tasks are important in natural language processing (NLP), but improving their performance while keeping them reliable is still hard. This paper presents a framework that combines pseudo-label generation and model ensemble techniques to improve sentence embeddings. We use external data from SimpleWiki, Wikipedia, and BookCorpus to make sure the training data is consistent. The framework includes a hierarchical model with an encoding layer, refinement layer, and ensemble prediction layer, using ALBERT-xxlarge, RoBERTa-large, and DeBERTa-large models. Cross-attention layers combine external context, and data augmentation techniques like synonym replacement and back-translation increase data variety. Experimental results show large improvements in accuracy and F1-score compared to basic models, and studies confirm that cross-attention and data augmentation make a difference. This work presents an effective way to improve sentence embedding tasks and lays the groundwork for future NLP research.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is a growing need for diverse, high-quality stuttered speech data, particularly in the context of Indian languages. This paper introduces Project Boli, a multi-lingual stuttered speech dataset designed to advance scientific understanding and technology development for individuals who stutter, particularly in India. The dataset constitutes (a) anonymized metadata (gender, age, country, mother tongue) and responses to a questionnaire about how stuttering affects their daily lives, (b) captures both read speech (using the Rainbow Passage) and spontaneous speech (through image description tasks) for each participant and (c) includes detailed annotations of five stutter types: blocks, prolongations, interjections, sound repetitions and word repetitions. We present a comprehensive analysis of the dataset, including the data collection procedure, experience summarization of people who stutter, severity assessment of stuttering events and technical validation of the collected data. The dataset is released as an open access to further speech technology development.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Width Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For almost 70 years, researchers have mostly relied on hyper-parameter tuning to pick the width of neural networks' layers out of many possible choices. This paper challenges the status quo by introducing an easy-to-use technique to learn an unbounded width of a neural network's layer during training. The technique does not rely on alternate optimization nor hand-crafted gradient heuristics; rather, it jointly optimizes the width and the parameters of each layer via simple backpropagation. We apply the technique to a broad range of data domains such as tables, images, texts, and graphs, showing how the width adapts to the task's difficulty. By imposing a soft ordering of importance among neurons, it is possible to truncate the trained network at virtually zero cost, achieving a smooth trade-off between performance and compute resources in a structured way. Alternatively, one can dynamically compress the network with no performance degradation. In light of recent foundation models trained on large datasets, believed to require billions of parameters and where hyper-parameter tuning is unfeasible due to huge training costs, our approach stands as a viable alternative for width learning.</description>

      <title>A Data-Centric Approach: Dimensions of Visual Complexity and How to find Them</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how humans perceive visual complexity is a key area of study in visual cognition. Previous approaches to modeling visual complexity have often resulted in intricate, difficult-to-interpret solutions that employ numerous features or sophisticated deep learning architectures. While these complex models achieve high performance on specific datasets, they often sacrifice interpretability, making it challenging to understand the factors driving human perception of complexity. A recent model based on image segmentations showed promise in addressing this challenge; however, it presented limitations in capturing structural and semantic aspects of visual complexity. In this paper, we propose viable and effective features to overcome these shortcomings. Specifically, we develop multiscale features for the structural aspect of complexity, including the Multiscale Sobel Gradient (MSG), which captures spatial intensity variations across scales, and Multiscale Unique Colors (MUC), which quantifies image colorfulness by indexing quantized RGB values. We also introduce a new dataset SVG based on Visual Genome to explore the semantic aspect of visual complexity, obtaining surprise scores based on the element of surprise in images, which we demonstrate significantly contributes to perceived complexity. Overall, we suggest that the nature of the data is fundamental to understanding and modeling visual complexity, highlighting the importance of both structural and semantic dimensions in providing a comprehensive, interpretable assessment. The code for our analysis, experimental setup, and dataset will be made publicly available upon acceptance.</description>

      <title>Evidential Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel class of Physics-Informed Neural Networks that is formulated based on the principles of Evidential Deep Learning, where the model incorporates uncertainty quantification by learning parameters of a higher-order distribution. The dependent and trainable variables of the PDE residual loss and data-fitting loss terms are recast as functions of the hyperparameters of an evidential prior distribution. Our model is equipped with an information-theoretic regularizer that contains the Kullback-Leibler divergence between two inverse-gamma distributions characterizing predictive uncertainty. Relative to Bayesian-Physics-Informed-Neural-Networks, our framework appeared to exhibit higher sensitivity to data noise, preserve boundary conditions more faithfully and yield empirical coverage probabilities closer to nominal ones. Toward examining its relevance for data mining in scientific discoveries, we demonstrate how to apply our model to inverse problems involving 1D and 2D nonlinear differential equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies an online variant of the celebrated housing market problem, where each agent has a single house and seeks to exchange it for another based on her preferences. In this online setting, agents may arrive and depart at any time, meaning that not all agents are present on the housing market simultaneously. I extend the well known serial dictatorship and Gale s top trading cycle mechanisms to this online scenario, aiming to retain their desirable properties such as Pareto efficiency, individual rationality, and strategy proofness. These extensions also seek to prevent agents from strategically delaying their arrival or advancing their departure. I demonstrate that achieving all of these properties simultaneously is impossible in the online context, and I present several variants that achieve different subsets of these properties.</description>

      <title>Generative AI for Lyapunov Optimization Theory in UAV-based Low-Altitude Economy Networking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lyapunov optimization theory has recently emerged as a powerful mathematical framework for solving complex stochastic optimization problems by transforming long-term objectives into a sequence of real-time short-term decisions while ensuring system stability. This theory is particularly valuable in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based low-altitude economy (LAE) networking scenarios, where it could effectively address inherent challenges of dynamic network conditions, multiple optimization objectives, and stability requirements. Recently, generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) has garnered significant attention for its unprecedented capability to generate diverse digital content. Extending beyond content generation, in this paper, we propose a framework integrating generative diffusion models with reinforcement learning to address Lyapunov optimization problems in UAV-based LAE networking. We begin by introducing the fundamentals of Lyapunov optimization theory and analyzing the limitations of both conventional methods and traditional AI-enabled approaches. We then examine various GenAI models and comprehensively analyze their potential contributions to Lyapunov optimization. Subsequently, we develop a Lyapunov-guided generative diffusion model-based reinforcement learning framework and validate its effectiveness through a UAV-based LAE networking case study. Finally, we outline several directions for future research.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Data Influence in Meta Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As one of the most fundamental models, meta learning aims to effectively address few-shot learning challenges. However, it still faces significant issues related to the training data, such as training inefficiencies due to numerous low-contribution tasks in large datasets and substantial noise from incorrect labels. Thus, training data attribution methods are needed for meta learning. However, the dual-layer structure of mata learning complicates the modeling of training data contributions because of the interdependent influence between meta-parameters and task-specific parameters, making existing data influence evaluation tools inapplicable or inaccurate. To address these challenges, based on the influence function, we propose a general data attribution evaluation framework for meta-learning within the bilevel optimization framework. Our approach introduces task influence functions (task-IF) and instance influence functions (instance-IF) to accurately assess the impact of specific tasks and individual data points in closed forms. This framework comprehensively models data contributions across both the inner and outer training processes, capturing the direct effects of data points on meta-parameters as well as their indirect influence through task-specific parameters. We also provide several strategies to enhance computational efficiency and scalability. Experimental results demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in training data evaluation via several downstream tasks.</description>

      <title>Multi-View Attention Syntactic Enhanced Graph Convolutional Network for Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) is the task aimed at predicting the sentiment polarity of aspect words within sentences. Recently, incorporating graph neural networks (GNNs) to capture additional syntactic structure information in the dependency tree derived from syntactic dependency parsing has been proven to be an effective paradigm for boosting ABSA. Despite GNNs enhancing model capability by fusing more types of information, most works only utilize a single topology view of the dependency tree or simply conflate different perspectives of information without distinction, which limits the model performance. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose a new multi-view attention syntactic enhanced graph convolutional network (MASGCN) that weighs different syntactic information of views using attention mechanisms. Specifically, we first construct distance mask matrices from the dependency tree to obtain multiple subgraph views for GNNs. To aggregate features from different views, we propose a multi-view attention mechanism to calculate the attention weights of views. Furthermore, to incorporate more syntactic information, we fuse the dependency type information matrix into the adjacency matrices and present a structural entropy loss to learn the dependency type adjacency matrix. Comprehensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods. The codes and datasets are available at https://github.com/SELGroup/MASGCN.</description>

      <title>An Explainable Disease Surveillance System for Early Prediction of Multiple Chronic Diseases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study addresses a critical gap in the healthcare system by developing a clinically meaningful, practical, and explainable disease surveillance system for multiple chronic diseases, utilizing routine EHR data from multiple U.S. practices integrated with CureMD's EMR/EHR system. Unlike traditional systems--using AI models that rely on features from patients' labs--our approach focuses on routinely available data, such as medical history, vitals, diagnoses, and medications, to preemptively assess the risks of chronic diseases in the next year. We trained three distinct models for each chronic disease: prediction models that forecast the risk of a disease 3, 6, and 12 months before a potential diagnosis. We developed Random Forest models, which were internally validated using F1 scores and AUROC as performance metrics and further evaluated by a panel of expert physicians for clinical relevance based on inferences grounded in medical knowledge. Additionally, we discuss our implementation of integrating these models into a practical EMR system. Beyond using Shapley attributes and surrogate models for explainability, we also introduce a new rule-engineering framework to enhance the intrinsic explainability of Random Forests.</description>

      <title>MultiPDENet: PDE-embedded Learning with Multi-time-stepping for Accelerated Flow Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solving partial differential equations (PDEs) by numerical methods meet computational cost challenge for getting the accurate solution since fine grids and small time steps are required. Machine learning can accelerate this process, but struggle with weak generalizability, interpretability, and data dependency, as well as suffer in long-term prediction. To this end, we propose a PDE-embedded network with multiscale time stepping (MultiPDENet), which fuses the scheme of numerical methods and machine learning, for accelerated simulation of flows. In particular, we design a convolutional filter based on the structure of finite difference stencils with a small number of parameters to optimize, which estimates the equivalent form of spatial derivative on a coarse grid to minimize the equation's residual. A Physics Block with a 4th-order Runge-Kutta integrator at the fine time scale is established that embeds the structure of PDEs to guide the prediction. To alleviate the curse of temporal error accumulation in long-term prediction, we introduce a multiscale time integration approach, where a neural network is used to correct the prediction error at a coarse time scale. Experiments across various PDE systems, including the Navier-Stokes equations, demonstrate that MultiPDENet can accurately predict long-term spatiotemporal dynamics, even given small and incomplete training data, e.g., spatiotemporally down-sampled datasets. MultiPDENet achieves the state-of-the-art performance compared with other neural baseline models, also with clear speedup compared to classical numerical methods.</description>

      <title>Controllable Forgetting Mechanism for Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Class-incremental learning in the context of limited personal labeled samples (few-shot) is critical for numerous real-world applications, such as smart home devices. A key challenge in these scenarios is balancing the trade-off between adapting to new, personalized classes and maintaining the performance of the model on the original, base classes. Fine-tuning the model on novel classes often leads to the phenomenon of catastrophic forgetting, where the accuracy of base classes declines unpredictably and significantly. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective mechanism to address this challenge by controlling the trade-off between novel and base class accuracy. We specifically target the ultra-low-shot scenario, where only a single example is available per novel class. Our approach introduces a Novel Class Detection (NCD) rule, which adjusts the degree of forgetting a priori while simultaneously enhancing performance on novel classes. We demonstrate the versatility of our solution by applying it to state-of-the-art Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) methods, showing consistent improvements across different settings. To better quantify the trade-off between novel and base class performance, we introduce new metrics: NCR@2FOR and NCR@5FOR. Our approach achieves up to a 30% improvement in novel class accuracy on the CIFAR100 dataset (1-shot, 1 novel class) while maintaining a controlled base class forgetting rate of 2%.</description>

      <title>FDLLM: A Text Fingerprint Detection Method for LLMs in Multi-Language, Multi-Domain Black-Box Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using large language models (LLMs) integration platforms without transparency about which LLM is being invoked can lead to potential security risks. Specifically, attackers may exploit this black-box scenario to deploy malicious models and embed viruses in the code provided to users. In this context, it is increasingly urgent for users to clearly identify the LLM they are interacting with, in order to avoid unknowingly becoming victims of malicious models. However, existing studies primarily focus on mixed classification of human and machine-generated text, with limited attention to classifying texts generated solely by different models. Current research also faces dual bottlenecks: poor quality of LLM-generated text (LLMGT) datasets and limited coverage of detectable LLMs, resulting in poor detection performance for various LLMGT in black-box scenarios. We propose the first LLMGT fingerprint detection model, \textbf{FDLLM}, based on Qwen2.5-7B and fine-tuned using LoRA to address these challenges. FDLLM can more efficiently handle detection tasks across multilingual and multi-domain scenarios. Furthermore, we constructed a dataset named \textbf{FD-Datasets}, consisting of 90,000 samples that span multiple languages and domains, covering 20 different LLMs. Experimental results demonstrate that FDLLM achieves a macro F1 score 16.7\% higher than the best baseline method, LM-D.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Protecting online privacy requires users to engage with and comprehend website privacy policies, but many policies are difficult and tedious to read. We present PRISMe (Privacy Risk Information Scanner for Me), a novel Large Language Model (LLM)-driven privacy policy assessment tool, which helps users to understand the essence of a lengthy, complex privacy policy while browsing. The tool, a browser extension, integrates a dashboard and an LLM chat. One major contribution is the first rigorous evaluation of such a tool. In a mixed-methods user study (N=22), we evaluate PRISMe's efficiency, usability, understandability of the provided information, and impacts on awareness. While our tool improves privacy awareness by providing a comprehensible quick overview and a quality chat for in-depth discussion, users note issues with consistency and building trust in the tool. From our insights, we derive important design implications to guide future policy analysis tools.</description>

      <title>Skeleton-Guided-Translation: A Benchmarking Framework for Code Repository Translation with Fine-Grained Quality Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advancement of large language models has intensified the need to modernize enterprise applications and migrate legacy systems to secure, versatile languages. However, existing code translation benchmarks primarily focus on individual functions, overlooking the complexities involved in translating entire repositories, such as maintaining inter-module coherence and managing dependencies. While some recent repository-level translation benchmarks attempt to address these challenges, they still face limitations, including poor maintainability and overly coarse evaluation granularity, which make them less developer-friendly. We introduce Skeleton-Guided-Translation, a framework for repository-level Java to C# code translation with fine-grained quality evaluation. It uses a two-step process: first translating the repository's structural "skeletons", then translating the full repository guided by these skeletons. Building on this, we present TRANSREPO-BENCH, a benchmark of high quality open-source Java repositories and their corresponding C# skeletons, including matching unit tests and build configurations. Our unit tests are fixed and can be applied across multiple or incremental translations without manual adjustments, enhancing automation and scalability in evaluations. Additionally, we develop fine-grained evaluation metrics that assess translation quality at the individual test case level, addressing traditional binary metrics' inability to distinguish when build failures cause all tests to fail. Evaluations using TRANSREPO-BENCH highlight key challenges and advance more accurate repository level code translation.</description>

      <title>The Unbearable Lightness of Prompting: A Critical Reflection on the Environmental Impact of genAI use in Design Education</title>

Abstract: Design educators are finding ways to support students in skillfully using GenAI tools in their practices while encouraging the critical scrutiny of the ethical and social issues around these technologies. However, the issue of environmental sustainability remains unaddressed. There is a lack of both resources to grasp the environmental costs of genAI in education and a lack of shared practices for engaging with the issue. This paper critically reflects on the energy costs of using genAI in design education, using a workshop held in 2023 with 49 students as a motivating example. Through this reflection, we develop a set of five alternative stances, with related actions, that support the conscious use of genAI in design education. The work contributes to the field of design and HCI by bringing together ways for educators to reflect on their practices, informing the future development of educational programs around genAI.</description>

      <title>PISCO: Pretty Simple Compression for Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines enhance Large Language Models (LLMs) by retrieving relevant documents, but they face scalability issues due to high inference costs and limited context size. Document compression is a practical solution, but current soft compression methods suffer from accuracy losses and require extensive pretraining. In this paper, we introduce PISCO, a novel method that achieves a 16x compression rate with minimal accuracy loss (0-3%) across diverse RAG-based question-answering (QA) tasks. Unlike existing approaches, PISCO requires no pretraining or annotated data, relying solely on sequence-level knowledge distillation from document-based questions. With the ability to fine-tune a 7-10B LLM in 48 hours on a single A100 GPU, PISCO offers a highly efficient and scalable solution. We present comprehensive experiments showing that PISCO outperforms existing compression models by 8% in accuracy.</description>

Abstract: Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) aims to identify four sentiment elements, including aspect term, aspect category, opinion term, and sentiment polarity. These elements construct the complete picture of sentiments. The most challenging task, aspect sentiment quad prediction (ASQP), predicts these elements simultaneously, hindered by difficulties in accurately coupling different sentiment elements. A key challenge is insufficient annotated data that limits the capability of models in semantic understanding and reasoning about quad prediction. To address this, we propose stepwise task augmentation and relation learning (STAR), a strategy inspired by human reasoning. STAR constructs auxiliary data to learn quadruple relationships incrementally by augmenting with pairwise and overall relation tasks derived from training data. By encouraging the model to infer causal relationships among sentiment elements without requiring additional annotations, STAR effectively enhances quad prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate the proposed STAR exhibits superior performance on four benchmark datasets.</description>

      <title>Automated Detection of Sport Highlights from Audio and Video Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents a novel Deep Learning-based and lightweight approach for the automated detection of sports highlights (HLs) from audio and video sources. HL detection is a key task in sports video analysis, traditionally requiring significant human effort. Our solution leverages Deep Learning (DL) models trained on relatively small datasets of audio Mel-spectrograms and grayscale video frames, achieving promising accuracy rates of 89% and 83% for audio and video detection, respectively. The use of small datasets, combined with simple architectures, demonstrates the practicality of our method for fast and cost-effective deployment. Furthermore, an ensemble model combining both modalities shows improved robustness against false positives and false negatives. The proposed methodology offers a scalable solution for automated HL detection across various types of sports video content, reducing the need for manual intervention. Future work will focus on enhancing model architectures and extending this approach to broader scene-detection tasks in media analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) promises a framework for near-universal problem-solving. In practice however, RL algorithms are often tailored to specific benchmarks, relying on carefully tuned hyperparameters and algorithmic choices. Recently, powerful model-based RL methods have shown impressive general results across benchmarks but come at the cost of increased complexity and slow run times, limiting their broader applicability. In this paper, we attempt to find a unifying model-free deep RL algorithm that can address a diverse class of domains and problem settings. To achieve this, we leverage model-based representations that approximately linearize the value function, taking advantage of the denser task objectives used by model-based RL while avoiding the costs associated with planning or simulated trajectories. We evaluate our algorithm, MR.Q, on a variety of common RL benchmarks with a single set of hyperparameters and show a competitive performance against domain-specific and general baselines, providing a concrete step towards building general-purpose model-free deep RL algorithms.</description>

      <title>Toward Efficient Generalization in 3D Human Pose Estimation via a Canonical Domain Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in deep learning methods have significantly improved the performance of 3D Human Pose Estimation (HPE). However, performance degradation caused by domain gaps between source and target domains remains a major challenge to generalization, necessitating extensive data augmentation and/or fine-tuning for each specific target domain. To address this issue more efficiently, we propose a novel canonical domain approach that maps both the source and target domains into a unified canonical domain, alleviating the need for additional fine-tuning in the target domain. To construct the canonical domain, we introduce a canonicalization process to generate a novel canonical 2D-3D pose mapping that ensures 2D-3D pose consistency and simplifies 2D-3D pose patterns, enabling more efficient training of lifting networks. The canonicalization of both domains is achieved through the following steps: (1) in the source domain, the lifting network is trained within the canonical domain; (2) in the target domain, input 2D poses are canonicalized prior to inference by leveraging the properties of perspective projection and known camera intrinsics. Consequently, the trained network can be directly applied to the target domain without requiring additional fine-tuning. Experiments conducted with various lifting networks and publicly available datasets (e.g., Human3.6M, Fit3D, MPI-INF-3DHP) demonstrate that the proposed method substantially improves generalization capability across datasets while using the same data volume.</description>

      <title>AdaCoT: Rethinking Cross-Lingual Factual Reasoning through Adaptive Chain-of-Thought</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive multilingual capabilities through pretraining on diverse corpora. While these models show strong reasoning abilities, their performance varies significantly across languages due to uneven training data distribution. Existing approaches using machine translation, and extensive multilingual pretraining and cross-lingual tuning face scalability challenges and often fail to capture nuanced reasoning processes across languages. In this paper, we introduce AdaCoT (Adaptive Chain-of-Thought), a framework that enhances multilingual reasoning by dynamically routing thought processes through intermediary "thinking languages" before generating target-language responses. AdaCoT leverages a language-agnostic core and incorporates an adaptive, reward-based mechanism for selecting optimal reasoning pathways without requiring additional pretraining. Our comprehensive evaluation across multiple benchmarks demonstrates substantial improvements in both factual reasoning quality and cross-lingual consistency, with particularly strong performance gains in low-resource language settings. The results suggest that adaptive reasoning paths can effectively bridge the performance gap between high and low-resource languages while maintaining cultural and linguistic nuances.</description>

      <title>Measuring Heterogeneity in Machine Learning with Distributed Energy Distance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In distributed and federated learning, heterogeneity across data sources remains a major obstacle to effective model aggregation and convergence. We focus on feature heterogeneity and introduce energy distance as a sensitive measure for quantifying distributional discrepancies. While we show that energy distance is robust for detecting data distribution shifts, its direct use in large-scale systems can be prohibitively expensive. To address this, we develop Taylor approximations that preserve key theoretical quantitative properties while reducing computational overhead. Through simulation studies, we show how accurately capturing feature discrepancies boosts convergence in distributed learning. Finally, we propose a novel application of energy distance to assign penalty weights for aligning predictions across heterogeneous nodes, ultimately enhancing coordination in federated and distributed settings.</description>

      <title>BAG: Body-Aligned 3D Wearable Asset Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While recent advancements have shown remarkable progress in general 3D shape generation models, the challenge of leveraging these approaches to automatically generate wearable 3D assets remains unexplored. To this end, we present BAG, a Body-aligned Asset Generation method to output 3D wearable asset that can be automatically dressed on given 3D human bodies. This is achived by controlling the 3D generation process using human body shape and pose information. Specifically, we first build a general single-image to consistent multiview image diffusion model, and train it on the large Objaverse dataset to achieve diversity and generalizability. Then we train a Controlnet to guide the multiview generator to produce body-aligned multiview images. The control signal utilizes the multiview 2D projections of the target human body, where pixel values represent the XYZ coordinates of the body surface in a canonical space. The body-conditioned multiview diffusion generates body-aligned multiview images, which are then fed into a native 3D diffusion model to produce the 3D shape of the asset. Finally, by recovering the similarity transformation using multiview silhouette supervision and addressing asset-body penetration with physics simulators, the 3D asset can be accurately fitted onto the target human body. Experimental results demonstrate significant advantages over existing methods in terms of image prompt-following capability, shape diversity, and shape quality.

      <title>The Linear Attention Resurrection in Vision Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have recently taken computer vision by storm. However, the softmax attention underlying ViTs comes with a quadratic complexity in time and memory, hindering the application of ViTs to high-resolution images. We revisit the attention design and propose a linear attention method to address the limitation, which doesn't sacrifice ViT's core advantage of capturing global representation like existing methods (e.g. local window attention of Swin). We further investigate the key difference between linear attention and softmax attention. Our empirical results suggest that linear attention lacks a fundamental property of concentrating the distribution of the attention matrix. Inspired by this observation, we introduce a local concentration module to enhance linear attention. By incorporating enhanced linear global attention and local window attention, we propose a new ViT architecture, dubbed L$^2$ViT. Notably, L$^2$ViT can effectively capture both global interactions and local representations while enjoying linear computational complexity. Extensive experiments demonstrate the strong performance of L$^2$ViT. On image classification, L$^2$ViT achieves 84.4% Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K without any extra training data or label. By further pre-training on ImageNet-22k, it attains 87.0% when fine-tuned with resolution 384$^2$. For downstream tasks, L$^2$ViT delivers favorable performance as a backbone on object detection as well as semantic segmentation.</description>

      <title>Raiders of the Lost Dependency: Fixing Dependency Conflicts in Python using LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fixing Python dependency issues is a tedious and error-prone task for developers, who must manually identify and resolve environment dependencies and version constraints of third-party modules and Python interpreters. Researchers have attempted to automate this process by relying on large knowledge graphs and database lookup tables. However, these traditional approaches face limitations due to the variety of dependency error types, large sets of possible module versions, and conflicts among transitive dependencies. This study explores the potential of using large language models (LLMs) to automatically fix dependency issues in Python programs. We introduce PLLM (pronounced "plum"), a novel technique that employs retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to help an LLM infer Python versions and required modules for a given Python file. PLLM builds a testing environment that iteratively (1) prompts the LLM for module combinations, (2) tests the suggested changes, and (3) provides feedback (error messages) to the LLM to refine the fix. This feedback cycle leverages natural language processing (NLP) to intelligently parse and interpret build error messages. We benchmark PLLM on the Gistable HG2.9K dataset, a collection of challenging single-file Python gists. We compare PLLM against two state-of-the-art automatic dependency inference approaches, namely PyEGo and ReadPyE, w.r.t. the ability to resolve dependency issues. Our results indicate that PLLM can fix more dependency issues than the two baselines, with +218 (+15.97%) more fixes over ReadPyE and +281 (+21.58%) over PyEGo. Our deeper analyses suggest that PLLM is particularly beneficial for projects with many dependencies and for specific third-party numerical and machine-learning modules. Our findings demonstrate the potential of LLM-based approaches to iteratively resolve Python dependency issues.</description>

      <title>UDBE: Unsupervised Diffusion-based Brightness Enhancement in Underwater Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Activities in underwater environments are paramount in several scenarios, which drives the continuous development of underwater image enhancement techniques. A major challenge in this domain is the depth at which images are captured, with increasing depth resulting in a darker environment. Most existing methods for underwater image enhancement focus on noise removal and color adjustment, with few works dedicated to brightness enhancement. This work introduces a novel unsupervised learning approach to underwater image enhancement using a diffusion model. Our method, called UDBE, is based on conditional diffusion to maintain the brightness details of the unpaired input images. The input image is combined with a color map and a Signal-Noise Relation map (SNR) to ensure stable training and prevent color distortion in the output images. The results demonstrate that our approach achieves an impressive accuracy rate in the datasets UIEB, SUIM and RUIE, well-established underwater image benchmarks. Additionally, the experiments validate the robustness of our approach, regarding the image quality metrics PSNR, SSIM, UIQM, and UISM, indicating the good performance of the brightness enhancement process.

      <description>arXiv:2501.16224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many important scientific problems involve multivariate optimization coupled with slow and laborious experimental measurements. These complex, high-dimensional searches can be defined by non-convex optimization landscapes that resemble needle-in-a-haystack surfaces, leading to entrapment in local minima. Contextualizing optimizers with human domain knowledge is a powerful approach to guide searches to localized fruitful regions. However, this approach is susceptible to human confirmation bias and it is also challenging for domain experts to keep track of the rapidly expanding scientific literature. Here, we propose the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for contextualizing Bayesian optimization (BO) via a hybrid optimization framework that intelligently and economically blends stochastic inference with domain knowledge-based insights from the LLM, which is used to suggest new, better-performing areas of the search space for exploration. Our method fosters user engagement by offering real-time commentary on the optimization progress, explaining the reasoning behind the search strategies. We validate the effectiveness of our approach on synthetic benchmarks with up to 15 independent variables and demonstrate the ability of LLMs to reason in four real-world experimental tasks where context-aware suggestions boost optimization performance substantially.</description>

Abstract: We address the problem of quantum reinforcement learning (QRL) under model-free settings with quantum oracle access to the Markov Decision Process (MDP). This paper introduces a Quantum Natural Policy Gradient (QNPG) algorithm, which replaces the random sampling used in classical Natural Policy Gradient (NPG) estimators with a deterministic gradient estimation approach, enabling seamless integration into quantum systems. While this modification introduces a bounded bias in the estimator, the bias decays exponentially with increasing truncation levels. This paper demonstrates that the proposed QNPG algorithm achieves a sample complexity of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-1.5})$ for queries to the quantum oracle, significantly improving the classical lower bound of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-2})$ for queries to the MDP.</description>

      <title>Lightweight Weighted Average Ensemble Model for Pneumonia Detection in Chest X-Ray Images</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pneumonia is a leading cause of illness and death in children, underscoring the need for early and accurate detection. In this study, we propose a novel lightweight ensemble model for detecting pneumonia in children using chest X-ray images. This ensemble model integrates two pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs), MobileNetV2 and NASNetMobile, selected for their balance of computational efficiency and accuracy. These models were fine-tuned on a pediatric chest X-ray dataset and combined to enhance classification performance. Our proposed ensemble model achieved a classification accuracy of 98.63%, significantly outperforming individual models such as MobileNetV2 (97.10%) and NASNetMobile(96.25%) in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Moreover, the ensemble model outperformed state-of-the-art architectures, including ResNet50, InceptionV3, and DenseNet201, while maintaining computational efficiency. The proposed lightweight ensemble model presents a highly effective and resource-efficient solution for pneumonia detection, making it particularly suitable for deployment in resource-constrained settings.</description>

      <title>From Molecules to Mixtures: Learning Representations of Olfactory Mixture Similarity using Inductive Biases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16271v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Olfaction -- how molecules are perceived as odors to humans -- remains poorly understood. Recently, the principal odor map (POM) was introduced to digitize the olfactory properties of single compounds. However, smells in real life are not pure single molecules, but complex mixtures of molecules, whose representations remain relatively under-explored. In this work, we introduce POMMix, an extension of the POM to represent mixtures. Our representation builds upon the symmetries of the problem space in a hierarchical manner: (1) graph neural networks for building molecular embeddings, (2) attention mechanisms for aggregating molecular representations into mixture representations, and (3) cosine prediction heads to encode olfactory perceptual distance in the mixture embedding space. POMMix achieves state-of-the-art predictive performance across multiple datasets. We also evaluate the generalizability of the representation on multiple splits when applied to unseen molecules and mixture sizes. Our work advances the effort to digitize olfaction, and highlights the synergy of domain expertise and deep learning in crafting expressive representations in low-data regimes.</description>

      <title>Return of the Encoder: Maximizing Parameter Efficiency for SLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dominance of large decoder-only language models has overshadowed encoder-decoder architectures, despite their fundamental efficiency advantages in sequence processing. For small language models (SLMs) - those with 1 billion parameters or fewer - our systematic analysis across GPU, CPU, and NPU platforms reveals that encoder-decoder architectures achieve 47% lower first-token latency and 4.7x higher throughput compared to decoder-only models on edge devices. These gains may be attributed to encoder-decoder's one-time input processing and efficient separation of understanding and generation phases.
  We introduce a novel knowledge distillation framework that enables encoder-decoder models to leverage capabilities from large scalable decoder-only teachers while preserving their architectural advantages, achieving up to 6 average performance points improvement across diverse tasks, with significant gains in asymmetric sequence tasks where input and output distributions can benefit from different processing approaches.
  When combined with modern advances like Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE) and Vision encoders, our systematic investigation demonstrates that encoder-decoder architectures provide a more practical path toward deploying capable language models in resource-constrained environments. Our findings challenge the prevailing trend toward decoder-only scaling, showing that architectural choices become increasingly crucial as parameter budgets decrease, particularly for on-device and edge deployments where computational efficiency is paramount.</description>

      <title>What is Formal Verification without Specifications? A Survey on mining LTL Specifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Virtually all verification techniques using formal methods rely on the availability of a formal specification, which describes the design requirements precisely. However, formulating specifications remains a manual task that is notoriously challenging and error-prone. To address this bottleneck in formal verification, recent research has thus focussed on automatically generating specifications for formal verification from examples of (desired and undesired) system behavior. In this survey, we list and compare recent advances in mining specifications in Linear Temporal Logic (LTL), the de facto standard specification language for reactive systems. Several approaches have been designed for learning LTL formulas, which address different aspects and settings of specification design. Moreover, the approaches rely on a diverse range of techniques such as constraint solving, neural network training, enumerative search, etc. We survey the current state-of-the-art techniques and compare them for the convenience of the formal methods practitioners.</description>

      <title>Brain-Adapter: Enhancing Neurological Disorder Analysis with Adapter-Tuning Multimodal Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding brain disorders is crucial for accurate clinical diagnosis and treatment. Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offer a promising approach to interpreting medical images with the support of text descriptions. However, previous research has primarily focused on 2D medical images, leaving richer spatial information of 3D images under-explored, and single-modality-based methods are limited by overlooking the critical clinical information contained in other modalities. To address this issue, this paper proposes Brain-Adapter, a novel approach that incorporates an extra bottleneck layer to learn new knowledge and instill it into the original pre-trained knowledge. The major idea is to incorporate a lightweight bottleneck layer to train fewer parameters while capturing essential information and utilize a Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) strategy to align multimodal data within a unified representation space. Extensive experiments demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach in integrating multimodal data to significantly improve the diagnosis accuracy without high computational costs, highlighting the potential to enhance real-world diagnostic workflows.</description>

      <title>Upside Down Reinforcement Learning with Policy Generators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Upside Down Reinforcement Learning (UDRL) is a promising framework for solving reinforcement learning problems which focuses on learning command-conditioned policies. In this work, we extend UDRL to the task of learning a command-conditioned generator of deep neural network policies. We accomplish this using Hypernetworks - a variant of Fast Weight Programmers, which learn to decode input commands representing a desired expected return into command-specific weight matrices. Our method, dubbed Upside Down Reinforcement Learning with Policy Generators (UDRLPG), streamlines comparable techniques by removing the need for an evaluator or critic to update the weights of the generator. To counteract the increased variance in last returns caused by not having an evaluator, we decouple the sampling probability of the buffer from the absolute number of policies in it, which, together with a simple weighting strategy, improves the empirical convergence of the algorithm. Compared with existing algorithms, UDRLPG achieves competitive performance and high returns, sometimes outperforming more complex architectures. Our experiments show that a trained generator can generalize to create policies that achieve unseen returns zero-shot. The proposed method appears to be effective in mitigating some of the challenges associated with learning highly multimodal functions. Altogether, we believe that UDRLPG represents a promising step forward in achieving greater empirical sample efficiency in RL. A full implementation of UDRLPG is publicly available at https://github.com/JacopoD/udrlpg_</description>

      <title>Mixture-of-Mamba: Enhancing Multi-Modal State-Space Models with Modality-Aware Sparsity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs) have emerged as efficient alternatives to Transformers for sequential modeling, but their inability to leverage modality-specific features limits their performance in multi-modal pretraining. Here, we propose Mixture-of-Mamba, a novel SSM architecture that introduces modality-aware sparsity through modality-specific parameterization of the Mamba block. Building on Mixture-of-Transformers (W. Liang et al. arXiv:2411.04996; 2024), we extend the benefits of modality-aware sparsity to SSMs while preserving their computational efficiency. We evaluate Mixture-of-Mamba across three multi-modal pretraining settings: Transfusion (interleaved text and continuous image tokens with diffusion loss), Chameleon (interleaved text and discrete image tokens), and an extended three-modality framework incorporating speech. Mixture-of-Mamba consistently reaches the same loss values at earlier training steps with significantly reduced computational costs. In the Transfusion setting, Mixture-of-Mamba achieves equivalent image loss using only 34.76% of the training FLOPs at the 1.4B scale. In the Chameleon setting, Mixture-of-Mamba reaches similar image loss with just 42.50% of the FLOPs at the 1.4B scale, and similar text loss with just 65.40% of the FLOPs. In the three-modality setting, MoM matches speech loss at 24.80% of the FLOPs at the 1.4B scale. Our ablation study highlights the synergistic effects of decoupling projection components, where joint decoupling yields greater gains than individual modifications. These results establish modality-aware sparsity as a versatile and effective design principle, extending its impact from Transformers to SSMs and setting new benchmarks in multi-modal pretraining.

      <title>Large Models in Dialogue for Active Perception and Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous aerial monitoring is an important task aimed at gathering information from areas that may not be easily accessible by humans. At the same time, this task often requires recognizing anomalies from a significant distance or not previously encountered in the past. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that leverages the advanced capabilities provided by Large Language Models (LLMs) to actively collect information and perform anomaly detection in novel scenes. To this end, we propose an LLM based model dialogue approach, in which two deep learning models engage in a dialogue to actively control a drone to increase perception and anomaly detection accuracy. We conduct our experiments in a high fidelity simulation environment where an LLM is provided with a predetermined set of natural language movement commands mapped into executable code functions. Additionally, we deploy a multimodal Visual Question Answering (VQA) model charged with the task of visual question answering and captioning. By engaging the two models in conversation, the LLM asks exploratory questions while simultaneously flying a drone into different parts of the scene, providing a novel way to implement active perception. By leveraging LLMs reasoning ability, we output an improved detailed description of the scene going beyond existing static perception approaches. In addition to information gathering, our approach is utilized for anomaly detection and our results demonstrate the proposed methods effectiveness in informing and alerting about potential hazards.</description>

      <title>Evaluating The Performance of Using Large Language Models to Automate Summarization of CT Simulation Orders in Radiation Oncology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Purpose: This study aims to use a large language model (LLM) to automate the generation of summaries from the CT simulation orders and evaluate its performance.
  Materials and Methods: A total of 607 CT simulation orders for patients were collected from the Aria database at our institution. A locally hosted Llama 3.1 405B model, accessed via the Application Programming Interface (API) service, was used to extract keywords from the CT simulation orders and generate summaries. The downloaded CT simulation orders were categorized into seven groups based on treatment modalities and disease sites. For each group, a customized instruction prompt was developed collaboratively with therapists to guide the Llama 3.1 405B model in generating summaries. The ground truth for the corresponding summaries was manually derived by carefully reviewing each CT simulation order and subsequently verified by therapists. The accuracy of the LLM-generated summaries was evaluated by therapists using the verified ground truth as a reference.
  Results: About 98% of the LLM-generated summaries aligned with the manually generated ground truth in terms of accuracy. Our evaluations showed an improved consistency in format and enhanced readability of the LLM-generated summaries compared to the corresponding therapists-generated summaries. This automated approach demonstrated a consistent performance across all groups, regardless of modality or disease site.
  Conclusions: This study demonstrated the high precision and consistency of the Llama 3.1 405B model in extracting keywords and summarizing CT simulation orders, suggesting that LLMs have great potential to help with this task, reduce the workload of therapists and improve workflow efficiency.</description>

      <title>sDREAMER: Self-distilled Mixture-of-Modality-Experts Transformer for Automatic Sleep Staging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automatic sleep staging based on electroencephalography (EEG) and electromyography (EMG) signals is an important aspect of sleep-related research. Current sleep staging methods suffer from two major drawbacks. First, there are limited information interactions between modalities in the existing methods. Second, current methods do not develop unified models that can handle different sources of input. To address these issues, we propose a novel sleep stage scoring model sDREAMER, which emphasizes cross-modality interaction and per-channel performance. Specifically, we develop a mixture-of-modality-expert (MoME) model with three pathways for EEG, EMG, and mixed signals with partially shared weights. We further propose a self-distillation training scheme for further information interaction across modalities. Our model is trained with multi-channel inputs and can make classifications on either single-channel or multi-channel inputs. Experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms the existing transformer-based sleep scoring methods for multi-channel inference. For single-channel inference, our model also outperforms the transformer-based models trained with single-channel signals.</description>

      <title>RelightVid: Temporal-Consistent Diffusion Model for Video Relighting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable success in image generation and editing, with recent advancements enabling albedo-preserving image relighting. However, applying these models to video relighting remains challenging due to the lack of paired video relighting datasets and the high demands for output fidelity and temporal consistency, further complicated by the inherent randomness of diffusion models. To address these challenges, we introduce RelightVid, a flexible framework for video relighting that can accept background video, text prompts, or environment maps as relighting conditions. Trained on in-the-wild videos with carefully designed illumination augmentations and rendered videos under extreme dynamic lighting, RelightVid achieves arbitrary video relighting with high temporal consistency without intrinsic decomposition while preserving the illumination priors of its image backbone.</description>

      <title>Path Analysis for Effective Fault Localization in Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18987v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep learning has revolutionized numerous fields, yet the reliability of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) remains a concern due to their complexity and data dependency. Traditional software fault localization methods, such as Spectrum-based Fault Localization (SBFL), have been adapted for DNNs but often fall short in effectiveness. These methods typically overlook the propagation of faults through neural pathways, resulting in less precise fault detection. Research indicates that examining neural pathways, rather than individual neurons, is crucial because issues in one neuron can affect its entire pathway. By investigating these interconnected pathways, we can better identify and address problems arising from the collective activity of neurons. To address this limitation, we introduce the NP-SBFL method, which leverages Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) to identify essential faulty neural pathways. Our method explores multiple fault sources to accurately pinpoint faulty neurons by analyzing their interconnections. Additionally, our multi-stage gradient ascent (MGA) technique, an extension of gradient ascent (GA), enables sequential neuron activation to enhance fault detection. We evaluated NP-SBFL-MGA on the well-established MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, comparing it to other methods like DeepFault and NP-SBFL-GA, as well as three neuron measures: Tarantula, Ochiai, and Barinel. Our evaluation utilized all training and test samples (60,000 for MNIST and 50,000 for CIFAR-10) and revealed that NP-SBFL-MGA significantly outperformed the baselines in identifying suspicious pathways and generating adversarial inputs. Notably, Tarantula with NP-SBFL-MGA achieved a remarkable 96.75% fault detection rate compared to DeepFault's 89.90%. NP-SBFL-MGA highlights a strong correlation between critical path coverage and the number of failed tests in DNN fault localization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10883v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This systematic review assessed the current state and future prospects of artificial intelligence (AI) in schizophrenia rehabilitation management. We reviewed 61 studies on AI-related data types, feature engineering methods, algorithmic models, and evaluation metrics published from 2012-2024. The review categorizes AI applications into the following key application areas: symptom monitoring, medication management, risk management, functional training, and psychosocial support. Findings indicate that supervised machine learning techniques, particularly for symptom monitoring and relapse risk management, remain the predominant approaches, effectively leveraging structured data while incorporating interpretable algorithms. This study underscores the potential of AI in transforming long-term management strategies for schizophrenia, offering valuable insights into improving the quality of life of patients. Future research should focus on expanding data sources through multimodal data integration, exploring deep learning models, and integrating AI-driven interventions into training tasks to fully capitalize on AI's potential in schizophrenia rehabilitation.</description>

      <title>SyntheT2C: Generating Synthetic Data for Fine-Tuning Large Language Models on the Text2Cypher Task</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10710v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) with existing Knowledge Graph (KG) databases presents a promising avenue for enhancing LLMs' efficacy and mitigating their "hallucinations". Given that most KGs reside in graph databases accessible solely through specialized query languages (e.g., Cypher), it is critical to connect LLMs with KG databases by automating the translation of natural language into Cypher queries (termed as "Text2Cypher" task). Prior efforts tried to bolster LLMs' proficiency in Cypher generation through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). However, these explorations are hindered by the lack of annotated datasets of Query-Cypher pairs, resulting from the labor-intensive and domain-specific nature of such annotation. In this study, we propose SyntheT2C, a methodology for constructing a synthetic Query-Cypher pair dataset, comprising two distinct pipelines: (1) LLM-based prompting and (2) template-filling. SyntheT2C is applied to two medical KG databases, culminating in the creation of a synthetic dataset, MedT2C. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the MedT2C dataset effectively enhances the performance of backbone LLMs on Text2Cypher task via SFT. Both the SyntheT2C codebase and the MedT2C dataset are released in https://github.com/ZGChung/SyntheT2C.</description>

      <title>Explaining Decisions of Agents in Mixed-Motive Games</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15255v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, agents have become capable of communicating seamlessly via natural language and navigating in environments that involve cooperation and competition, a fact that can introduce social dilemmas. Due to the interleaving of cooperation and competition, understanding agents' decision-making in such environments is challenging, and humans can benefit from obtaining explanations. However, such environments and scenarios have rarely been explored in the context of explainable AI. While some explanation methods for cooperative environments can be applied in mixed-motive setups, they do not address inter-agent competition, cheap-talk, or implicit communication by actions. In this work, we design explanation methods to address these issues. Then, we proceed to establish generality and demonstrate the applicability of the methods to three games with vastly different properties. Lastly, we demonstrate the effectiveness and usefulness of the methods for humans in two mixed-motive games. The first is a challenging 7-player game called no-press Diplomacy. The second is a 3-player game inspired by the prisoner's dilemma, featuring communication in natural language.</description>

      <title>Conformalized Answer Set Prediction for Knowledge Graph Embedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08248v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Knowledge graph embeddings (KGE) apply machine learning methods on knowledge graphs (KGs) to provide non-classical reasoning capabilities based on similarities and analogies. The learned KG embeddings are typically used to answer queries by ranking all potential answers, but rankings often lack a meaningful probabilistic interpretation - lower-ranked answers do not necessarily have a lower probability of being true. This limitation makes it difficult to quantify uncertainty of model's predictions, posing challenges for the application of KGE methods in high-stakes domains like medicine. We address this issue by applying the theory of conformal prediction that allows generating answer sets, which contain the correct answer with probabilistic guarantees. We explain how conformal prediction can be used to generate such answer sets for link prediction tasks. Our empirical evaluation on four benchmark datasets using six representative KGE methods validates that the generated answer sets satisfy the probabilistic guarantees given by the theory of conformal prediction. We also demonstrate that the generated answer sets often have a sensible size and that the size adapts well with respect to the difficulty of the query.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08550v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel hierarchical framework for optimal transport (OT) using string diagrams, namely string diagrams of optimal transports. This framework reduces complex hierarchical OT problems to standard OT problems, allowing efficient synthesis of optimal hierarchical transportation plans. Our approach uses algebraic compositions of cost matrices to effectively model hierarchical structures. We also study an adversarial situation with multiple choices in the cost matrices, where we present a polynomial-time algorithm for a relaxation of the problem. Experimental results confirm the efficiency and performance advantages of our proposed algorithm over the naive method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10932v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has experienced significant advancement over the past decade, prompting a growing interest in applications within finance. This survey critically evaluates 167 publications, exploring diverse RL applications and frameworks in finance. Financial markets, marked by their complexity, multi-agent nature, information asymmetry, and inherent randomness, serve as an intriguing test-bed for RL. Traditional finance offers certain solutions, and RL advances these with a more dynamic approach, incorporating machine learning methods, including transfer learning, meta-learning, and multi-agent solutions. This survey dissects key RL components through the lens of Quantitative Finance. We uncover emerging themes, propose areas for future research, and critique the strengths and weaknesses of existing methods.</description>

      <title>GRATR: Zero-Shot Evidence Graph Retrieval-Augmented Trustworthiness Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12333v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Trustworthiness reasoning aims to enable agents in multiplayer games with incomplete information to identify potential allies and adversaries, thereby enhancing decision-making. In this paper, we introduce the graph retrieval-augmented trustworthiness reasoning (GRATR) framework, which retrieves observable evidence from the game environment to inform decision-making by large language models (LLMs) without requiring additional training, making it a zero-shot approach. Within the GRATR framework, agents first observe the actions of other players and evaluate the resulting shifts in inter-player trust, constructing a corresponding trustworthiness graph. During decision-making, the agent performs multi-hop retrieval to evaluate trustworthiness toward a specific target, where evidence chains are retrieved from multiple trusted sources to form a comprehensive assessment. Experiments in the multiplayer game \emph{Werewolf} demonstrate that GRATR outperforms the alternatives, improving reasoning accuracy by 50.5\% and reducing hallucination by 30.6\% compared to the baseline method. Additionally, when tested on a dataset of Twitter tweets during the U.S. election period, GRATR surpasses the baseline method by 10.4\% in accuracy, highlighting its potential in real-world applications such as intent analysis.</description>

      <title>Natural Language Counterfactual Explanations for Graphs Using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09295v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has emerged as a critical area of research to unravel the opaque inner logic of (deep) machine learning models. Among the various XAI techniques proposed in the literature, counterfactual explanations stand out as one of the most promising approaches. However, these "what-if" explanations are frequently complex and technical, making them difficult for non-experts to understand and, more broadly, challenging for humans to interpret. To bridge this gap, in this work, we exploit the power of open-source Large Language Models to generate natural language explanations when prompted with valid counterfactual instances produced by state-of-the-art explainers for graph-based models. Experiments across several graph datasets and counterfactual explainers show that our approach effectively produces accurate natural language representations of counterfactual instances, as demonstrated by key performance metrics.</description>

      <title>Large Language Model-based Augmentation for Imbalanced Node Classification on Text-Attributed Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16882v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Node classification on graphs often suffers from class imbalance, leading to biased predictions and significant risks in real-world applications. While data-centric solutions have been explored, they largely overlook Text-Attributed Graphs (TAGs) and the potential of using rich textual semantics to improve the classification of minority nodes. Given this gap, we propose Large Language Model-based Augmentation on Text-Attributed Graphs (LA-TAG), a novel framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to handle imbalanced node classification. Specifically, we develop prompting strategies inspired by interpolation to synthesize textual node attributes. Additionally, to effectively integrate synthetic nodes into the graph structure, we introduce a textual link predictor that connects the generated nodes to the original graph, preserving structural and contextual information. Experiments across various datasets and evaluation metrics demonstrate that LA-TAG outperforms existing textual augmentation and graph imbalance learning methods, emphasizing the efficacy of our approach in addressing class imbalance in TAGs.</description>

      <title>Knowledge Graph Enhanced Language Agents for Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19627v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Language agents have recently been used to simulate human behavior and user-item interactions for recommendation systems. However, current language agent simulations do not understand the relationships between users and items, leading to inaccurate user profiles and ineffective recommendations. In this work, we explore the utility of Knowledge Graphs (KGs), which contain extensive and reliable relationships between users and items, for recommendation. Our key insight is that the paths in a KG can capture complex relationships between users and items, eliciting the underlying reasons for user preferences and enriching user profiles. Leveraging this insight, we propose Knowledge Graph Enhanced Language Agents(KGLA), a framework that unifies language agents and KG for recommendation systems. In the simulated recommendation scenario, we position the user and item within the KG and integrate KG paths as natural language descriptions into the simulation. This allows language agents to interact with each other and discover sufficient rationale behind their interactions, making the simulation more accurate and aligned with real-world cases, thus improving recommendation performance. Our experimental results show that KGLA significantly improves recommendation performance (with a 33%-95% boost in NDCG@1 among three widely used benchmarks) compared to the previous best baseline method.</description>

      <title>A Methodology for Incompleteness-Tolerant and Modular Gradual Semantics for Argumentative Statement Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22209v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gradual semantics (GS) have demonstrated great potential in argumentation, in particular for deploying quantitative bipolar argumentation frameworks (QBAFs) in a number of real-world settings, from judgmental forecasting to explainable AI. In this paper, we provide a novel methodology for obtaining GS for statement graphs, a form of structured argumentation framework, where arguments and relations between them are built from logical statements. Our methodology differs from existing approaches in the literature in two main ways. First, it naturally accommodates incomplete information, so that arguments with partially specified premises can play a meaningful role in the evaluation. Second, it is modularly defined to leverage on any GS for QBAFs. We also define a set of novel properties for our GS and study their suitability alongside a set of existing properties (adapted to our setting) for two instantiations of our GS, demonstrating their advantages over existing approaches.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Bradley-Terry Models in Preference-Based Reward Modeling: Foundations, Theory, and Alternatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04991v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Bradley-Terry (BT) model is a common and successful practice in reward modeling for Large Language Model (LLM) alignment. However, it remains unclear why this model -- originally developed for multi-player stochastic game matching -- can be adopted to convert pairwise response comparisons to reward values and make predictions. Especially given the fact that only a limited number of prompt-response pairs are sparsely compared with others. In this paper, we first revisit the foundations of using BT models in reward modeling, and establish the convergence rate of BT reward models based on deep neural networks using embeddings, providing a theoretical foundation for their use. Despite theoretically sound, we argue that the BT model is not a necessary choice from the perspective of downstream optimization. This is because a reward model only needs to preserve the correct ranking predictions through a monotonic transformation of the true reward. We highlight the critical concept of order consistency in reward modeling and demonstrate that the BT model possesses this property. Consequently, we propose a simple and straightforward upper-bound algorithm, compatible with off-the-shelf binary classifiers, as an alternative order-consistent reward modeling objective. To offer practical insights, we empirically evaluate the performance of these different reward modeling approaches across more than 12,000 experimental setups, using $6$ base LLMs, $2$ datasets, and diverse annotation designs that vary in quantity, quality, and pairing choices in preference annotations.</description>

Abstract: To address the sycophancy problem caused by reinforcement learning from human feedback in large language models, this research applies synthetic data intervention technology to the decoder-only transformer architecture. Based on the research gaps in the existing literature, the researcher designed an experimental process to reduce the tendency of models to cater by generating diversified data, and used GPT4o as an experimental tool for verification. The experiment used 100 true and false questions, and compared the performance of the model trained with synthetic data intervention and the original untrained model on multiple indicators. The results show that the SDI training model supports the technology in terms of accuracy rate and sycophancy rate and has significant effectiveness in reducing sycophancy phenomena.</description>

      <title>SNN-Based Online Learning of Concepts and Action Laws in an Open World</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12308v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the architecture of a fully autonomous, bio-inspired cognitive agent built around a spiking neural network (SNN) implementing the agent's semantic memory. The agent explores its universe and learns concepts of objects/situations and of its own actions in a one-shot manner. While object/situation concepts are unary, action concepts are triples made up of an initial situation, a motor activity, and an outcome. They embody the agent's knowledge of its universe's actions laws. Both kinds of concepts have different degrees of generality. To make decisions the agent queries its semantic memory for the expected outcomes of envisaged actions and chooses the action to take on the basis of these predictions. Our experiments show that the agent handles new situations by appealing to previously learned general concepts and rapidly modifies its concepts to adapt to environment changes.</description>

Abstract: Efficiently deploying large language models (LLMs) in real-world scenarios remains a critical challenge, primarily due to hardware heterogeneity, inference framework limitations, and workload complexities.Efficiently deploying large language models (LLMs) in real-world scenarios remains a critical challenge, primarily due to hardware heterogeneity, inference framework limitations, and workload complexities. These challenges often lead to inefficiencies in memory utilization, latency, and throughput, hindering the effective deployment of LLMs, especially for non-experts. Through extensive experiments, we identify key performance bottlenecks, including sudden drops in memory utilization, latency fluctuations with varying batch sizes, and inefficiencies in multi-GPU configurations. These insights reveal a vast optimization space shaped by the intricate interplay of hardware, frameworks, and workload parameters. This underscores the need for a systematic approach to optimize LLM inference, motivating the design of our framework, GUIDE. GUIDE leverages dynamic modeling and simulation-based optimization to address these issues, achieving prediction errors between 9.9% and 42.3% for key metrics such as batch latency, TTFT, and decode throughput. By effectively bridging the gap between theoretical performance and practical deployment, our framework empowers practitioners, particularly non-specialists, to make data-driven decisions and unlock the full potential of LLMs in heterogeneous environments cheaply.</description>

      <title>MiniRAG: Towards Extremely Simple Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06713v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The growing demand for efficient and lightweight Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems has highlighted significant challenges when deploying Small Language Models (SLMs) in existing RAG frameworks. Current approaches face severe performance degradation due to SLMs' limited semantic understanding and text processing capabilities, creating barriers for widespread adoption in resource-constrained scenarios. To address these fundamental limitations, we present MiniRAG, a novel RAG system designed for extreme simplicity and efficiency. MiniRAG introduces two key technical innovations: (1) a semantic-aware heterogeneous graph indexing mechanism that combines text chunks and named entities in a unified structure, reducing reliance on complex semantic understanding, and (2) a lightweight topology-enhanced retrieval approach that leverages graph structures for efficient knowledge discovery without requiring advanced language capabilities. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that MiniRAG achieves comparable performance to LLM-based methods even when using SLMs while requiring only 25\% of the storage space. Additionally, we contribute a comprehensive benchmark dataset for evaluating lightweight RAG systems under realistic on-device scenarios with complex queries. We fully open-source our implementation and datasets at: https://github.com/HKUDS/MiniRAG.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07468v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Healthcare systems worldwide face persistent challenges in efficiency, accessibility, and personalization. Powered by modern AI technologies such as multimodal large language models and world models, Embodied AI (EmAI) represents a transformative frontier, offering enhanced autonomy and the ability to interact with the physical world to address these challenges. As an interdisciplinary and rapidly evolving research domain, "EmAI in healthcare" spans diverse fields such as algorithms, robotics, and biomedicine. This complexity underscores the importance of timely reviews and analyses to track advancements, address challenges, and foster cross-disciplinary collaboration. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of the "brain" of EmAI for healthcare, wherein we introduce foundational AI algorithms for perception, actuation, planning, and memory, and focus on presenting the healthcare applications spanning clinical interventions, daily care &amp; companionship, infrastructure support, and biomedical research. Despite its promise, the development of EmAI for healthcare is hindered by critical challenges such as safety concerns, gaps between simulation platforms and real-world applications, the absence of standardized benchmarks, and uneven progress across interdisciplinary domains. We discuss the technical barriers and explore ethical considerations, offering a forward-looking perspective on the future of EmAI in healthcare. A hierarchical framework of intelligent levels for EmAI systems is also introduced to guide further development. By providing systematic insights, this work aims to inspire innovation and practical applications, paving the way for a new era of intelligent, patient-centered healthcare.</description>

      <title>Exploring the sustainable scaling of AI dilemma: A projective study of corporations' AI environmental impacts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14334v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid growth of artificial intelligence (AI), particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), has raised concerns regarding its global environmental impact that extends beyond greenhouse gas emissions to include consideration of hardware fabrication and end-of-life processes. The opacity from major providers hinders companies' abilities to evaluate their AI-related environmental impacts and achieve net-zero targets.
  In this paper, we propose a methodology to estimate the environmental impact of a company's AI portfolio, providing actionable insights without necessitating extensive AI and Life-Cycle Assessment (LCA) expertise. Results confirm that large generative AI models consume up to 4600x more energy than traditional models. Our modelling approach, which accounts for increased AI usage, hardware computing efficiency, and changes in electricity mix in line with IPCC scenarios, forecasts AI electricity use up to 2030. Under a high adoption scenario, driven by widespread Generative AI and agents adoption associated to increasingly complex models and frameworks, AI electricity use is projected to rise by a factor of 24.4.
  Mitigating the environmental impact of Generative AI by 2030 requires coordinated efforts across the AI value chain. Isolated measures in hardware efficiency, model efficiency, or grid improvements alone are insufficient. We advocate for standardized environmental assessment frameworks, greater transparency from the all actors of the value chain and the introduction of a "Return on Environment" metric to align AI development with net-zero goals.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Structural-RNN for Robot Crowd Navigation with Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2011.04820v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Safe and efficient navigation through human crowds is an essential capability for mobile robots. Previous work on robot crowd navigation assumes that the dynamics of all agents are known and well-defined. In addition, the performance of previous methods deteriorates in partially observable environments and environments with dense crowds. To tackle these problems, we propose decentralized structural-Recurrent Neural Network (DS-RNN), a novel network that reasons about spatial and temporal relationships for robot decision making in crowd navigation. We train our network with model-free deep reinforcement learning without any expert supervision. We demonstrate that our model outperforms previous methods in challenging crowd navigation scenarios. We successfully transfer the policy learned in the simulator to a real-world TurtleBot 2i.

      <title>Fairness Amidst Non-IID Graph Data: A Literature Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.07170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.07170v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The growing importance of understanding and addressing algorithmic bias in artificial intelligence (AI) has led to a surge in research on AI fairness, which often assumes that the underlying data is independent and identically distributed (IID). However, real-world data frequently exists in non-IID graph structures that capture connections among individual units. To effectively mitigate bias in AI systems, it is essential to bridge the gap between traditional fairness literature, designed for IID data, and the prevalence of non-IID graph data. This survey reviews recent advancements in fairness amidst non-IID graph data, including the newly introduced fair graph generation and the commonly studied fair graph classification. In addition, available datasets and evaluation metrics for future research are identified, the limitations of existing work are highlighted, and promising future directions are proposed.</description>

      <title>Cardinality-Regularized Hawkes-Granger Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.10671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.10671v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new sparse Granger-causal learning framework for temporal event data. We focus on a specific class of point processes called the Hawkes process. We begin by pointing out that most of the existing sparse causal learning algorithms for the Hawkes process suffer from a singularity in maximum likelihood estimation. As a result, their sparse solutions can appear only as numerical artifacts. In this paper, we propose a mathematically well-defined sparse causal learning framework based on a cardinality-regularized Hawkes process, which remedies the pathological issues of existing approaches. We leverage the proposed algorithm for the task of instance-wise causal event analysis, where sparsity plays a critical role. We validate the proposed framework with two real use-cases, one from the power grid and the other from the cloud data center management domain.</description>

      <title>Collective Intelligence for 2D Push Manipulations with Mobile Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.15136v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While natural systems often present collective intelligence that allows them to self-organize and adapt to changes, the equivalent is missing in most artificial systems. We explore the possibility of such a system in the context of cooperative 2D push manipulations using mobile robots. Although conventional works demonstrate potential solutions for the problem in restricted settings, they have computational and learning difficulties. More importantly, these systems do not possess the ability to adapt when facing environmental changes. In this work, we show that by distilling a planner derived from a differentiable soft-body physics simulator into an attention-based neural network, our multi-robot push manipulation system achieves better performance than baselines. In addition, our system also generalizes to configurations not seen during training and is able to adapt toward task completions when external turbulence and environmental changes are applied.

      <title>Harnessing Contrastive Learning and Neural Transformation for Time Series Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.07898v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time series anomaly detection (TSAD) plays a vital role in many industrial applications. While contrastive learning has gained momentum in the time series domain for its prowess in extracting meaningful representations from unlabeled data, its straightforward application to anomaly detection is not without hurdles. Firstly, contrastive learning typically requires negative sampling to avoid the representation collapse issue, where the encoder converges to a constant solution. However, drawing from the same dataset for dissimilar samples is ill-suited for TSAD as most samples are ``normal'' in the training dataset. Secondly, conventional contrastive learning focuses on instance discrimination, which may overlook anomalies that are detectable when compared to their temporal context. In this study, we propose a novel approach, CNT, that incorporates a window-based contrastive learning strategy fortified with learnable transformations. This dual configuration focuses on capturing temporal anomalies in local regions while simultaneously mitigating the representation collapse issue. Our theoretical analysis validates the effectiveness of CNT in circumventing constant encoder solutions. Through extensive experiments on diverse real-world industrial datasets, we show the superiority of our framework by outperforming various baselines and model variants.</description>

      <title>SAMScore: A Content Structural Similarity Metric for Image Translation Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.15367v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Image translation has wide applications, such as style transfer and modality conversion, usually aiming to generate images having both high degrees of realism and faithfulness. These problems remain difficult, especially when it is important to preserve content structures. Traditional image-level similarity metrics are of limited use, since the content structures of an image are high-level, and not strongly governed by pixel-wise faithfulness to an original image. To fill this gap, we introduce SAMScore, a generic content structural similarity metric for evaluating the faithfulness of image translation models. SAMScore is based on the recent high-performance Segment Anything Model (SAM), which allows content similarity comparisons with standout accuracy. We applied SAMScore on 19 image translation tasks, and found that it is able to outperform all other competitive metrics on all tasks. We envision that SAMScore will prove to be a valuable tool that will help to drive the vibrant field of image translation, by allowing for more precise evaluations of new and evolving translation models. The code is available at https://github.com/Kent0n-Li/SAMScore.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Noise-Robust Losses for Large-Scale Noisy Data Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.05497v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large annotated datasets inevitably contain noisy labels, which poses a major challenge for training deep neural networks as they easily memorize the labels. Noise-robust loss functions have emerged as a notable strategy to counteract this issue, but it remains challenging to create a robust loss function which is not susceptible to underfitting. Through a quantitative approach, this paper explores the limited overlap between the network output at initialization and regions of non-vanishing gradients of bounded loss functions in the initial learning phase. Using these insights, we address underfitting of several noise robust losses with a novel method denoted as logit bias, which adds a real number $\epsilon$ to the logit at the position of the correct class. The logit bias enables these losses to achieve state-of-the-art results, even on datasets like WebVision, consisting of over a million images from 1000 classes. In addition, we demonstrate that our method can be used to determine optimal parameters for several loss functions -- without having to train networks. Remarkably, our method determines the hyperparameters based on the number of classes, resulting in loss functions which require zero dataset or noise-dependent parameters.</description>

      <title>GenORM: Generalizable One-shot Rope Manipulation with Parameter-Aware Policy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.09872v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Due to the inherent uncertainty in their deformability during motion, previous methods in rope manipulation often require hundreds of real-world demonstrations to train a manipulation policy for each rope, even for simple tasks such as rope goal reaching, which hinder their applications in our ever-changing world. To address this issue, we introduce GenORM, a framework that allows the manipulation policy to handle different deformable ropes with a single real-world demonstration. To achieve this, we augment the policy by conditioning it on deformable rope parameters and training it with a diverse range of simulated deformable ropes so that the policy can adjust actions based on different rope parameters. At the time of inference, given a new rope, GenORM estimates the deformable rope parameters by minimizing the disparity between the grid density of point clouds of real-world demonstrations and simulations. With the help of a differentiable physics simulator, we require only a single real-world demonstration. Empirical validations on both simulated and real-world rope manipulation setups clearly show that our method can manipulate different ropes with a single demonstration and significantly outperforms the baseline in both environments (62% improvement in in-domain ropes, and 15% improvement in out-of-distribution ropes in simulation, 26% improvement in real-world), demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach in one-shot rope manipulation.</description>

      <title>SDC-HSDD-NDSA: Structure Detecting Cluster by Hierarchical Secondary Directed Differential with Normalized Density and Self-Adaption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.00677v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Density-based clustering is the most popular clustering algorithm since it can identify clusters of arbitrary shape as long as they are separated by low-density regions. However, a high-density region that is not separated by low-density ones might also have different structures belonging to multiple clusters. As far as we know, all previous density-based clustering algorithms fail to detect such structures. In this paper, we provide a novel density-based clustering scheme to address this problem. It is the first clustering algorithm that can detect meticulous structures in a high-density region that is not separated by low-density ones and thus extends the range of applications of clustering. The algorithm employs secondary directed differential, hierarchy, normalized density, as well as the self-adaption coefficient, called Structure Detecting Cluster by Hierarchical Secondary Directed Differential with Normalized Density and Self-Adaption, dubbed SDC-HSDD-NDSA. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets are implemented to verify the effectiveness, robustness, and granularity independence of the algorithm, and the scheme is compared to unsupervised schemes in the Python package \textit{Scikit-learn}. Results demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms previous ones in many situations, especially significantly when clusters have regular internal structures. For example, averaging over the eight noiseless synthetic datasets with structures employing ARI and NMI criteria, previous algorithms obtain scores below 0.6 and 0.7, while the presented algorithm obtains scores higher than 0.9 and 0.95, respectively. The Python code is on https://github.com/Hao-B-Shu/SDC-HSDD-NDSA.</description>

Abstract: Due to the inherent uncertainty in their deformability during motion, previous methods in deformable object manipulation, such as rope and cloth, often required hundreds of real-world demonstrations to train a manipulation policy for each object, which hinders their applications in our ever-changing world. To address this issue, we introduce GenDOM, a framework that allows the manipulation policy to handle different deformable objects with only a single real-world demonstration. To achieve this, we augment the policy by conditioning it on deformable object parameters and training it with a diverse range of simulated deformable objects so that the policy can adjust actions based on different object parameters. At the time of inference, given a new object, GenDOM can estimate the deformable object parameters with only a single real-world demonstration by minimizing the disparity between the grid density of point clouds of real-world demonstrations and simulations in a differentiable physics simulator. Empirical validations on both simulated and real-world object manipulation setups clearly show that our method can manipulate different objects with a single demonstration and significantly outperforms the baseline in both environments (a 62% improvement for in-domain ropes and a 15% improvement for out-of-distribution ropes in simulation, as well as a 26% improvement for ropes and a 50% improvement for cloths in the real world), demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach in one-shot deformable object manipulation.</description>

      <title>MM-NeRF: Multimodal-Guided 3D Multi-Style Transfer of Neural Radiance Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.13607v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: 3D style transfer aims to generate stylized views of 3D scenes with specified styles, which requires high-quality generating and keeping multi-view consistency. Existing methods still suffer the challenges of high-quality stylization with texture details and stylization with multimodal guidance. In this paper, we reveal that the common training method of stylization with NeRF, which generates stylized multi-view supervision by 2D style transfer models, causes the same object in supervision to show various states (color tone, details, etc.) in different views, leading NeRF to tend to smooth the texture details, further resulting in low-quality rendering for 3D multi-style transfer. To tackle these problems, we propose a novel Multimodal-guided 3D Multi-style transfer of NeRF, termed MM-NeRF. First, MM-NeRF projects multimodal guidance into a unified space to keep the multimodal styles consistency and extracts multimodal features to guide the 3D stylization. Second, a novel multi-head learning scheme is proposed to relieve the difficulty of learning multi-style transfer, and a multi-view style consistent loss is proposed to track the inconsistency of multi-view supervision data. Finally, a novel incremental learning mechanism is proposed to generalize MM-NeRF to any new style with small costs. Extensive experiments on several real-world datasets show that MM-NeRF achieves high-quality 3D multi-style stylization with multimodal guidance, and keeps multi-view consistency and style consistency between multimodal guidance.</description>

Abstract: We use a large-scale experiment (N=8000) to determine whether GPT-4 can replicate cross-cultural differences in the Big Five, measured using the Ten-Item Personality Inventory. We used the US and South Korea as the cultural pair, given that prior research suggests substantial personality differences between people from these two countries. We manipulated the target of the simulation (US vs. Korean), the language of the inventory (English vs. Korean), and the language model (GPT-4 vs. GPT-3.5). Our results show that GPT-4 replicated the cross-cultural differences for each factor. However, mean ratings had an upward bias and exhibited lower variation than in the human samples, as well as lower structural validity. We provide preliminary evidence that LLMs can aid cross-cultural researchers and practitioners.</description>

      <title>Analyzing User Characteristics of Hate Speech Spreaders on Social Media</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.15772v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hate speech on social media threatens the mental and physical well-being of individuals and contributes to real-world violence. Resharing is an important driver behind the spread of hate speech on social media. Yet, little is known about who reshares hate speech and what their characteristics are. In this paper, we analyze the role of user characteristics in hate speech resharing across different types of hate speech (e.g., political hate). For this, we proceed as follows: First, we cluster hate speech posts using large language models to identify different types of hate speech. Then we model the effects of user attributes on users' probability to reshare hate speech using an explainable machine learning model. To do so, we apply debiasing to control for selection bias in our observational social media data and further control for the latent vulnerability of users to hate speech. We find that, all else equal, users with fewer followers, fewer friends, fewer posts, and older accounts share more hate speech. This shows that users with little social influence tend to share more hate speech. Further, we find substantial heterogeneity across different types of hate speech. For example, racist and misogynistic hate is spread mostly by users with little social influence. In contrast, political anti-Trump and anti-right-wing hate is reshared by users with larger social influence. Overall, understanding the factors that drive users to share hate speech is crucial for detecting individuals at risk of engaging in harmful behavior and for designing effective mitigation strategies.</description>

      <title>Knowledge-Infused Prompting: Assessing and Advancing Clinical Text Data Generation with Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.00287v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Clinical natural language processing requires methods that can address domain-specific challenges, such as complex medical terminology and clinical contexts. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in this domain. Yet, their direct deployment can lead to privacy issues and are constrained by resources. To address this challenge, we delve into synthetic clinical text generation using LLMs for clinical NLP tasks. We propose an innovative, resource-efficient approach, ClinGen, which infuses knowledge into the process. Our model involves clinical knowledge extraction and context-informed LLM prompting. Both clinical topics and writing styles are drawn from external domain-specific knowledge graphs and LLMs to guide data generation. Our extensive empirical study across 7 clinical NLP tasks and 16 datasets reveals that ClinGen consistently enhances performance across various tasks, effectively aligning the distribution of real datasets and significantly enriching the diversity of generated training instances. Our code is available at \url{https://github.com/ritaranx/ClinGen}.</description>

      <title>Multimodal and Force-Matched Imitation Learning with a See-Through Visuotactile Sensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01248v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Contact-rich tasks continue to present many challenges for robotic manipulation. In this work, we leverage a multimodal visuotactile sensor within the framework of imitation learning (IL) to perform contact-rich tasks that involve relative motion (e.g., slipping and sliding) between the end-effector and the manipulated object. We introduce two algorithmic contributions, tactile force matching and learned mode switching, as complimentary methods for improving IL. Tactile force matching enhances kinesthetic teaching by reading approximate forces during the demonstration and generating an adapted robot trajectory that recreates the recorded forces. Learned mode switching uses IL to couple visual and tactile sensor modes with the learned motion policy, simplifying the transition from reaching to contacting. We perform robotic manipulation experiments on four door-opening tasks with a variety of observation and algorithm configurations to study the utility of multimodal visuotactile sensing and our proposed improvements. Our results show that the inclusion of force matching raises average policy success rates by 62.5%, visuotactile mode switching by 30.3%, and visuotactile data as a policy input by 42.5%, emphasizing the value of see-through tactile sensing for IL, both for data collection to allow force matching, and for policy execution to enable accurate task feedback.

      <title>On The Truthfulness of 'Surprisingly Likely' Responses of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07692v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The principle of rewarding a crowd for surprisingly common answers has been used in the literature for designing a number of truthful information elicitation mechanisms. A related method has also been proposed in the literature for better aggregation of crowd wisdom. Drawing a comparison between crowd based collective intelligence systems and large language models, we define the notion of 'surprisingly likely' textual response of a large language model. This notion is inspired by the surprisingly common principle, but tailored for text in a language model. Using benchmarks such as TruthfulQA and openly available LLMs: GPT-2 and LLaMA-2, we show that the surprisingly likely textual responses of large language models are more accurate in many cases compared to standard baselines. For example, we observe up to 24 percentage points aggregate improvement on TruthfulQA and up to 70 percentage points improvement on individual categories of questions in this benchmark. We also provide further analysis of the results, including the cases when surprisingly likely responses are less or not more accurate.</description>

      <title>Compelling ReLU Networks to Exhibit Exponentially Many Linear Regions at Initialization and During Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18022v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A neural network with ReLU activations may be viewed as a composition of piecewise linear functions. For such networks, the number of distinct linear regions expressed over the input domain has the potential to scale exponentially with depth, but it is not expected to do so when the initial parameters are chosen randomly. Therefore, randomly initialized models are often unnecessarily large, even when approximating simple functions. To address this issue, we introduce a novel training strategy: we first reparameterize the network weights in a manner that forces the network to exhibit a number of linear regions exponential in depth. Training first on our derived parameters provides an initial solution that can later be refined by directly updating the underlying model weights. This approach allows us to learn approximations of convex, one-dimensional functions that are several orders of magnitude more accurate than their randomly initialized counterparts. We further demonstrate how to extend our approach to multidimensional and non convex functions, with similar benefits observed.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking and Defending Against Indirect Prompt Injection Attacks on Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14197v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The integration of large language models with external content has enabled applications such as Microsoft Copilot but also introduced vulnerabilities to indirect prompt injection attacks. In these attacks, malicious instructions embedded within external content can manipulate LLM outputs, causing deviations from user expectations. To address this critical yet under-explored issue, we introduce the first benchmark for indirect prompt injection attacks, named BIPIA, to assess the risk of such vulnerabilities. Using BIPIA, we evaluate existing LLMs and find them universally vulnerable. Our analysis identifies two key factors contributing to their success: LLMs' inability to distinguish between informational context and actionable instructions, and their lack of awareness in avoiding the execution of instructions within external content. Based on these findings, we propose two novel defense mechanisms-boundary awareness and explicit reminder-to address these vulnerabilities in both black-box and white-box settings. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our black-box defense provides substantial mitigation, while our white-box defense reduces the attack success rate to near-zero levels, all while preserving the output quality of LLMs. We hope this work inspires further research into securing LLM applications and fostering their safe and reliable use.</description>

      <title>Turbulence: Systematically and Automatically Testing Instruction-Tuned Large Language Models for Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14856v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a method for systematically evaluating the correctness and robustness of instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs) for code generation via a new benchmark, Turbulence. Turbulence consists of a large set of natural language $\textit{question templates}$, each of which is a programming problem, parameterised so that it can be asked in many different forms. Each question template has an associated $\textit{test oracle}$ that judges whether a code solution returned by an LLM is correct. Thus, from a single question template, it is possible to ask an LLM a $\textit{neighbourhood}$ of very similar programming questions, and assess the correctness of the result returned for each question. This allows gaps in an LLM's code generation abilities to be identified, including $\textit{anomalies}$ where the LLM correctly solves $\textit{almost all}$ questions in a neighbourhood but fails for particular parameter instantiations. We present experiments against five LLMs from OpenAI, Cohere and Meta, each at two temperature configurations. Our findings show that, across the board, Turbulence is able to reveal gaps in LLM reasoning ability. This goes beyond merely highlighting that LLMs sometimes produce wrong code (which is no surprise): by systematically identifying cases where LLMs are able to solve some problems in a neighbourhood but do not manage to generalise to solve the whole neighbourhood, our method is effective at highlighting $\textit{robustness}$ issues. We present data and examples that shed light on the kinds of mistakes that LLMs make when they return incorrect code results.</description>

      <title>DualDynamics: Synergizing Implicit and Explicit Methods for Robust Irregular Time Series Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04979v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Real-world time series analysis faces significant challenges when dealing with irregular and incomplete data. While Neural Differential Equation (NDE) based methods have shown promise, they struggle with limited expressiveness, scalability issues, and stability concerns. Conversely, Neural Flows offer stability but falter with irregular data. We introduce 'DualDynamics', a novel framework that synergistically combines NDE-based method and Neural Flow-based method. This approach enhances expressive power while balancing computational demands, addressing critical limitations of existing techniques. We demonstrate DualDynamics' effectiveness across diverse tasks: classification of robustness to dataset shift, irregularly-sampled series analysis, interpolation of missing data, and forecasting with partial observations. Our results show consistent outperformance over state-of-the-art methods, indicating DualDynamics' potential to advance irregular time series analysis significantly.</description>

      <title>CreINNs: Credal-Set Interval Neural Networks for Uncertainty Estimation in Classification Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05043v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Effective uncertainty estimation is becoming increasingly attractive for enhancing the reliability of neural networks. This work presents a novel approach, termed Credal-Set Interval Neural Networks (CreINNs), for classification. CreINNs retain the fundamental structure of traditional Interval Neural Networks, capturing weight uncertainty through deterministic intervals. CreINNs are designed to predict an upper and a lower probability bound for each class, rather than a single probability value. The probability intervals can define a credal set, facilitating estimating different types of uncertainties associated with predictions. Experiments on standard multiclass and binary classification tasks demonstrate that the proposed CreINNs can achieve superior or comparable quality of uncertainty estimation compared to variational Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) and Deep Ensembles. Furthermore, CreINNs significantly reduce the computational complexity of variational BNNs during inference. Moreover, the effective uncertainty quantification of CreINNs is also verified when the input data are intervals.</description>

      <title>Graph Condensation: A Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.11720v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid growth of graph data poses significant challenges in storage, transmission, and particularly the training of graph neural networks (GNNs). To address these challenges, graph condensation (GC) has emerged as an innovative solution. GC focuses on synthesizing a compact yet highly representative graph, enabling GNNs trained on it to achieve performance comparable to those trained on the original large graph. The notable efficacy of GC and its broad prospects have garnered significant attention and spurred extensive research. This survey paper provides an up-to-date and systematic overview of GC, organizing existing research into five categories aligned with critical GC evaluation criteria: effectiveness, generalization, efficiency, fairness, and robustness. To facilitate an in-depth and comprehensive understanding of GC, this paper examines various methods under each category and thoroughly discusses two essential components within GC: optimization strategies and condensed graph generation. We also empirically compare and analyze representative GC methods with diverse optimization strategies based on the five proposed GC evaluation criteria. Finally, we explore the applications of GC in various fields, outline the related open-source libraries, and highlight the present challenges and novel insights, with the aim of promoting advancements in future research.

      <title>Fine-Grained Stateful Knowledge Exploration: A Novel Paradigm for Integrating Knowledge Graphs with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13444v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities, yet updating their knowledge remains a significant challenge, often leading to outdated or inaccurate responses. A proposed solution is the integration of external knowledge bases, such as knowledge graphs, with LLMs. Most existing methods use a paradigm that treats the question as the objective, with relevant knowledge being incrementally retrieved from the knowledge graph. However, this strategy frequently experiences an mismatch in the granularity of knowledge between the target question and the entities and relations being retrieved. As a result, the information in the question cannot precisely correspond to the retrieved knowledge. This may cause redundant exploration or omission of vital knowledge, thereby leading to enhanced computational consumption and reduced retrieval accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel paradigm of fine-grained stateful knowledge exploration, which addresses the `information granularity mismatch' issue. We extract fine-grained information from questions and explore the semantic mapping between this information and the knowledge in graph. By dynamically updating the mapping records, we avoid redundant exploration and ensure no pertinent information is overlooked, thereby reducing computational overhead and improving the accuracy of knowledge exploration. The use of fine-grained information also eliminates the need for a priori knowledge, a common requirement in existing methods. Experiments on multiple datasets revealed that our paradigm surpasses current advanced methods in knowledge retrieval while significantly reducing the average number of LLM invocations.</description>

      <title>Large Language Model Distilling Medication Recommendation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02803v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recommendation of medication is a vital aspect of intelligent healthcare systems, as it involves prescribing the most suitable drugs based on a patient's specific health needs. Unfortunately, many sophisticated models currently in use tend to overlook the nuanced semantics of medical data, while only relying heavily on identities. Furthermore, these models face significant challenges in handling cases involving patients who are visiting the hospital for the first time, as they lack prior prescription histories to draw upon. To tackle these issues, we harness the powerful semantic comprehension and input-agnostic characteristics of Large Language Models (LLMs). Our research aims to transform existing medication recommendation methodologies using LLMs. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach called Large Language Model Distilling Medication Recommendation (LEADER). We begin by creating appropriate prompt templates that enable LLMs to suggest medications effectively. However, the straightforward integration of LLMs into recommender systems leads to an out-of-corpus issue specific to drugs. We handle it by adapting the LLMs with a novel output layer and a refined tuning loss function. Although LLM-based models exhibit remarkable capabilities, they are plagued by high computational costs during inference, which is impractical for the healthcare sector. To mitigate this, we have developed a feature-level knowledge distillation technique, which transfers the LLM's proficiency to a more compact model. Extensive experiments conducted on two real-world datasets, MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV, demonstrate that our proposed model not only delivers effective results but also is efficient. To ease the reproducibility of our experiments, we release the implementation code online.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models as an Indirect Reasoner: Contrapositive and Contradiction for Automated Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03667v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, increasing attention has been focused on improving the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform complex reasoning. Advanced methods, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and its variants, are found to enhance their reasoning skills by designing suitable prompts or breaking down complex problems into more manageable sub-problems. However, little concentration has been put on exploring the reasoning process, \textit{i.e.}, we discovered that most methods resort to Direct Reasoning (DR) and disregard Indirect Reasoning (IR). This can make LLMs difficult to solve IR tasks, which are often encountered in the real world. To address this issue, we propose a Direct-Indirect Reasoning (DIR) method, which considers DR and IR as multiple parallel reasoning paths that are merged to derive the final answer. We stimulate LLMs to implement IR by crafting prompt templates incorporating the principles of contrapositive and contradiction. These templates trigger LLMs to assume the negation of the conclusion as true, combine it with the premises to deduce a conclusion, and utilize the logical equivalence of the contrapositive to enhance their comprehension of the rules used in the reasoning process. Our DIR method is simple yet effective and can be straightforwardly integrated with existing variants of CoT methods. Experimental results on four datasets related to logical reasoning and mathematic proof demonstrate that our DIR method, when combined with various baseline methods, significantly outperforms all the original methods.</description>

      <title>Self-DC: When to Reason and When to Act? Self Divide-and-Conquer for Compositional Unknown Questions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13514v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Previous research has typically concentrated on leveraging the internal knowledge of Large Language Models (LLMs) to answer known questions (i.e., \textit{internal reasoning such as generate-then-read}). In contrast, for questions that fall outside their known scope, these models rely on external knowledge retrieval to provide accurate responses (i.e., \textit{external acting such as retrieve-then-read}). However, few previous works consider the \textit{compositional questions}, which consist of several known and unknown sub-questions, necessitating the dynamic combination of previous two methods (i.e., \textit{internal reasoning and external acting}) to achieve a better trade-off between effectiveness and efficiency. To this end, we introduce a \textbf{Self} \textbf{D}ivide-and-\textbf{C}onquer (\textit{\texttt{Self-DC}}) framework, accompanying with the first \textbf{C}ompositional \textbf{u}nknown \textbf{Q}uestion-\textbf{A}nswering dataset (CuQA). This framework enables LLMs to adaptively choose between using internal knowledge and retrieving external knowledge as needed, resulting in a better trade-off between effectiveness and efficiency. Experimental results on two datasets demonstrate that \textit{\texttt{Self-DC}} can achieve comparable or even better performance with much fewer external calls compared with several strong baselines.</description>

      <title>Has the Deep Neural Network learned the Stochastic Process? An Evaluation Viewpoint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15163v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the first systematic study of evaluating Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) designed to forecast the evolution of stochastic complex systems. We show that traditional evaluation methods like threshold-based classification metrics and error-based scoring rules assess a DNN's ability to replicate the observed ground truth but fail to measure the DNN's learning of the underlying stochastic process. To address this gap, we propose a new evaluation criterion called Fidelity to Stochastic Process (F2SP), representing the DNN's ability to predict the system property Statistic-GT--the ground truth of the stochastic process--and introduce an evaluation metric that exclusively assesses F2SP. We formalize F2SP within a stochastic framework and establish criteria for validly measuring it. We formally show that Expected Calibration Error (ECE) satisfies the necessary condition for testing F2SP, unlike traditional evaluation methods. Empirical experiments on synthetic datasets, including wildfire, host-pathogen, and stock market models, demonstrate that ECE uniquely captures F2SP. We further extend our study to real-world wildfire data, highlighting the limitations of conventional evaluation and discuss the practical utility of incorporating F2SP into model assessment. This work offers a new perspective on evaluating DNNs modeling complex systems by emphasizing the importance of capturing the underlying stochastic process.</description>

      <title>Temporal Logic Specification-Conditioned Decision Transformer for Offline Safe Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17217v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Offline safe reinforcement learning (RL) aims to train a constraint satisfaction policy from a fixed dataset. Current state-of-the-art approaches are based on supervised learning with a conditioned policy. However, these approaches fall short in real-world applications that involve complex tasks with rich temporal and logical structures. In this paper, we propose temporal logic Specification-conditioned Decision Transformer (SDT), a novel framework that harnesses the expressive power of signal temporal logic (STL) to specify complex temporal rules that an agent should follow and the sequential modeling capability of Decision Transformer (DT). Empirical evaluations on the DSRL benchmarks demonstrate the better capacity of SDT in learning safe and high-reward policies compared with existing approaches. In addition, SDT shows good alignment with respect to different desired degrees of satisfaction of the STL specification that it is conditioned on.</description>

      <title>KnowAgent: Knowledge-Augmented Planning for LLM-Based Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03101v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated great potential in complex reasoning tasks, yet they fall short when tackling more sophisticated challenges, especially when interacting with environments through generating executable actions. This inadequacy primarily stems from the lack of built-in action knowledge in language agents, which fails to effectively guide the planning trajectories during task solving and results in planning hallucination. To address this issue, we introduce KnowAgent, a novel approach designed to enhance the planning capabilities of LLMs by incorporating explicit action knowledge. Specifically, KnowAgent employs an action knowledge base and a knowledgeable self-learning strategy to constrain the action path during planning, enabling more reasonable trajectory synthesis, and thereby enhancing the planning performance of language agents. Experimental results on HotpotQA and ALFWorld based on various backbone models demonstrate that KnowAgent can achieve comparable or superior performance to existing baselines. Further analysis indicates the effectiveness of KnowAgent in terms of planning hallucinations mitigation. Code is available in https://github.com/zjunlp/KnowAgent.</description>

      <title>Merino: Entropy-driven Design for Generative Language Models on IoT Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07921v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative Large Language Models (LLMs) stand as a revolutionary advancement in the modern era of artificial intelligence (AI). However, scaling down LLMs for resource-constrained hardware, such as Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices requires non-trivial efforts and domain knowledge. In this paper, we propose a novel information-entropy framework for designing mobile-friendly generative language models. The whole design procedure involves solving a mathematical programming (MP) problem, which can be done on the CPU within minutes, making it nearly zero-cost. We evaluate our designed models, termed MeRino, across fourteen NLP downstream tasks, showing their competitive performance against the state-of-the-art autoregressive transformer models under the mobile setting. Notably, MeRino achieves similar or better performance on both language modeling and zero-shot learning tasks, compared to the 350M parameter OPT while being 4.9x faster on NVIDIA Jetson Nano with 5.5x reduction in model size.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14734v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural Code Intelligence -- leveraging deep learning to understand, generate, and optimize code -- holds immense potential for transformative impacts on the whole society. Bridging the gap between Natural Language and Programming Language, this domain has drawn significant attention from researchers in both research communities over the past few years. This survey presents a systematic and chronological review of the advancements in code intelligence, encompassing over 50 representative models and their variants, more than 20 categories of tasks, and an extensive coverage of over 680 related works. We follow the historical progression to trace the paradigm shifts across different research phases (e.g., from modeling code with recurrent neural networks to the era of Large Language Models). Concurrently, we highlight the major technical transitions in models, tasks, and evaluations spanning through different stages. For applications, we also observe a co-evolving shift. It spans from initial endeavors to tackling specific scenarios, through exploring a diverse array of tasks during its rapid expansion, to currently focusing on tackling increasingly complex and varied real-world challenges. Building on our examination of the developmental trajectories, we further investigate the emerging synergies between code intelligence and broader machine intelligence, uncovering new cross-domain opportunities and illustrating the substantial influence of code intelligence across various domains. Finally, we delve into both the opportunities and challenges associated with this field, alongside elucidating our insights on the most promising research directions. An ongoing, dynamically updated project and resources associated with this survey have been released at https://github.com/QiushiSun/Awesome-Code-Intelligence.</description>

      <title>MedPromptX: Grounded Multimodal Prompting for Chest X-ray Diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15585v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chest X-ray images are commonly used for predicting acute and chronic cardiopulmonary conditions, but efforts to integrate them with structured clinical data face challenges due to incomplete electronic health records (EHR). This paper introduces MedPromptX, the first clinical decision support system that integrates multimodal large language models (MLLMs), few-shot prompting (FP) and visual grounding (VG) to combine imagery with EHR data for chest X-ray diagnosis. A pre-trained MLLM is utilized to complement the missing EHR information, providing a comprehensive understanding of patients' medical history. Additionally, FP reduces the necessity for extensive training of MLLMs while effectively tackling the issue of hallucination. Nevertheless, the process of determining the optimal number of few-shot examples and selecting high-quality candidates can be burdensome, yet it profoundly influences model performance. Hence, we propose a new technique that dynamically refines few-shot data for real-time adjustment to new patient scenarios. Moreover, VG narrows the search area in X-ray images, thereby enhancing the identification of abnormalities. We also release MedPromptX-VQA, a new in-context visual question answering dataset encompassing interleaved images and EHR data derived from MIMIC-IV and MIMIC-CXR-JPG databases. Results demonstrate the SOTA performance of MedPromptX, achieving an 11% improvement in F1-score compared to the baselines. Code and data are publicly available on https://github.com/BioMedIA-MBZUAI/MedPromptX.</description>

      <title>Understanding the Functional Roles of Modelling Components in Spiking Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16674v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs), inspired by the neural circuits of the brain, are promising in achieving high computational efficiency with biological fidelity. Nevertheless, it is quite difficult to optimize SNNs because the functional roles of their modelling components remain unclear. By designing and evaluating several variants of the classic model, we systematically investigate the functional roles of key modelling components, leakage, reset, and recurrence, in leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) based SNNs. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate how these components influence the accuracy, generalization, and robustness of SNNs. Specifically, we find that the leakage plays a crucial role in balancing memory retention and robustness, the reset mechanism is essential for uninterrupted temporal processing and computational efficiency, and the recurrence enriches the capability to model complex dynamics at a cost of robustness degradation. With these interesting observations, we provide optimization suggestions for enhancing the performance of SNNs in different scenarios. This work deepens the understanding of how SNNs work, which offers valuable guidance for the development of more effective and robust neuromorphic models.</description>

      <title>Streamlining Redundant Layers to Compress Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19135v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces LLM-Streamline, a pioneer work on layer pruning for large language models (LLMs). It is based on the observation that different layers have varying impacts on hidden states, enabling the identification of less important layers to be pruned.LLM-Streamline comprises two parts: layer pruning, which removes consecutive layers with the lowest importance based on target sparsity, and layer replacement, a novel module that trains a lightweight network to replace the pruned layers to mitigate performance loss. Additionally, a new metric called stability is proposed to address the limitations of the widely used accuracy metric in evaluating model compression. Experiments show that LLM-Streamline outperforms both previous and concurrent state-of-the-art pruning methods in terms of both performance and training efficiency.Our code is available at https://github.com/RUCKBReasoning/LLM-Streamline</description>

      <title>Uncovering Latent Arguments in Social Media Messaging by Employing LLMs-in-the-Loop Strategy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10259v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The widespread use of social media has led to a surge in popularity for automated methods of analyzing public opinion. Supervised methods are adept at text categorization, yet the dynamic nature of social media discussions poses a continual challenge for these techniques due to the constant shifting of the focus. On the other hand, traditional unsupervised methods for extracting themes from public discourse, such as topic modeling, often reveal overarching patterns that might not capture specific nuances. Consequently, a significant portion of research into social media discourse still depends on labor-intensive manual coding techniques and a human-in-the-loop approach, which are both time-consuming and costly. In this work, we study the problem of discovering arguments associated with a specific theme. We propose a generic LLMs-in-the-Loop strategy that leverages the advanced capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract latent arguments from social media messaging. To demonstrate our approach, we apply our framework to contentious topics. We use two publicly available datasets: (1) the climate campaigns dataset of 14k Facebook ads with 25 themes and (2) the COVID-19 vaccine campaigns dataset of 9k Facebook ads with 14 themes. Additionally, we design a downstream task as stance prediction by leveraging talking points in climate debates. Furthermore, we analyze demographic targeting and the adaptation of messaging based on real-world events.</description>

      <title>Empirical Studies of Parameter Efficient Methods for Large Language Models of Code and Knowledge Transfer to R</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01553v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods are proposed as an alternative fine-tuning approach for Large Language Models (LLM) to minimize high training costs. While prior research demonstrates the effectiveness of PEFT methods in knowledge transfer using smaller language models, their application to larger LLMs, particularly in low-resource and unseen programming languages such as R, remains under-explored. In this work, we evaluate PEFT methods, LoRA, Compacter, and IA^3 on LLMs for code summarization and generation, with a particular emphasis on knowledge transfer to R as an unseen under-explored target language. Our experiments reveal that LoRA consistently outperforms Compacter and IA^3 in all settings, while Compacter offers significant resource efficiency with minimal performance trade-offs. Additionally, we find that the number of trainable parameters has a greater influence on the functional accuracy of the generated code than PEFT architecture. Our study can direct future research in developing code intelligent tasks for unseen languages including R, as well as the choice of PEFT methods for knowledge transfer, especially when balancing the computational cost and performance.</description>

      <title>Boosting Multimodal Large Language Models with Visual Tokens Withdrawal for Rapid Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05803v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) demand considerable computations for inference due to the extensive parameters and the additional input tokens needed for visual information representation. Herein, we introduce Visual Tokens Withdrawal (VTW), a plug-and-play module to boost MLLMs for rapid inference. Our approach is inspired by two intriguing phenomena we have observed: (1) the attention sink phenomenon that is prevalent in LLMs also persists in MLLMs, suggesting that initial tokens and nearest tokens receive the majority of attention, while middle vision tokens garner minimal attention in deep layers; (2) the presence of information migration, which implies that visual information is transferred to subsequent text tokens within the first few layers of MLLMs. As per our findings, we conclude that vision tokens are unnecessary in the deep layers of MLLMs. Thus, we strategically withdraw them at a certain layer, enabling only text tokens to engage in subsequent layers. To pinpoint the ideal layer for VTW, we initially analyze a limited set of tiny datasets and choose the first layer that meets the Kullback-Leibler divergence criterion. Our VTW approach can cut computational overhead by over 40\% across diverse multimodal tasks while maintaining performance.</description>

      <title>Context-aware Diversity Enhancement for Neural Multi-Objective Combinatorial Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08604v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-objective combinatorial optimization (MOCO) problems are prevalent in various real-world applications. Most existing neural MOCO methods rely on problem decomposition to transform an MOCO problem into a series of singe-objective combinatorial optimization (SOCO) problems and train attention models based on a single-step and deterministic greedy rollout. However, inappropriate decomposition and undesirable short-sighted behaviors of previous methods tend to induce a decline in diversity. To address the above limitation, we design a Context-aware Diversity Enhancement algorithm named CDE, which casts the neural MOCO problems as conditional sequence modeling via autoregression (node-level context awareness) and establishes a direct relationship between the mapping of preferences and diversity indicator of reward based on hypervolume expectation maximization (solution-level context awareness). Based on the solution-level context awareness, we further propose a hypervolume residual update strategy to enable the Pareto attention model to capture both local and non-local information of the Pareto set/front. The proposed CDE can effectively and efficiently grasp the context information, resulting in diversity enhancement. Experimental results on three classic MOCO problems demonstrate that our CDE outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines.</description>

      <title>BiMix: A Bivariate Data Mixing Law for Language Model Pretraining</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14908v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various tasks, primarily attributed to the utilization of diversely sourced data. However, the impact of pretraining data composition on model performance remains poorly understood. This paper introduces $\textbf{BiMix}$, a novel bivariate data mixing law that models the joint scaling behavior of domain proportions and data volume in LLM pretraining. $\textbf{BiMix}$ provides a systematic framework for understanding and optimizing data mixtures across diverse domains. Through extensive experiments on two large-scale datasets, we demonstrate $\textbf{BiMix}$'s high accuracy in loss extrapolation (mean relative error &lt; 0.2%) and its generalization to unseen mixtures (R${}^{2}$ &gt; 0.97). Optimization of domain proportions yields superior model performance compared to existing methods. Furthermore, we establish entropy-based measures as efficient proxies for data mixing, offering a computationally lightweight strategy. Our work contributes both theoretical insights into data mixing dynamics and practical tools for enhancing LLM training efficiency, paving the way for more effective scaling strategies in language model development.</description>

      <title>Inverse-RLignment: Large Language Model Alignment from Demonstrations through Inverse Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15624v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for enhancing their safety and utility. However, existing methods, primarily based on preference datasets, face challenges such as noisy labels, high annotation costs, and privacy concerns. In this work, we introduce Alignment from Demonstrations (AfD), a novel approach leveraging high-quality demonstration data to overcome these challenges. We formalize AfD within a sequential decision-making framework, highlighting its unique challenge of missing reward signals. Drawing insights from forward and inverse reinforcement learning, we introduce divergence minimization objectives for AfD. Analytically, we elucidate the mass-covering and mode-seeking behaviors of various approaches, explaining when and why certain methods are superior. Practically, we propose a computationally efficient algorithm that extrapolates over a tailored reward model for AfD. We validate our key insights through experiments on the Harmless and Helpful tasks, demonstrating their strong empirical performance while maintaining simplicity.</description>

      <title>SLoPe: Double-Pruned Sparse Plus Lazy Low-Rank Adapter Pretraining of LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16325v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose SLoPe, a Double-Pruned Sparse Plus Lazy Low-rank Adapter Pretraining method for LLMs that improves the accuracy of sparse LLMs while accelerating their pretraining and inference and reducing their memory footprint. Sparse pretraining of LLMs reduces the accuracy of the model, to overcome this, prior work uses dense models during fine-tuning. SLoPe improves the accuracy of sparsely pretrained models by adding low-rank adapters in the final 1% iterations of pretraining without adding significant overheads to the model pretraining and inference. In addition, SLoPe uses a double-pruned backward pass formulation that prunes the transposed weight matrix using N:M sparsity structures to enable an accelerated sparse backward pass. SLoPe accelerates the training and inference of models with billions of parameters up to $1.25\times$ and $1.54\times$ respectively (OPT-33B and OPT-66B) while reducing their memory usage by up to $0.63\times$ and $0.61\times$ for training and inference respectively.</description>

      <title>Generalized Neyman Allocation for Locally Minimax Optimal Best-Arm Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19317v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study investigates an asymptotically locally minimax optimal algorithm for fixed-budget best-arm identification (BAI). We propose the Generalized Neyman Allocation (GNA) algorithm and demonstrate that its worst-case upper bound on the probability of misidentifying the best arm aligns with the worst-case lower bound under the small-gap regime, where the gap between the expected outcomes of the best and suboptimal arms is small. Our lower and upper bounds are tight, matching exactly including constant terms within the small-gap regime. The GNA algorithm generalizes the Neyman allocation for two-armed bandits (Neyman, 1934; Kaufmann et al., 2016) and refines existing BAI algorithms, such as those proposed by Glynn &amp; Juneja (2004). By proposing an asymptotically minimax optimal algorithm, we address the longstanding open issue in BAI (Kaufmann, 2020) and treatment choice (Kasy &amp; Sautmann, 202) by restricting a class of distributions to the small-gap regimes.</description>

Abstract: Integrating information from various reference databases is a major challenge for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems because each knowledge source adopts a unique data structure and follows different conventions. Retrieving from multiple knowledge sources with one fixed strategy usually leads to under-exploitation of information. To mitigate this drawback, inspired by Mix-of-Expert, we introduce Mix-of-Granularity (MoG), a method that dynamically determines the optimal granularity of a knowledge source based on input queries using a router. The router is efficiently trained with a newly proposed loss function employing soft labels. We further extend MoG to MoG-Graph (MoGG), where reference documents are pre-processed as graphs, enabling the retrieval of distantly situated snippets. Experiments demonstrate that MoG and MoGG effectively predict optimal granularity levels, significantly enhancing the performance of the RAG system in downstream tasks. The code of both MoG and MoGG are released in https://github.com/ZGChung/Mix-of-Granularity.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Automatic Differentiation with Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: Computing Jacobians with automatic differentiation is ubiquitous in many scientific domains such as machine learning, computational fluid dynamics, robotics and finance. Even small savings in the number of computations or memory usage in Jacobian computations can already incur massive savings in energy consumption and runtime. While there exist many methods that allow for such savings, they generally trade computational efficiency for approximations of the exact Jacobian. In this paper, we present a novel method to optimize the number of necessary multiplications for Jacobian computation by leveraging deep reinforcement learning (RL) and a concept called cross-country elimination while still computing the exact Jacobian. Cross-country elimination is a framework for automatic differentiation that phrases Jacobian accumulation as ordered elimination of all vertices on the computational graph where every elimination incurs a certain computational cost. We formulate the search for the optimal elimination order that minimizes the number of necessary multiplications as a single player game which is played by an RL agent. We demonstrate that this method achieves up to 33% improvements over state-of-the-art methods on several relevant tasks taken from diverse domains. Furthermore, we show that these theoretical gains translate into actual runtime improvements by providing a cross-country elimination interpreter in JAX that can efficiently execute the obtained elimination orders.</description>

      <title>AI-Driven Predictive Analytics Approach for Early Prognosis of Chronic Kidney Disease Using Ensemble Learning and Explainable AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06728</link>

Abstract: Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is one of the widespread Chronic diseases with no known ultimo cure and high morbidity. Research demonstrates that progressive Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a heterogeneous disorder that significantly impacts kidney structure and functions, eventually leading to kidney failure. With the progression of time, chronic kidney disease has moved from a life-threatening disease affecting few people to a common disorder of varying severity. The goal of this research is to visualize dominating features, feature scores, and values exhibited for early prognosis and detection of CKD using ensemble learning and explainable AI. For that, an AI-driven predictive analytics approach is proposed to aid clinical practitioners in prescribing lifestyle modifications for individual patients to reduce the rate of progression of this disease. Our dataset is collected on body vitals from individuals with CKD and healthy subjects to develop our proposed AI-driven solution accurately. In this regard, blood and urine test results are provided, and ensemble tree-based machine-learning models are applied to predict unseen cases of CKD. Our research findings are validated after lengthy consultations with nephrologists. Our experiments and interpretation results are compared with existing explainable AI applications in various healthcare domains, including CKD. The comparison shows that our developed AI models, particularly the Random Forest model, have identified more features as significant contributors than XgBoost. Interpretability (I), which measures the ratio of important to masked features, indicates that our XgBoost model achieved a higher score, specifically a Fidelity of 98\%, in this metric and naturally in the FII index compared to competing models.</description>

      <title>BLoB: Bayesian Low-Rank Adaptation by Backpropagation for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11675v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often suffer from overconfidence during inference, particularly when adapted to downstream domain-specific tasks with limited data. Previous work addresses this issue by employing approximate Bayesian estimation after the LLMs are trained, enabling them to quantify uncertainty. However, such post-training approaches' performance is severely limited by the parameters learned during training. In this paper, we go beyond post-training Bayesianization and propose Bayesian Low-Rank Adaptation by Backpropagation (BLoB), an algorithm that continuously and jointly adjusts both the mean and covariance of LLM parameters throughout the whole fine-tuning process. Our empirical results verify the effectiveness of BLoB in terms of generalization and uncertainty estimation, when evaluated on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution data.</description>

Abstract: Benchmarks for large multimodal language models (MLMs) now serve to simultaneously assess the general capabilities of models instead of evaluating for a specific capability. As a result, when a developer wants to identify which models to use for their application, they are overwhelmed by the number of benchmarks and remain uncertain about which benchmark's results are most reflective of their specific use case. This paper introduces Task-Me-Anything, a benchmark generation engine which produces a benchmark tailored to a user's needs. Task-Me-Anything maintains an extendable taxonomy of visual assets and can programmatically generate a vast number of task instances. Additionally, it algorithmically addresses user queries regarding MLM performance efficiently within a computational budget. It contains 113K images, 10K videos, 2K 3D object assets, over 365 object categories, 655 attributes, and 335 relationships. It can generate 750M image/video question-answering pairs, which focus on evaluating MLM perceptual capabilities. Task-Me-Anything reveals critical insights: open-source MLMs excel in object and attribute recognition but lack spatial and temporal understanding; each model exhibits unique strengths and weaknesses; larger models generally perform better, though exceptions exist; and GPT4o demonstrates challenges in recognizing rotating/moving objects and distinguishing colors.</description>

      <title>Sparse High Rank Adapters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13175v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has gained massive attention in the recent generative AI research. One of the main advantages of LoRA is its ability to be fused with pretrained models, adding no overhead during inference. However, from a mobile deployment standpoint, we can either avoid inference overhead in the fused mode but lose the ability to switch adapters rapidly, or suffer significant (up to 30% higher) inference latency while enabling rapid switching in the unfused mode. LoRA also exhibits concept-loss when multiple adapters are used concurrently. In this paper, we propose Sparse High Rank Adapters (SHiRA), a new paradigm which incurs no inference overhead, enables rapid switching, and significantly reduces concept-loss. Specifically, SHiRA can be trained by directly tuning only 1-2% of the base model weights while leaving others unchanged. This results in a highly sparse adapter which can be switched directly in the fused mode. We further provide theoretical and empirical insights on how high sparsity in SHiRA can aid multi-adapter fusion by reducing concept loss. Our extensive experiments on LVMs and LLMs demonstrate that finetuning only a small fraction of the parameters in the base model significantly outperforms LoRA while enabling both rapid switching and multi-adapter fusion. Finally, we provide a latency- and memory-efficient SHiRA implementation based on Parameter-Efficient Finetuning (PEFT) Library which trains at nearly the same speed as LoRA while consuming up to 16% lower peak GPU memory, thus making SHiRA easy to adopt for practical use cases. To demonstrate rapid switching benefits during inference, we show that loading SHiRA on a base model can be 5x-16x faster than LoRA fusion on a CPU.</description>

      <title>Imperative Learning: A Self-supervised Neuro-Symbolic Learning Framework for Robot Autonomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16087v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data-driven methods such as reinforcement and imitation learning have achieved remarkable success in robot autonomy. However, their data-centric nature still hinders them from generalizing well to ever-changing environments. Moreover, collecting large datasets for robotic tasks is often impractical and expensive. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a new self-supervised neuro-symbolic (NeSy) computational framework, imperative learning (IL), for robot autonomy, leveraging the generalization abilities of symbolic reasoning. The framework of IL consists of three primary components: a neural module, a reasoning engine, and a memory system. We formulate IL as a special bilevel optimization (BLO), which enables reciprocal learning over the three modules. This overcomes the label-intensive obstacles associated with data-driven approaches and takes advantage of symbolic reasoning concerning logical reasoning, physical principles, geometric analysis, etc. We discuss several optimization techniques for IL and verify their effectiveness in five distinct robot autonomy tasks including path planning, rule induction, optimal control, visual odometry, and multi-robot routing. Through various experiments, we show that IL can significantly enhance robot autonomy capabilities and we anticipate that it will catalyze further research across diverse domains.</description>

      <title>Dimensions underlying the representational alignment of deep neural networks with humans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19087v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Determining the similarities and differences between humans and artificial intelligence (AI) is an important goal both in computational cognitive neuroscience and machine learning, promising a deeper understanding of human cognition and safer, more reliable AI systems. Much previous work comparing representations in humans and AI has relied on global, scalar measures to quantify their alignment. However, without explicit hypotheses, these measures only inform us about the degree of alignment, not the factors that determine it. To address this challenge, we propose a generic framework to compare human and AI representations, based on identifying latent representational dimensions underlying the same behavior in both domains. Applying this framework to humans and a deep neural network (DNN) model of natural images revealed a low-dimensional DNN embedding of both visual and semantic dimensions. In contrast to humans, DNNs exhibited a clear dominance of visual over semantic properties, indicating divergent strategies for representing images. While in-silico experiments showed seemingly consistent interpretability of DNN dimensions, a direct comparison between human and DNN representations revealed substantial differences in how they process images. By making representations directly comparable, our results reveal important challenges for representational alignment and offer a means for improving their comparability.</description>

      <title>Panza: Design and Analysis of a Fully-Local Personalized Text Writing Assistant</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10994v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The availability of powerful open-source large language models (LLMs) opens exciting use cases, such as automated personal assistants that adapt to the user's unique data and demands. Two key requirements for such assistants are personalization - in the sense that the assistant should reflect the user's own writing style - and privacy - users may prefer to always store their personal data locally, on their own computing device. In this application paper, we present a new design and evaluation for such an automated assistant, for the specific use case of email generation, which we call Panza. Specifically, Panza can be trained and deployed locally on commodity hardware, and is personalized to the user's writing style. Panza's personalization features are based on a combination of fine-tuning using a variant of the Reverse Instructions technique together with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). We demonstrate that this combination allows us to fine-tune an LLM to better reflect a user's writing style using limited data, while executing on extremely limited resources, e.g. on a free Google Colab instance. Our key methodological contribution is what we believe to be the first detailed study of evaluation metrics for this personalized writing task, and of how different choices of system components - e.g. the use of RAG and of different fine-tuning approaches - impact the system's performance. We also perform an ablation study showing that less than 100 emails are generally sufficient to produce a credible Panza model. We are releasing the full Panza code as well as a new "David" personalized email dataset licensed for research use, both available on https://github.com/IST-DASLab/PanzaMail.</description>

      <title>Ada-KV: Optimizing KV Cache Eviction by Adaptive Budget Allocation for Efficient LLM Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11550v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models have excelled in various domains but face efficiency challenges due to the growing Key-Value (KV) cache required for long-sequence inference. Recent efforts aim to reduce KV cache size by evicting vast non-critical cache elements during runtime while preserving generation quality. However, these methods typically allocate compression budgets uniformly across all attention heads, ignoring the unique attention patterns of each head. In this paper, we establish a theoretical loss upper bound between pre- and post-eviction attention output, explaining the optimization target of prior cache eviction methods, while guiding the optimization of adaptive budget allocation. Base on this, we propose {\it Ada-KV}, the first head-wise adaptive budget allocation strategy. It offers plug-and-play benefits, enabling seamless integration with prior cache eviction methods. Extensive evaluations on 13 datasets from Ruler and 16 datasets from LongBench, all conducted under both question-aware and question-agnostic scenarios, demonstrate substantial quality improvements over existing methods.</description>

      <title>Improving Out-of-Distribution Generalization of Trajectory Prediction for Autonomous Driving via Polynomial Representations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13431v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Robustness against Out-of-Distribution (OoD) samples is a key performance indicator of a trajectory prediction model. However, the development and ranking of state-of-the-art (SotA) models are driven by their In-Distribution (ID) performance on individual competition datasets. We present an OoD testing protocol that homogenizes datasets and prediction tasks across two large-scale motion datasets. We introduce a novel prediction algorithm based on polynomial representations for agent trajectory and road geometry on both the input and output sides of the model. With a much smaller model size, training effort, and inference time, we reach near SotA performance for ID testing and significantly improve robustness in OoD testing. Within our OoD testing protocol, we further study two augmentation strategies of SotA models and their effects on model generalization. Highlighting the contrast between ID and OoD performance, we suggest adding OoD testing to the evaluation criteria of trajectory prediction models.</description>

      <title>Multi-Grained Query-Guided Set Prediction Network for Grounded Multimodal Named Entity Recognition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21033v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Grounded Multimodal Named Entity Recognition (GMNER) is an emerging information extraction (IE) task, aiming to simultaneously extract entity spans, types, and corresponding visual regions of entities from given sentence-image pairs data. Recent unified methods employing machine reading comprehension or sequence generation-based frameworks show limitations in this difficult task. The former, utilizing human-designed type queries, struggles to differentiate ambiguous entities, such as Jordan (Person) and off-White x Jordan (Shoes). The latter, following the one-by-one decoding order, suffers from exposure bias issues. We maintain that these works misunderstand the relationships of multimodal entities. To tackle these, we propose a novel unified framework named Multi-grained Query-guided Set Prediction Network (MQSPN) to learn appropriate relationships at intra-entity and inter-entity levels. Specifically, MQSPN explicitly aligns textual entities with visual regions by employing a set of learnable queries to strengthen intra-entity connections. Based on distinct intra-entity modeling, MQSPN reformulates GMNER as a set prediction, guiding models to establish appropriate inter-entity relationships from a optimal global matching perspective. Additionally, we incorporate a query-guided Fusion Net (QFNet) as a glue network to boost better alignment of two-level relationships. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performances in widely used benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Graph Representation Learning via Causal Diffusion for Out-of-Distribution Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00490v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)-based recommendation algorithms typically assume that training and testing data are drawn from independent and identically distributed (IID) spaces. However, this assumption often fails in the presence of out-of-distribution (OOD) data, resulting in significant performance degradation. In this study, we construct a Structural Causal Model (SCM) to analyze interaction data, revealing that environmental confounders (e.g., the COVID-19 pandemic) lead to unstable correlations in GNN-based models, thus impairing their generalization to OOD data. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach, graph representation learning via causal diffusion (CausalDiffRec) for OOD recommendation. This method enhances the model's generalization on OOD data by eliminating environmental confounding factors and learning invariant graph representations. Specifically, we use backdoor adjustment and variational inference to infer the real environmental distribution, thereby eliminating the impact of environmental confounders. This inferred distribution is then used as prior knowledge to guide the representation learning in the reverse phase of the diffusion process to learn the invariant representation. In addition, we provide a theoretical derivation that proves optimizing the objective function of CausalDiffRec can encourage the model to learn environment-invariant graph representations, thereby achieving excellent generalization performance in recommendations under distribution shifts. Our extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of CausalDiffRec in improving the generalization of OOD data, and the average improvement is up to 10.69% on Food, 18.83% on KuaiRec, 22.41% on Yelp2018, and 11.65% on Douban datasets.</description>

Abstract: Foundation Model (FM)-based agents are revolutionizing application development across various domains. However, their rapidly growing capabilities and autonomy have raised significant concerns about AI safety. Researchers are exploring better ways to design guardrails to ensure that the runtime behavior of FM-based agents remains within specific boundaries. Nevertheless, designing effective runtime guardrails is challenging due to the agents' autonomous and non-deterministic behavior. The involvement of multiple pipeline stages and agent artifacts, such as goals, plans, tools, at runtime further complicates these issues. Addressing these challenges at runtime requires multi-layered guardrails that operate effectively at various levels of the agent architecture. Therefore, in this paper, based on the results of a systematic literature review, we present a comprehensive taxonomy of runtime guardrails for FM-based agents to identify the key quality attributes for guardrails and design dimensions. Inspired by the Swiss Cheese Model, we also propose a reference architecture for designing multi-layered runtime guardrails for FM-based agents, which includes three dimensions: quality attributes, pipelines, and artifacts. The proposed taxonomy and reference architecture provide concrete and robust guidance for researchers and practitioners to build AI-safety-by-design from a software architecture perspective.</description>

      <title>CTR-KAN: KAN for Adaptive High-Order Feature Interaction Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08713v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modeling high-order feature interactions is critical for click-through rate (CTR) prediction, yet traditional approaches often face challenges in balancing predictive accuracy and computational efficiency. These methods typically rely on pre-defined interaction orders, which limit flexibility and require extensive prior knowledge. Moreover, explicitly modeling high-order interactions can lead to significant computational overhead. To tackle these challenges, we propose CTR-KAN, an adaptive framework for efficient high-order feature interaction modeling. CTR-KAN builds upon the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) paradigm, addressing its limitations in CTR prediction tasks. Specifically, we introduce key enhancements, including a lightweight architecture that reduces the computational complexity of KAN and supports embedding-based feature representations. Additionally, CTR-KAN integrates guided symbolic regression to effectively capture multiplicative relationships, a known challenge in standard KAN implementations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CTR-KAN achieves state-of-the-art predictive accuracy with significantly lower computational costs. Its sparse network structure also facilitates feature pruning and enhances global interpretability, making CTR-KAN a powerful tool for efficient inference in real-world CTR prediction scenarios.</description>

      <title>PAT: Pruning-Aware Tuning for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14721v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel in language tasks, especially with supervised fine-tuning after pre-training. However, their substantial memory and computational requirements hinder practical applications. Structural pruning, which reduces less significant weight dimensions, is one solution. Yet, traditional post-hoc pruning often leads to significant performance loss, with limited recovery from further fine-tuning due to reduced capacity. Since the model fine-tuning refines the general and chaotic knowledge in pre-trained models, we aim to incorporate structural pruning with the fine-tuning, and propose the Pruning-Aware Tuning (PAT) paradigm to eliminate model redundancy while preserving the model performance to the maximum extend. Specifically, we insert the innovative Hybrid Sparsification Modules (HSMs) between the Attention and FFN components to accordingly sparsify the upstream and downstream linear modules. The HSM comprises a lightweight operator and a globally shared trainable mask. The lightweight operator maintains a training overhead comparable to that of LoRA, while the trainable mask unifies the channels to be sparsified, ensuring structural pruning. Additionally, we propose the Identity Loss which decouples the transformation and scaling properties of the HSMs to enhance training robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PAT excels in both performance and efficiency. For example, our Llama2-7b model with a 25\% pruning ratio achieves 1.33$\times$ speedup while outperforming the LoRA-finetuned model by up to 1.26\% in accuracy with a similar training cost.

      <title>Synthesizing Late-Stage Contrast Enhancement in Breast MRI: A Comprehensive Pipeline Leveraging Temporal Contrast Enhancement Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01596v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) is essential for breast cancer diagnosis due to its ability to characterize tissue through contrast agent kinetics. However, traditional DCE-MRI protocols require multiple imaging phases, including early and late post-contrast acquisitions, leading to prolonged scan times, patient discomfort, motion artifacts, high costs, and limited accessibility. To overcome these limitations, this study presents a pipeline for synthesizing late-phase DCE-MRI images from early-phase data, replicating the time-intensity (TI) curve behavior in enhanced regions while maintaining visual fidelity across the entire image. The proposed approach introduces a novel loss function, Time Intensity Loss (TI-loss), leveraging the temporal behavior of contrast agents to guide the training of a generative model. Additionally, a new normalization strategy, TI-norm, preserves the contrast enhancement pattern across multiple image sequences at various timestamps, addressing limitations of conventional normalization methods. Two metrics are proposed to evaluate image quality: the Contrast Agent Pattern Score ($\mathcal{CP}_{s}$), which validates enhancement patterns in annotated regions, and the Average Difference in Enhancement ($\mathcal{ED}$), measuring differences between real and generated enhancements. Using a public DCE-MRI dataset with 1.5T and 3T scanners, the proposed method demonstrates accurate synthesis of late-phase images that outperform existing models in replicating the TI curve's behavior in regions of interest while preserving overall image quality. This advancement shows a potential to optimize DCE-MRI protocols by reducing scanning time without compromising diagnostic accuracy, and bringing generative models closer to practical implementation in clinical scenarios to enhance efficiency in breast cancer imaging.</description>

      <title>A Survey on Knowledge Organization Systems of Research Fields: Resources and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04432v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Knowledge Organization Systems (KOSs), such as term lists, thesauri, taxonomies, and ontologies, play a fundamental role in categorising, managing, and retrieving information. In the academic domain, KOSs are often adopted for representing research areas and their relationships, primarily aiming to classify research articles, academic courses, patents, books, scientific venues, domain experts, grants, software, experiment materials, and several other relevant products and agents. These structured representations of research areas, widely embraced by many academic fields, have proven effective in empowering AI-based systems to i) enhance retrievability of relevant documents, ii) enable advanced analytic solutions to quantify the impact of academic research, and iii) analyse and forecast research dynamics. This paper aims to present a comprehensive survey of the current KOS for academic disciplines. We analysed and compared 45 KOSs according to five main dimensions: scope, structure, curation, usage, and links to other KOSs. Our results reveal a very heterogeneous scenario in terms of scope, scale, quality, and usage, highlighting the need for more integrated solutions for representing research knowledge across academic fields. We conclude by discussing the main challenges and the most promising future directions.</description>

      <title>PAPILLON: Efficient and Stealthy Fuzz Testing-Powered Jailbreaks for LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14866v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have excelled in various tasks but are still vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks, where attackers create jailbreak prompts to mislead the model to produce harmful or offensive content. Current jailbreak methods either rely heavily on manually crafted templates, which pose challenges in scalability and adaptability, or struggle to generate semantically coherent prompts, making them easy to detect. Additionally, most existing approaches involve lengthy prompts, leading to higher query costs.In this paper, to remedy these challenges, we introduce a novel jailbreaking attack framework called PAPILLON, which is an automated, black-box jailbreaking attack framework that adapts the black-box fuzz testing approach with a series of customized designs. Instead of relying on manually crafted templates,PAPILLON starts with an empty seed pool, removing the need to search for any related jailbreaking templates. We also develop three novel question-dependent mutation strategies using an LLM helper to generate prompts that maintain semantic coherence while significantly reducing their length. Additionally, we implement a two-level judge module to accurately detect genuine successful jailbreaks. We evaluated PAPILLON on 7 representative LLMs and compared it with 5 state-of-the-art jailbreaking attack strategies. For proprietary LLM APIs, such as GPT-3.5 turbo, GPT-4, and Gemini-Pro, PAPILLONs achieves attack success rates of over 90%, 80%, and 74%, respectively, exceeding existing baselines by more than 60\%. Additionally, PAPILLON can maintain high semantic coherence while significantly reducing the length of jailbreak prompts. When targeting GPT-4, PAPILLON can achieve over 78% attack success rate even with 100 tokens. Moreover, PAPILLON demonstrates transferability and is robust to state-of-the-art defenses.</description>

      <title>Style Outweighs Substance: Failure Modes of LLM Judges in Alignment Benchmarking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15268v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The release of ChatGPT in November 2022 sparked an explosion of interest in post-training and an avalanche of new preference optimization (PO) methods. These methods claim superior alignment by virtue of better correspondence with human pairwise preferences, often measured by LLM-judges. In this work, we attempt to answer the following question -- do LLM-judge preferences translate to progress on other, more concrete metrics for alignment, and if not, why not? We define a concrete metric for alignment, and introduce SOS-Bench (Substance Outweighs Style Benchmark), which is to the best of our knowledge the largest standardized, reproducible LLM meta-benchmark to date. We find that (1) LLM-judge preferences do not correlate with concrete measures of safety, world knowledge, and instruction following; (2) LLM-judges have powerful implicit biases, prioritizing style over factuality and safety; and (3) the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage of post-training, and not the PO stage, has the greatest impact on alignment, with data scaling and prompt diversity as the driving factors. Our codebase and complete results can be found at https://github.com/penfever/sos-bench.</description>

      <title>An Adversarial Perspective on Machine Unlearning for AI Safety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18025v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models are finetuned to refuse questions about hazardous knowledge, but these protections can often be bypassed. Unlearning methods aim at completely removing hazardous capabilities from models and make them inaccessible to adversaries. This work challenges the fundamental differences between unlearning and traditional safety post-training from an adversarial perspective. We demonstrate that existing jailbreak methods, previously reported as ineffective against unlearning, can be successful when applied carefully. Furthermore, we develop a variety of adaptive methods that recover most supposedly unlearned capabilities. For instance, we show that finetuning on 10 unrelated examples or removing specific directions in the activation space can recover most hazardous capabilities for models edited with RMU, a state-of-the-art unlearning method. Our findings challenge the robustness of current unlearning approaches and question their advantages over safety training.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Analysis of Copyright Disputes and Generative AI Safety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00475v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a probabilistic approach to analyzing copyright infringement disputes. Under this approach, evidentiary principles shaped by case law are formalized in probabilistic terms, allowing for a mathematical examination of issues arising in such disputes. The usefulness of this approach is showcased through its application to the ``inverse ratio rule'' -- a controversial legal doctrine adopted by some courts. Although this rule has faced significant criticism, a formal proof demonstrates its validity, provided it is properly defined. Furthermore, the paper employs the probabilistic approach to study the copyright safety of generative AI. Specifically, the Near Access-Free (NAF) condition, previously proposed as a strategy for mitigating the heightened copyright infringement risks of generative AI, is evaluated. The analysis reveals that, while the NAF condition mitigates some infringement risks, its justifiability and efficacy are questionable in certain contexts. These findings illustrate how taking a probabilistic perspective can enhance our understanding of copyright jurisprudence and its interaction with generative AI technology.</description>

      <title>Efficient Length-Generalizable Attention via Causal Retrieval for Long-Context Language Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01651v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the success of Transformers, handling long contexts remains challenging due to the limited length generalization and quadratic complexity of self-attention. Thus Transformers often require post-training with a larger attention window, significantly increasing computational and memory costs. In this paper, we propose a novel attention mechanism based on dynamic context, Grouped Cross Attention (GCA), which can generalize to 1000 times the pre-training context length while maintaining the ability to access distant information with a constant attention window size. For a given input sequence, we split it into chunks and use each chunk to retrieve top-k relevant past chunks for subsequent text generation. Specifically, unlike most previous works that use an off-the-shelf retriever, our key innovation allows the retriever to learn how to retrieve past chunks that better minimize the auto-regressive loss of subsequent tokens in an end-to-end manner. Such a mechanism accommodates retrieved chunks with a fixed-size attention window to achieve long-range information access, significantly reducing computational and memory costs during training and inference. Experiments show that GCA-based models achieve near-perfect accuracy in passkey retrieval for 16M context lengths, which is 1000 times the training length.</description>

      <title>Beyond correlation: The Impact of Human Uncertainty in Measuring the Effectiveness of Automatic Evaluation and LLM-as-a-Judge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03775v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The effectiveness of automatic evaluation of generative models is typically measured by comparing the labels generated via automation with labels by humans using correlation metrics. However, metrics like Krippendorff's $\alpha$ and Randolph's $\kappa$ were originally designed to measure the reliability of human labeling, thus make assumptions about typical human labeling behavior, and these assumptions may not be applicable to machine generated labels. In this paper, we show how *relying on a single aggregate correlation score* can obscure fundamental differences between human labels and those from automatic evaluation, including LLM-as-a-Judge. Specifically, we demonstrate that when the proportion of samples with variation or uncertainty in human assigned labels is relatively high, machine labels (generated by automatic evaluation methods) may superficially appear to have similar or better correlation with the human majority label compared to the human-to-human (HH) correlation. This can create the illusion that labels from automatic evaluation approximates the human majority label. However, as the proportion of samples with consistent human labels increases, the correlation between machine and human labels fall well below HH correlation. Based on these findings, we first propose stratifying data by human label uncertainty to provide a more robust analysis of automatic evaluation performance. Second, recognizing that uncertainty and variation are inherent in perception-based human evaluations, such as those involving attitudes or preferences, we introduce a new metric - binned Jensen-Shannon Divergence for perception for such scenarios to better measure the effectiveness of automatic evaluations. We present visualization techniques -- perception charts, to contextualize correlation measures appropriately. We have open-sourced at https://github.com/amazon-science/BeyondCorrelation.</description>

Abstract: As generative artificial intelligence (AI) continues its ballistic trajectory, everything from text to audio, image, and video generation continues to improve at mimicking human-generated content. Through a series of perceptual studies, we report on the realism of AI-generated voices in terms of identity matching and naturalness. We find human participants cannot consistently identify recordings of AI-generated voices. Specifically, participants perceived the identity of an AI-voice to be the same as its real counterpart approximately 80% of the time, and correctly identified a voice as AI generated only about 60% of the time.</description>

      <title>Revisiting In-context Learning Inference Circuit in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04468v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In-context Learning (ICL) is an emerging few-shot learning paradigm on Language Models (LMs) with inner mechanisms un-explored. There are already existing works describing the inner processing of ICL, while they struggle to capture all the inference phenomena in large language models. Therefore, this paper proposes a comprehensive circuit to model the inference dynamics and try to explain the observed phenomena of ICL. In detail, we divide ICL inference into 3 major operations: (1) Input Text Encode: LMs encode every input text (demonstrations and queries) into linear representation in the hidden states with sufficient information to solve ICL tasks. (2) Semantics Merge: LMs merge the encoded representations of demonstrations with their corresponding label tokens to produce joint representations of labels and demonstrations. (3) Feature Retrieval and Copy: LMs search the joint representations similar to the query representation on a task subspace, and copy the searched representations into the query. Then, language model heads capture these copied label representations to a certain extent and decode them into predicted labels. The proposed inference circuit successfully captured many phenomena observed during the ICL process, making it a comprehensive and practical explanation of the ICL inference process. Moreover, ablation analysis by disabling the proposed steps seriously damages the ICL performance, suggesting the proposed inference circuit is a dominating mechanism. Additionally, we confirm and list some bypass mechanisms that solve ICL tasks in parallel with the proposed circuit.</description>

      <title>Multi-Tiered Self-Contrastive Learning for Medical Microwave Radiometry (MWR) Breast Cancer Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04636v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Improving breast cancer detection and monitoring techniques is a critical objective in healthcare, driving the need for innovative imaging technologies and diagnostic approaches. This study introduces a novel multi-tiered self-contrastive model tailored for microwave radiometry (MWR) in breast cancer detection. Our approach incorporates three distinct models: Local-MWR (L-MWR), Regional-MWR (R-MWR), and Global-MWR (G-MWR), designed to analyze varying sub-regional comparisons within the breasts. These models are integrated through the Joint-MWR (J-MWR) network, which leverages self-contrastive results at each analytical level to improve diagnostic accuracy. Utilizing a dataset of 4,932 female patients, our research demonstrates the efficacy of our proposed models. Notably, the J-MWR model achieves a Matthew's correlation coefficient of 0.74 $\pm$ 0.018, surpassing existing MWR neural networks and contrastive methods. These findings highlight the potential of self-contrastive learning techniques in improving the diagnostic accuracy and generalizability for MWR-based breast cancer detection. This advancement holds considerable promise for future investigations into enabling point-of-care testing.

      <title>Towards Robust Spacecraft Trajectory Optimization via Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05585v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Future multi-spacecraft missions require robust autonomous trajectory optimization capabilities to ensure safe and efficient rendezvous operations. This capability hinges on solving non-convex optimal control problems in real-time, although traditional iterative methods such as sequential convex programming impose significant computational challenges. To mitigate this burden, the Autonomous Rendezvous Transformer (ART) introduced a generative model trained to provide near-optimal initial guesses. This approach provides convergence to better local optima (e.g., fuel optimality), improves feasibility rates, and results in faster convergence speed of optimization algorithms through warm-starting. This work extends the capabilities of ART to address robust chance-constrained optimal control problems. Specifically, ART is applied to challenging rendezvous scenarios in Low Earth Orbit (LEO), ensuring fault-tolerant behavior under uncertainty. Through extensive experimentation, the proposed warm-starting strategy is shown to consistently produce high-quality reference trajectories, achieving up to 30\% cost improvement and 50\% reduction in infeasible cases compared to conventional methods, demonstrating robust performance across multiple state representations. Additionally, a post hoc evaluation framework is proposed to assess the quality of generated trajectories and mitigate runtime failures, marking an initial step toward the reliable deployment of AI-driven solutions in safety-critical autonomous systems such as spacecraft.</description>

      <title>TEOChat: A Large Vision-Language Assistant for Temporal Earth Observation Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06234v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large vision and language assistants have enabled new capabilities for interpreting natural images. These approaches have recently been adapted to earth observation data, but they are only able to handle single image inputs, limiting their use for many real-world tasks. In this work, we develop a new vision and language assistant called TEOChat that can engage in conversations about temporal sequences of earth observation data. To train TEOChat, we curate an instruction-following dataset composed of many single image and temporal tasks including building change and damage assessment, semantic change detection, and temporal scene classification. We show that TEOChat can perform a wide variety of spatial and temporal reasoning tasks, substantially outperforming previous vision and language assistants, and even achieving comparable or better performance than several specialist models trained to perform specific tasks. Furthermore, TEOChat achieves impressive zero-shot performance on a change detection and change question answering dataset, outperforms GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro on multiple temporal tasks, and exhibits stronger single image capabilities than a comparable single image instruction-following model on scene classification, visual question answering, and captioning. We publicly release our data, model, and code at https://github.com/ermongroup/TEOChat .</description>

      <title>Learning Evolving Tools for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06617v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tool learning enables large language models (LLMs) to interact with external tools and APIs, greatly expanding the application scope of LLMs. However, due to the dynamic nature of external environments, these tools and APIs may become outdated over time, preventing LLMs from correctly invoking tools. Existing research primarily focuses on static environments and overlooks this issue, limiting the adaptability of LLMs in real-world applications. In this paper, we propose ToolEVO, a novel framework designed to enhance the adaptive and reflective capabilities of LLMs against tool variability. By leveraging Monte Carlo Tree Search, ToolEVO facilitates active exploration and interaction of LLMs within dynamic environments, allowing for autonomous self-reflection and self-updating of tool usage based on environmental feedback. Additionally, we introduce ToolQA-D, a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the impact of tool variability. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and stability of our approach, highlighting the importance of adaptability to tool variability for effective tool learning.

      <title>Learning to Summarize from LLM-generated Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13116v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Developing effective text summarizers remains a challenge due to issues like hallucinations, key information omissions, and verbosity in LLM-generated summaries. This work explores using LLM-generated feedback to improve summary quality by aligning the summaries with human preferences for faithfulness, completeness, and conciseness. We introduce FeedSum, a large-scale dataset containing multi-dimensional LLM feedback on summaries of varying quality across diverse domains. Our experiments show how feedback quality, dimensionality, and granularity influence preference learning, revealing that high-quality, multi-dimensional, fine-grained feedback significantly improves summary generation. We also compare two methods for using this feedback: supervised fine-tuning and direct preference optimization. Finally, we introduce SummLlama3-8b, a model that outperforms the nearly 10x larger Llama3-70b-instruct in generating human-preferred summaries, demonstrating that smaller models can achieve superior performance with appropriate training. The full dataset and SummLlama3-8B model are available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/DISLab/FeedSum and https://huggingface.co/DISLab/SummLlama3-8B.</description>

      <title>CBT-Bench: Evaluating Large Language Models on Assisting Cognitive Behavior Therapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13218v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is a significant gap between patient needs and available mental health support today. In this paper, we aim to thoroughly examine the potential of using Large Language Models (LLMs) to assist professional psychotherapy. To this end, we propose a new benchmark, CBT-BENCH, for the systematic evaluation of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) assistance. We include three levels of tasks in CBT-BENCH: I: Basic CBT knowledge acquisition, with the task of multiple-choice questions; II: Cognitive model understanding, with the tasks of cognitive distortion classification, primary core belief classification, and fine-grained core belief classification; III: Therapeutic response generation, with the task of generating responses to patient speech in CBT therapy sessions. These tasks encompass key aspects of CBT that could potentially be enhanced through AI assistance, while also outlining a hierarchy of capability requirements, ranging from basic knowledge recitation to engaging in real therapeutic conversations. We evaluated representative LLMs on our benchmark. Experimental results indicate that while LLMs perform well in reciting CBT knowledge, they fall short in complex real-world scenarios requiring deep analysis of patients' cognitive structures and generating effective responses, suggesting potential future work.</description>

      <title>Agent Skill Acquisition for Large Language Models via CycleQD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14735v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Training large language models to acquire specific skills remains a challenging endeavor. Conventional training approaches often struggle with data distribution imbalances and inadequacies in objective functions that do not align well with task-specific performance. To address these challenges, we introduce CycleQD, a novel approach that leverages the Quality Diversity framework through a cyclic adaptation of the algorithm, along with a model merging based crossover and an SVD-based mutation. In CycleQD, each task's performance metric is alternated as the quality measure while the others serve as the behavioral characteristics. This cyclic focus on individual tasks allows for concentrated effort on one task at a time, eliminating the need for data ratio tuning and simplifying the design of the objective function. Empirical results from AgentBench indicate that applying CycleQD to LLAMA3-8B-INSTRUCT based models not only enables them to surpass traditional fine-tuning methods in coding, operating systems, and database tasks, but also achieves performance on par with GPT-3.5-TURBO, which potentially contains much more parameters, across these domains. Crucially, this enhanced performance is achieved while retaining robust language capabilities, as evidenced by its performance on widely adopted language benchmark tasks. We highlight the key design choices in CycleQD, detailing how these contribute to its effectiveness. Furthermore, our method is general and can be applied to image segmentation models, highlighting its applicability across different domains.</description>

      <title>Towards Kriging-informed Conditional Diffusion for Regional Sea-Level Data Downscaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15628v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given coarser-resolution projections from global climate models or satellite data, the downscaling problem aims to estimate finer-resolution regional climate data, capturing fine-scale spatial patterns and variability. Downscaling is any method to derive high-resolution data from low-resolution variables, often to provide more detailed and local predictions and analyses. This problem is societally crucial for effective adaptation, mitigation, and resilience against significant risks from climate change. The challenge arises from spatial heterogeneity and the need to recover finer-scale features while ensuring model generalization. Most downscaling methods \cite{Li2020} fail to capture the spatial dependencies at finer scales and underperform on real-world climate datasets, such as sea-level rise. We propose a novel Kriging-informed Conditional Diffusion Probabilistic Model (Ki-CDPM) to capture spatial variability while preserving fine-scale features. Experimental results on climate data show that our proposed method is more accurate than state-of-the-art downscaling techniques.</description>

      <title>SimRAG: Self-Improving Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Adapting Large Language Models to Specialized Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17952v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances the question-answering (QA) abilities of large language models (LLMs) by integrating external knowledge. However, adapting general-purpose RAG systems to specialized fields such as science and medicine poses unique challenges due to distribution shifts and limited access to domain-specific data. To tackle this, we propose SimRAG, a self-training approach that equips the LLM with joint capabilities of question answering and question generation for domain adaptation. Our method first fine-tunes the LLM on instruction-following, question-answering, and search-related data. Then, it prompts the same LLM to generate diverse domain-relevant questions from unlabeled corpora, with an additional filtering strategy to retain high-quality synthetic examples. By leveraging these self-generated synthetic examples, the LLM can improve their performance on domain-specific RAG tasks. Experiments on 11 datasets, spanning two backbone sizes and three domains, demonstrate that SimRAG outperforms baselines by 1.2\%--8.6\%.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Mixture of Experts: Generalizable Learning for High-Level Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19225v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-level synthesis (HLS) is a widely used tool in designing Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). HLS enables FPGA design with software programming languages by compiling the source code into an FPGA circuit. The source code includes a program (called ``kernel'') and several pragmas that instruct hardware synthesis, such as parallelization, pipeline, etc. While it is relatively easy for software developers to design the program, it heavily relies on hardware knowledge to design the pragmas, posing a big challenge for software developers. Recently, different machine learning algorithms, such as GNNs, have been proposed to automate the pragma design via performance prediction. However, when applying the trained model on new kernels, the significant domain shift often leads to unsatisfactory performance. We propose a more domain-generalizable model structure: a two-level hierarchical Mixture of Experts (MoE), that can be flexibly adapted to any GNN model. Different expert networks can learn to deal with different regions in the representation space, and they can utilize similar patterns between the old kernels and new kernels. In the low-level MoE, we apply MoE on three natural granularities of a program: node, basic block, and graph. The high-level MoE learns to aggregate the three granularities for the final decision. To stably train the hierarchical MoE, we further propose a two-stage training method. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of the hierarchical MoE.</description>

      <title>From Cool Demos to Production-Ready FMware: Core Challenges and a Technology Roadmap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20791v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid expansion of foundation models (FMs), such as large language models (LLMs), has given rise to FMware--software systems that integrate FMs as core components. While building demonstration-level FMware is relatively straightforward, transitioning to production-ready systems presents numerous challenges, including reliability, high implementation costs, scalability, and compliance with privacy regulations. Our paper conducts a semi-structured thematic synthesis to identify the key challenges in productionizing FMware across diverse data sources including our own industry experience in developing FMArts--a FMware lifecycle engineering platform and integrating it into Huawei cloud, grey literature, academic publications, hands-on involvement in the Open Platform for Enterprise AI (OPEA), organizing the AIware conference and Bootcamp, and co-leading the ISO SPDX SBOM working group on AI and datasets. We identify critical issues in FM selection, data and model alignment, prompt engineering, agent orchestration, system testing, and deployment, alongside cross-cutting concerns such as memory management, observability, and feedback integration. We discuss needed technologies and strategies to address these challenges and offer guidance on how to enable the transition from demonstration systems to scalable, production-ready FMware solutions. Our findings underscore the importance of continued research and multi-industry collaboration to advance the development of production-ready FMware.</description>

      <title>BitStack: Any-Size Compression of Large Language Models in Variable Memory Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23918v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized numerous applications, yet their deployment remains challenged by memory constraints on local devices. While scaling laws have enhanced LLM capabilities, the primary bottleneck has shifted from \textit{capability} to \textit{availability}, emphasizing the need for efficient memory management. Traditional compression methods, such as quantization, often require predefined compression ratios and separate compression processes for each setting, complicating deployment in variable memory environments. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{BitStack}, a novel, training-free weight compression approach that enables megabyte-level trade-offs between memory usage and model performance. By leveraging weight decomposition, BitStack can dynamically adjust the model size with minimal transmission between running memory and storage devices. Our approach iteratively decomposes weight matrices while considering the significance of each parameter, resulting in an approximately 1-bit per parameter residual block in each decomposition iteration. These blocks are sorted and stacked in storage as basic transmission units, with different quantities loaded based on current memory availability. Extensive experiments across a wide range of tasks demonstrate that, despite offering fine-grained size control, BitStack consistently matches or surpasses strong quantization baselines, particularly at extreme compression ratios. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first decomposition-based method that effectively bridges the gap to practical compression techniques like quantization. Code is available at https://github.com/xinghaow99/BitStack.</description>

      <title>B-cosification: Transforming Deep Neural Networks to be Inherently Interpretable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00715v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: B-cos Networks have been shown to be effective for obtaining highly human interpretable explanations of model decisions by architecturally enforcing stronger alignment between inputs and weight. B-cos variants of convolutional networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs), which primarily replace linear layers with B-cos transformations, perform competitively to their respective standard variants while also yielding explanations that are faithful by design. However, it has so far been necessary to train these models from scratch, which is increasingly infeasible in the era of large, pre-trained foundation models. In this work, inspired by the architectural similarities in standard DNNs and B-cos networks, we propose 'B-cosification', a novel approach to transform existing pre-trained models to become inherently interpretable. We perform a thorough study of design choices to perform this conversion, both for convolutional neural networks and vision transformers. We find that B-cosification can yield models that are on par with B-cos models trained from scratch in terms of interpretability, while often outperforming them in terms of classification performance at a fraction of the training cost. Subsequently, we apply B-cosification to a pretrained CLIP model, and show that, even with limited data and compute cost, we obtain a B-cosified version that is highly interpretable and competitive on zero shot performance across a variety of datasets. We release our code and pre-trained model weights at https://github.com/shrebox/B-cosification.</description>

      <title>MambaPEFT: Exploring Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning for Mamba</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03855v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An ecosystem of Transformer-based models has been established by building large models with extensive data. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) is a crucial technology for deploying these models to downstream tasks with minimal cost while achieving effective performance. Recently, Mamba, a State Space Model (SSM)-based model, has attracted attention as a potential alternative to Transformers. While many large-scale Mamba-based models have been proposed, efficiently adapting pre-trained Mamba-based models to downstream tasks remains unexplored. In this paper, we conduct an exploratory analysis of PEFT methods for Mamba. We investigate the effectiveness of existing PEFT methods for Transformers when applied to Mamba. We also modify these methods to better align with the Mamba architecture. Additionally, we propose new Mamba-specific PEFT methods that leverage the distinctive structure of Mamba. Our experiments indicate that PEFT performs more effectively for Mamba than Transformers. Lastly, we demonstrate how to effectively combine multiple PEFT methods and provide a framework that outperforms previous works. To ensure reproducibility, we will release the code after publication.</description>

      <title>From Dashcam Videos to Driving Simulations: Stress Testing Automated Vehicles against Rare Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16027v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Testing Automated Driving Systems (ADS) in simulation with realistic driving scenarios is important for verifying their performance. However, converting real-world driving videos into simulation scenarios is a significant challenge due to the complexity of interpreting high-dimensional video data and the time-consuming nature of precise manual scenario reconstruction. In this work, we propose a novel framework that automates the conversion of real-world car crash videos into detailed simulation scenarios for ADS testing. Our approach leverages prompt-engineered Video Language Models(VLM) to transform dashcam footage into SCENIC scripts, which define the environment and driving behaviors in the CARLA simulator, enabling the generation of realistic simulation scenarios. Importantly, rather than solely aiming for one-to-one scenario reconstruction, our framework focuses on capturing the essential driving behaviors from the original video while offering flexibility in parameters such as weather or road conditions to facilitate search-based testing. Additionally, we introduce a similarity metric that helps iteratively refine the generated scenario through feedback by comparing key features of driving behaviors between the real and simulated videos. Our preliminary results demonstrate substantial time efficiency, finishing the real-to-sim conversion in minutes with full automation and no human intervention, while maintaining high fidelity to the original driving events.</description>

      <title>Cooperative Cruising: Reinforcement Learning-Based Time-Headway Control for Increased Traffic Efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02520v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The proliferation of connected automated vehicles represents an unprecedented opportunity for improving driving efficiency and alleviating traffic congestion. However, existing research fails to address realistic multi-lane highway scenarios without assuming connectivity, perception, and control capabilities that are typically unavailable in current vehicles. This paper proposes a novel AI system that is the first to improve highway traffic efficiency compared with human-like traffic in realistic, simulated multi-lane scenarios, while relying on existing connectivity, perception, and control capabilities. At the core of our approach is a reinforcement learning based controller that dynamically communicates time-headways to automated vehicles near bottlenecks based on real-time traffic conditions. These desired time-headways are then used by adaptive cruise control (ACC) systems to adjust their following distance. By (i) integrating existing traffic estimation technology and low-bandwidth vehicle-to-infrastructure connectivity, (ii) leveraging safety-certified ACC systems, and (iii) targeting localized bottleneck challenges that can be addressed independently in different locations, we propose a potentially practical, safe, and scalable system that can positively impact numerous road users.</description>

      <title>{\lambda}: A Benchmark for Data-Efficiency in Long-Horizon Indoor Mobile Manipulation Robotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05313v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficiently learning and executing long-horizon mobile manipulation (MoMa) tasks is crucial for advancing robotics in household and workplace settings. However, current MoMa models are data-inefficient, underscoring the need for improved models that require realistic-sized benchmarks to evaluate their efficiency, which do not exist. To address this, we introduce the LAMBDA ({\lambda}) benchmark (Long-horizon Actions for Mobile-manipulation Benchmarking of Directed Activities), which evaluates the data efficiency of models on language-conditioned, long-horizon, multi-room, multi-floor, pick-and-place tasks using a dataset of manageable size, more feasible for collection. The benchmark includes 571 human-collected demonstrations that provide realism and diversity in simulated and real-world settings. Unlike planner-generated data, these trajectories offer natural variability and replay-verifiability, ensuring robust learning and evaluation. We benchmark several models, including learning-based models and a neuro-symbolic modular approach combining foundation models with task and motion planning. Learning-based models show suboptimal success rates, even when leveraging pretrained weights, underscoring significant data inefficiencies. However, the neuro-symbolic approach performs significantly better while being more data efficient. Findings highlight the need for more data-efficient learning-based MoMa approaches. {\lambda} addresses this gap by serving as a key benchmark for evaluating the data efficiency of those future models in handling household robotics tasks.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Chain-of-Thought from the Perspective of Self-Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10827v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning has emerged as an effective approach for activating latent capabilities in LLMs. Interestingly, we observe that both CoT reasoning and self-training share the core objective: iteratively leveraging model-generated information to progressively reduce prediction uncertainty. Building on this insight, we propose a novel CoT framework to improve reasoning performance. Our framework integrates two key components: (i) a task-specific prompt module that optimizes the initial reasoning process, and (ii) an adaptive reasoning iteration module that dynamically refines the reasoning process and addresses the limitations of previous CoT approaches, \ie over-reasoning and high similarity between consecutive reasoning iterations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves significant advantages in both performance and computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Implicit Location-Caption Alignment via Complementary Masking for Weakly-Supervised Dense Video Captioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12791v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Weakly-Supervised Dense Video Captioning (WSDVC) aims to localize and describe all events of interest in a video without requiring annotations of event boundaries. This setting poses a great challenge in accurately locating the temporal location of event, as the relevant supervision is unavailable. Existing methods rely on explicit alignment constraints between event locations and captions, which involve complex event proposal procedures during both training and inference. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel implicit location-caption alignment paradigm by complementary masking, which simplifies the complex event proposal and localization process while maintaining effectiveness. Specifically, our model comprises two components: a dual-mode video captioning module and a mask generation module. The dual-mode video captioning module captures global event information and generates descriptive captions, while the mask generation module generates differentiable positive and negative masks for localizing the events. These masks enable the implicit alignment of event locations and captions by ensuring that captions generated from positively and negatively masked videos are complementary, thereby forming a complete video description. In this way, even under weak supervision, the event location and event caption can be aligned implicitly. Extensive experiments on the public datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing weakly-supervised methods and achieves competitive results compared to fully-supervised methods.</description>

      <title>Crabs: Consuming Resrouce via Auto-generation for LLM-DoS Attack under Black-box Settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13879v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across diverse tasks. LLMs continue to be vulnerable to external threats, particularly Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks. Specifically, LLM-DoS attacks aim to exhaust computational resources and block services. However, prior works tend to focus on performing white-box attacks, overlooking black-box settings. In this work, we propose an automated algorithm designed for black-box LLMs, called Auto-Generation for LLM-DoS Attack (AutoDoS). AutoDoS introduces DoS Attack Tree and optimizes the prompt node coverage to enhance effectiveness under black-box conditions. Our method can bypass existing defense with enhanced stealthiness via semantic improvement of prompt nodes. Furthermore, we reveal that implanting Length Trojan in Basic DoS Prompt aids in achieving higher attack efficacy. Experimental results show that AutoDoS amplifies service response latency by over 250 $\times \uparrow$, leading to severe resource consumption in terms of GPU utilization and memory usage. Our code is available at https://github.com/shuita2333/AutoDoS.</description>

      <title>WiFi CSI Based Temporal Activity Detection via Dual Pyramid Network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16233v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the challenge of WiFi-based temporal activity detection and propose an efficient Dual Pyramid Network that integrates Temporal Signal Semantic Encoders and Local Sensitive Response Encoders. The Temporal Signal Semantic Encoder splits feature learning into high and low-frequency components, using a novel Signed Mask-Attention mechanism to emphasize important areas and downplay unimportant ones, with the features fused using ContraNorm. The Local Sensitive Response Encoder captures fluctuations without learning. These feature pyramids are then combined using a new cross-attention fusion mechanism. We also introduce a dataset with over 2,114 activity segments across 553 WiFi CSI samples, each lasting around 85 seconds. Extensive experiments show our method outperforms challenging baselines.</description>

      <title>FedTLU: Federated Learning with Targeted Layer Updates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17692v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) addresses privacy concerns in training language models by enabling multiple clients to contribute to the training, without sending their data to others. However, non-IID (identically and independently distributed) data across clients often limits FL's performance. This issue is especially challenging during model fine-tuning, as noise due to variations in clients' data distributions can harm model convergence near stationary points. This paper proposes a targeted layer update strategy for fine-tuning in FL. Instead of randomly updating layers of the language model, as often done in practice, we use a scoring mechanism to identify and update the most critical layers, avoiding excessively noisy or even poisoned updates by freezing the parameters in other layers. We show in extensive experiments that our method improves convergence and performance in non-IID settings, offering a more efficient approach to fine-tuning federated language models.</description>

      <title>TextMatch: Enhancing Image-Text Consistency Through Multimodal Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18185v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Text-to-image generative models excel in creating images from text but struggle with ensuring alignment and consistency between outputs and prompts. This paper introduces TextMatch, a novel framework that leverages multimodal optimization to address image-text discrepancies in text-to-image (T2I) generation and editing. TextMatch employs a scoring strategy powered by large language models (LLMs) and visual question-answering (VQA) models to evaluate semantic consistency between prompts and generated images. By integrating multimodal in-context learning and chain of thought reasoning, our method dynamically refines prompts through iterative optimization. This process ensures that the generated images better capture user intent of, resulting in higher fidelity and relevance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TextMatch significantly improves text-image consistency across multiple benchmarks, establishing a reliable framework for advancing the capabilities of text-to-image generative models. Our code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/TextMatch-F55C/.</description>

      <title>DeepCRCEval: Revisiting the Evaluation of Code Review Comment Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18291v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Code review is a vital but demanding aspect of software development, generating significant interest in automating review comments. Traditional evaluation methods for these comments, primarily based on text similarity, face two major challenges: inconsistent reliability of human-authored comments in open-source projects and the weak correlation of text similarity with objectives like enhancing code quality and detecting defects.
  This study empirically analyzes benchmark comments using a novel set of criteria informed by prior research and developer interviews. We then similarly revisit the evaluation of existing methodologies. Our evaluation framework, DeepCRCEval, integrates human evaluators and Large Language Models (LLMs) for a comprehensive reassessment of current techniques based on the criteria set. Besides, we also introduce an innovative and efficient baseline, LLM-Reviewer, leveraging the few-shot learning capabilities of LLMs for a target-oriented comparison.
  Our research highlights the limitations of text similarity metrics, finding that less than 10% of benchmark comments are high quality for automation. In contrast, DeepCRCEval effectively distinguishes between high and low-quality comments, proving to be a more reliable evaluation mechanism. Incorporating LLM evaluators into DeepCRCEval significantly boosts efficiency, reducing time and cost by 88.78% and 90.32%, respectively. Furthermore, LLM-Reviewer demonstrates significant potential of focusing task real targets in comment generation.</description>

      <title>DynaGRAG | Exploring the Topology of Information for Advancing Language Understanding and Generation in Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18644v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GRAG or Graph RAG) architectures aim to enhance language understanding and generation by leveraging external knowledge. However, effectively capturing and integrating the rich semantic information present in textual and structured data remains a challenge. To address this, a novel GRAG framework, Dynamic Graph Retrieval-Agumented Generation (DynaGRAG), is proposed to focus on enhancing subgraph representation and diversity within the knowledge graph. By improving graph density, capturing entity and relation information more effectively, and dynamically prioritizing relevant and diverse subgraphs and information within them, the proposed approach enables a more comprehensive understanding of the underlying semantic structure. This is achieved through a combination of de-duplication processes, two-step mean pooling of embeddings, query-aware retrieval considering unique nodes, and a Dynamic Similarity-Aware BFS (DSA-BFS) traversal algorithm. Integrating Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) through hard prompting further enhances the learning of rich node and edge representations while preserving the hierarchical subgraph structure. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of DynaGRAG, showcasing the significance of enhanced subgraph representation and diversity for improved language understanding and generation.</description>

      <title>Ister: Inverted Seasonal-Trend Decomposition Transformer for Explainable Multivariate Time Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18798v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In long-term time series forecasting, Transformer-based models have achieved great success, due to its ability to capture long-range dependencies. However, existing models face challenges in identifying critical components for prediction, leading to limited interpretability and suboptimal performance. To address these issues, we propose the Inverted Seasonal-Trend Decomposition Transformer (Ister), a novel Transformer-based model for multivariate time series forecasting. Ister decomposes time series into seasonal and trend components, further modeling multi-periodicity and inter-series dependencies using a Dual Transformer architecture. We introduce a novel Dot-attention mechanism that improves interpretability, computational efficiency, and predictive accuracy. Comprehensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that Ister outperforms existing state-of-the-art models, achieving up to 10% improvement in MSE. Moreover, Ister enables intuitive visualization of component contributions, shedding lights on model's decision process and enhancing transparency in prediction results.</description>

Abstract: Quinn et al propose challenge datasets in their work called ``Kryptonite-N". These datasets aim to counter the universal function approximation argument of machine learning, breaking the notation that machine learning can ``approximate any continuous function" \cite{original_paper}. Our work refutes this claim and shows that universal function approximations can be applied successfully; the Kryptonite datasets are constructed predictably, allowing logistic regression with sufficient polynomial expansion and L1 regularization to solve for any dimension N.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01454v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Infectious diseases remain a critical global health challenge, and the integration of standardized ontologies plays a vital role in managing related data. The Infectious Disease Ontology (IDO) and its extensions, such as the Coronavirus Infectious Disease Ontology (CIDO), are essential for organizing and disseminating information related to infectious diseases. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the need for updating IDO and its virus-specific extensions. There is an additional need to update IDO extensions specific to bacteria, fungus, and parasite infectious diseases. We adopt the "hub and spoke" methodology to generate pathogen-specific extensions of IDO: Virus Infectious Disease Ontology (VIDO), Bacteria Infectious Disease Ontology (BIDO), Mycosis Infectious Disease Ontology (MIDO), and Parasite Infectious Disease Ontology (PIDO). The creation of pathogen-specific reference ontologies advances modularization and reusability of infectious disease data within the IDO ecosystem. Future work will focus on further refining these ontologies, creating new extensions, and developing application ontologies based on them, in line with ongoing efforts to standardize biological and biomedical terminologies for improved data sharing and analysis.</description>

      <title>MoColl: Agent-Based Specific and General Model Collaboration for Image Captioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01834v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Image captioning is a critical task at the intersection of computer vision and natural language processing, with wide-ranging applications across various domains. For complex tasks such as diagnostic report generation, deep learning models require not only domain-specific image-caption datasets but also the incorporation of relevant general knowledge to provide contextual accuracy. Existing approaches exhibit inherent limitations: specialized models excel in capturing domain-specific details but lack generalization, while vision-language models (VLMs) built on large language models (LLMs) leverage general knowledge but struggle with domain-specific adaptation. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel agent-enhanced model collaboration framework, which we call MoColl, designed to effectively integrate domain-specific and general knowledge. Specifically, our approach is to decompose complex image captioning tasks into a series of interconnected question-answer subtasks. A trainable visual question answering (VQA) model is employed as a specialized tool to focus on domain-specific visual analysis, answering task-specific questions based on image content. Concurrently, an LLM-based agent with general knowledge formulates these questions and synthesizes the resulting question-answer pairs into coherent captions. Beyond its role in leveraging the VQA model, the agent further guides its training to enhance its domain-specific capabilities. Experimental results on radiology report generation validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, demonstrating significant improvements in the quality of generated reports.</description>

      <title>Plasma-CycleGAN: Plasma Biomarker-Guided MRI to PET Cross-modality Translation Using Conditional CycleGAN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02146v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cross-modality translation between MRI and PET imaging is challenging due to the distinct mechanisms underlying these modalities. Blood-based biomarkers (BBBMs) are revolutionizing Alzheimer's disease (AD) detection by identifying patients and quantifying brain amyloid levels. However, the potential of BBBMs to enhance PET image synthesis remains unexplored. In this paper, we performed a thorough study on the effect of incorporating BBBM into deep generative models. By evaluating three widely used cross-modality translation models, we found that BBBMs integration consistently enhances the generative quality across all models. By visual inspection of the generated results, we observed that PET images generated by CycleGAN exhibit the best visual fidelity. Based on these findings, we propose Plasma-CycleGAN, a novel generative model based on CycleGAN, to synthesize PET images from MRI using BBBMs as conditions. This is the first approach to integrate BBBMs in conditional cross-modality translation between MRI and PET.</description>

      <title>AlgoRxplorers | Precision in Mutation -- Enhancing Drug Design with Advanced Protein Stability Prediction Tools</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07014v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Predicting the impact of single-point amino acid mutations on protein stability is essential for understanding disease mechanisms and advancing drug development. Protein stability, quantified by changes in Gibbs free energy ($\Delta\Delta G$), is influenced by these mutations. However, the scarcity of data and the complexity of model interpretation pose challenges in accurately predicting stability changes. This study proposes the application of deep neural networks, leveraging transfer learning and fusing complementary information from different models, to create a feature-rich representation of the protein stability landscape. We developed four models, with our third model, ThermoMPNN+, demonstrating the best performance in predicting $\Delta\Delta G$ values. This approach, which integrates diverse feature sets and embeddings through latent transfusion techniques, aims to refine $\Delta\Delta G$ predictions and contribute to a deeper understanding of protein dynamics, potentially leading to advancements in disease research and drug discovery.</description>

      <title>PokerBench: Training Large Language Models to become Professional Poker Players</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08328v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce PokerBench - a benchmark for evaluating the poker-playing abilities of large language models (LLMs). As LLMs excel in traditional NLP tasks, their application to complex, strategic games like poker poses a new challenge. Poker, an incomplete information game, demands a multitude of skills such as mathematics, reasoning, planning, strategy, and a deep understanding of game theory and human psychology. This makes Poker the ideal next frontier for large language models. PokerBench consists of a comprehensive compilation of 11,000 most important scenarios, split between pre-flop and post-flop play, developed in collaboration with trained poker players. We evaluate prominent models including GPT-4, ChatGPT 3.5, and various Llama and Gemma series models, finding that all state-of-the-art LLMs underperform in playing optimal poker. However, after fine-tuning, these models show marked improvements. We validate PokerBench by having models with different scores compete with each other, demonstrating that higher scores on PokerBench lead to higher win rates in actual poker games. Through gameplay between our fine-tuned model and GPT-4, we also identify limitations of simple supervised fine-tuning for learning optimal playing strategy, suggesting the need for more advanced methodologies for effectively training language models to excel in games. PokerBench thus presents a unique benchmark for a quick and reliable evaluation of the poker-playing ability of LLMs as well as a comprehensive benchmark to study the progress of LLMs in complex game-playing scenarios.</description>

      <title>Text-driven Adaptation of Foundation Models for Few-shot Surgical Workflow Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09555v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Purpose: Surgical workflow analysis is crucial for improving surgical efficiency and safety. However, previous studies rely heavily on large-scale annotated datasets, posing challenges in cost, scalability, and reliance on expert annotations. To address this, we propose Surg-FTDA (Few-shot Text-driven Adaptation), designed to handle various surgical workflow analysis tasks with minimal paired image-label data.
  Methods: Our approach has two key components. First, Few-shot selection-based modality alignment selects a small subset of images and aligns their embeddings with text embeddings from the downstream task, bridging the modality gap. Second, Text-driven adaptation leverages only text data to train a decoder, eliminating the need for paired image-text data. This decoder is then applied to aligned image embeddings, enabling image-related tasks without explicit image-text pairs.
  Results: We evaluate our approach to generative tasks (image captioning) and discriminative tasks (triplet recognition and phase recognition). Results show that Surg-FTDA outperforms baselines and generalizes well across downstream tasks.
  Conclusion: We propose a text-driven adaptation approach that mitigates the modality gap and handles multiple downstream tasks in surgical workflow analysis, with minimal reliance on large annotated datasets. The code and dataset will be released in https://github.com/CAMMA-public/Surg-FTDA</description>

      <title>Multiple Choice Questions: Reasoning Makes Large Language Models (LLMs) More Self-Confident Even When They Are Wrong</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09775v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the most widely used methods to evaluate LLMs are Multiple Choice Question (MCQ) tests. MCQ benchmarks enable the testing of LLM knowledge on almost any topic at scale as the results can be processed automatically. To help the LLM answer, a few examples called few shots can be included in the prompt. Moreover, the LLM can be asked to answer the question directly with the selected option or to first provide the reasoning and then the selected answer, which is known as chain of thought. In addition to checking whether the selected answer is correct, the evaluation can look at the LLM-estimated probability of its response as an indication of the confidence of the LLM in the response. In this paper, we study how the LLM confidence in its answer depends on whether the model has been asked to answer directly or to provide the reasoning before answering. The results of the evaluation of questions on a wide range of topics in seven different models show that LLMs are more confident in their answers when they provide reasoning before the answer. This occurs regardless of whether the selected answer is correct. Our hypothesis is that this behavior is due to the reasoning that modifies the probability of the selected answer, as the LLM predicts the answer based on the input question and the reasoning that supports the selection made. Therefore, LLM estimated probabilities seem to have intrinsic limitations that should be understood in order to use them in evaluation procedures. Interestingly, the same behavior has been observed in humans, for whom explaining an answer increases confidence in its correctness.</description>

      <title>SLIM: Sim-to-Real Legged Instructive Manipulation via Long-Horizon Visuomotor Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09905v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a low-cost legged mobile manipulation system that solves long-horizon real-world tasks, trained by reinforcement learning purely in simulation. This system is made possible by 1) a hierarchical design of a high-level policy for visual-mobile manipulation following instructions and a low-level policy for quadruped movement and limb control, 2) a progressive exploration and learning approach that leverages privileged task decomposition information to train the teacher policy for long-horizon tasks, which will guide an imitation-based student policy for efficient training of the high-level visuomotor policy, and 3) a suite of techniques for minimizing sim-to-real gaps.
  In contrast to previous approaches that use high-end equipment, our system demonstrates effective performance with more accessible hardware - specifically, a Unitree Go1 quadruped, a WidowX250S arm, and a single wrist-mounted RGB camera - despite the increased challenges of sim-to-real transfer. When fully trained in simulation, a single policy autonomously solves long-horizon tasks such as search, move, grasp, and drop-into, achieving nearly 80% success. This performance is comparable to that of expert human teleoperation on the same tasks but significantly more efficient, operating at about 1.5x the speed. The sim-to-real transfer is fluid across diverse indoor and outdoor scenes under varying lighting conditions. Finally, we discuss the key techniques that enable the entire pipeline, including efficient RL training and sim-to-real, to work effectively for legged mobile manipulation, and present their ablation results.</description>

      <title>How Should I Build A Benchmark? Revisiting Code-Related Benchmarks For LLMs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10711v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Various benchmarks have been proposed to assess the performance of large language models (LLMs) in different coding scenarios. We refer to them as code-related benchmarks. However, there are no systematic guidelines by which such a benchmark should be developed to ensure its quality, reliability, and reproducibility. We propose How2Bench, which is comprised of a 55- 55-criteria checklist as a set of guidelines to govern the development of code-related benchmarks comprehensively. Using HOW2BENCH, we profiled 274 benchmarks released within the past decade and found concerning issues. Nearly 70% of the benchmarks did not take measures for data quality assurance; over 10% did not even open source or only partially open source. Many highly cited benchmarks have loopholes, including duplicated samples, incorrect reference codes/tests/prompts, and unremoved sensitive/confidential information. Finally, we conducted a human study involving 49 participants, which revealed significant gaps in awareness of the importance of data quality, reproducibility, and transparency.</description>

      <title>Parameters vs FLOPs: Scaling Laws for Optimal Sparsity for Mixture-of-Experts Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12370v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scaling the capacity of language models has consistently proven to be a reliable approach for improving performance and unlocking new capabilities. Capacity can be primarily defined by two dimensions: the number of model parameters and the compute per example. While scaling typically involves increasing both, the precise interplay between these factors and their combined contribution to overall capacity remains not fully understood. We explore this relationship in the context of sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoEs), which allow scaling the number of parameters without proportionally increasing the FLOPs per example. We investigate how varying the sparsity level, i.e., the fraction of inactive parameters, impacts model's performance during pretraining and downstream few-shot evaluation. We find that under different constraints (e.g., parameter size and total training compute), there is an optimal level of sparsity that improves both training efficiency and model performance. These results provide a better understanding of the impact of sparsity in scaling laws for MoEs and complement existing works in this area, offering insights for designing more efficient architectures.</description>

      <title>EvidenceMap: Learning Evidence Analysis to Unleash the Power of Small Language Models for Biomedical Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12746v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When addressing professional questions in the biomedical domain, humans typically acquire multiple pieces of information as evidence and engage in multifaceted evidence analysis to provide high-quality answers. Current LLM-based answer generation methods lack a detailed definition and learning process for evidence analysis, leading to the risk of error propagation and hallucinations while using evidence. Although increasing the parameter size of LLMs can alleviate these issues, it also presents challenges in model training and deployment with limited resources. In this study, we propose EvidenceMap, which aims to enable a tiny pre-trained language model to explicitly learn multiple aspects of biomedical evidence, including supportive evaluation, logical correlation and content summarization, thereby latently guiding a small generative model (around 3B parameters) to provide textual responses. Experimental results demonstrate that our method, fine-tuning a language model with 66M parameters, exceeds the RAG method with an 8B LLM by 19.9% and 5.7% in reference-based quality and accuracy, respectively.</description>

      <title>Softplus Attention with Re-weighting Boosts Length Extrapolation in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13428v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models have achieved remarkable success in recent years, primarily due to the implementation of self-attention mechanisms. However, traditional Softmax attention suffers from numerical instability and reduced performance as the length of inference tokens increases. This paper addresses these issues by decomposing the Softmax operation into a non-linear transformation and the $l_1$-norm. We identify the latter as essential for maintaining model performance. By replacing the non-linear transformation with the Softplus activation function and introducing a dynamic scale factor for different token lengths based on invariance entropy, we create a novel attention mechanism with performance better than conventional Softmax attention across various inference lengths. To further improve the length extrapolation ability of the proposed attention mechanism, we introduce a fine-tuning-free re-weighting mechanism that amplifies significant attention weights while diminishing weaker ones, enabling the model to concentrate more effectively on relevant tokens without requiring retraining. When combined with our proposed attention mechanism, this approach demonstrates significant promise in managing longer sequences, maintaining nearly constant validation loss even at 16$\times$ the training token length while ensuring numerical stability. Our code is available at: https://github.com/iminfine/freeatten.</description>

      <title>Contrastive Representation Learning Helps Cross-institutional Knowledge Transfer: A Study in Pediatric Ventilation Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13587v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Clinical machine learning deployment across institutions faces significant challenges when patient populations and clinical practices differ substantially. We present a systematic framework for cross-institutional knowledge transfer in clinical time series, demonstrated through pediatric ventilation management between a general pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) and a cardiac-focused unit. Using contrastive predictive coding (CPC) for representation learning, we investigate how different data regimes and fine-tuning strategies affect knowledge transfer across institutional boundaries. Our results show that while direct model transfer performs poorly, CPC with appropriate fine-tuning enables effective knowledge sharing between institutions, with benefits particularly evident in limited data scenarios. Analysis of transfer patterns reveals an important asymmetry: temporal progression patterns transfer more readily than point-of-care decisions, suggesting practical pathways for cross-institutional deployment. Through a systematic evaluation of fine-tuning approaches and transfer patterns, our work provides insights for developing more generalizable clinical decision support systems while enabling smaller specialized units to leverage knowledge from larger centers.</description>

      <title>GUI-Bee: Align GUI Action Grounding to Novel Environments via Autonomous Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13896v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) action grounding is a critical step in GUI automation that maps language instructions to actionable elements on GUI screens. Most recent works of GUI action grounding leverage large GUI datasets to fine-tune MLLMs. However, the fine-tuning data always covers limited GUI environments, and we find the performance of the resulting model deteriorates in novel environments. We argue that the GUI grounding models should be further aligned to the novel environments to reveal their full potential, when the inference is known to involve novel environments, i.e., environments not used during the previous fine-tuning. To realize this, we first propose GUI-Bee, an MLLM-based autonomous agent, to collect high-quality, environment-specific data through exploration and then continuously fine-tune GUI grounding models with the collected data. Our agent leverages a novel Q-value-Incentive In-Context Reinforcement Learning (Q-ICRL) method to optimize exploration efficiency and data quality. Additionally, we introduce NovelScreenSpot, a benchmark for testing how well the data can help align GUI action grounding models to novel environments and demonstrate the effectiveness of data collected by GUI-Bee in the experiments. Furthermore, we conduct an ablation study to validate the Q-ICRL method in enhancing the efficiency of GUI-Bee. Project page: https://gui-bee.github.io</description>

      <title>FedDAG: Federated Domain Adversarial Generation Towards Generalizable Medical Image Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13967v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated domain generalization aims to train a global model from multiple source domains and ensure its generalization ability to unseen target domains. Due to the target domain being with unknown domain shifts, attempting to approximate these gaps by source domains may be the key to improving model generalization capability. Existing works mainly focus on sharing and recombining local domain-specific attributes to increase data diversity and simulate potential domain shifts. However, these methods may be insufficient since only the local attribute recombination can be hard to touch the out-of-distribution of global data. In this paper, we propose a simple-yet-efficient framework named Federated Domain Adversarial Generation (FedDAG). It aims to simulate the domain shift and improve the model generalization by adversarially generating novel domains different from local and global source domains. Specifically, it generates novel-style images by maximizing the instance-level feature discrepancy between original and generated images and trains a generalizable task model by minimizing their feature discrepancy. Further, we observed that FedDAG could cause different performance improvements for local models. It may be due to inherent data isolation and heterogeneity among clients, exacerbating the imbalance in their generalization contributions to the global model. Ignoring this imbalance can lead the global model's generalization ability to be sub-optimal, further limiting the novel domain generation procedure. Thus, to mitigate this imbalance, FedDAG hierarchically aggregates local models at the within-client and across-client levels by using the sharpness concept to evaluate client model generalization contributions. Extensive experiments across four medical benchmarks demonstrate FedDAG's ability to enhance generalization in federated medical scenarios.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Sparse Kernel Generator for O(3)-Equivariant Deep Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13986v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rotation equivariant graph neural networks, i.e., networks designed to guarantee certain geometric relations between their inputs and outputs, yield state-of-the-art performance on spatial deep learning tasks. They exhibit high data efficiency during training and significantly reduced inference time for interatomic potential calculations compared to classical approaches. Key to these models is the Clebsch-Gordon (CG) tensor product, a kernel that contracts two dense feature vectors with a highly structured sparse tensor to produce a dense output vector. The operation, which may be repeated millions of times for typical equivariant models, is a costly and inefficient bottleneck. We introduce a GPU sparse kernel generator for the CG tensor product that provides significant speedup over the best existing open and closed-source implementations. Our implementation achieves high performance by carefully managing GPU shared memory through static analysis at model compile-time, minimizing reads and writes to global memory. We break the tensor product into a series of kernels with operands that fit entirely into registers, enabling us to emit long arithmetic instruction streams that maximize instruction-level parallelism. By fusing the CG tensor product with a subsequent graph convolution, we reduce both intermediate storage and global memory traffic over naive approaches that duplicate input data. We also provide optimized kernels for the gradient of the CG tensor product and a novel identity for the higher partial derivatives required to predict interatomic forces. Our fused kernels offer up to 4.5x speedup for the forward pass and 3x for the backward pass over NVIDIA cuEquivariance, as well as &gt;10x speedup over the widely-used e3nn package. We offer up to 5.3x inference-time speedup for the MACE chemistry foundation model over the original unoptimized version.</description>

Abstract: Learning efficient representations for decision-making policies is a challenge in imitation learning (IL). Current IL methods require expert demonstrations, which are expensive to collect. Consequently, they often have underdeveloped world models. Self-supervised learning (SSL) offers an alternative by allowing models to learn from diverse, unlabeled data, including failures. However, SSL methods often operate in raw input space, making them inefficient. In this work, we propose ACT-JEPA, a novel architecture that integrates IL and SSL to enhance policy representations. We train a policy to predict (1) action sequences and (2) abstract observation sequences. The first objective uses action chunking to improve action prediction and reduce compounding errors. The second objective extends this idea of chunking by predicting abstract observation sequences. We utilize Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture to predict in abstract representation space, allowing the model to filter out irrelevant details, improve efficiency, and develop a robust world model. Our experiments show that ACT-JEPA improves the quality of representations by learning temporal environment dynamics. Additionally, the model's ability to predict abstract observation sequences results in representations that effectively generalize to action sequence prediction. ACT-JEPA performs on par with established baselines across a range of decision-making tasks.</description>
