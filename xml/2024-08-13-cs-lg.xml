      <title>Exploring Scalability in Large-Scale Time Series in DeepVATS framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visual analytics is essential for studying large time series due to its ability to reveal trends, anomalies, and insights. DeepVATS is a tool that merges Deep Learning (Deep) with Visual Analytics (VA) for the analysis of large time series data (TS). It has three interconnected modules. The Deep Learning module, developed in R, manages the load of datasets and Deep Learning models from and to the Storage module. This module also supports models training and the acquisition of the embeddings from the latent space of the trained model. The Storage module operates using the Weights and Biases system. Subsequently, these embeddings can be analyzed in the Visual Analytics module. This module, based on an R Shiny application, allows the adjustment of the parameters related to the projection and clustering of the embeddings space. Once these parameters are set, interactive plots representing both the embeddings, and the time series are shown. This paper introduces the tool and examines its scalability through log analytics. The execution time evolution is examined while the length of the time series is varied. This is achieved by resampling a large data series into smaller subsets and logging the main execution and rendering times for later analysis of scalability.</description>

      <title>Overlay-based Decentralized Federated Learning in Bandwidth-limited Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emerging machine learning paradigm of decentralized federated learning (DFL) has the promise of greatly boosting the deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) by directly learning across distributed agents without centralized coordination. Despite significant efforts on improving the communication efficiency of DFL, most existing solutions were based on the simplistic assumption that neighboring agents are physically adjacent in the underlying communication network, which fails to correctly capture the communication cost when learning over a general bandwidth-limited network, as encountered in many edge networks. In this work, we address this gap by leveraging recent advances in network tomography to jointly design the communication demands and the communication schedule for overlay-based DFL in bandwidth-limited networks without requiring explicit cooperation from the underlying network. By carefully analyzing the structure of our problem, we decompose it into a series of optimization problems that can each be solved efficiently, to collectively minimize the total training time. Extensive data-driven simulations show that our solution can significantly accelerate DFL in comparison with state-of-the-art designs.</description>

      <title>DyGMamba: Efficiently Modeling Long-Term Temporal Dependency on Continuous-Time Dynamic Graphs with State Space Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning useful representations for continuous-time dynamic graphs (CTDGs) is challenging, due to the concurrent need to span long node interaction histories and grasp nuanced temporal details. In particular, two problems emerge: (1) Encoding longer histories requires more computational resources, making it crucial for CTDG models to maintain low computational complexity to ensure efficiency; (2) Meanwhile, more powerful models are needed to identify and select the most critical temporal information within the extended context provided by longer histories. To address these problems, we propose a CTDG representation learning model named DyGMamba, originating from the popular Mamba state space model (SSM). DyGMamba first leverages a node-level SSM to encode the sequence of historical node interactions. Another time-level SSM is then employed to exploit the temporal patterns hidden in the historical graph, where its output is used to dynamically select the critical information from the interaction history. We validate DyGMamba experimentally on the dynamic link prediction task. The results show that our model achieves state-of-the-art in most cases. DyGMamba also maintains high efficiency in terms of computational resources, making it possible to capture long temporal dependencies with a limited computation budget.</description>

      <title>Zero-Shot Uncertainty Quantification using Diffusion Probabilistic Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The success of diffusion probabilistic models in generative tasks, such as text-to-image generation, has motivated the exploration of their application to regression problems commonly encountered in scientific computing and various other domains. In this context, the use of diffusion regression models for ensemble prediction is becoming a practice with increasing popularity. Under such background, we conducted a study to quantitatively evaluate the effectiveness of ensemble methods on solving different regression problems using diffusion models. We consider the ensemble prediction of a diffusion model as a means for zero-shot uncertainty quantification, since the diffusion models in our study are not trained with a loss function containing any uncertainty estimation. Through extensive experiments on 1D and 2D data, we demonstrate that ensemble methods consistently improve model prediction accuracy across various regression tasks. Notably, we observed a larger accuracy gain in auto-regressive prediction compared with point-wise prediction, and that enhancements take place in both the mean-square error and the physics-informed loss. Additionally, we reveal a statistical correlation between ensemble prediction error and ensemble variance, offering insights into balancing computational complexity with prediction accuracy and monitoring prediction confidence in practical applications where the ground truth is unknown. Our study provides a comprehensive view of the utility of diffusion ensembles, serving as a useful reference for practitioners employing diffusion models in regression problem-solving.</description>

      <title>Confident magnitude-based neural network pruning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pruning neural networks has proven to be a successful approach to increase the efficiency and reduce the memory storage of deep learning models without compromising performance. Previous literature has shown that it is possible to achieve a sizable reduction in the number of parameters of a deep neural network without deteriorating its predictive capacity in one-shot pruning regimes. Our work builds beyond this background in order to provide rigorous uncertainty quantification for pruning neural networks reliably, which has not been addressed to a great extent in previous literature focusing on pruning methods in computer vision settings. We leverage recent techniques on distribution-free uncertainty quantification to provide finite-sample statistical guarantees to compress deep neural networks, while maintaining high performance. Moreover, this work presents experiments in computer vision tasks to illustrate how uncertainty-aware pruning is a useful approach to deploy sparse neural networks safely.</description>

      <title>AI and Machine Learning Driven Indoor Localization and Navigation with Mobile Embedded Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Indoor navigation is a foundational technology to assist the tracking and localization of humans, autonomous vehicles, drones, and robots in indoor spaces. Due to the lack of penetration of GPS signals in buildings, subterranean locales, and dense urban environments, indoor navigation solutions typically make use of ubiquitous wireless signals (e.g., WiFi) and sensors in mobile embedded systems to perform tracking and localization. This article provides an overview of the many challenges facing state-of-the-art indoor navigation solutions, and then describes how AI algorithms deployed on mobile embedded systems can overcome these challenges.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we overview one promising avenue of progress at the mathematical foundation of deep learning: the connection between deep networks and function approximation by affine splines (continuous piecewise linear functions in multiple dimensions). In particular, we will overview work over the past decade on understanding certain geometrical properties of a deep network's affine spline mapping, in particular how it tessellates its input space. As we will see, the affine spline connection and geometrical viewpoint provide a powerful portal through which to view, analyze, and improve the inner workings of a deep network.</description>

      <title>Towards improving Alzheimer's intervention: a machine learning approach for biomarker detection through combining MEG and MRI pipelines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: MEG are non invasive neuroimaging techniques with excellent temporal and spatial resolution, crucial for studying brain function in dementia and Alzheimer Disease. They identify changes in brain activity at various Alzheimer stages, including preclinical and prodromal phases. MEG may detect pathological changes before clinical symptoms, offering potential biomarkers for intervention. This study evaluates classification techniques using MEG features to distinguish between healthy controls and mild cognitive impairment participants from the BioFIND study. We compare MEG based biomarkers with MRI based anatomical features, both independently and combined. We used 3 Tesla MRI and MEG data from 324 BioFIND participants;158 MCI and 166 HC. Analyses were performed using MATLAB with SPM12 and OSL toolboxes. Machine learning analyses, including 100 Monte Carlo replications of 10 fold cross validation, were conducted on sensor and source spaces. Combining MRI with MEG features achieved the best performance; 0.76 accuracy and AUC of 0.82 for GLMNET using LCMV source based MEG. MEG only analyses using LCMV and eLORETA also performed well, suggesting that combining uncorrected MEG with z-score-corrected MRI features is optimal.</description>

      <title>Performance Metric for Multiple Anomaly Score Distributions with Discrete Severity Levels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rise of smart factories has heightened the demand for automated maintenance, and normal-data-based anomaly detection has proved particularly effective in environments where anomaly data are scarce. This method, which does not require anomaly data during training, has prompted researchers to focus not only on detecting anomalies but also on classifying severity levels by using anomaly scores. However, the existing performance metrics, such as the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), do not effectively reflect the performance of models in classifying severity levels based on anomaly scores. To address this limitation, we propose the weighted sum of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (WS-AUROC), which combines AUROC with a penalty for severity level differences. We conducted various experiments using different penalty assignment methods: uniform penalty regardless of severity level differences, penalty based on severity level index differences, and penalty based on actual physical quantities that cause anomalies. The latter method was the most sensitive. Additionally, we propose an anomaly detector that achieves clear separation of distributions and outperforms the ablation models on the WS-AUROC and AUROC metrics.</description>

      <title>Interventional Causal Structure Discovery over Graphical Models with Convergence and Optimality Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning causal structure from sampled data is a fundamental problem with applications in various fields, including healthcare, machine learning and artificial intelligence. Traditional methods predominantly rely on observational data, but there exist limits regarding the identifiability of causal structures with only observational data. Interventional data, on the other hand, helps establish a cause-and-effect relationship by breaking the influence of confounding variables. It remains to date under-explored to develop a mathematical framework that seamlessly integrates both observational and interventional data in causal structure learning. Furthermore, existing studies often focus on centralized approaches, necessitating the transfer of entire datasets to a single server, which lead to considerable communication overhead and heightened risks to privacy. To tackle these challenges, we develop a bilevel polynomial optimization (Bloom) framework. Bloom not only provides a powerful mathematical modeling framework, underpinned by theoretical support, for causal structure discovery from both interventional and observational data, but also aspires to an efficient causal discovery algorithm with convergence and optimality guarantees. We further extend Bloom to a distributed setting to reduce the communication overhead and mitigate data privacy risks. It is seen through experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets that Bloom markedly surpasses other leading learning algorithms.</description>

      <title>Dual-Channel Latent Factor Analysis Enhanced Graph Contrastive Learning for Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are powerful learning methods for recommender systems owing to their robustness in handling complicated user-item interactions. Recently, the integration of contrastive learning with GNNs has demonstrated remarkable performance in recommender systems to handle the issue of highly sparse user-item interaction data. Yet, some available graph contrastive learning (GCL) techniques employ stochastic augmentation, i.e., nodes or edges are randomly perturbed on the user-item bipartite graph to construct contrastive views. Such a stochastic augmentation strategy not only brings noise perturbation but also cannot utilize global collaborative signals effectively. To address it, this study proposes a latent factor analysis (LFA) enhanced GCL approach, named LFA-GCL. Our model exclusively incorporates LFA to implement the unconstrained structural refinement, thereby obtaining an augmented global collaborative graph accurately without introducing noise signals. Experiments on four public datasets show that the proposed LFA-GCL outperforms the state-of-the-art models.</description>

      <title>Adversarially Robust Industrial Anomaly Detection Through Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning-based industrial anomaly detection models have achieved remarkably high accuracy on commonly used benchmark datasets. However, the robustness of those models may not be satisfactory due to the existence of adversarial examples, which pose significant threats to the practical deployment of deep anomaly detectors. Recently, it has been shown that diffusion models can be used to purify the adversarial noises and thus build a robust classifier against adversarial attacks. Unfortunately, we found that naively applying this strategy in anomaly detection (i.e., placing a purifier before an anomaly detector) will suffer from a high anomaly miss rate since the purifying process can easily remove both the anomaly signal and the adversarial perturbations, causing the later anomaly detector failed to detect anomalies. To tackle this issue, we explore the possibility of performing anomaly detection and adversarial purification simultaneously. We propose a simple yet effective adversarially robust anomaly detection method, \textit{AdvRAD}, that allows the diffusion model to act both as an anomaly detector and adversarial purifier. We also extend our proposed method for certified robustness to $l_2$ norm bounded perturbations. Through extensive experiments, we show that our proposed method exhibits outstanding (certified) adversarial robustness while also maintaining equally strong anomaly detection performance on par with the state-of-the-art methods on industrial anomaly detection benchmark datasets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have shown potential as an alternative to Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) in neural networks, providing universal function approximation with fewer parameters and reduced memory usage. In this paper, we explore the use of KANs as function approximators within the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm. We evaluate this approach by comparing its performance to the original MLP-based PPO using the DeepMind Control Proprio Robotics benchmark. Our results indicate that the KAN-based reinforcement learning algorithm can achieve comparable performance to its MLP-based counterpart, often with fewer parameters. These findings suggest that KANs may offer a more efficient option for reinforcement learning models.</description>

      <title>Counterfactual Explanations with Probabilistic Guarantees on their Robustness to Model Change</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Counterfactual explanations (CFEs) guide users on how to adjust inputs to machine learning models to achieve desired outputs. While existing research primarily addresses static scenarios, real-world applications often involve data or model changes, potentially invalidating previously generated CFEs and rendering user-induced input changes ineffective. Current methods addressing this issue often support only specific models or change types, require extensive hyperparameter tuning, or fail to provide probabilistic guarantees on CFE robustness to model changes. This paper proposes a novel approach for generating CFEs that provides probabilistic guarantees for any model and change type, while offering interpretable and easy-to-select hyperparameters. We establish a theoretical framework for probabilistically defining robustness to model change and demonstrate how our BetaRCE method directly stems from it. BetaRCE is a post-hoc method applied alongside a chosen base CFE generation method to enhance the quality of the explanation beyond robustness. It facilitates a transition from the base explanation to a more robust one with user-adjusted probability bounds. Through experimental comparisons with baselines, we show that BetaRCE yields robust, most plausible, and closest to baseline counterfactual explanations.</description>

      <title>MDS-GNN: A Mutual Dual-Stream Graph Neural Network on Graphs with Incomplete Features and Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for analyzing and learning representations from graph-structured data. A crucial prerequisite for the outstanding performance of GNNs is the availability of complete graph information, i.e., node features and graph structure, which is frequently unmet in real-world scenarios since graphs are often incomplete due to various uncontrollable factors. Existing approaches only focus on dealing with either incomplete features or incomplete structure, which leads to performance loss inevitably. To address this issue, this study proposes a mutual dual-stream graph neural network (MDS-GNN), which implements a mutual benefit learning between features and structure. Its main ideas are as follows: a) reconstructing the missing node features based on the initial incomplete graph structure; b) generating an augmented global graph based on the reconstructed node features, and propagating the incomplete node features on this global graph; and c) utilizing contrastive learning to make the dual-stream process mutually benefit from each other. Extensive experiments on six real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed MDS-GNN on incomplete graphs.</description>

      <title>Your Classifier Can Be Secretly a Likelihood-Based OOD Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to detect out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs is critical to guarantee the reliability of classification models deployed in an open environment. A fundamental challenge in OOD detection is that a discriminative classifier is typically trained to estimate the posterior probability p(y|z) for class y given an input z, but lacks the explicit likelihood estimation of p(z) ideally needed for OOD detection. While numerous OOD scoring functions have been proposed for classification models, these estimate scores are often heuristic-driven and cannot be rigorously interpreted as likelihood. To bridge the gap, we propose Intrinsic Likelihood (INK), which offers rigorous likelihood interpretation to modern discriminative-based classifiers. Specifically, our proposed INK score operates on the constrained latent embeddings of a discriminative classifier, which are modeled as a mixture of hyperspherical embeddings with constant norm. We draw a novel connection between the hyperspherical distribution and the intrinsic likelihood, which can be effectively optimized in modern neural networks. Extensive experiments on the OpenOOD benchmark empirically demonstrate that INK establishes a new state-of-the-art in a variety of OOD detection setups, including both far-OOD and near-OOD. Code is available at https://github.com/deeplearning-wisc/ink.</description>

Abstract: In high-dimensional settings, Bayesian optimization (BO) can be expensive and infeasible. The random embedding Bayesian optimization algorithm is commonly used to address high-dimensional BO challenges. However, this method relies on the effective subspace assumption on the optimization problem's objective function, which limits its applicability. In this paper, we introduce Condensing-Expansion Projection Bayesian optimization (CEPBO), a novel random projection-based approach for high-dimensional BO that does not reply on the effective subspace assumption. The approach is both simple to implement and highly practical. We present two algorithms based on different random projection matrices: the Gaussian projection matrix and the hashing projection matrix. Experimental results demonstrate that both algorithms outperform existing random embedding-based algorithms in most cases, achieving superior performance on high-dimensional BO problems. The code is available in \url{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/CEPBO-14429}.</description>

      <title>An Evaluation of Standard Statistical Models and LLMs on Time Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research examines the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in predicting time series, with a specific focus on the LLMTIME model. Despite the established effectiveness of LLMs in tasks such as text generation, language translation, and sentiment analysis, this study highlights the key challenges that large language models encounter in the context of time series prediction. We assess the performance of LLMTIME across multiple datasets and introduce classical almost periodic functions as time series to gauge its effectiveness. The empirical results indicate that while large language models can perform well in zero-shot forecasting for certain datasets, their predictive accuracy diminishes notably when confronted with diverse time series data and traditional signals. The primary finding of this study is that the predictive capacity of LLMTIME, similar to other LLMs, significantly deteriorates when dealing with time series data that contain both periodic and trend components, as well as when the signal comprises complex frequency components.</description>

      <title>UCB Exploration for Fixed-Budget Bayesian Best Arm Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study best-arm identification (BAI) in the fixed-budget setting. Adaptive allocations based on upper confidence bounds (UCBs), such as UCBE, are known to work well in BAI. However, it is well-known that its optimal regret is theoretically dependent on instances, which we show to be an artifact in many fixed-budget BAI problems. In this paper we propose an UCB exploration algorithm that is both theoretically and empirically efficient for the fixed budget BAI problem under a Bayesian setting. The key idea is to learn prior information, which can enhance the performance of UCB-based BAI algorithm as it has done in the cumulative regret minimization problem. We establish bounds on the failure probability and the simple regret for the Bayesian BAI problem, providing upper bounds of order $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{K/n})$, up to logarithmic factors, where $n$ represents the budget and $K$ denotes the number of arms. Furthermore, we demonstrate through empirical results that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.</description>

      <title>Better Not to Propagate: Understanding Edge Uncertainty and Over-smoothing in Signed Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) rely on network homophily, which can lead to performance degradation due to over-smoothing in many real-world heterophily scenarios. Recent studies analyze the smoothing effect (separability) after message-passing (MP), depending on the expectation of node features. Regarding separability gain, they provided theoretical backgrounds on over-smoothing caused by various propagation schemes, including positive, signed, and blocked MPs. More recently, by extending these theorems, some works have suggested improvements in signed propagation under multiple classes. However, prior works assume that the error ratio of all propagation schemes is fixed, failing to investigate this phenomenon correctly. To solve this problem, we propose a novel method for estimating homophily and edge error ratio, integrated with dynamic selection between blocked and signed propagation during training. Our theoretical analysis, supported by extensive experiments, demonstrates that blocking MP can be more effective than signed propagation under high edge error ratios, improving the performance in both homophilic and heterophilic graphs.</description>

      <title>A Geometric Nash Approach in Tuning the Learning Rate in Q-Learning Algorithm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a geometric approach for estimating the $\alpha$ value in Q learning. We establish a systematic framework that optimizes the {\alpha} parameter, thereby enhancing learning efficiency and stability. Our results show that there is a relationship between the learning rate and the angle between a vector T (total time steps in each episode of learning) and R (the reward vector for each episode). The concept of angular bisector between vectors T and R and Nash Equilibrium provide insight into estimating $\alpha$ such that the algorithm minimizes losses arising from exploration-exploitation trade-off.</description>

      <title>PTrajM: Efficient and Semantic-rich Trajectory Learning with Pretrained Trajectory-Mamba</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vehicle trajectories provide crucial movement information for various real-world applications. To better utilize vehicle trajectories, it is essential to develop a trajectory learning approach that can effectively and efficiently extract rich semantic information, including movement behavior and travel purposes, to support accurate downstream applications. However, creating such an approach presents two significant challenges. First, movement behavior are inherently spatio-temporally continuous, making them difficult to extract efficiently from irregular and discrete trajectory points. Second, travel purposes are related to the functionalities of areas and road segments traversed by vehicles. These functionalities are not available from the raw spatio-temporal trajectory features and are hard to extract directly from complex textual features associated with these areas and road segments.
  To address these challenges, we propose PTrajM, a novel method capable of efficient and semantic-rich vehicle trajectory learning. To support efficient modeling of movement behavior, we introduce Trajectory-Mamba as the learnable model of PTrajM, which effectively extracts continuous movement behavior while being more computationally efficient than existing structures. To facilitate efficient extraction of travel purposes, we propose a travel purpose-aware pre-training procedure, which enables PTrajM to discern the travel purposes of trajectories without additional computational resources during its embedding process. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets and comparisons with several state-of-the-art trajectory learning methods demonstrate the effectiveness of PTrajM. Code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/PTrajM-C973.</description>

      <title>Privacy-Preserved Taxi Demand Prediction System Utilizing Distributed Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate taxi-demand prediction is essential for optimizing taxi operations and enhancing urban transportation services. However, using customers' data in these systems raises significant privacy and security concerns. Traditional federated learning addresses some privacy issues by enabling model training without direct data exchange but often struggles with accuracy due to varying data distributions across different regions or service providers. In this paper, we propose CC-Net: a novel approach using collaborative learning enhanced with contrastive learning for taxi-demand prediction. Our method ensures high performance by enabling multiple parties to collaboratively train a demand-prediction model through hierarchical federated learning. In this approach, similar parties are clustered together, and federated learning is applied within each cluster. The similarity is defined without data exchange, ensuring privacy and security. We evaluated our approach using real-world data from five taxi service providers in Japan over fourteen months. The results demonstrate that CC-Net maintains the privacy of customers' data while improving prediction accuracy by at least 2.2% compared to existing techniques.</description>

      <title>Model Debiasing by Learnable Data Augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep Neural Networks are well known for efficiently fitting training data, yet experiencing poor generalization capabilities whenever some kind of bias dominates over the actual task labels, resulting in models learning "shortcuts". In essence, such models are often prone to learn spurious correlations between data and labels. In this work, we tackle the problem of learning from biased data in the very realistic unsupervised scenario, i.e., when the bias is unknown. This is a much harder task as compared to the supervised case, where auxiliary, bias-related annotations, can be exploited in the learning process. This paper proposes a novel 2-stage learning pipeline featuring a data augmentation strategy able to regularize the training. First, biased/unbiased samples are identified by training over-biased models. Second, such subdivision (typically noisy) is exploited within a data augmentation framework, properly combining the original samples while learning mixing parameters, which has a regularization effect. Experiments on synthetic and realistic biased datasets show state-of-the-art classification accuracy, outperforming competing methods, ultimately proving robust performance on both biased and unbiased examples. Notably, being our training method totally agnostic to the level of bias, it also positively affects performance for any, even apparently unbiased, dataset, thus improving the model generalization regardless of the level of bias (or its absence) in the data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated learning is often used in environments with many unverified participants. Therefore, federated learning under adversarial attacks receives significant attention. This paper proposes an algorithmic framework for list-decodable federated learning, where a central server maintains a list of models, with at least one guaranteed to perform well. The framework has no strict restriction on the fraction of honest workers, extending the applicability of Byzantine federated learning to the scenario with more than half adversaries. Under proper assumptions on the loss function, we prove a convergence theorem for our method. Experimental results, including image classification tasks with both convex and non-convex losses, demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can withstand the malicious majority under various attacks.</description>

      <title>Towards aerodynamic surrogate modeling based on $\beta$-variational autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surrogate models combining dimensionality reduction and regression techniques are essential to reduce the need for costly high-fidelity CFD data. New approaches using $\beta$-Variational Autoencoder ($\beta$-VAE) architectures have shown promise in obtaining high-quality low-dimensional representations of high-dimensional flow data while enabling physical interpretation of their latent spaces. We propose a surrogate model based on latent space regression to predict pressure distributions on a transonic wing given the flight conditions: Mach number and angle of attack. The $\beta$-VAE model, enhanced with Principal Component Analysis (PCA), maps high-dimensional data to a low-dimensional latent space, showing a direct correlation with flight conditions. Regularization through $\beta$ requires careful tuning to improve the overall performance, while PCA pre-processing aids in constructing an effective latent space, improving autoencoder training and performance. Gaussian Process Regression is used to predict latent space variables from flight conditions, showing robust behavior independent of $\beta$, and the decoder reconstructs the high-dimensional pressure field data. This pipeline provides insight into unexplored flight conditions. Additionally, a fine-tuning process of the decoder further refines the model, reducing dependency on $\beta$ and enhancing accuracy. The structured latent space, robust regression performance, and significant improvements from fine-tuning collectively create a highly accurate and efficient surrogate model. Our methodology demonstrates the effectiveness of $\beta$-VAEs for aerodynamic surrogate modeling, offering a rapid, cost-effective, and reliable alternative for aerodynamic data prediction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medical imaging classifiers can achieve high predictive accuracy, but quantifying their uncertainty remains an unresolved challenge, which prevents their deployment in medical clinics. We present an algorithm that can modify any classifier to produce a prediction set containing the true label with a user-specified probability, such as 90%. We train a network to predict an instance-based version of the Conformal Prediction threshold. The threshold is then conformalized to ensure the required coverage. We applied the proposed algorithm to several standard medical imaging classification datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms current approaches in terms of smaller average size of the prediction set while maintaining the desired coverage.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our open-source Python package BoFire combines Bayesian Optimization (BO) with other design of experiments (DoE) strategies focusing on developing and optimizing new chemistry. Previous BO implementations, for example as they exist in the literature or software, require substantial adaptation for effective real-world deployment in chemical industry. BoFire provides a rich feature-set with extensive configurability and realizes our vision of fast-tracking research contributions into industrial use via maintainable open-source software. Owing to quality-of-life features like JSON-serializability of problem formulations, BoFire enables seamless integration of BO into RESTful APIs, a common architecture component for both self-driving laboratories and human-in-the-loop setups. This paper discusses the differences between BoFire and other BO implementations and outlines ways that BO research needs to be adapted for real-world use in a chemistry setting.</description>

      <title>Graph Neural Networks as Ordering Heuristics for Parallel Graph Coloring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The graph coloring problem asks for an assignment of the minimum number of distinct colors to vertices in an undirected graph with the constraint that no pair of adjacent vertices share the same color. The problem is a thoroughly studied NP-hard combinatorial problem with several real-world applications. As such, a number of greedy heuristics have been suggested that strike a good balance between coloring quality, execution time, and also parallel scalability. In this work, we introduce a graph neural network (GNN) based ordering heuristic and demonstrate that it outperforms existing greedy ordering heuristics both on quality and performance. Previous results have demonstrated that GNNs can produce high-quality colorings but at the expense of excessive running time. The current paper is the first that brings the execution time down to compete with existing greedy heuristics. Our GNN model is trained using both supervised and unsupervised techniques. The experimental results show that a 2-layer GNN model can achieve execution times between the largest degree first (LF) and smallest degree last (SL) ordering heuristics while outperforming both on coloring quality. Increasing the number of layers improves the coloring quality further, and it is only at four layers that SL becomes faster than the GNN. Finally, our GNN-based coloring heuristic achieves superior scaling in the parallel setting compared to both SL and LF.</description>

      <title>GLEAMS: Bridging the Gap Between Local and Global Explanations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The explainability of machine learning algorithms is crucial, and numerous methods have emerged recently. Local, post-hoc methods assign an attribution score to each feature, indicating its importance for the prediction. However, these methods require recalculating explanations for each example. On the other side, while there exist global approaches they often produce explanations that are either overly simplistic and unreliable or excessively complex. To bridge this gap, we propose GLEAMS, a novel method that partitions the input space and learns an interpretable model within each sub-region, thereby providing both faithful local and global surrogates. We demonstrate GLEAMS' effectiveness on both synthetic and real-world data, highlighting its desirable properties and human-understandable insights.</description>

      <title>Masked adversarial neural network for cell type deconvolution in spatial transcriptomics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately determining cell type composition in disease-relevant tissues is crucial for identifying disease targets. Most existing spatial transcriptomics (ST) technologies cannot achieve single-cell resolution, making it challenging to accurately determine cell types. To address this issue, various deconvolution methods have been developed. Most of these methods use single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from the same tissue as a reference to infer cell types in ST data spots. However, they often overlook the differences between scRNA-seq and ST data. To overcome this limitation, we propose a Masked Adversarial Neural Network (MACD). MACD employs adversarial learning to align real ST data with simulated ST data generated from scRNA-seq data. By mapping them into a unified latent space, it can minimize the differences between the two types of data. Additionally, MACD uses masking techniques to effectively learn the features of real ST data and mitigate noise. We evaluated MACD on 32 simulated datasets and 2 real datasets, demonstrating its accuracy in performing cell type deconvolution. All code and public datasets used in this paper are available at https://github.com/wenwenmin/MACD and https://zenodo.org/records/12804822.</description>

      <title>Generalizing Few Data to Unseen Domains Flexibly Based on Label Smoothing Integrated with Distributionally Robust Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Overfitting commonly occurs when applying deep neural networks (DNNs) on small-scale datasets, where DNNs do not generalize well from existing data to unseen data. The main reason resulting in overfitting is that small-scale datasets cannot reflect the situations of the real world. Label smoothing (LS) is an effective regularization method to prevent overfitting, avoiding it by mixing one-hot labels with uniform label vectors. However, LS only focuses on labels while ignoring the distribution of existing data. In this paper, we introduce the distributionally robust optimization (DRO) to LS, achieving shift the existing data distribution flexibly to unseen domains when training DNNs. Specifically, we prove that the regularization of LS can be extended to a regularization term for the DNNs parameters when integrating DRO. The regularization term can be utilized to shift existing data to unseen domains and generate new data. Furthermore, we propose an approximate gradient-iteration label smoothing algorithm (GI-LS) to achieve the findings and train DNNs. We prove that the shift for the existing data does not influence the convergence of GI-LS. Since GI-LS incorporates a series of hyperparameters, we further consider using Bayesian optimization (BO) to find the relatively optimal combinations of these hyperparameters. Taking small-scale anomaly classification tasks as a case, we evaluate GI-LS, and the results clearly demonstrate its superior performance.</description>

      <title>Bootstrap Latents of Nodes and Neighbors for Graph Self-Supervised Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contrastive learning is a significant paradigm in graph self-supervised learning. However, it requires negative samples to prevent model collapse and learn discriminative representations. These negative samples inevitably lead to heavy computation, memory overhead and class collision, compromising the representation learning. Recent studies present that methods obviating negative samples can attain competitive performance and scalability enhancements, exemplified by bootstrapped graph latents (BGRL). However, BGRL neglects the inherent graph homophily, which provides valuable insights into underlying positive pairs. Our motivation arises from the observation that subtly introducing a few ground-truth positive pairs significantly improves BGRL. Although we can't obtain ground-truth positive pairs without labels under the self-supervised setting, edges in the graph can reflect noisy positive pairs, i.e., neighboring nodes often share the same label. Therefore, we propose to expand the positive pair set with node-neighbor pairs. Subsequently, we introduce a cross-attention module to predict the supportiveness score of a neighbor with respect to the anchor node. This score quantifies the positive support from each neighboring node, and is encoded into the training objective. Consequently, our method mitigates class collision from negative and noisy positive samples, concurrently enhancing intra-class compactness. Extensive experiments are conducted on five benchmark datasets and three downstream task node classification, node clustering, and node similarity search. The results demonstrate that our method generates node representations with enhanced intra-class compactness and achieves state-of-the-art performance.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic Learning with Multimodal Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperbolic embeddings have demonstrated their effectiveness in capturing measures of uncertainty and hierarchical relationships across various deep-learning tasks, including image segmentation and active learning. However, their application in modern vision-language models (VLMs) has been limited. A notable exception is MERU, which leverages the hierarchical properties of hyperbolic space in the CLIP ViT-large model, consisting of hundreds of millions parameters. In our work, we address the challenges of scaling multi-modal hyperbolic models by orders of magnitude in terms of parameters (billions) and training complexity using the BLIP-2 architecture. Although hyperbolic embeddings offer potential insights into uncertainty not present in Euclidean embeddings, our analysis reveals that scaling these models is particularly difficult. We propose a novel training strategy for a hyperbolic version of BLIP-2, which allows to achieve comparable performance to its Euclidean counterpart, while maintaining stability throughout the training process and showing a meaningful indication of uncertainty with each embedding.</description>

      <title>Semantic Successive Refinement: A Generative AI-aided Semantic Communication Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic Communication (SC) is an emerging technology aiming to surpass the Shannon limit. Traditional SC strategies often minimize signal distortion between the original and reconstructed data, neglecting perceptual quality, especially in low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) environments. To address this issue, we introduce a novel Generative AI Semantic Communication (GSC) system for single-user scenarios. This system leverages deep generative models to establish a new paradigm in SC. Specifically, At the transmitter end, it employs a joint source-channel coding mechanism based on the Swin Transformer for efficient semantic feature extraction and compression. At the receiver end, an advanced Diffusion Model (DM) reconstructs high-quality images from degraded signals, enhancing perceptual details. Additionally, we present a Multi-User Generative Semantic Communication (MU-GSC) system utilizing an asynchronous processing model. This model effectively manages multiple user requests and optimally utilizes system resources for parallel processing. Simulation results on public datasets demonstrate that our generative AI semantic communication systems achieve superior transmission efficiency and enhanced communication content quality across various channel conditions. Compared to CNN-based DeepJSCC, our methods improve the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) by 17.75% in Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) channels and by 20.86% in Rayleigh channels.</description>

      <title>Cautious Calibration in Binary Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Being cautious is crucial for enhancing the trustworthiness of machine learning systems integrated into decision-making pipelines. Although calibrated probabilities help in optimal decision-making, perfect calibration remains unattainable, leading to estimates that fluctuate between under- and overconfidence. This becomes a critical issue in high-risk scenarios, where even occasional overestimation can lead to extreme expected costs. In these scenarios, it is important for each predicted probability to lean towards underconfidence, rather than just achieving an average balance. In this study, we introduce the novel concept of cautious calibration in binary classification. This approach aims to produce probability estimates that are intentionally underconfident for each predicted probability. We highlight the importance of this approach in a high-risk scenario and propose a theoretically grounded method for learning cautious calibration maps. Through experiments, we explore and compare our method to various approaches, including methods originally not devised for cautious calibration but applicable in this context. We show that our approach is the most consistent in providing cautious estimates. Our work establishes a strong baseline for further developments in this novel framework.</description>

      <title>Range Membership Inference Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning models can leak private information about their training data, but the standard methods to measure this risk, based on membership inference attacks (MIAs), have a major limitation. They only check if a given data point \textit{exactly} matches a training point, neglecting the potential of similar or partially overlapping data revealing the same private information. To address this issue, we introduce the class of range membership inference attacks (RaMIAs), testing if the model was trained on any data in a specified range (defined based on the semantics of privacy). We formulate the RaMIAs game and design a principled statistical test for its complex hypotheses. We show that RaMIAs can capture privacy loss more accurately and comprehensively than MIAs on various types of data, such as tabular, image, and language. RaMIA paves the way for a more comprehensive and meaningful privacy auditing of machine learning algorithms.</description>

      <title>Cycle-Configuration: A Novel Graph-theoretic Descriptor Set for Molecular Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel family of descriptors of chemical graphs, named cycle-configuration (CC), that can be used in the standard "two-layered (2L) model" of mol-infer, a molecular inference framework based on mixed integer linear programming (MILP) and machine learning (ML). Proposed descriptors capture the notion of ortho/meta/para patterns that appear in aromatic rings, which has been impossible in the framework so far. Computational experiments show that, when the new descriptors are supplied, we can construct prediction functions of similar or better performance for all of the 27 tested chemical properties. We also provide an MILP formulation that asks for a chemical graph with desired properties under the 2L model with CC descriptors (2L+CC model). We show that a chemical graph with up to 50 non-hydrogen vertices can be inferred in a practical time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predictions often influence the reality which they aim to predict, an effect known as performativity. Existing work focuses on accuracy maximization under this effect, but model deployment may have important unintended impacts, especially in multiagent scenarios. In this work, we investigate performative prediction in a concrete game-theoretic setting where social welfare is an alternative objective to accuracy maximization. We explore a collective risk dilemma scenario where maximising accuracy can negatively impact social welfare, when predicting collective behaviours. By assuming knowledge of a Bayesian agent behavior model, we then show how to achieve better trade-offs and use them for mechanism design.</description>

      <title>Gemma Scope: Open Sparse Autoencoders Everywhere All At Once on Gemma 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are an unsupervised method for learning a sparse decomposition of a neural network's latent representations into seemingly interpretable features. Despite recent excitement about their potential, research applications outside of industry are limited by the high cost of training a comprehensive suite of SAEs. In this work, we introduce Gemma Scope, an open suite of JumpReLU SAEs trained on all layers and sub-layers of Gemma 2 2B and 9B and select layers of Gemma 2 27B base models. We primarily train SAEs on the Gemma 2 pre-trained models, but additionally release SAEs trained on instruction-tuned Gemma 2 9B for comparison. We evaluate the quality of each SAE on standard metrics and release these results. We hope that by releasing these SAE weights, we can help make more ambitious safety and interpretability research easier for the community.

      <title>Meta-Learning Guided Label Noise Distillation for Robust Signal Modulation Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automatic modulation classification (AMC) is an effective way to deal with physical layer threats of the internet of things (IoT). However, there is often label mislabeling in practice, which significantly impacts the performance and robustness of deep neural networks (DNNs). In this paper, we propose a meta-learning guided label noise distillation method for robust AMC. Specifically, a teacher-student heterogeneous network (TSHN) framework is proposed to distill and reuse label noise. Based on the idea that labels are representations, the teacher network with trusted meta-learning divides and conquers untrusted label samples and then guides the student network to learn better by reassessing and correcting labels. Furthermore, we propose a multi-view signal (MVS) method to further improve the performance of hard-to-classify categories with few-shot trusted label samples. Extensive experimental results show that our methods can significantly improve the performance and robustness of signal AMC in various and complex label noise scenarios, which is crucial for securing IoT applications.</description>

      <title>Federated Hypergraph Learning with Hyperedge Completion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hypergraph neural networks enhance conventional graph neural networks by capturing high-order relationships among nodes, which proves vital in data-rich environments where interactions are not merely pairwise. As data complexity and interconnectivity grow, it is common for graph-structured data to be split and stored in a distributed manner, underscoring the necessity of federated learning on subgraphs. In this work, we propose FedHGN, a novel algorithm for federated hypergraph learning. Our algorithm utilizes subgraphs of a hypergraph stored on distributed devices to train local HGNN models in a federated manner:by collaboratively developing an effective global HGNN model through sharing model parameters while preserving client privacy. Additionally, considering that hyperedges may span multiple clients, a pre-training step is employed before the training process in which cross-client hyperedge feature gathering is performed at the central server. In this way, the missing cross-client information can be supplemented from the central server during the node feature aggregation phase. Experimental results on seven real-world datasets confirm the effectiveness of our approach and demonstrate its performance advantages over traditional federated graph learning methods.</description>

      <title>Beyond Closure Models: Learning Chaotic-Systems via Physics-Informed Neural Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately predicting the long-term behavior of chaotic systems is crucial for various applications such as climate modeling. However, achieving such predictions typically requires iterative computations over a dense spatiotemporal grid to account for the unstable nature of chaotic systems, which is expensive and impractical in many real-world situations. An alternative approach to such a full-resolved simulation is using a coarse grid and then correcting its errors through a \textit{closure model}, which approximates the overall information from fine scales not captured in the coarse-grid simulation. Recently, ML approaches have been used for closure modeling, but they typically require a large number of training samples from expensive fully-resolved simulations (FRS). In this work, we prove an even more fundamental limitation, i.e., the standard approach to learning closure models suffers from a large approximation error for generic problems, no matter how large the model is, and it stems from the non-uniqueness of the mapping. We propose an alternative end-to-end learning approach using a physics-informed neural operator (PINO) that overcomes this limitation by not using a closure model or a coarse-grid solver. We first train the PINO model on data from a coarse-grid solver and then fine-tune it with (a small amount of) FRS and physics-based losses on a fine grid. The discretization-free nature of neural operators means that they do not suffer from the restriction of a coarse grid that closure models face, and they can provably approximate the long-term statistics of chaotic systems. In our experiments, our PINO model achieves a 120x speedup compared to FRS with a relative error $\sim 5\%$. In contrast, the closure model coupled with a coarse-grid solver is $58$x slower than PINO while having a much higher error $\sim205\%$ when the closure model is trained on the same FRS dataset.</description>

      <title>ECG-FM: An Open Electrocardiogram Foundation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electrocardiogram (ECG) is a ubiquitous diagnostic test. Conventional task-specific ECG analysis models require large numbers of expensive ECG annotations or associated labels to train. Transfer learning techniques have been shown to improve generalization and reduce reliance on labeled data. We present ECG-FM, an open foundation model for ECG analysis, and conduct a comprehensive study performed on a dataset of 1.66 million ECGs sourced from both publicly available and private institutional sources. ECG-FM adopts a transformer-based architecture and is pretrained on 2.5 million samples using ECG-specific augmentations and contrastive learning, as well as a continuous signal masking objective. Our transparent evaluation includes a diverse range of downstream tasks, where we predict ECG interpretation labels, reduced left ventricular ejection fraction, and abnormal cardiac troponin. Affirming ECG-FM's effectiveness as a foundation model, we demonstrate how its command of contextual information results in strong performance, rich pretrained embeddings, and reliable interpretability. Due to a lack of open-weight practices, we highlight how ECG analysis is lagging behind other medical machine learning subfields in terms of foundation model adoption. Our code is available at https://github.com/bowang-lab/ECG-FM/.</description>

      <title>HistoKernel: Whole Slide Image Level Maximum Mean Discrepancy Kernels for Pan-Cancer Predictive Modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning in computational pathology (CPath) often aggregates patch-level predictions from multi-gigapixel Whole Slide Images (WSIs) to generate WSI-level prediction scores for crucial tasks such as survival prediction and drug effect prediction. However, current methods do not explicitly characterize distributional differences between patch sets within WSIs. We introduce HistoKernel, a novel Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) kernel that measures distributional similarity between WSIs for enhanced prediction performance on downstream prediction tasks.
  Our comprehensive analysis demonstrates HistoKernel's effectiveness across various machine learning tasks, including retrieval (n = 9,362), drug sensitivity regression (n = 551), point mutation classification (n = 3,419), and survival analysis (n = 2,291), outperforming existing deep learning methods. Additionally, HistoKernel seamlessly integrates multi-modal data and offers a novel perturbation-based method for patch-level explainability. This work pioneers the use of kernel-based methods for WSI-level predictive modeling, opening new avenues for research. Code is available at https://github.com/pkeller00/HistoKernel.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-content phenotypic screening, including high-content imaging (HCI), has gained popularity in the last few years for its ability to characterize novel therapeutics without prior knowledge of the protein target. When combined with deep learning techniques to predict and represent molecular-phenotype interactions, these advancements hold the potential to significantly accelerate and enhance drug discovery applications. This work focuses on the novel task of HCI-guided molecular design. Generative models for molecule design could be guided by HCI data, for example with a supervised model that links molecules to phenotypes of interest as a reward function. However, limited labeled data, combined with the high-dimensional readouts, can make training these methods challenging and impractical. We consider an alternative approach in which we leverage an unsupervised multimodal joint embedding to define a latent similarity as a reward for GFlowNets. The proposed model learns to generate new molecules that could produce phenotypic effects similar to those of the given image target, without relying on pre-annotated phenotypic labels. We demonstrate that the proposed method generates molecules with high morphological and structural similarity to the target, increasing the likelihood of similar biological activity, as confirmed by an independent oracle model.</description>

Abstract: Currently, large language models are gaining popularity, their achievements are used in many areas, ranging from text translation to generating answers to queries. However, the main problem with these new machine learning algorithms is that training such models requires large computing resources that only large IT companies have. To avoid this problem, a number of methods (LoRA, quantization) have been proposed so that existing models can be effectively fine-tuned for specific tasks. In this paper, we propose an E2E (end to end) audio summarization model using these techniques. In addition, this paper examines the effectiveness of these approaches to the problem under consideration and draws conclusions about the applicability of these methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work uses the state-of-the-art language model GPT-3 to offer a novel method of information extraction for knowledge base development. The suggested method attempts to solve the difficulties associated with obtaining relevant entities and relationships from unstructured text in order to extract structured information. We conduct experiments on a huge corpus of text from diverse fields to assess the performance of our suggested technique. The evaluation measures, which are frequently employed in information extraction tasks, include precision, recall, and F1-score. The findings demonstrate that GPT-3 can be used to efficiently and accurately extract pertinent and correct information from text, hence increasing the precision and productivity of knowledge base creation. We also assess how well our suggested approach performs in comparison to the most advanced information extraction techniques already in use. The findings show that by utilizing only a small number of instances in in-context learning, our suggested strategy yields competitive outcomes with notable savings in terms of data annotation and engineering expense. Additionally, we use our proposed method to retrieve Biomedical information, demonstrating its practicality in a real-world setting. All things considered, our suggested method offers a viable way to overcome the difficulties involved in obtaining structured data from unstructured text in order to create knowledge bases. It can greatly increase the precision and effectiveness of information extraction, which is necessary for many applications including chatbots, recommendation engines, and question-answering systems.</description>

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and LLaMA, have significantly transformed Natural Language Processing (NLP) with their outstanding abilities in text generation, summarization, and classification. Nevertheless, their widespread adoption introduces numerous challenges, including issues related to academic integrity, copyright, environmental impacts, and ethical considerations such as data bias, fairness, and privacy. The rapid evolution of LLMs also raises concerns regarding the reliability and generalizability of their evaluations. This paper offers a comprehensive survey of the literature on these subjects, systematically gathered and synthesized from Google Scholar. Our study provides an in-depth analysis of the risks associated with specific LLMs, identifying sub-risks, their causes, and potential solutions. Furthermore, we explore the broader challenges related to LLMs, detailing their causes and proposing mitigation strategies. Through this literature analysis, our survey aims to deepen the understanding of the implications and complexities surrounding these powerful models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) in interpreting existing literature through a systematic review of the relationship between Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) factors and financial performance. The primary objective is to assess how LLMs can replicate a systematic review on a corpus of ESG-focused papers. We compiled and hand-coded a database of 88 relevant papers published from March 2020 to May 2024. Additionally, we used a set of 238 papers from a previous systematic review of ESG literature from January 2015 to February 2020. We evaluated two current state-of-the-art LLMs, Meta AI's Llama 3 8B and OpenAI's GPT-4o, on the accuracy of their interpretations relative to human-made classifications on both sets of papers. We then compared these results to a "Custom GPT" and a fine-tuned GPT-4o Mini model using the corpus of 238 papers as training data. The fine-tuned GPT-4o Mini model outperformed the base LLMs by 28.3% on average in overall accuracy on prompt 1. At the same time, the "Custom GPT" showed a 3.0% and 15.7% improvement on average in overall accuracy on prompts 2 and 3, respectively. Our findings reveal promising results for investors and agencies to leverage LLMs to summarize complex evidence related to ESG investing, thereby enabling quicker decision-making and a more efficient market.</description>

      <title>Distinguishing Chatbot from Human</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There have been many recent advances in the fields of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Large Language Models (LLM), with the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) model being a leading "chatbot." LLM-based chatbots have become so powerful that it may seem difficult to differentiate between human-written and machine-generated text. To analyze this problem, we have developed a new dataset consisting of more than 750,000 human-written paragraphs, with a corresponding chatbot-generated paragraph for each. Based on this dataset, we apply Machine Learning (ML) techniques to determine the origin of text (human or chatbot). Specifically, we consider two methodologies for tackling this issue: feature analysis and embeddings. Our feature analysis approach involves extracting a collection of features from the text for classification. We also explore the use of contextual embeddings and transformer-based architectures to train classification models. Our proposed solutions offer high classification accuracy and serve as useful tools for textual analysis, resulting in a better understanding of chatbot-generated text in this era of advanced AI technology.</description>

      <title>Building Trust in Mental Health Chatbots: Safety Metrics and LLM-Based Evaluation Tools</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Objective: This study aims to develop and validate an evaluation framework to ensure the safety and reliability of mental health chatbots, which are increasingly popular due to their accessibility, human-like interactions, and context-aware support. Materials and Methods: We created an evaluation framework with 100 benchmark questions and ideal responses, and five guideline questions for chatbot responses. This framework, validated by mental health experts, was tested on a GPT-3.5-turbo-based chatbot. Automated evaluation methods explored included large language model (LLM)-based scoring, an agentic approach using real-time data, and embedding models to compare chatbot responses against ground truth standards. Results: The results highlight the importance of guidelines and ground truth for improving LLM evaluation accuracy. The agentic method, dynamically accessing reliable information, demonstrated the best alignment with human assessments. Adherence to a standardized, expert-validated framework significantly enhanced chatbot response safety and reliability. Discussion: Our findings emphasize the need for comprehensive, expert-tailored safety evaluation metrics for mental health chatbots. While LLMs have significant potential, careful implementation is necessary to mitigate risks. The superior performance of the agentic approach underscores the importance of real-time data access in enhancing chatbot reliability. Conclusion: The study validated an evaluation framework for mental health chatbots, proving its effectiveness in improving safety and reliability. Future work should extend evaluations to accuracy, bias, empathy, and privacy to ensure holistic assessment and responsible integration into healthcare. Standardized evaluations will build trust among users and professionals, facilitating broader adoption and improved mental health support through technology.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Large Language Models with Chain-of-Thought and Prompt Engineering for Traffic Crash Severity Analysis and Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Harnessing the power of Large Language Models (LLMs), this study explores the use of three state-of-the-art LLMs, specifically GPT-3.5-turbo, LLaMA3-8B, and LLaMA3-70B, for crash severity inference, framing it as a classification task. We generate textual narratives from original traffic crash tabular data using a pre-built template infused with domain knowledge. Additionally, we incorporated Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to guide the LLMs in analyzing the crash causes and then inferring the severity. This study also examine the impact of prompt engineering specifically designed for crash severity inference. The LLMs were tasked with crash severity inference to: (1) evaluate the models' capabilities in crash severity analysis, (2) assess the effectiveness of CoT and domain-informed prompt engineering, and (3) examine the reasoning abilities with the CoT framework. Our results showed that LLaMA3-70B consistently outperformed the other models, particularly in zero-shot settings. The CoT and Prompt Engineering techniques significantly enhanced performance, improving logical reasoning and addressing alignment issues. Notably, the CoT offers valuable insights into LLMs' reasoning processes, unleashing their capacity to consider diverse factors such as environmental conditions, driver behavior, and vehicle characteristics in severity analysis and inference.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper describes the winning solution of all 5 tasks for the Amazon KDD Cup 2024 Multi Task Online Shopping Challenge for LLMs. The challenge was to build a useful assistant, answering questions in the domain of online shopping. The competition contained 57 diverse tasks, covering 5 different task types (e.g. multiple choice) and across 4 different tracks (e.g. multi-lingual). Our solution is a single model per track. We fine-tune Qwen2-72B-Instruct on our own training dataset. As the competition released only 96 example questions, we developed our own training dataset by processing multiple public datasets or using Large Language Models for data augmentation and synthetic data generation. We apply wise-ft to account for distribution shifts and ensemble multiple LoRA adapters in one model. We employed Logits Processors to constrain the model output on relevant tokens for the tasks. AWQ 4-bit Quantization and vLLM are used during inference to predict the test dataset in the time constraints of 20 to 140 minutes depending on the track. Our solution achieved the first place in each individual track and is the first place overall of Amazons KDD Cup 2024.</description>

      <title>LLM Stability: A detailed analysis with some surprises</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A concerning property of our nearly magical LLMs involves the variation of results given the exact same input and deterministic hyper-parameters. While AI has always had a certain level of noisiness from inputs outside of training data, we have generally had deterministic results for any particular input; that is no longer true. While most LLM practitioners are "in the know", we are unaware of any work that attempts to quantify current LLM stability. We suspect no one has taken the trouble because it is just too boring a paper to execute and write. But we have done it and there are some surprises.
  What kinds of surprises?
  The evaluated LLMs are rarely deterministic at the raw output level; they are much more deterministic at the parsed output/answer level but still rarely 100% stable across 5 re-runs with same data input.
  LLM accuracy variation is not normally distributed.
  Stability varies based on task.</description>

      <title>AutoFAIR : Automatic Data FAIRification via Machine Reading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The explosive growth of data fuels data-driven research, facilitating progress across diverse domains. The FAIR principles emerge as a guiding standard, aiming to enhance the findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability of data. However, current efforts primarily focus on manual data FAIRification, which can only handle targeted data and lack efficiency. To address this issue, we propose AutoFAIR, an architecture designed to enhance data FAIRness automately. Firstly, We align each data and metadata operation with specific FAIR indicators to guide machine-executable actions. Then, We utilize Web Reader to automatically extract metadata based on language models, even in the absence of structured data webpage schemas. Subsequently, FAIR Alignment is employed to make metadata comply with FAIR principles by ontology guidance and semantic matching. Finally, by applying AutoFAIR to various data, especially in the field of mountain hazards, we observe significant improvements in findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability of data. The FAIRness scores before and after applying AutoFAIR indicate enhanced data value.</description>

      <title>ToolSandbox: A Stateful, Conversational, Interactive Evaluation Benchmark for LLM Tool Use Capabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent large language models (LLMs) advancements sparked a growing research interest in tool assisted LLMs solving real-world challenges, which calls for comprehensive evaluation of tool-use capabilities. While previous works focused on either evaluating over stateless web services (RESTful API), based on a single turn user prompt, or an off-policy dialog trajectory, ToolSandbox includes stateful tool execution, implicit state dependencies between tools, a built-in user simulator supporting on-policy conversational evaluation and a dynamic evaluation strategy for intermediate and final milestones over an arbitrary trajectory. We show that open source and proprietary models have a significant performance gap, and complex tasks like State Dependency, Canonicalization and Insufficient Information defined in ToolSandbox are challenging even the most capable SOTA LLMs, providing brand-new insights into tool-use LLM capabilities. ToolSandbox evaluation framework is released at https://github.com/apple/ToolSandbox</description>

      <title>Understanding the Performance and Estimating the Cost of LLM Fine-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to the cost-prohibitive nature of training Large Language Models (LLMs), fine-tuning has emerged as an attractive alternative for specializing LLMs for specific tasks using limited compute resources in a cost-effective manner. In this paper, we characterize sparse Mixture of Experts (MoE) based LLM fine-tuning to understand their accuracy and runtime performance on a single GPU. Our evaluation provides unique insights into the training efficacy of sparse and dense versions of MoE models, as well as their runtime characteristics, including maximum batch size, execution time breakdown, end-to-end throughput, GPU hardware utilization, and load distribution. Our study identifies the optimization of the MoE layer as crucial for further improving the performance of LLM fine-tuning. Using our profiling results, we also develop and validate an analytical model to estimate the cost of LLM fine-tuning on the cloud. This model, based on parameters of the model and GPU architecture, estimates LLM throughput and the cost of training, aiding practitioners in industry and academia to budget the cost of fine-tuning a specific model.</description>

      <title>Learning the Simplicity of Scattering Amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The simplification and reorganization of complex expressions lies at the core of scientific progress, particularly in theoretical high-energy physics. This work explores the application of machine learning to a particular facet of this challenge: the task of simplifying scattering amplitudes expressed in terms of spinor-helicity variables. We demonstrate that an encoder-decoder transformer architecture achieves impressive simplification capabilities for expressions composed of handfuls of terms. Lengthier expressions are implemented in an additional embedding network, trained using contrastive learning, which isolates subexpressions that are more likely to simplify. The resulting framework is capable of reducing expressions with hundreds of terms - a regular occurrence in quantum field theory calculations - to vastly simpler equivalent expressions. Starting from lengthy input expressions, our networks can generate the Parke-Taylor formula for five-point gluon scattering, as well as new compact expressions for five-point amplitudes involving scalars and gravitons. An interactive demonstration can be found at https://spinorhelicity.streamlit.app .</description>

      <title>Quantifying the Corpus Bias Problem in Automatic Music Transcription Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automatic Music Transcription (AMT) is the task of recognizing notes in audio recordings of music. The State-of-the-Art (SotA) benchmarks have been dominated by deep learning systems. Due to the scarcity of high quality data, they are usually trained and evaluated exclusively or predominantly on classical piano music. Unfortunately, that hinders our ability to understand how they generalize to other music. Previous works have revealed several aspects of memorization and overfitting in these systems. We identify two primary sources of distribution shift: the music, and the sound. Complementing recent results on the sound axis (i.e. acoustics, timbre), we investigate the musical one (i.e. note combinations, dynamics, genre). We evaluate the performance of several SotA AMT systems on two new experimental test sets which we carefully construct to emulate different levels of musical distribution shift. Our results reveal a stark performance gap, shedding further light on the Corpus Bias problem, and the extent to which it continues to trouble these systems.</description>

      <title>Segmentation of Mental Foramen in Orthopantomographs: A Deep Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precise identification and detection of the Mental Foramen are crucial in dentistry, impacting procedures such as impacted tooth removal, cyst surgeries, and implants. Accurately identifying this anatomical feature facilitates post-surgery issues and improves patient outcomes. Moreover, this study aims to accelerate dental procedures, elevating patient care and healthcare efficiency in dentistry. This research used Deep Learning methods to accurately detect and segment the Mental Foramen from panoramic radiograph images. Two mask types, circular and square, were used during model training. Multiple segmentation models were employed to identify and segment the Mental Foramen, and their effectiveness was evaluated using diverse metrics. An in-house dataset comprising 1000 panoramic radiographs was created for this study. Our experiments demonstrated that the Classical UNet model performed exceptionally well on the test data, achieving a Dice Coefficient of 0.79 and an Intersection over Union (IoU) of 0.67. Moreover, ResUNet++ and UNet Attention models showed competitive performance, with Dice scores of 0.675 and 0.676, and IoU values of 0.683 and 0.671, respectively. We also investigated transfer learning models with varied backbone architectures, finding LinkNet to produce the best outcomes. In conclusion, our research highlights the efficacy of the classical Unet model in accurately identifying and outlining the Mental Foramen in panoramic radiographs. While vital, this task is comparatively simpler than segmenting complex medical datasets such as brain tumours or skin cancer, given their diverse sizes and shapes. This research also holds value in optimizing dental practice, benefiting practitioners and patients.</description>

Abstract: The estimation of the ratio of two density probability functions is of great interest in many statistics fields, including causal inference. In this study, we develop an ensemble estimator of density ratios with a novel loss function based on super learning. We show that this novel loss function is qualified for building super learners. Two simulations corresponding to mediation analysis and longitudinal modified treatment policy in causal inference, where density ratios are nuisance parameters, are conducted to show our density ratio super learner's performance empirically.</description>

      <title>Improved Robustness for Deep Learning-based Segmentation of Multi-Center Myocardial Perfusion MRI Datasets Using Data Adaptive Uncertainty-guided Space-time Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Background. Fully automatic analysis of myocardial perfusion MRI datasets enables rapid and objective reporting of stress/rest studies in patients with suspected ischemic heart disease. Developing deep learning techniques that can analyze multi-center datasets despite limited training data and variations in software and hardware is an ongoing challenge.
  Methods. Datasets from 3 medical centers acquired at 3T (n = 150 subjects) were included: an internal dataset (inD; n = 95) and two external datasets (exDs; n = 55) used for evaluating the robustness of the trained deep neural network (DNN) models against differences in pulse sequence (exD-1) and scanner vendor (exD-2). A subset of inD (n = 85) was used for training/validation of a pool of DNNs for segmentation, all using the same spatiotemporal U-Net architecture and hyperparameters but with different parameter initializations. We employed a space-time sliding-patch analysis approach that automatically yields a pixel-wise "uncertainty map" as a byproduct of the segmentation process. In our approach, a given test case is segmented by all members of the DNN pool and the resulting uncertainty maps are leveraged to automatically select the "best" one among the pool of solutions.
  Results. The proposed DAUGS analysis approach performed similarly to the established approach on the internal dataset (p = n.s.) whereas it significantly outperformed on the external datasets (p &lt; 0.005 for exD-1 and exD-2). Moreover, the number of image series with "failed" segmentation was significantly lower for the proposed vs. the established approach (4.3% vs. 17.1%, p &lt; 0.0005).
  Conclusions. The proposed DAUGS analysis approach has the potential to improve the robustness of deep learning methods for segmentation of multi-center stress perfusion datasets with variations in the choice of pulse sequence, site location or scanner vendor.</description>

      <title>Scaling Deep Learning Computation over the Inter-Core Connected Intelligence Processor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As AI chips incorporate numerous parallelized cores to scale deep learning (DL) computing, inter-core communication is enabled recently by employing high-bandwidth and low-latency interconnect links on the chip (e.g., Graphcore IPU). It allows each core to directly access the fast scratchpad memory in other cores, which enables new parallel computing paradigms. However, without proper support for the scalable inter-core connections in current DL compilers, it is hard for developers to exploit the benefits of this new architecture.
  We present T10, the first DL compiler to exploit the inter-core communication bandwidth and distributed on-chip memory on AI chips. To formulate the computation and communication patterns of tensor operators in this new architecture, T10 introduces a distributed tensor abstraction rTensor. T10 maps a DNN model to execution plans with a generalized compute-shift pattern, by partitioning DNN computation into sub-operators and mapping them to cores, so that the cores can exchange data following predictable patterns. T10 makes globally optimized trade-offs between on-chip memory consumption and inter-core communication overhead, selects the best execution plan from a vast optimization space, and alleviates unnecessary inter-core communications. Our evaluation with a real inter-core connected AI chip, the Graphcore IPU, shows up to 3.3$\times$ performance improvement, and scalability support for larger models, compared to state-of-the-art DL compilers and vendor libraries.</description>

      <title>UniBench: Visual Reasoning Requires Rethinking Vision-Language Beyond Scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Significant research efforts have been made to scale and improve vision-language model (VLM) training approaches. Yet, with an ever-growing number of benchmarks, researchers are tasked with the heavy burden of implementing each protocol, bearing a non-trivial computational cost, and making sense of how all these benchmarks translate into meaningful axes of progress. To facilitate a systematic evaluation of VLM progress, we introduce UniBench: a unified implementation of 50+ VLM benchmarks spanning a comprehensive range of carefully categorized capabilities from object recognition to spatial awareness, counting, and much more. We showcase the utility of UniBench for measuring progress by evaluating nearly 60 publicly available vision-language models, trained on scales of up to 12.8B samples. We find that while scaling training data or model size can boost many vision-language model capabilities, scaling offers little benefit for reasoning or relations. Surprisingly, we also discover today's best VLMs struggle on simple digit recognition and counting tasks, e.g. MNIST, which much simpler networks can solve. Where scale falls short, we find that more precise interventions, such as data quality or tailored-learning objectives offer more promise. For practitioners, we also offer guidance on selecting a suitable VLM for a given application. Finally, we release an easy-to-run UniBench code-base with the full set of 50+ benchmarks and comparisons across 59 models as well as a distilled, representative set of benchmarks that runs in 5 minutes on a single GPU.</description>

      <title>FUSE-ing Language Models: Zero-Shot Adapter Discovery for Prompt Optimization Across Tokenizers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The widespread use of large language models has resulted in a multitude of tokenizers and embedding spaces, making knowledge transfer in prompt discovery tasks difficult. In this work, we propose FUSE (Flexible Unification of Semantic Embeddings), an inexpensive approach to approximating an adapter layer that maps from one model's textual embedding space to another, even across different tokenizers. We introduce a third-order tensor-based representation of a model's embedding space that aligns semantic embeddings that have been split apart by different tokenizers, and use this representation to derive an approximation of the gradient of one model's outputs with respect to another model's embedding space. We show the efficacy of our approach via multi-objective optimization over vision-language and causal language models for image captioning and sentiment-based image captioning.</description>

      <title>Natural Language Outlines for Code: Literate Programming in the LLM Era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose using natural language outlines as a novel modality and interaction surface for providing AI assistance to developers throughout the software development process. An NL outline for a code function comprises multiple statements written in concise prose, which partition the code and summarize its main ideas in the style of literate programming. Crucially, we find that modern LLMs can generate accurate and high-quality NL outlines in practice. Moreover, NL outlines enable a bidirectional sync between code and NL, allowing changes in one to be automatically reflected in the other. We discuss many use cases for NL outlines: they can accelerate understanding and navigation of code and diffs, simplify code maintenance, augment code search, steer code generation, and more. We then propose and compare multiple LLM prompting techniques for generating outlines and ask professional developers to judge outline quality. Finally, we present two case studies applying NL outlines toward code review and the difficult task of malware detection.</description>

      <title>Performance Prediction of Hub-Based Swarms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A hub-based colony consists of multiple agents who share a common nest site called the hub. Agents perform tasks away from the hub like foraging for food or gathering information about future nest sites. Modeling hub-based colonies is challenging because the size of the collective state space grows rapidly as the number of agents grows. This paper presents a graph-based representation of the colony that can be combined with graph-based encoders to create low-dimensional representations of collective state that can scale to many agents for a best-of-N colony problem. We demonstrate how the information in the low-dimensional embedding can be used with two experiments. First, we show how the information in the tensor can be used to cluster collective states by the probability of choosing the best site for a very small problem. Second, we show how structured collective trajectories emerge when a graph encoder is used to learn the low-dimensional embedding, and these trajectories have information that can be used to predict swarm performance.</description>

      <title>mPLUG-Owl3: Towards Long Image-Sequence Understanding in Multi-Modal Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in executing instructions for a variety of single-image tasks. Despite this progress, significant challenges remain in modeling long image sequences. In this work, we introduce the versatile multi-modal large language model, mPLUG-Owl3, which enhances the capability for long image-sequence understanding in scenarios that incorporate retrieved image-text knowledge, interleaved image-text, and lengthy videos. Specifically, we propose novel hyper attention blocks to efficiently integrate vision and language into a common language-guided semantic space, thereby facilitating the processing of extended multi-image scenarios. Extensive experimental results suggest that mPLUG-Owl3 achieves state-of-the-art performance among models with a similar size on single-image, multi-image, and video benchmarks. Moreover, we propose a challenging long visual sequence evaluation named Distractor Resistance to assess the ability of models to maintain focus amidst distractions. Finally, with the proposed architecture, mPLUG-Owl3 demonstrates outstanding performance on ultra-long visual sequence inputs. We hope that mPLUG-Owl3 can contribute to the development of more efficient and powerful multimodal large language models.</description>

      <title>UGrid: An Efficient-And-Rigorous Neural Multigrid Solver for Linear PDEs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerical solvers of Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) are of fundamental significance to science and engineering. To date, the historical reliance on legacy techniques has circumscribed possible integration of big data knowledge and exhibits sub-optimal efficiency for certain PDE formulations, while data-driven neural methods typically lack mathematical guarantee of convergence and correctness. This paper articulates a mathematically rigorous neural solver for linear PDEs. The proposed UGrid solver, built upon the principled integration of U-Net and MultiGrid, manifests a mathematically rigorous proof of both convergence and correctness, and showcases high numerical accuracy, as well as strong generalization power to various input geometry/values and multiple PDE formulations. In addition, we devise a new residual loss metric, which enables unsupervised training and affords more stability and a larger solution space over the legacy losses.</description>

      <title>A Pipeline for Data-Driven Learning of Topological Features with Applications to Protein Stability Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a data-driven method to learn interpretable topological features of biomolecular data and demonstrate the efficacy of parsimonious models trained on topological features in predicting the stability of synthetic mini proteins. We compare models that leverage automatically-learned structural features against models trained on a large set of biophysical features determined by subject-matter experts (SME). Our models, based only on topological features of the protein structures, achieved 92%-99% of the performance of SME-based models in terms of the average precision score. By interrogating model performance and feature importance metrics, we extract numerous insights that uncover high correlations between topological features and SME features. We further showcase how combining topological features and SME features can lead to improved model performance over either feature set used in isolation, suggesting that, in some settings, topological features may provide new discriminating information not captured in existing SME features that are useful for protein stability prediction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, representation learning with contrastive learning algorithms has been successfully applied to challenging unlabeled datasets. However, these methods are unable to distinguish important features from unimportant ones under simply unsupervised settings, and definitions of importance vary according to the type of downstream task or analysis goal, such as the identification of objects or backgrounds. In this paper, we focus on unsupervised image clustering as the downstream task and propose a representation learning method that enhances features critical to the clustering task. We extend a clustering-friendly contrastive learning method and incorporate a contrastive analysis approach, which utilizes a reference dataset to separate important features from unimportant ones, into the design of loss functions. Conducting an experimental evaluation of image clustering for three datasets with characteristic backgrounds, we show that for all datasets, our method achieves higher clustering scores compared with conventional contrastive analysis and deep clustering methods.</description>

Abstract: Explaining decisions of black-box classifiers is both important and computationally challenging. In this paper, we scrutinize explainers that generate feature-based explanations from samples or datasets. We start by presenting a set of desirable properties that explainers would ideally satisfy, delve into their relationships, and highlight incompatibilities of some of them. We identify the entire family of explainers that satisfy two key properties which are compatible with all the others. Its instances provide sufficient reasons, called weak abductive explanations.We then unravel its various subfamilies that satisfy subsets of compatible properties. Indeed, we fully characterize all the explainers that satisfy any subset of compatible properties. In particular, we introduce the first (broad family of) explainers that guarantee the existence of explanations and their global consistency.We discuss some of its instances including the irrefutable explainer and the surrogate explainer whose explanations can be found in polynomial time.</description>

      <title>Causal Discovery of Linear Non-Gaussian Causal Models with Unobserved Confounding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider linear non-Gaussian structural equation models that involve latent confounding. In this setting, the causal structure is identifiable, but, in general, it is not possible to identify the specific causal effects. Instead, a finite number of different causal effects result in the same observational distribution. Most existing algorithms for identifying these causal effects use overcomplete independent component analysis (ICA), which often suffers from convergence to local optima. Furthermore, the number of latent variables must be known a priori. To address these issues, we propose an algorithm that operates recursively rather than using overcomplete ICA. The algorithm first infers a source, estimates the effect of the source and its latent parents on their descendants, and then eliminates their influence from the data. For both source identification and effect size estimation, we use rank conditions on matrices formed from higher-order cumulants. We prove asymptotic correctness under the mild assumption that locally, the number of latent variables never exceeds the number of observed variables. Simulation studies demonstrate that our method achieves comparable performance to overcomplete ICA even though it does not know the number of latents in advance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is characterized by irregular electrical impulses originating in the atria, which can lead to severe complications and even death. Due to the intermittent nature of the AF, early and timely monitoring of AF is critical for patients to prevent further exacerbation of the condition. Although ambulatory ECG Holter monitors provide accurate monitoring, the high cost of these devices hinders their wider adoption. Current mobile-based AF detection systems offer a portable solution. However, these systems have various applicability issues, such as being easily affected by environmental factors and requiring significant user effort. To overcome the above limitations, we present AcousAF, a novel AF detection system based on acoustic sensors of smartphones. Particularly, we explore the potential of pulse wave acquisition from the wrist using smartphone speakers and microphones. In addition, we propose a well-designed framework comprised of pulse wave probing, pulse wave extraction, and AF detection to ensure accurate and reliable AF detection. We collect data from 20 participants utilizing our custom data collection application on the smartphone. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the high performance of our system, with 92.8% accuracy, 86.9% precision, 87.4% recall, and 87.1% F1 Score.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have revolutionized search and rescue (SAR) operations, but the lack of specialized human detection datasets for training machine learning models poses a significant challenge.To address this gap, this paper introduces the Combination to Application (C2A) dataset, synthesized by overlaying human poses onto UAV-captured disaster scenes. Through extensive experimentation with state-of-the-art detection models, we demonstrate that models fine-tuned on the C2A dataset exhibit substantial performance improvements compared to those pre-trained on generic aerial datasets. Furthermore, we highlight the importance of combining the C2A dataset with general human datasets to achieve optimal performance and generalization across various scenarios. This points out the crucial need for a tailored dataset to enhance the effectiveness of SAR operations. Our contributions also include developing dataset creation pipeline and integrating diverse human poses and disaster scenes information to assess the severity of disaster scenarios. Our findings advocate for future developments, to ensure that SAR operations benefit from the most realistic and effective AI-assisted interventions possible.</description>

The approach assumes a linear correlation model between the input variables which is used to decompose the contribution of an input variable into a correlated and an uncorrelated part. This method provides sampling matrices following the original joint probability distribution which are used directly to compute the model output without any assumptions or approximations of the model response function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extraction and interpretation of intricate information from unstructured text data arising in financial applications, such as earnings call transcripts, present substantial challenges to large language models (LLMs) even using the current best practices to use Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) (referred to as VectorRAG techniques which utilize vector databases for information retrieval) due to challenges such as domain specific terminology and complex formats of the documents. We introduce a novel approach based on a combination, called HybridRAG, of the Knowledge Graphs (KGs) based RAG techniques (called GraphRAG) and VectorRAG techniques to enhance question-answer (Q&amp;A) systems for information extraction from financial documents that is shown to be capable of generating accurate and contextually relevant answers. Using experiments on a set of financial earning call transcripts documents which come in the form of Q&amp;A format, and hence provide a natural set of pairs of ground-truth Q&amp;As, we show that HybridRAG which retrieves context from both vector database and KG outperforms both traditional VectorRAG and GraphRAG individually when evaluated at both the retrieval and generation stages in terms of retrieval accuracy and answer generation. The proposed technique has applications beyond the financial domain</description>

      <title>CROCODILE: Causality aids RObustness via COntrastive DIsentangled LEarning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to domain shift, deep learning image classifiers perform poorly when applied to a domain different from the training one. For instance, a classifier trained on chest X-ray (CXR) images from one hospital may not generalize to images from another hospital due to variations in scanner settings or patient characteristics. In this paper, we introduce our CROCODILE framework, showing how tools from causality can foster a model's robustness to domain shift via feature disentanglement, contrastive learning losses, and the injection of prior knowledge. This way, the model relies less on spurious correlations, learns the mechanism bringing from images to prediction better, and outperforms baselines on out-of-distribution (OOD) data. We apply our method to multi-label lung disease classification from CXRs, utilizing over 750000 images from four datasets. Our bias-mitigation method improves domain generalization and fairness, broadening the applicability and reliability of deep learning models for a safer medical image analysis.

      <title>Retrieval-augmented code completion for local projects using large language models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The use of large language models (LLMs) is becoming increasingly widespread among software developers. However, privacy and computational requirements are problematic with commercial solutions and the use of LLMs. In this work, we focus on using LLMs with around 160 million parameters that are suitable for local execution and augmentation with retrieval from local projects. We train two models based on the transformer architecture, the generative model GPT-2 and the retrieval-adapted RETRO model, on open-source Python files, and empirically evaluate and compare them, confirming the benefits of vector embedding based retrieval. Further, we improve our models' performance with In-context retrieval-augmented generation, which retrieves code snippets based on the Jaccard similarity of tokens. We evaluate In-context retrieval-augmented generation on larger models and conclude that, despite its simplicity, the approach is more suitable than using the RETRO architecture. We highlight the key role of proper tokenization in achieving the full potential of LLMs in code completion.</description>

      <title>Integrating Edge Information into Ground Truth for the Segmentation of the Optic Disc and Cup from Fundus Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optic disc and cup segmentation helps in the diagnosis of glaucoma, myocardial infarction, and diabetic retinopathy. Most deep learning methods developed to perform segmentation tasks are built on top of a U-Net-based model architecture. Nevertheless, U-Net and its variants have a tendency to over-segment/ under-segment the required regions of interest. Since the most important outcome is the value of cup-to-disc ratio and not the segmented regions themselves, we are more concerned about the boundaries rather than the regions under the boundaries. This makes learning edges important as compared to learning the regions. In the proposed work, the authors aim to extract both edges of the optic disc and cup from the ground truth using a Laplacian filter. Next, edges are reconstructed to obtain an edge ground truth in addition to the optic disc-cup ground truth. Utilizing both ground truths, the authors study several U-Net and its variant architectures with and without optic disc and cup edges as target, along with the optic disc-cup ground truth for segmentation. The authors have used the REFUGE benchmark dataset and the Drishti-GS dataset to perform the study, and the results are tabulated for the dice and the Hausdorff distance metrics. In the case of the REFUGE dataset, the optic disc mean dice score has improved from 0.7425 to 0.8859 while the mean Hausdorff distance has reduced from 6.5810 to 3.0540 for the baseline U-Net model. Similarly, the optic cup mean dice score has improved from 0.6970 to 0.8639 while the mean Hausdorff distance has reduced from 5.2340 to 2.6323 for the same model. Similar improvement has been observed for the Drishti-GS dataset as well. Compared to the baseline U-Net and its variants (i.e) the Attention U-Net and the U-Net++, the models that learn integrated edges along with the optic disc and cup regions performed well in both validation and testing datasets.</description>

      <title>Variational Bayesian Phylogenetic Inference with Semi-implicit Branch Length Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reconstructing the evolutionary history relating a collection of molecular sequences is the main subject of modern Bayesian phylogenetic inference. However, the commonly used Markov chain Monte Carlo methods can be inefficient due to the complicated space of phylogenetic trees, especially when the number of sequences is large. An alternative approach is variational Bayesian phylogenetic inference (VBPI) which transforms the inference problem into an optimization problem. While effective, the default diagonal lognormal approximation for the branch lengths of the tree used in VBPI is often insufficient to capture the complexity of the exact posterior. In this work, we propose a more flexible family of branch length variational posteriors based on semi-implicit hierarchical distributions using graph neural networks. We show that this semi-implicit construction emits straightforward permutation equivariant distributions, and therefore can handle the non-Euclidean branch length space across different tree topologies with ease. To deal with the intractable marginal probability of semi-implicit variational distributions, we develop several alternative lower bounds for stochastic optimization. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method over baseline methods on benchmark data examples, in terms of both marginal likelihood estimation and branch length posterior approximation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The training phase of deep neural networks requires substantial resources and as such is often performed on cloud servers. However, this raises privacy concerns when the training dataset contains sensitive content, e.g., face images. In this work, we propose a method to perform the training phase of a deep learning model on both an edge device and a cloud server that prevents sensitive content being transmitted to the cloud while retaining the desired information. The proposed privacy-preserving method uses adversarial early exits to suppress the sensitive content at the edge and transmits the task-relevant information to the cloud. This approach incorporates noise addition during the training phase to provide a differential privacy guarantee. We extensively test our method on different facial datasets with diverse face attributes using various deep learning architectures, showcasing its outstanding performance. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of privacy preservation through successful defenses against different white-box and deep reconstruction attacks.</description>

      <title>AI-driven Java Performance Testing: Balancing Result Quality with Testing Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Performance testing aims at uncovering efficiency issues of software systems. In order to be both effective and practical, the design of a performance test must achieve a reasonable trade-off between result quality and testing time. This becomes particularly challenging in Java context, where the software undergoes a warm-up phase of execution, due to just-in-time compilation. During this phase, performance measurements are subject to severe fluctuations, which may adversely affect quality of performance test results. However, these approaches often provide suboptimal estimates of the warm-up phase, resulting in either insufficient or excessive warm-up iterations, which may degrade result quality or increase testing time. There is still a lack of consensus on how to properly address this problem. Here, we propose and study an AI-based framework to dynamically halt warm-up iterations at runtime. Specifically, our framework leverages recent advances in AI for Time Series Classification (TSC) to predict the end of the warm-up phase during test execution. We conduct experiments by training three different TSC models on half a million of measurement segments obtained from JMH microbenchmark executions. We find that our framework significantly improves the accuracy of the warm-up estimates provided by state-of-practice and state-of-the-art methods. This higher estimation accuracy results in a net improvement in either result quality or testing time for up to +35.3% of the microbenchmarks. Our study highlights that integrating AI to dynamically estimate the end of the warm-up phase can enhance the cost-effectiveness of Java performance testing.</description>

Abstract: Factors which attract customers and persuade them to buy new car are various regarding different consumer tastes. There are some methods to extract pattern form mass data. In this case we firstly asked passenger car marketing experts to rank more important factors which affect customer decision making behavior using fuzzy Delphi technique, then we provided a sample set from questionnaires and tried to apply a useful artificial neural network method called self_organizing map SOM to find out which factors have more effect on Iranian customer's buying decision making. Fuzzy tools were applied to adjust the study to be more real. MATLAB software was used for developing and training network. Results report four factors are more important rather than the others. Results are rather different from marketing expert rankings. Such results would help manufacturers to focus on more important factors and increase company sales level.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classical learning of the expectation values of observables for quantum states is a natural variant of learning quantum states or channels. While learning-theoretic frameworks establish the sample complexity and the number of measurement shots per sample required for learning such statistical quantities, the interplay between these two variables has not been adequately quantified before. In this work, we take the probabilistic nature of quantum measurements into account in classical modelling and discuss these quantities under a single unified learning framework. We provide provable guarantees for learning parameterized quantum models that also quantify the asymmetrical effects and interplay of the two variables on the performance of learning algorithms. These results show that while increasing the sample size enhances the learning performance of classical machines, even with single-shot estimates, the improvements from increasing measurements become asymptotically trivial beyond a constant factor. We further apply our framework and theoretical guarantees to study the impact of measurement noise on the classical surrogation of parameterized quantum circuit models. Our work provides new tools to analyse the operational influence of finite measurement noise in the classical learning of quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Impacts of floating-point non-associativity on reproducibility for HPC and deep learning applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Run-by-run variability in parallel programs caused by floating-point non-associativity (FPNA) has been known to significantly affect reproducibility in iterative algorithms, due to accumulating errors. Non-reproducibility negatively affects efficiency and effectiveness of correctness testing for stochastic programs. Recently, the sensitivity of deep learning (DL) training and inference pipelines to FPNA have been found to be extreme, and can prevent certification for commercial applications, accurate assessment of robustness and sensitivity, and bug detection. New approaches in scientific computing applications have coupled DL models with high-performance computing (HPC) simulations, leading to an aggravation of debugging and testing challenges. Here we perform an investigation of the statistical properties of FPNA within modern parallel programming models, analyze performance and productivity impacts of replacing atomic operations with deterministic alternatives on GPUs, and examine the recently-added deterministic options within the PyTorch framework within the context of GPU deployment, uncovering and quantifying the impacts of input parameters triggering run-by-run variability and reporting on the reliability and completeness of the documentation. Finally, we evaluate the strategy of exploiting automatic determinism provided by deterministic hardware, using the Groq LPU$^{TM}$ accelerator for inference portions of the DL pipeline. We demonstrate the benefits that this strategy can provide within reproducibility and correctness efforts.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel decoding method for Quantum Low-Density Parity-Check (QLDPC) codes based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Similar to the Belief Propagation (BP)-based QLDPC decoders, the proposed GNN-based QLDPC decoder exploits the sparse graph structure of QLDPC codes and can be implemented as a message-passing decoding algorithm. We compare the proposed GNN-based decoding algorithm against selected classes of both conventional and neural-enhanced QLDPC decoding algorithms across several QLDPC code designs. The simulation results demonstrate excellent performance of GNN-based decoders along with their low complexity compared to competing methods.</description>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) represent a significant advancement in artificial intelligence, finding applications across various domains. However, their reliance on massive internet-sourced datasets for training brings notable privacy issues, which are exacerbated in critical domains (e.g., healthcare). Moreover, certain application-specific scenarios may require fine-tuning these models on private data. This survey critically examines the privacy threats associated with LLMs, emphasizing the potential for these models to memorize and inadvertently reveal sensitive information. We explore current threats by reviewing privacy attacks on LLMs and propose comprehensive solutions for integrating privacy mechanisms throughout the entire learning pipeline. These solutions range from anonymizing training datasets to implementing differential privacy during training or inference and machine unlearning after training. Our comprehensive review of existing literature highlights ongoing challenges, available tools, and future directions for preserving privacy in LLMs. This work aims to guide the development of more secure and trustworthy AI systems by providing a thorough understanding of privacy preservation methods and their effectiveness in mitigating risks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2112.09741v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To advance deep learning methodologies in the next decade, a theoretical framework for reasoning about modern neural networks is needed. While efforts are increasing toward demystifying why deep learning is so effective, a comprehensive picture remains lacking, suggesting that a better theory is possible. We argue that a future deep learning theory should inherit three characteristics: a \textit{hierarchically} structured network architecture, parameters \textit{iteratively} optimized using stochastic gradient-based methods, and information from the data that evolves \textit{compressively}. As an instantiation, we integrate these characteristics into a graphical model called \textit{neurashed}. This model effectively explains some common empirical patterns in deep learning. In particular, neurashed enables insights into implicit regularization, information bottleneck, and local elasticity. Finally, we discuss how neurashed can guide the development of deep learning theories.</description>

Abstract: Notions of counterfactual invariance (CI) have proven essential for predictors that are fair, robust, and generalizable in the real world. We propose graphical criteria that yield a sufficient condition for a predictor to be counterfactually invariant in terms of a conditional independence in the observational distribution. In order to learn such predictors, we propose a model-agnostic framework, called Counterfactually Invariant Prediction (CIP), building on the Hilbert-Schmidt Conditional Independence Criterion (HSCIC), a kernel-based conditional dependence measure. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of CIP in enforcing counterfactual invariance across various simulated and real-world datasets including scalar and multi-variate settings.</description>

      <title>Learning k-Level Structured Sparse Neural Networks Using Group Envelope Regularization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.12921v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The extensive need for computational resources poses a significant obstacle to deploying large-scale Deep Neural Networks (DNN) on devices with constrained resources. At the same time, studies have demonstrated that a significant number of these DNN parameters are redundant and extraneous. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for learning structured sparse neural networks, aimed at bridging the DNN hardware deployment challenges. We develop a novel regularization technique, termed Weighted Group Sparse Envelope Function (WGSEF), generalizing the Sparse Envelop Function (SEF), to select (or nullify) neuron groups, thereby reducing redundancy and enhancing computational efficiency. The method speeds up inference time and aims to reduce memory demand and power consumption, thanks to its adaptability which lets any hardware specify group definitions, such as filters, channels, filter shapes, layer depths, a single parameter (unstructured), etc. The properties of the WGSEF enable the pre-definition of a desired sparsity level to be achieved at the training convergence. In the case of redundant parameters, this approach maintains negligible network accuracy degradation or can even lead to improvements in accuracy. Our method efficiently computes the WGSEF regularizer and its proximal operator, in a worst-case linear complexity relative to the number of group variables. Employing a proximal-gradient-based optimization technique, to train the model, it tackles the non-convex minimization problem incorporating the neural network loss and the WGSEF. Finally, we experiment and illustrate the efficiency of our proposed method in terms of the compression ratio, accuracy, and inference latency.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.13458v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the optimization of neural networks on symmetric data, and compare the strategy of constraining the architecture to be equivariant to that of using data augmentation. Our analysis reveals that that the relative geometry of the admissible and the equivariant layers, respectively, plays a key role. Under natural assumptions on the data, network, loss, and group of symmetries, we show that compatibility of the spaces of admissible layers and equivariant layers, in the sense that the corresponding orthogonal projections commute, implies that the sets of equivariant stationary points are identical for the two strategies. If the linear layers of the network also are given a unitary parametrization, the set of equivariant layers is even invariant under the gradient flow for augmented models. Our analysis however also reveals that even in the latter situation, stationary points may be unstable for augmented training although they are stable for the manifestly equivariant models.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Reinforcement Learning with Value-Conditional State Entropy Exploration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.19476v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A promising technique for exploration is to maximize the entropy of visited state distribution, i.e., state entropy, by encouraging uniform coverage of visited state space. While it has been effective for an unsupervised setup, it tends to struggle in a supervised setup with a task reward, where an agent prefers to visit high-value states to exploit the task reward. Such a preference can cause an imbalance between the distributions of high-value states and low-value states, which biases exploration towards low-value state regions as a result of the state entropy increasing when the distribution becomes more uniform. This issue is exacerbated when high-value states are narrowly distributed within the state space, making it difficult for the agent to complete the tasks. In this paper, we present a novel exploration technique that maximizes the value-conditional state entropy, which separately estimates the state entropies that are conditioned on the value estimates of each state, then maximizes their average. By only considering the visited states with similar value estimates for computing the intrinsic bonus, our method prevents the distribution of low-value states from affecting exploration around high-value states, and vice versa. We demonstrate that the proposed alternative to the state entropy baseline significantly accelerates various reinforcement learning algorithms across a variety of tasks within MiniGrid, DeepMind Control Suite, and Meta-World benchmarks.

Abstract: Time series are the primary data type used to record dynamic system measurements and generated in great volume by both physical sensors and online processes (virtual sensors). Time series analytics is therefore crucial to unlocking the wealth of information implicit in available data. With the recent advancements in graph neural networks (GNNs), there has been a surge in GNN-based approaches for time series analysis. These approaches can explicitly model inter-temporal and inter-variable relationships, which traditional and other deep neural network-based methods struggle to do. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of graph neural networks for time series analysis (GNN4TS), encompassing four fundamental dimensions: forecasting, classification, anomaly detection, and imputation. Our aim is to guide designers and practitioners to understand, build applications, and advance research of GNN4TS. At first, we provide a comprehensive task-oriented taxonomy of GNN4TS. Then, we present and discuss representative research works and introduce mainstream applications of GNN4TS. A comprehensive discussion of potential future research directions completes the survey. This survey, for the first time, brings together a vast array of knowledge on GNN-based time series research, highlighting foundations, practical applications, and opportunities of graph neural networks for time series analysis.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity-Aware Mixed-Precision Quantization and Width Optimization of Deep Neural Networks Through Cluster-Based Tree-Structured Parzen Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.06422v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As the complexity and computational demands of deep learning models rise, the need for effective optimization methods for neural network designs becomes paramount. This work introduces an innovative search mechanism for automatically selecting the best bit-width and layer-width for individual neural network layers. This leads to a marked enhancement in deep neural network efficiency. The search domain is strategically reduced by leveraging Hessian-based pruning, ensuring the removal of non-crucial parameters. Subsequently, we detail the development of surrogate models for favorable and unfavorable outcomes by employing a cluster-based tree-structured Parzen estimator. This strategy allows for a streamlined exploration of architectural possibilities and swift pinpointing of top-performing designs. Through rigorous testing on well-known datasets, our method proves its distinct advantage over existing methods. Compared to leading compression strategies, our approach records an impressive 20% decrease in model size without compromising accuracy. Additionally, our method boasts a 12x reduction in search time relative to the best search-focused strategies currently available. As a result, our proposed method represents a leap forward in neural network design optimization, paving the way for quick model design and implementation in settings with limited resources, thereby propelling the potential of scalable deep learning solutions.</description>

Abstract: Modern deep neural networks, particularly recent large language models, come with massive model sizes that require significant computational and storage resources. To enable the deployment of modern models on resource-constrained environments and accelerate inference time, researchers have increasingly explored pruning techniques as a popular research direction in neural network compression. However, there is a dearth of up-to-date comprehensive review papers on pruning. To address this issue, in this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of existing research works on deep neural network pruning in a taxonomy of 1) universal/specific speedup, 2) when to prune, 3) how to prune, and 4) fusion of pruning and other compression techniques. We then provide a thorough comparative analysis of eight pairs of contrast settings for pruning and explore emerging topics, including pruning for large language models, large multimodal models, post-training pruning, and different supervision levels for pruning to shed light on the commonalities and differences of existing methods and lay the foundation for further method development. To facilitate future research, we build a curated collection of datasets, networks, and evaluations on different applications. Finally, we provide valuable recommendations on selecting pruning methods and prospect several promising research directions. We build a repository at https://github.com/hrcheng1066/awesome-pruning.</description>

      <title>DeepHGCN: Toward Deeper Hyperbolic Graph Convolutional Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.02027v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hyperbolic graph convolutional networks (HGCNs) have demonstrated significant potential in extracting information from hierarchical graphs. However, existing HGCNs are limited to shallow architectures due to the computational expense of hyperbolic operations and the issue of over-smoothing as depth increases. Although treatments have been applied to alleviate over-smoothing in GCNs, developing a hyperbolic solution presents distinct challenges since operations must be carefully designed to fit the hyperbolic nature. Addressing these challenges, we propose DeepHGCN, the first deep multi-layer HGCN architecture with dramatically improved computational efficiency and substantially reduced over-smoothing. DeepHGCN features two key innovations: (1) a novel hyperbolic feature transformation layer that enables fast and accurate linear mappings, and (2) techniques such as hyperbolic residual connections and regularization for both weights and features, facilitated by an efficient hyperbolic midpoint method. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DeepHGCN achieves significant improvements in link prediction and node classification tasks compared to both Euclidean and shallow hyperbolic GCN variants.</description>

      <title>SteP: Stacked LLM Policies for Web Actions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.03720v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Performing tasks on the web presents fundamental challenges to large language models (LLMs), including combinatorially large open-world tasks and variations across web interfaces. Simply specifying a large prompt to handle all possible behaviors and states is extremely complex, and results in behavior leaks between unrelated behaviors. Decomposition to distinct policies can address this challenge, but requires carefully handing off control between policies. We propose Stacked LLM Policies for Web Actions (SteP), an approach to dynamically compose policies to solve a diverse set of web tasks. SteP defines a Markov Decision Process where the state is a stack of policies representing the control state, i.e., the chain of policy calls. Unlike traditional methods that are restricted to static hierarchies, SteP enables dynamic control that adapts to the complexity of the task. We evaluate SteP against multiple baselines and web environments including WebArena, MiniWoB++, and a CRM. On WebArena, SteP improves (14.9\% to 33.5\%) over SOTA that use GPT-4 policies, while on MiniWob++, SteP is competitive with prior works while using significantly less data. Our code and data are available at https://asappresearch.github.io/webagents-step.</description>

      <title>Eliciting Latent Knowledge from Quirky Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.01037v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Eliciting Latent Knowledge (ELK) aims to find patterns in a capable neural network's activations that robustly track the true state of the world, especially in hard-to-verify cases where the model's output is untrusted. To further ELK research, we introduce 12 datasets and a corresponding suite of "quirky" language models (LMs) that are finetuned to make systematic errors when answering questions if and only if the keyword "Bob" is present in the prompt. We find that, especially in middle layers, linear probes usually report an LM's knowledge independently of what the LM outputs, enabling us to elicit the correct answer despite the model's untruthful output. The best probing method (logistic regression on contrast pairs) recovers 89% of the gap in AUROC between truthful and untruthful contexts, and 75% for questions harder than those used to train the probe. We also find that a mechanistic anomaly detection approach can flag untruthful behavior with 0.95 AUROC. Our results show promise for eliciting reliable knowledge from capable but untrusted models, and facilitates future research empirically investigating ELK methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14134v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Learning rewards from expert videos offers an affordable and effective solution to specify the intended behaviors for reinforcement learning (RL) tasks. In this work, we propose Diffusion Reward, a novel framework that learns rewards from expert videos via conditional video diffusion models for solving complex visual RL problems. Our key insight is that lower generative diversity is exhibited when conditioning diffusion on expert trajectories. Diffusion Reward is accordingly formalized by the negative of conditional entropy that encourages productive exploration of expert behaviors. We show the efficacy of our method over robotic manipulation tasks in both simulation platforms and the real world with visual input. Moreover, Diffusion Reward can even solve unseen tasks successfully and effectively, largely surpassing baseline methods. Project page and code: https://diffusion-reward.github.io.</description>

      <title>Distributionally Robust Policy Evaluation under General Covariate Shift in Contextual Bandits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.11353v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a distributionally robust approach that enhances the reliability of offline policy evaluation in contextual bandits under general covariate shifts. Our method aims to deliver robust policy evaluation results in the presence of discrepancies in both context and policy distribution between logging and target data. Central to our methodology is the application of robust regression, a distributionally robust technique tailored here to improve the estimation of conditional reward distribution from logging data. Utilizing the reward model obtained from robust regression, we develop a comprehensive suite of policy value estimators, by integrating our reward model into established evaluation frameworks, namely direct methods and doubly robust methods. Through theoretical analysis, we further establish that the proposed policy value estimators offer a finite sample upper bound for the bias, providing a clear advantage over traditional methods, especially when the shift is large. Finally, we designed an extensive range of policy evaluation scenarios, covering diverse magnitudes of shifts and a spectrum of logging and target policies. Our empirical results indicate that our approach significantly outperforms baseline methods, most notably in 90% of the cases under the policy shift-only settings and 72% of the scenarios under the general covariate shift settings.</description>

      <title>On Building Myopic MPC Policies using Supervised Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.12546v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The application of supervised learning techniques in combination with model predictive control (MPC) has recently generated significant interest, particularly in the area of approximate explicit MPC, where function approximators like deep neural networks are used to learn the MPC policy via optimal state-action pairs generated offline. While the aim of approximate explicit MPC is to closely replicate the MPC policy, substituting online optimization with a trained neural network, the performance guarantees that come with solving the online optimization problem are typically lost. This paper considers an alternative strategy, where supervised learning is used to learn the optimal value function offline instead of learning the optimal policy. This can then be used as the cost-to-go function in a myopic MPC with a very short prediction horizon, such that the online computation burden reduces significantly without affecting the controller performance. This approach differs from existing work on value function approximations in the sense that it learns the cost-to-go function by using offline-collected state-value pairs, rather than closed-loop performance data. The cost of generating the state-value pairs used for training is addressed using a sensitivity-based data augmentation scheme.</description>

      <title>Rehabilitation Exercise Quality Assessment through Supervised Contrastive Learning with Hard and Soft Negatives</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02772v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Exercise-based rehabilitation programs have proven to be effective in enhancing the quality of life and reducing mortality and rehospitalization rates. AI-driven virtual rehabilitation, which allows patients to independently complete exercises at home, utilizes AI algorithms to analyze exercise data, providing feedback to patients and updating clinicians on their progress. These programs commonly prescribe a variety of exercise types, leading to a distinct challenge in rehabilitation exercise assessment datasets: while abundant in overall training samples, these datasets often have a limited number of samples for each individual exercise type. This disparity hampers the ability of existing approaches to train generalizable models with such a small sample size per exercise type. Addressing this issue, this paper introduces a novel supervised contrastive learning framework with hard and soft negative samples that effectively utilizes the entire dataset to train a single model applicable to all exercise types. This model, with a Spatial-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (ST-GCN) architecture, demonstrated enhanced generalizability across exercises and a decrease in overall complexity. Through extensive experiments on three publicly available rehabilitation exercise assessment datasets, UI-PRMD, IRDS, and KIMORE, our method has proven to surpass existing methods, setting a new benchmark in rehabilitation exercise quality assessment.</description>

      <title>Domain Generalization through Meta-Learning: A Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02785v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have revolutionized artificial intelligence but often lack performance when faced with out-of-distribution (OOD) data, a common scenario due to the inevitable domain shifts in real-world applications. This limitation stems from the common assumption that training and testing data share the same distribution--an assumption frequently violated in practice. Despite their effectiveness with large amounts of data and computational power, DNNs struggle with distributional shifts and limited labeled data, leading to overfitting and poor generalization across various tasks and domains. Meta-learning presents a promising approach by employing algorithms that acquire transferable knowledge across various tasks for fast adaptation, eliminating the need to learn each task from scratch. This survey paper delves into the realm of meta-learning with a focus on its contribution to domain generalization. We first clarify the concept of meta-learning for domain generalization and introduce a novel taxonomy based on the feature extraction strategy and the classifier learning methodology, offering a granular view of methodologies. Additionally, we present a decision graph to assist readers in navigating the taxonomy based on data availability and domain shifts, enabling them to select and develop a proper model tailored to their specific problem requirements. Through an exhaustive review of existing methods and underlying theories, we map out the fundamentals of the field. Our survey provides practical insights and an informed discussion on promising research directions.</description>

      <title>Gradient-based Automatic Mixed Precision Quantization for Neural Networks On-Chip</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00645v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Model size and inference speed at deployment time, are major challenges in many deep learning applications. A promising strategy to overcome these challenges is quantization. However, a straightforward uniform quantization to very low precision can result in significant accuracy loss. Mixed-precision quantization, based on the idea that certain parts of the network can accommodate lower precision without compromising performance compared to other parts, offers a potential solution. In this work, we present High Granularity Quantization (HGQ), an innovative quantization-aware training method that could fine-tune the per-weight and per-activation precision by making them optimizable through gradient descent. This approach enables ultra-low latency and low power neural networks on hardware capable of performing arithmetic operations with an arbitrary number of bits, such as FPGAs and ASICs. We demonstrate that HGQ can outperform existing methods by a substantial margin, achieving resource reduction by up to a factor of 20 and latency improvement by a factor of 5 while preserving accuracy.</description>

      <title>FuXi-ENS: A machine learning model for medium-range ensemble weather forecasting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05925v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ensemble forecasting is crucial for improving weather predictions, especially for forecasts of extreme events. Constructing an ensemble prediction system (EPS) based on conventional NWP models is highly computationally expensive. ML models have emerged as valuable tools for deterministic weather forecasts, providing forecasts with significantly reduced computational requirements and even surpassing the forecast performance of traditional NWP models. However, challenges arise when applying ML models to ensemble forecasting. Recent ML models, such as GenCast and SEEDS model, rely on the ERA5 EDA or operational NWP ensemble members for forecast generation. Their spatial resolution is also considered too coarse for many applications. To overcome these limitations, we introduce FuXi-ENS, an advanced ML model designed to deliver 6-hourly global ensemble weather forecasts up to 15 days. This model runs at a significantly increased spatial resolution of 0.25\textdegree, incorporating 5 atmospheric variables at 13 pressure levels, along with 13 surface variables. By leveraging the inherent probabilistic nature of Variational AutoEncoder (VAE), FuXi-ENS optimizes a loss function that combines the CRPS and the KL divergence between the predicted and target distribution, facilitating the incorporation of flow-dependent perturbations in both initial conditions and forecast. This innovative approach makes FuXi-ENS an advancement over the traditional ones that use L1 loss combined with the KL loss in standard VAE models for ensemble weather forecasting. Results demonstrate that FuXi-ENS outperforms ensemble forecasts from the ECMWF, a world leading NWP model, in the CRPS of 98.1% of 360 variable and forecast lead time combinations. This achievement underscores the potential of the FuXi-ENS model to enhance ensemble weather forecasts, offering a promising direction for further development in this field.</description>

      <title>TrajCogn: Leveraging LLMs for Cognizing Movement Patterns and Travel Purposes from Trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12459v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spatio-temporal trajectories are crucial in various data mining tasks. It is important to develop a versatile trajectory learning method that performs different tasks with high accuracy. This involves effectively extracting two core aspects of information--movement patterns and travel purposes--from trajectories. However, this is challenging due to limitations in model capacity and the quality and scale of trajectory datasets. Meanwhile, large language models (LLMs) have shown great success in versatility by training on large-scale, high-quality datasets. Given the similarities between trajectories and sentences, there's potential to leverage LLMs to develop an effective trajectory learning method. However, standard LLMs are not designed to handle the unique spatio-temporal features of trajectories and cannot extract movement patterns and travel purposes.
  To address these challenges, we propose a model called TrajCogn that effectively utilizes LLMs to model trajectories. TrajCogn leverages the strengths of LLMs to create a versatile trajectory learning approach while addressing the limitations of standard LLMs. First, TrajCogn incorporates a novel trajectory semantic embedder that enables LLMs to process spatio-temporal features and extract movement patterns and travel purposes. Second, TrajCogn introduces a new trajectory prompt that integrates these patterns and purposes into LLMs, allowing the model to adapt to various tasks. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets and two representative tasks demonstrate that TrajCogn successfully achieves its design goals. Codes are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/TrajCogn-5021.</description>

      <title>Tensor Frames -- How To Make Any Message Passing Network Equivariant</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15389v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In many applications of geometric deep learning, the choice of global coordinate frame is arbitrary, and predictions should be independent of the reference frame. In other words, the network should be equivariant with respect to rotations and reflections of the input, i.e., the transformations of O(d). We present a novel framework for building equivariant message passing architectures and modifying existing non-equivariant architectures to be equivariant. Our approach is based on local coordinate frames, between which geometric information is communicated consistently by including tensorial objects in the messages. Our framework can be applied to message passing on geometric data in arbitrary dimensional Euclidean space. While many other approaches for equivariant message passing require specialized building blocks, such as non-standard normalization layers or non-linearities, our approach can be adapted straightforwardly to any existing architecture without such modifications. We explicitly demonstrate the benefit of O(3)-equivariance for a popular point cloud architecture and produce state-of-the-art results on normal vector regression on point clouds.</description>

Abstract: The recent surge in foundation models for natural language processing and computer vision has fueled innovation across various domains. Inspired by this progress, we explore the potential of foundation models for time-series forecasting in smart agriculture, a field often plagued by limited data availability. Specifically, this work presents a novel application of $\texttt{TimeGPT}$, a state-of-the-art (SOTA) time-series foundation model, to predict soil water potential ($\psi_\mathrm{soil}$), a key indicator of field water status that is typically used for irrigation advice. Traditionally, this task relies on a wide array of input variables. We explore $\psi_\mathrm{soil}$'s ability to forecast $\psi_\mathrm{soil}$ in: ($i$) a zero-shot setting, ($ii$) a fine-tuned setting relying solely on historic $\psi_\mathrm{soil}$ measurements, and ($iii$) a fine-tuned setting where we also add exogenous variables to the model. We compare $\texttt{TimeGPT}$'s performance to established SOTA baseline models for forecasting $\psi_\mathrm{soil}$. Our results demonstrate that $\texttt{TimeGPT}$ achieves competitive forecasting accuracy using only historical $\psi_\mathrm{soil}$ data, highlighting its remarkable potential for agricultural applications. This research paves the way for foundation time-series models for sustainable development in agriculture by enabling forecasting tasks that were traditionally reliant on extensive data collection and domain expertise.</description>

      <title>Opening the Black Box: predicting the trainability of deep neural networks with reconstruction entropy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12916v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An important challenge in machine learning is to predict the initial conditions under which a given neural network will be trainable. We present a method for predicting the trainable regime in parameter space for deep feedforward neural networks, based on reconstructing the input from subsequent activation layers via a cascade of single-layer auxiliary networks. For both the MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets, we show that a single epoch of training of the shallow cascade networks is sufficient to predict the trainability of the deep feedforward network, thereby providing a significant reduction in overall training time. We achieve this by computing the relative entropy between reconstructed images and the original inputs, and show that this probe of information loss is sensitive to the phase behaviour of the network. Moreover, our approach illustrates the network's decision making process by displaying the changes performed on the input data at each layer. Our results provide a concrete link between the flow of information and the trainability of deep neural networks, further explaining the role of criticality in these systems.</description>

      <title>Rethinking LLM-based Preference Evaluation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01085v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The use of large language model (LLM)-based preference evaluations has become widespread for comparing model responses, but it has revealed a notable bias towards longer responses, questioning the reliability of such evaluations. This paper explores the length bias in LLM evaluations from a data-centric perspective, analyzing 14 commonly used preference datasets and 10 reward models. Our findings indicate that human preference labeling favors longer responses and this spurious correlation is learned by the reward model and subsequently propagated to the aligned model during training. We decompose the preference evaluation metric, i.e., win rate, from the perspective of human to identify the deeper factors and conclude that the win rate is affected by two axes of model response: desirability and information mass, where the former is length-independent and related to trustworthiness, and the latter is length-dependent and can be represented by conditional entropy. Controlled experiments demonstrate that response length impacts evaluations by influencing information mass. To ensure reliable evaluation metrics that assess content quality without being confounded by response length, we propose AdapAlpaca, a simple yet effective adjustment to win rate measurement. Specifically, by adjusting the lengths of reference answers to match the test model's answers within the same interval, we debias information mass relative to length, ensuring a fair model evaluation. Furthermore, we investigate length bias in DPO using AlpacaEval and AdapAlpaca. By testing Tulu2 and Tulu2-dpo at 7B, 13B, and 70B scales, we found that DPO leads to higher human preference, but this gain is amplified by response length, with AlpacaEval showing higher win rates gain than AdapAlpaca.</description>

Abstract: Controlled fusion energy is deemed pivotal for the advancement of human civilization. In this study, we introduce $\textbf{Fusion-LLM}$, a novel integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with classical reservoir computing paradigms tailored to address challenges in Inertial Confinement Fusion ($\texttt{ICF}$). Our approach offers several key contributions: Firstly, we propose the $\textit{LLM-anchored Reservoir}$, augmented with a fusion-specific prompt, enabling accurate forecasting of hot electron dynamics during implosion. Secondly, we develop $\textit{Signal-Digesting Channels}$ to temporally and spatially describe the laser intensity across time, capturing the unique characteristics of $\texttt{ICF}$ inputs. Lastly, we design the $\textit{Confidence Scanner}$ to quantify the confidence level in forecasting, providing valuable insights for domain experts to design the $\texttt{ICF}$ process. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our method, achieving 1.90 CAE, 0.14 $\texttt{top-1}$ MAE, and 0.11 $\texttt{top-5}$ MAE in predicting Hard X-ray ($\texttt{HXR}$) energies of $\texttt{ICF}$ tasks, which presents state-of-the-art comparisons against concurrent best systems. Additionally, we present $\textbf{Fusion4AI}$, the first $\texttt{ICF}$ benchmark based on physical experiments, aimed at fostering novel ideas in plasma physics research and enhancing the utility of LLMs in scientific exploration. Overall, our work strives to forge an innovative synergy between AI and plasma science for advancing fusion energy.</description>

      <title>DisenSemi: Semi-supervised Graph Classification via Disentangled Representation Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14081v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph classification is a critical task in numerous multimedia applications, where graphs are employed to represent diverse types of multimedia data, including images, videos, and social networks. Nevertheless, in real-world scenarios, labeled graph data can be limited or scarce. To address this issue, we focus on the problem of semi-supervised graph classification, which involves both supervised and unsupervised models learning from labeled and unlabeled data. In contrast to recent approaches that transfer the entire knowledge from the unsupervised model to the supervised one, we argue that an effective transfer should only retain the relevant semantics that align well with the supervised task. In this paper, we propose a novel framework named DisenSemi, which learns disentangled representation for semi-supervised graph classification. Specifically, a disentangled graph encoder is proposed to generate factor-wise graph representations for both supervised and unsupervised models. Then we train two models via supervised objective and mutual information (MI)-based constraints respectively. To ensure the meaningful transfer of knowledge from the unsupervised encoder to the supervised one, we further define an MI-based disentangled consistency regularization between two models and identify the corresponding rationale that aligns well with the current graph classification task. Experimental results on a range of publicly accessible datasets reveal the effectiveness of our DisenSemi.</description>

      <title>Parallel Split Learning with Global Sampling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15738v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The expansion of IoT devices and the demands of deep learning have highlighted significant challenges in distributed deep learning systems. Parallel split learning has emerged as a promising derivative of split learning well suited for distributed learning on resource-constrained devices. However, parallel split learning faces several challenges, such as large effective batch sizes, non-independent and identically distributed data, and the straggler effect. We view these issues as a sampling dilemma and propose to address them by orchestrating a mini-batch sampling process on the server side. We introduce a new method called uniform global sampling to decouple the effective batch size from the number of clients and reduce the mini-batch deviation. To address the straggler effect, we introduce a novel method called Latent Dirichlet Sampling, which generalizes uniform global sampling to balance the trade-off between batch deviation and training time. Our simulations reveal that our proposed methods enhance model accuracy by up to 34.1% in non-independent and identically distributed settings and reduce the training time in the presence of stragglers by up to 62%. In particular, Latent Dirichlet Sampling effectively mitigates the straggler effect without compromising model accuracy or adding significant computational overhead compared to uniform global sampling. Our results demonstrate the potential of our methods to mitigate common challenges in parallel split learning.</description>

      <title>Ensemble data assimilation to diagnose AI-based weather prediction model: A case with ClimaX</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17781v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI)-based weather prediction research is growing rapidly and has shown to be competitive with the advanced dynamic numerical weather prediction models. However, research combining AI-based weather prediction models with data assimilation remains limited partially because long-term sequential data assimilation cycles are required to evaluate data assimilation systems. This study proposes using ensemble data assimilation for diagnosing AI-based weather prediction models, and marked the first successful implementation of ensemble Kalman filter with AI-based weather prediction models. Our experiments with an AI-based model ClimaX demonstrated that the ensemble data assimilation cycled stably for the AI-based weather prediction model using covariance inflation and localization techniques within the ensemble Kalman filter. While ClimaX showed some limitations in capturing flow-dependent error covariance compared to dynamical models, the AI-based ensemble forecasts provided reasonable and beneficial error covariance in sparsely observed regions. In addition, ensemble data assimilation revealed that error growth based on ensemble ClimaX predictions was weaker than that of dynamical NWP models, leading to higher inflation factors. A series of experiments demonstrated that ensemble data assimilation can be used to diagnose properties of AI weather prediction models such as physical consistency and accurate error growth representation.</description>

      <title>Advancing Neural Network Performance through Emergence-Promoting Initialization Scheme</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19044v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a novel yet straightforward neural network initialization scheme that modifies conventional methods like Xavier and Kaiming initialization. Inspired by the concept of emergence and leveraging the emergence measures proposed by Li (2023), our method adjusts the layer-wise weight scaling factors to achieve higher emergence values. This enhancement is easy to implement, requiring no additional optimization steps for initialization compared to GradInit. We evaluate our approach across various architectures, including MLP and convolutional architectures for image recognition, and transformers for machine translation. We demonstrate substantial improvements in both model accuracy and training speed, with and without batch normalization. The simplicity, theoretical innovation, and demonstrable empirical advantages of our method make it a potent enhancement to neural network initialization practices. These results suggest a promising direction for leveraging emergence to improve neural network training methodologies.

      <title>Tamper-Resistant Safeguards for Open-Weight LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00761v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rapid advances in the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have raised widespread concerns regarding their potential for malicious use. Open-weight LLMs present unique challenges, as existing safeguards lack robustness to tampering attacks that modify model weights. For example, recent works have demonstrated that refusal and unlearning safeguards can be trivially removed with a few steps of fine-tuning. These vulnerabilities necessitate new approaches for enabling the safe release of open-weight LLMs. We develop a method, called TAR, for building tamper-resistant safeguards into open-weight LLMs such that adversaries cannot remove the safeguards even after thousands of steps of fine-tuning. In extensive evaluations and red teaming analyses, we find that our method greatly improves tamper-resistance while preserving benign capabilities. Our results demonstrate that tamper-resistance is a tractable problem, opening up a promising new avenue to improve the safety and security of open-weight LLMs.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Smoothing ADMM for Quantile Regression with Non-Convex Sparse Penalties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01307v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the rapidly evolving internet-of-things (IoT) ecosystem, effective data analysis techniques are crucial for handling distributed data generated by sensors. Addressing the limitations of existing methods, such as the sub-gradient approach, which fails to distinguish between active and non-active coefficients effectively, this paper introduces the decentralized smoothing alternating direction method of multipliers (DSAD) for penalized quantile regression. Our method leverages non-convex sparse penalties like the minimax concave penalty (MCP) and smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD), improving the identification and retention of significant predictors. DSAD incorporates a total variation norm within a smoothing ADMM framework, achieving consensus among distributed nodes and ensuring uniform model performance across disparate data sources. This approach overcomes traditional convergence challenges associated with non-convex penalties in decentralized settings. We present theoretical proofs and extensive simulation results to validate the effectiveness of the DSAD, demonstrating its superiority in achieving reliable convergence and enhancing estimation accuracy compared with prior methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02866v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present Wideband back-projection diffusion, an end-to-end probabilistic framework for approximating the posterior distribution induced by the inverse scattering map from wideband scattering data. This framework leverages conditional diffusion models coupled with the underlying physics of wave-propagation and symmetries in the problem, to produce highly accurate reconstructions. The framework introduces a factorization of the score function into a physics-based latent representation inspired by the filtered back-propagation formula and a conditional score function conditioned on this latent representation. These two steps are also constrained to obey symmetries in the formulation while being amenable to compression by imposing the rank structure found in the filtered back-projection formula. As a result, empirically, our framework is able to provide sharp reconstructions effortlessly, even recovering sub-Nyquist features in the multiple-scattering regime. It has low-sample and computational complexity, its number of parameters scales sub-linearly with the target resolution, and it has stable training dynamics.</description>

      <title>Online Model-based Anomaly Detection in Multivariate Time Series: Taxonomy, Survey, Research Challenges and Future Directions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03747v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time-series anomaly detection plays an important role in engineering processes, like development, manufacturing and other operations involving dynamic systems. These processes can greatly benefit from advances in the field, as state-of-the-art approaches may aid in cases involving, for example, highly dimensional data. To provide the reader with understanding of the terminology, this survey introduces a novel taxonomy where a distinction between online and offline, and training and inference is made. Additionally, it presents the most popular data sets and evaluation metrics used in the literature, as well as a detailed analysis. Furthermore, this survey provides an extensive overview of the state-of-the-art model-based online semi- and unsupervised anomaly detection approaches for multivariate time-series data, categorising them into different model families and other properties. The biggest research challenge revolves around benchmarking, as currently there is no reliable way to compare different approaches against one another. This problem is two-fold: on the one hand, public data sets suffers from at least one fundamental flaw, while on the other hand, there is a lack of intuitive and representative evaluation metrics in the field. Moreover, the way most publications choose a detection threshold disregards real-world conditions, which hinders the application in the real world. To allow for tangible advances in the field, these issues must be addressed in future work.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04093v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Self-attention is the core mathematical operation of modern transformer architectures and is also a significant computational bottleneck due to its quadratic complexity in the sequence length. In this work, we derive the scalar energy function whose gradient computes the self-attention block, thus elucidating the theoretical underpinnings of self-attention, providing a Bayesian interpretation of the operation and linking it closely with energy-based models such as Hopfield Networks. Our formulation reveals that the reduction across the sequence axis can be efficiently computed in parallel through a tree reduction. Our algorithm, for parallelizing attention computation across multiple GPUs enables cross-device decoding to be performed asymptotically faster (up to 8x faster in our experiments) than alternative approaches such as Ring Attention, while also requiring significantly less communication volume and incurring 2x less peak memory. Our code is publicly available here: \url{https://github.com/Zyphra/tree_attention}.</description>

Abstract: Anomaly detection in time series data is a critical challenge across various domains. Traditional methods typically focus on identifying anomalies in immediate subsequent steps, often underestimating the significance of temporal dynamics such as delay time and horizons of anomalies, which generally require extensive post-analysis. This paper introduces a novel approach for detecting time series anomalies called Anomaly Prediction, incorporating temporal information directly into the prediction results. We propose a new dataset specifically designed to evaluate this approach and conduct comprehensive experiments using several state-of-the-art time series forecasting methods. The results demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in providing timely and accurate anomaly predictions, setting a new benchmark for future research in this field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2202.12270v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Feature attribution maps are a popular approach to highlight the most important pixels in an image for a given prediction of a model. Despite a recent growth in popularity and available methods, little attention is given to the objective evaluation of such attribution maps. Building on previous work in this domain, we investigate existing metrics and propose new variants of metrics for the evaluation of attribution maps. We confirm a recent finding that different attribution metrics seem to measure different underlying concepts of attribution maps, and extend this finding to a larger selection of attribution metrics. We also find that metric results on one dataset do not necessarily generalize to other datasets, and methods with desirable theoretical properties such as DeepSHAP do not necessarily outperform computationally cheaper alternatives. Based on these findings, we propose a general benchmarking approach to identify the ideal feature attribution method for a given use case. Implementations of attribution metrics and our experiments are available online.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.13220v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Probabilistic denoising diffusion models (DDMs) have set a new standard for 2D image generation. Extending DDMs for 3D content creation is an active field of research. Here, we propose TetraDiffusion, a diffusion model that operates on a tetrahedral partitioning of 3D space to enable efficient, high-resolution 3D shape generation. Our model introduces operators for convolution and transpose convolution that act directly on the tetrahedral partition, and seamlessly includes additional attributes such as color. Remarkably, TetraDiffusion enables rapid sampling of detailed 3D objects in nearly real-time with unprecedented resolution. It's also adaptable for generating 3D shapes conditioned on 2D images. Compared to existing 3D mesh diffusion techniques, our method is up to 200 times faster in inference speed, works on standard consumer hardware, and delivers superior results.</description>

      <title>Learning from Similar Linear Representations: Adaptivity, Minimaxity, and Robustness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.17765v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Representation multi-task learning (MTL) has achieved tremendous success in practice. However, the theoretical understanding of these methods is still lacking. Most existing theoretical works focus on cases where all tasks share the same representation, and claim that MTL almost always improves performance. Nevertheless, as the number of tasks grows, assuming all tasks share the same representation is unrealistic. Furthermore, empirical findings often indicate that a shared representation does not necessarily improve single-task learning performance. In this paper, we aim to understand how to learn from tasks with \textit{similar but not exactly the same} linear representations, while dealing with outlier tasks. Assuming a known intrinsic dimension, we proposed a penalized empirical risk minimization method and a spectral method that are \textit{adaptive} to the similarity structure and \textit{robust} to outlier tasks. Both algorithms outperform single-task learning when representations across tasks are sufficiently similar and the proportion of outlier tasks is small. Moreover, they always perform at least as well as single-task learning, even when the representations are dissimilar. We provided information-theoretic lower bounds to demonstrate that both methods are nearly \textit{minimax} optimal in a large regime, with the spectral method being optimal in the absence of outlier tasks. Additionally, we introduce a thresholding algorithm to adapt to an unknown intrinsic dimension. We conducted extensive numerical experiments to validate our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>The Adaptive $\tau$-Lasso: Robustness and Oracle Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.09310v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new regularized version of the robust $\tau$-regression estimator for analyzing high-dimensional datasets subject to gross contamination in the response variables and covariates (explanatory variables). The resulting estimator, termed adaptive $\tau$-Lasso, is robust to outliers and high-leverage points. It also incorporates an adaptive $\ell_1$-norm penalty term, which enables the selection of relevant variables and reduces the bias associated with large true regression coefficients. More specifically, this adaptive $\ell_1$-norm penalty term assigns a weight to each regression coefficient. For a fixed number of predictors $p$, we show that the adaptive $\tau$-Lasso has the oracle property, ensuring both variable-selection consistency and asymptotic normality. Asymptotic normality applies only to the entries of the regression vector corresponding to the true support, assuming knowledge of the true regression vector support. We characterize its robustness by establishing the finite-sample breakdown point and the influence function. We carry out extensive simulations and observe that the class of $\tau$-Lasso estimators exhibits robustness and reliable performance in both contaminated and uncontaminated data settings. We also validate our theoretical findings on robustness properties through simulations. In the face of outliers and high-leverage points, the adaptive $\tau$-Lasso and $\tau$-Lasso estimators achieve the best performance or close-to-best performance in terms of prediction and variable selection accuracy compared to other competing regularized estimators for all scenarios considered in this study. Therefore, the adaptive $\tau$-Lasso and $\tau$-Lasso estimators provide attractive tools for a variety of sparse linear regression problems, particularly in high-dimensional settings and when the data is contaminated by outliers and high-leverage points.</description>

      <title>CREMP: Conformer-rotamer ensembles of macrocyclic peptides for machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.08057v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Computational and machine learning approaches to model the conformational landscape of macrocyclic peptides have the potential to enable rational design and optimization. However, accurate, fast, and scalable methods for modeling macrocycle geometries remain elusive. Recent deep learning approaches have significantly accelerated protein structure prediction and the generation of small-molecule conformational ensembles, yet similar progress has not been made for macrocyclic peptides due to their unique properties. Here, we introduce CREMP, a resource generated for the rapid development and evaluation of machine learning models for macrocyclic peptides. CREMP contains 36,198 unique macrocyclic peptides and their high-quality structural ensembles generated using the Conformer-Rotamer Ensemble Sampling Tool (CREST). Altogether, this new dataset contains nearly 31.3 million unique macrocycle geometries, each annotated with energies derived from semi-empirical extended tight-binding (xTB) DFT calculations. Additionally, we include 3,258 macrocycles with reported passive permeability data to couple conformational ensembles to experiment. We anticipate that this dataset will enable the development of machine learning models that can improve peptide design and optimization for novel therapeutics.</description>

      <title>A model for efficient dynamical ranking in networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.13544v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a physics-inspired method for inferring dynamic rankings in directed temporal networks - networks in which each directed and timestamped edge reflects the outcome and timing of a pairwise interaction. The inferred ranking of each node is real-valued and varies in time as each new edge, encoding an outcome like a win or loss, raises or lowers the node's estimated strength or prestige, as is often observed in real scenarios including sequences of games, tournaments, or interactions in animal hierarchies. Our method works by solving a linear system of equations and requires only one parameter to be tuned. As a result, the corresponding algorithm is scalable and efficient. We test our method by evaluating its ability to predict interactions (edges' existence) and their outcomes (edges' directions) in a variety of applications, including both synthetic and real data. Our analysis shows that in many cases our method's performance is better than existing methods for predicting dynamic rankings and interaction outcomes.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Crowd-Aware Multi-Agent Path Finding through Local Communication with Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.10275v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) in crowded environments presents a challenging problem in motion planning, aiming to find collision-free paths for all agents in the system. MAPF finds a wide range of applications in various domains, including aerial swarms, autonomous warehouse robotics, and self-driving vehicles. Current approaches to MAPF generally fall into two main categories: centralized and decentralized planning. Centralized planning suffers from the curse of dimensionality when the number of agents or states increases and thus does not scale well in large and complex environments. On the other hand, decentralized planning enables agents to engage in real-time path planning within a partially observable environment, demonstrating implicit coordination. However, they suffer from slow convergence and performance degradation in dense environments. In this paper, we introduce CRAMP, a novel crowd-aware decentralized reinforcement learning approach to address this problem by enabling efficient local communication among agents via Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), facilitating situational awareness and decision-making capabilities in congested environments. We test CRAMP on simulated environments and demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art decentralized methods for MAPF on various metrics. CRAMP improves the solution quality up to 59% measured in makespan and collision count, and up to 35% improvement in success rate in comparison to previous methods.</description>

      <title>Graph Matching via convex relaxation to the simplex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.20609v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the Graph Matching problem, which consists of finding the best possible alignment between two input graphs, and has many applications in computer vision, network deanonymization and protein alignment. A common approach to tackle this problem is through convex relaxations of the NP-hard \emph{Quadratic Assignment Problem} (QAP).
  Here, we introduce a new convex relaxation onto the unit simplex and develop an efficient mirror descent scheme with closed-form iterations for solving this problem. Under the correlated Gaussian Wigner model, we show that the simplex relaxation admits a unique solution with high probability. In the noiseless case, this is shown to imply exact recovery of the ground truth permutation. Additionally, we establish a novel sufficiency condition for the input matrix in standard greedy rounding methods, which is less restrictive than the commonly used `diagonal dominance' condition. We use this condition to show exact one-step recovery of the ground truth (holding almost surely) via the mirror descent scheme, in the noiseless setting. We also use this condition to obtain significantly improved conditions for the GRAMPA algorithm [Fan et al. 2019] in the noiseless setting.</description>

      <title>Mapping "Brain Terrain" Regions on Mars using Deep Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12292v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the main objectives of the Mars Exploration Program is to search for evidence of past or current life on the planet. To achieve this, Mars exploration has been focusing on regions that may have liquid or frozen water. A set of critical areas may have seen cycles of ice thawing in the relatively recent past in response to periodic changes in the obliquity of Mars. In this work, we use convolutional neural networks to detect surface regions containing "Brain Coral" terrain, a landform on Mars whose similarity in morphology and scale to sorted stone circles on Earth suggests that it may have formed as a consequence of freeze/thaw cycles. We use large images (~100-1000 megapixels) from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter to search for these landforms at resolutions close to a few tens of centimeters per pixel (~25--50 cm). Over 52,000 images (~28 TB) were searched (~5% of the Martian surface) where we found detections in over 200 images. To expedite the processing we leverage a classifier network (prior to segmentation) in the Fourier domain that can take advantage of JPEG compression by leveraging blocks of coefficients from a discrete cosine transform in lieu of decoding the entire image at the full spatial resolution. The hybrid pipeline approach maintains ~93% accuracy while cutting down on ~95% of the total processing time compared to running the segmentation network at the full resolution on every image. The timely processing of big data sets helps inform mission operations, geologic surveys to prioritize candidate landing sites, avoid hazardous areas, or map the spatial extent of certain terrain. The segmentation masks and source code are available on Github for the community to explore and build upon.</description>

      <title>A Context-Contrastive Inference Approach To Partial Diacritization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08919v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diacritization plays a pivotal role in improving readability and disambiguating the meaning of Arabic texts. Efforts have so far focused on marking every eligible character (Full Diacritization). Comparatively overlooked, Partial Diacritzation (PD) is the selection of a subset of characters to be marked to aid comprehension where needed. Research has indicated that excessive diacritic marks can hinder skilled readers -- reducing reading speed and accuracy. We conduct a behavioral experiment and show that partially marked text is often easier to read than fully marked text, and sometimes easier than plain text. In this light, we introduce Context-Contrastive Partial Diacritization (CCPD) -- a novel approach to PD which integrates seamlessly with existing Arabic diacritization systems. CCPD processes each word twice, once with context and once without, and diacritizes only the characters with disparities between the two inferences. Further, we introduce novel indicators for measuring partial diacritization quality, essential for establishing this as a machine learning task. Lastly, we introduce TD2, a Transformer-variant of an established model which offers a markedly different performance profile on our proposed indicators compared to all other known systems.</description>

      <title>Physics-constrained convolutional neural networks for inverse problems in spatiotemporal partial differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10306v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a physics-constrained convolutional neural network (PC-CNN) to solve two types of inverse problems in partial differential equations (PDEs), which are nonlinear and vary both in space and time. In the first inverse problem, we are given data that is offset by spatially varying systematic error (i.e., the bias, also known as the epistemic uncertainty). The task is to uncover the true state, which is the solution of the PDE, from the biased data. In the second inverse problem, we are given sparse information on the solution of a PDE. The task is to reconstruct the solution in space with high-resolution. First, we present the PC-CNN, which constrains the PDE with a time-windowing scheme to handle sequential data. Second, we analyse the performance of the PC-CNN for uncovering solutions from biased data. We analyse both linear and nonlinear convection-diffusion equations, and the Navier-Stokes equations, which govern the spatiotemporally chaotic dynamics of turbulent flows. We find that the PC-CNN correctly recovers the true solution for a variety of biases, which are parameterised as non-convex functions. Third, we analyse the performance of the PC-CNN for reconstructing solutions from sparse information for the turbulent flow. We reconstruct the spatiotemporal chaotic solution on a high-resolution grid from only &lt; 1\% of the information contained in it. For both tasks, we further analyse the Navier-Stokes solutions. We find that the inferred solutions have a physical spectral energy content, whereas traditional methods, such as interpolation, do not. This work opens opportunities for solving inverse problems with partial differential equations.</description>

      <title>The Distributional Uncertainty of the SHAP score in Explainable Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12731v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Attribution scores reflect how important the feature values in an input entity are for the output of a machine learning model. One of the most popular attribution scores is the SHAP score, which is an instantiation of the general Shapley value used in coalition game theory. The definition of this score relies on a probability distribution on the entity population. Since the exact distribution is generally unknown, it needs to be assigned subjectively or be estimated from data, which may lead to misleading feature scores. In this paper, we propose a principled framework for reasoning on SHAP scores under unknown entity population distributions. In our framework, we consider an uncertainty region that contains the potential distributions, and the SHAP score of a feature becomes a function defined over this region. We study the basic problems of finding maxima and minima of this function, which allows us to determine tight ranges for the SHAP scores of all features. In particular, we pinpoint the complexity of these problems, and other related ones, showing them to be NP-complete. Finally, we present experiments on a real-world dataset, showing that our framework may contribute to a more robust feature scoring.</description>

      <title>Fast Peer Adaptation with Context-aware Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02468v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fast adapting to unknown peers (partners or opponents) with different strategies is a key challenge in multi-agent games. To do so, it is crucial for the agent to probe and identify the peer's strategy efficiently, as this is the prerequisite for carrying out the best response in adaptation. However, exploring the strategies of unknown peers is difficult, especially when the games are partially observable and have a long horizon. In this paper, we propose a peer identification reward, which rewards the learning agent based on how well it can identify the behavior pattern of the peer over the historical context, such as the observation over multiple episodes. This reward motivates the agent to learn a context-aware policy for effective exploration and fast adaptation, i.e., to actively seek and collect informative feedback from peers when uncertain about their policies and to exploit the context to perform the best response when confident. We evaluate our method on diverse testbeds that involve competitive (Kuhn Poker), cooperative (PO-Overcooked), or mixed (Predator-Prey-W) games with peer agents. We demonstrate that our method induces more active exploration behavior, achieving faster adaptation and better outcomes than existing methods.</description>

      <title>Reduced-order modeling of unsteady fluid flow using neural network ensembles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05372v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The use of deep learning has become increasingly popular in reduced-order models (ROMs) to obtain low-dimensional representations of full-order models. Convolutional autoencoders (CAEs) are often used to this end as they are adept at handling data that are spatially distributed, including solutions to partial differential equations. When applied to unsteady physics problems, ROMs also require a model for time-series prediction of the low-dimensional latent variables. Long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, a type of recurrent neural network useful for modeling sequential data, are frequently employed in data-driven ROMs for autoregressive time-series prediction. When making predictions at unseen design points over long time horizons, error propagation is a frequently encountered issue, where errors made early on can compound over time and lead to large inaccuracies. In this work, we propose using bagging, a commonly used ensemble learning technique, to develop a fully data-driven ROM framework referred to as the CAE-eLSTM ROM that uses CAEs for spatial reconstruction of the full-order model and LSTM ensembles for time-series prediction. When applied to two unsteady fluid dynamics problems, our results show that the presented framework effectively reduces error propagation and leads to more accurate time-series prediction of latent variables at unseen points.</description>

      <title>Controllable seismic velocity synthesis using generative diffusion models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06277v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate seismic velocity estimations are vital to understanding Earth's subsurface structures, assessing natural resources, and evaluating seismic hazards. Machine learning-based inversion algorithms have shown promising performance in regional (i.e., for exploration) and global velocity estimation, while their effectiveness hinges on access to large and diverse training datasets whose distributions generally cover the target solutions. Additionally, enhancing the precision and reliability of velocity estimation also requires incorporating prior information, e.g., geological classes, well logs, and subsurface structures, but current statistical or neural network-based methods are not flexible enough to handle such multi-modal information. To address both challenges, we propose to use conditional generative diffusion models for seismic velocity synthesis, in which we readily incorporate those priors. This approach enables the generation of seismic velocities that closely match the expected target distribution, offering datasets informed by both expert knowledge and measured data to support training for data-driven geophysical methods. We demonstrate the flexibility and effectiveness of our method through training diffusion models on the OpenFWI dataset under various conditions, including class labels, well logs, reflectivity images, and the combination of these priors. The performance of the approach under out-of-distribution conditions further underscores its generalization ability, showcasing its potential to provide tailored priors for velocity inverse problems and create specific training datasets for machine learning-based geophysical applications.</description>

      <title>What Evidence Do Language Models Find Convincing?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11782v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-augmented language models are being increasingly tasked with subjective, contentious, and conflicting queries such as "is aspartame linked to cancer". To resolve these ambiguous queries, one must search through a large range of websites and consider "which, if any, of this evidence do I find convincing?". In this work, we study how LLMs answer this question. In particular, we construct ConflictingQA, a dataset that pairs controversial queries with a series of real-world evidence documents that contain different facts (e.g., quantitative results), argument styles (e.g., appeals to authority), and answers (Yes or No). We use this dataset to perform sensitivity and counterfactual analyses to explore which text features most affect LLM predictions. Overall, we find that current models rely heavily on the relevance of a website to the query, while largely ignoring stylistic features that humans find important such as whether a text contains scientific references or is written with a neutral tone. Taken together, these results highlight the importance of RAG corpus quality (e.g., the need to filter misinformation), and possibly even a shift in how LLMs are trained to better align with human judgements.</description>

Abstract: In various real-world scenarios, such as recommender systems and political surveys, pairwise rankings are commonly collected and utilized for rank aggregation to obtain an overall ranking of items. However, preference rankings can reveal individuals' personal preferences, underscoring the need to protect them from being released for downstream analysis. In this paper, we address the challenge of preserving privacy while ensuring the utility of rank aggregation based on pairwise rankings generated from a general comparison model. Using the randomized response mechanism to perturb raw pairwise rankings is a common privacy protection strategy used in practice. However, a critical challenge arises because the privatized rankings no longer adhere to the original model, resulting in significant bias in downstream rank aggregation tasks. Motivated by this, we propose to adaptively debiasing the rankings from the randomized response mechanism, ensuring consistent estimation of true preferences and enhancing the utility of downstream rank aggregation. Theoretically, we offer insights into the relationship between overall privacy guarantees and estimation errors from private ranking data, and establish minimax rates for estimation errors. This enables the determination of optimal privacy guarantees that balance consistency in rank aggregation with privacy protection. We also investigate convergence rates of expected ranking errors for partial and full ranking recovery, quantifying how privacy protection influences the specification of top-$K$ item sets and complete rankings. Our findings are validated through extensive simulations and a real application.</description>

      <title>Ab-initio variational wave functions for the time-dependent many-electron Schr\"odinger equation</title>

Abstract: Describing the real-time evolution of many-electron quantum systems is crucial for understanding the dynamical properties of condensed matter, molecular systems in quantum chemistry, and the behaviors of complex materials. However, the real-time evolution of non-equilibrium quantum electronic systems poses a significant challenge for theoretical and computational approaches. This work introduces a variational approach for fermionic time-dependent wave functions, surpassing mean-field approximations by capturing many-body correlations. Our methodology introduces a parameterization of the time-evolving quantum state, enabling an accurate approximation of its evolution. To account for electron correlations, we employ time-dependent Jastrow factors and backflow transformations, which can be further enhanced by incorporating neural networks for function parameterization. We utilize the time-dependent variational Monte Carlo technique to efficiently compute optimal time-dependent parameters. Additionally, we introduce a new time-evolution method based on Trotter-root expansions of the propagator, enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of our simulations. The approach is demonstrated in three distinct systems: the solvable harmonic interaction model, the dynamics of a diatomic molecule in intense laser fields, and a quenched quantum dot. In all cases, we show clear signatures of many-body correlations in the dynamics that are not captured by mean-field methods. The results showcase the ability of our variational approach to accurately capture the time evolution of quantum states, providing insight into the quantum dynamics of interacting electronic systems, beyond the capabilities of mean-field.</description>

      <title>Text Clustering with LLM Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15112v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Text clustering is an important method for organising the increasing volume of digital content, aiding in the structuring and discovery of hidden patterns in uncategorised data. The effectiveness of text clustering largely depends on the selection of textual embeddings and clustering algorithms. This study argues that recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have the potential to enhance this task. The research investigates how different textual embeddings, particularly those utilised in LLMs, and various clustering algorithms influence the clustering of text datasets. A series of experiments were conducted to evaluate the impact of embeddings on clustering results, the role of dimensionality reduction through summarisation, and the adjustment of model size. The findings indicate that LLM embeddings are superior at capturing subtleties in structured language. OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo model yields better results in three out of five clustering metrics across most tested datasets. Most LLM embeddings show improvements in cluster purity and provide a more informative silhouette score, reflecting a refined structural understanding of text data compared to traditional methods. Among the more lightweight models, BERT demonstrates leading performance. Additionally, it was observed that increasing model dimensionality and employing summarisation techniques do not consistently enhance clustering efficiency, suggesting that these strategies require careful consideration for practical application. These results highlight a complex balance between the need for refined text representation and computational feasibility in text clustering applications. This study extends traditional text clustering frameworks by integrating embeddings from LLMs, offering improved methodologies and suggesting new avenues for future research in various types of textual analysis.</description>

      <title>Multi-Conditional Ranking with Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00211v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Utilizing large language models (LLMs) to rank a set of items has become a common approach in recommendation and retrieval systems. Typically, these systems focus on ordering a substantial number of documents in a monotonic order based on a given query. However, real-world scenarios often present a different challenge: ranking a comparatively smaller set of items, but according to a variety of diverse and occasionally conflicting conditions. In this paper, we define and explore the task of multi-conditional ranking by introducing MCRank, a benchmark tailored for assessing multi-conditional ranking across various item types and conditions. Our analysis of LLMs using MCRank indicates a significant decrease in performance as the number and complexity of items and conditions grow. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel decomposed reasoning method, consisting of EXtracting and Sorting the conditions, and then Iteratively Ranking the items (EXSIR). Our extensive experiments show that this decomposed reasoning method enhances LLMs' performance significantly, achieving up to a 12% improvement over existing LLMs. We also provide a detailed analysis of LLMs performance across various condition categories, and examine the effectiveness of decomposition step. Furthermore, we compare our method with existing approaches such as Chain-of-Thought and existing ranking models, demonstrating the superiority of our approach and complexity of MCR task. We released our dataset and code.</description>

      <title>Efficient Radiation Treatment Planning based on Voxel Importance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03880v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Radiation treatment planning involves optimization over a large number of voxels, many of which carry limited information about the clinical problem. We propose an approach to reduce the large optimization problem by only using a representative subset of informative voxels. This way, we drastically improve planning efficiency while maintaining the plan quality. Within an initial probing step, we pre-solve an easier optimization problem involving a simplified objective from which we derive an importance score per voxel. This importance score is then turned into a sampling distribution, which allows us to subsample a small set of informative voxels using importance sampling. By solving a - now reduced - version of the original optimization problem using this subset, we effectively reduce the problem's size and computational demands while accounting for regions where satisfactory dose deliveries are challenging. In contrast to other stochastic (sub-)sampling methods, our technique only requires a single probing and sampling step to define a reduced optimization problem. This problem can be efficiently solved using established solvers without the need of modifying or adapting them. Empirical experiments on open benchmark data highlight substantially reduced optimization times, up to 50 times faster than the original ones, for intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), all while upholding plan quality comparable to traditional methods. Our novel approach has the potential to significantly accelerate radiation treatment planning by addressing its inherent computational challenges. We reduce the treatment planning time by reducing the size of the optimization problem rather than modifying and improving the optimization method. Our efforts are thus complementary to many previous developments.</description>

      <title>RuleFuser: An Evidential Bayes Approach for Rule Injection in Imitation Learned Planners for Robustness under Distribution Shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11139v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern motion planners for autonomous driving frequently use imitation learning (IL) to draw from expert driving logs. Although IL benefits from its ability to glean nuanced and multi-modal human driving behaviors from large datasets, the resulting planners often struggle with out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios and with traffic rule compliance. On the other hand, classical rule-based planners, by design, can generate safe traffic rule compliant behaviors while being robust to OOD scenarios, but these planners fail to capture nuances in agent-to-agent interactions and human drivers' intent. RuleFuser, an evidential framework, combines IL planners with classical rule-based planners to draw on the complementary benefits of both, thereby striking a balance between imitation and safety.
  Our approach, tested on the real-world nuPlan dataset, combines the IL planner's high performance in in-distribution (ID) scenarios with the rule-based planners' enhanced safety in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios, achieving a 38.43% average improvement on safety metrics over the IL planner without much detriment to imitation metrics in OOD scenarios.</description>

      <title>Beyond Item Dissimilarities: Diversifying by Intent in Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12327v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recommender systems that overly focus on short-term engagement prevents users from exploring diverse interests. To tackle this challenge, numerous diversification algorithms have been proposed. These algorithms typically rely on measures of item similarity, aiming to maximize the dissimilarity across items in the final set of recommendations. In this work, we demonstrate the benefits of going beyond item-level similarities by utilizing higher-level user understanding--specifically, user intents that persist across multiple interactions or recommendation sessions--in diversification. Our approach is motivated by the observation that user behaviors on online platforms are largely driven by their underlying intents. Therefore, final recommendations should ensure that a diverse set of intents is accurately represented. While user intent has primarily been studied in the context of search, it is less clear how to incorporate real-time dynamic intent predictions in recommender systems. To address this gap, we develop a probabilistic intent-based whole-page diversification framework for the final stage of a recommender system. Starting with a prior belief of user intents, the proposed framework sequentially selects items for each position based on these beliefs and subsequently updates posterior beliefs about the intents. This approach ensures that different user intents are represented on a page, towards optimizing long-term user experience.
  We experiment with the intent diversification framework on YouTube. Live experiments on a diverse set of intents show that our framework increases Daily Active Users and overall user enjoyment, validating its effectiveness in facilitating long-term planning. Specifically, it enables users to consistently discover and engage with diverse content that aligns with their underlying intents over time, leading to an improved long-term user experience.</description>

      <title>Differentiable Annealed Importance Sampling Minimizes The Symmetrized Kullback-Leibler Divergence Between Initial and Target Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14840v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Differentiable annealed importance sampling (DAIS), proposed by Geffner &amp; Domke (2021) and Zhang et al. (2021), allows optimizing over the initial distribution of AIS. In this paper, we show that, in the limit of many transitions, DAIS minimizes the symmetrized Kullback-Leibler divergence between the initial and target distribution. Thus, DAIS can be seen as a form of variational inference (VI) as its initial distribution is a parametric fit to an intractable target distribution. We empirically evaluate the usefulness of the initial distribution as a variational distribution on synthetic and real-world data, observing that it often provides more accurate uncertainty estimates than VI (optimizing the reverse KL divergence), importance weighted VI, and Markovian score climbing (optimizing the forward KL divergence).</description>

      <title>Radar Spectra-Language Model for Automotive Scene Parsing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02158v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Radar sensors are low cost, long-range, and weather-resilient. Therefore, they are widely used for driver assistance functions, and are expected to be crucial for the success of autonomous driving in the future. In many perception tasks only pre-processed radar point clouds are considered. In contrast, radar spectra are a raw form of radar measurements and contain more information than radar point clouds. However, radar spectra are rather difficult to interpret. In this work, we aim to explore the semantic information contained in spectra in the context of automated driving, thereby moving towards better interpretability of radar spectra. To this end, we create a radar spectra-language model, allowing us to query radar spectra measurements for the presence of scene elements using free text. We overcome the scarcity of radar spectra data by matching the embedding space of an existing vision-language model. Finally, we explore the benefit of the learned representation for scene retrieval using radar spectra only, and obtain improvements in free space segmentation and object detection merely by injecting the spectra embedding into a baseline model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06566v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Domain specific digital twins, representing a digital replica of various segments of the smart grid, are foreseen as able to model, simulate, and control the respective segments. At the same time, knowledge-based digital twins, coupled with AI, may also empower humans to understand aspects of the system through natural language interaction in view of planning and policy making. This paper is the first to assess and report on the potential of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) question answers related to household electrical energy measurement aspects leveraging a knowledge-based energy digital twin. Relying on the recently published electricity consumption knowledge graph that actually represents a knowledge-based digital twin, we study the capabilities of ChatGPT, Gemini and Llama in answering electricity related questions. Furthermore, we compare the answers with the ones generated through a RAG techniques that leverages an existing electricity knowledge-based digital twin. Our findings illustrate that the RAG approach not only reduces the incidence of incorrect information typically generated by LLMs but also significantly improves the quality of the output by grounding responses in verifiable data. This paper details our methodology, presents a comparative analysis of responses with and without RAG, and discusses the implications of our findings for future applications of AI in specialized sectors like energy data analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07398v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Self-supervised learning of image representations by predicting future frames is a promising direction but still remains a challenge. This is because of the under-determined nature of frame prediction; multiple potential futures can arise from a single current frame. To tackle this challenge, in this paper, we revisit the idea of stochastic video generation that learns to capture uncertainty in frame prediction and explore its effectiveness for representation learning. Specifically, we design a framework that trains a stochastic frame prediction model to learn temporal information between frames. Moreover, to learn dense information within each frame, we introduce an auxiliary masked image modeling objective along with a shared decoder architecture. We find this architecture allows for combining both objectives in a synergistic and compute-efficient manner. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on a variety of tasks from video label propagation and vision-based robot learning domains, such as video segmentation, pose tracking, vision-based robotic locomotion, and manipulation tasks.

      <title>MT-Ladder: A Model-Agnostic Framework Boosting LLM-based Machine Translation to the Next Level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15741v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: General-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 have achieved remarkable advancements in machine translation (MT) by leveraging extensive web content. On the other hand, translation-specific LLMs are built by pre-training on domain-specific monolingual corpora and fine-tuning with human-annotated translation data. Despite the superior performance, these methods either demand an unprecedented scale of computing and data or substantial human editing and annotation efforts. In this paper, we develop MT-Ladder, a novel model-agnostic and cost-effective tool to refine the performance of general LLMs for MT. MT-Ladder is trained on pseudo-refinement triplets which can be easily obtained from existing LLMs without additional human cost. During training, we propose a hierarchical fine-tuning strategy with an easy-to-hard schema, improving MT-Ladder's refining performance progressively. The trained MT-Ladder can be seamlessly integrated with any general-purpose LLMs to boost their translation performance. By utilizing Gemma-2B/7B as the backbone, MT-Ladder-2B can elevate raw translations to the level of top-tier open-source models (e.g., refining BigTranslate-13B with +6.91 BLEU and +3.52 COMET for XX-En), and MT-Ladder-7B can further enhance model performance to be on par with the state-of-the-art GPT-4. Extensive ablation and analysis corroborate the effectiveness of MT-Ladder in diverse settings. Our code is available at https://github.com/fzp0424/Ladder</description>

Abstract: Alzheimer Disease poses a significant challenge, necessitating early detection for effective intervention. MRI is a key neuroimaging tool due to its ease of use and cost effectiveness. This study analyzes machine learning methods for MRI based biomarker selection and classification to distinguish between healthy controls and those who develop mild cognitive impairment within five years. Using 3 Tesla MRI data from ADNI and OASIS 3, we applied various machine learning techniques, including MATLAB Classification Learner app, nested cross validation, and Bayesian optimization. Data harmonization with polynomial regression improved performance. Consistent features identified were the entorhinal, hippocampus, lateral ventricle, and lateral orbitofrontal regions. For balanced ADNI data, Naive Bayes with z score harmonization performed best. For balanced OASIS 3, SVM with z score correction excelled. In imbalanced data, RUSBoost showed strong performance on ADNI and OASIS 3. Z score harmonization highlighted the potential of a semi automatic pipeline for early AD detection using MRI.</description>

      <title>The Foundations of Tokenization: Statistical and Computational Concerns</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11606v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tokenization - the practice of converting strings of characters over an alphabet into sequences of tokens over a vocabulary - is a critical yet under-theorized step in the NLP pipeline. Notably, it remains the only major step not fully integrated into widely used end-to-end neural models. This paper aims to address this theoretical gap by laying the foundations of tokenization from a formal perspective. By articulating and extending basic properties about the category of stochastic maps, we propose a unified framework for representing and analyzing tokenizer models. This framework allows us to establish general conditions for the use of tokenizers. In particular, we formally establish the necessary and sufficient conditions for a tokenizer model to preserve the consistency of statistical estimators. Additionally, we discuss statistical and computational concerns crucial for the design and implementation of tokenizer models. The framework and results advanced in this paper represent a step toward a robust theoretical foundation for neural language modeling.</description>

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings have long been vital in diagnosing different cardiac conditions. Recently, research in the field of automatic ECG processing using machine learning methods has gained importance, mainly by utilizing deep learning methods on raw ECG signals. A major advantage of models like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is their ability to effectively process biomedical imaging or signal data. However, this strength is tempered by challenges related to their lack of explainability, the need for a large amount of training data, and the complexities involved in adapting them for unsupervised clustering tasks. In addressing these tasks, we aim to reintroduce shallow learning techniques, including support vector machines and principal components analysis, into ECG signal processing by leveraging their semi-structured, cyclic form. To this end, we developed and evaluated a transformation that effectively restructures ECG signals into a fully structured format, facilitating their subsequent analysis using shallow learning algorithms. In this study, we present this adaptive transformative approach that aligns R-peaks across all signals in a dataset and resamples the segments between R-peaks, both with and without heart rate dependencies. We illustrate the substantial benefit of this transformation for traditional analysis techniques in the areas of classification, clustering, and explainability, outperforming commercial software for median beat transformation and CNN approaches. Our approach demonstrates a significant advantage for shallow machine learning methods over CNNs, especially when dealing with limited training data. Additionally, we release a fully tested and publicly accessible code framework, providing a robust alignment pipeline to support future research, available at https://github.com/imi-ms/rlign.</description>

      <title>Cost-Effective Hallucination Detection for LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21424v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can be prone to hallucinations - generating unreliable outputs that are unfaithful to their inputs, external facts or internally inconsistent. In this work, we address several challenges for post-hoc hallucination detection in production settings. Our pipeline for hallucination detection entails: first, producing a confidence score representing the likelihood that a generated answer is a hallucination; second, calibrating the score conditional on attributes of the inputs and candidate response; finally, performing detection by thresholding the calibrated score. We benchmark a variety of state-of-the-art scoring methods on different datasets, encompassing question answering, fact checking, and summarization tasks. We employ diverse LLMs to ensure a comprehensive assessment of performance. We show that calibrating individual scoring methods is critical for ensuring risk-aware downstream decision making. Based on findings that no individual score performs best in all situations, we propose a multi-scoring framework, which combines different scores and achieves top performance across all datasets. We further introduce cost-effective multi-scoring, which can match or even outperform more expensive detection methods, while significantly reducing computational overhead.</description>
