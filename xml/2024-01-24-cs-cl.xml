<title>Location Sensitive Embedding for Knowledge Graph Embedding. (arXiv:2401.10893v1 [cs.IR])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10893</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Knowledge graph embedding transforms knowledge graphs into a continuous,
low-dimensional space, facilitating inference and completion tasks. This field
is mainly divided into translational distance models and semantic matching
models. A key challenge in translational distance models is their inability to
effectively differentiate between &apos;head&apos; and &apos;tail&apos; entities in graphs. To
address this, the novel location-sensitive embedding (LSE) method has been
developed. LSE innovatively modifies the head entity using relation-specific
mappings, conceptualizing relations as linear transformations rather than mere
translations. The theoretical foundations of LSE, including its
representational capabilities and its connections to existing models, have been
thoroughly examined. A more streamlined variant, LSEd, employs a diagonal
matrix for transformations to enhance practical efficiency. In tests conducted
on four large-scale datasets for link prediction, LSEd either outperforms or is
competitive with leading contemporary models.

<title>Towards building a monitoring platform for a challenge-oriented smart specialisation with RIS3-MCAT. (arXiv:2401.10900v1 [cs.CY])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10900</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;In the new research and innovation (R&amp;amp;I) paradigm, aimed at a transformation
towards more sustainable, inclusive and fair pathways to address societal and
environmental challenges, and at generating new patterns of specialisation and
new trajectories for socioeconomic development, it is essential to provide
monitoring systems and tools to map and understand the contribution of R&amp;amp;I
policies and projects. To address this transformation, we present the RIS3-MCAT
platform, the result of a line of work aimed at exploring the potential of open
data, semantic analysis, and data visualisation, for monitoring
challenge-oriented smart specialisation in Catalonia. RIS3-MCAT is an
interactive platform that facilitates access to R&amp;amp;I project data in formats
that allow for sophisticated analyses of a large volume of texts, enabling the
detailed study of thematic specialisations and challenges beyond classical
classification systems. Its conceptualisation, development framework and use
are presented in this paper.

<title>RELIANCE: Reliable Ensemble Learning for Information and News Credibility Evaluation. (arXiv:2401.10940v1 [cs.IR])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10940</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;In the era of information proliferation, discerning the credibility of news
content poses an ever-growing challenge. This paper introduces RELIANCE, a
pioneering ensemble learning system designed for robust information and fake
news credibility evaluation. Comprising five diverse base models, including
Support Vector Machine (SVM), naive Bayes, logistic regression, random forest,
and Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory Networks (BiLSTMs), RELIANCE employs
an innovative approach to integrate their strengths, harnessing the collective
intelligence of the ensemble for enhanced accuracy. Experiments demonstrate the
superiority of RELIANCE over individual models, indicating its efficacy in
distinguishing between credible and non-credible information sources. RELIANCE,
also surpasses baseline models in information and news credibility assessment,
establishing itself as an effective solution for evaluating the reliability of
information sources.

<title>The Radiation Oncology NLP Database. (arXiv:2401.10995v1 [cs.CL])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10995</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;We present the Radiation Oncology NLP Database (ROND), the first dedicated
Natural Language Processing (NLP) dataset for radiation oncology, an important
medical specialty that has received limited attention from the NLP community in
the past. With the advent of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), there is an
increasing need for specialized datasets and benchmarks to facilitate research
and development. ROND is specifically designed to address this gap in the
domain of radiation oncology, a field that offers many opportunities for NLP
exploration. It encompasses various NLP tasks including Logic Reasoning, Text
Classification, Named Entity Recognition (NER), Question Answering (QA), Text
Summarization, and Patient-Clinician Conversations, each with a distinct focus
on radiation oncology concepts and application cases. In addition, we have
developed an instruction-tuning dataset consisting of over 20k instruction
pairs (based on ROND) and trained a large language model, CancerChat. This
serves to demonstrate the potential of instruction-tuning large language models
within a highly-specialized medical domain. The evaluation results in this
study could serve as baseline results for future research. ROND aims to
stimulate advancements in radiation oncology and clinical NLP by offering a
platform for testing and improving algorithms and models in a domain-specific
context. The ROND dataset is a joint effort of multiple U.S. health
institutions. The data is available at
https://github.com/zl-liu/Radiation-Oncology-NLP-Database.

<title>Analysis and Detection of Multilingual Hate Speech Using Transformer Based Deep Learning. (arXiv:2401.11021v1 [cs.CL])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11021</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Hate speech is harmful content that directly attacks or promotes hatred
against members of groups or individuals based on actual or perceived aspects
of identity, such as racism, religion, or sexual orientation. This can affect
social life on social media platforms as hateful content shared through social
media can harm both individuals and communities. As the prevalence of hate
speech increases online, the demand for automated detection as an NLP task is
increasing. In this work, the proposed method is using transformer-based model
to detect hate speech in social media, like twitter, Facebook, WhatsApp,
Instagram, etc. The proposed model is independent of languages and has been
tested on Italian, English, German, Bengali. The Gold standard datasets were
collected from renowned researcher Zeerak Talat, Sara Tonelli, Melanie Siegel,
and Rezaul Karim. The success rate of the proposed model for hate speech
detection is higher than the existing baseline and state-of-the-art models with
accuracy in Bengali dataset is 89%, in English: 91%, in German dataset 91% and
in Italian dataset it is 77%. The proposed algorithm shows substantial
improvement to the benchmark method.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;This study is dedicated to evaluating the capabilities of advanced large
language models (LLMs) such as GPT-3.5-Turbo, GPT-4, and GPT-4-Turbo in the
extraction of structured information from scientific documents within the field
of materials science. We introduce a novel methodology for the comparative
analysis of intricate material expressions, emphasising the standardisation of
chemical formulas to tackle the complexities inherent in materials science
information assessment. To this end, we primarily focus on two critical tasks
of information extraction: (i) a named entity recognition (NER) of studied
materials and physical properties and (ii) a relation extraction (RE) between
these entities. The performance of LLMs in executing these tasks is benchmarked
against traditional models based on the BERT architecture and rule-based
approaches. For NER, LLMs fail to outperform the baseline with zero-shot
prompting and exhibit only limited improvement with few-shot prompting.
However, for RE, a GPT-3.5-Turbo fine-tuned with the appropriate strategy
outperforms all models, including the baseline. Without any fine-tuning, GPT-4
and GPT-4-Turbo display remarkable reasoning and relationship extraction
capabilities after being provided with merely a couple of examples, surpassing
the baseline. Overall, the results suggest that although LLMs demonstrate
relevant reasoning skills in connecting concepts, for tasks requiring
extracting complex domain-specific entities like materials, specialised models
are currently a better choice.

<title>Exploiting Duality in Open Information Extraction with Predicate Prompt. (arXiv:2401.11107v1 [cs.CL])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11107</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Open information extraction (OpenIE) aims to extract the schema-free triplets
in the form of (\emph{subject}, \emph{predicate}, \emph{object}) from a given
sentence. Compared with general information extraction (IE), OpenIE poses more
challenges for the IE models, {especially when multiple complicated triplets
exist in a sentence. To extract these complicated triplets more effectively, in
this paper we propose a novel generative OpenIE model, namely \emph{DualOIE},
which achieves a dual task at the same time as extracting some triplets from
the sentence, i.e., converting the triplets into the sentence.} Such dual task
encourages the model to correctly recognize the structure of the given sentence
and thus is helpful to extract all potential triplets from the sentence.
Specifically, DualOIE extracts the triplets in two steps: 1) first extracting a
sequence of all potential predicates, 2) then using the predicate sequence as a
prompt to induce the generation of triplets. Our experiments on two benchmarks
and our dataset constructed from Meituan demonstrate that DualOIE achieves the
best performance among the state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, the online
A/B test on Meituan platform shows that 0.93\% improvement of QV-CTR and 0.56\%
improvement of UV-CTR have been obtained when the triplets extracted by DualOIE
were leveraged in Meituan&apos;s search system.

<title>Enhancing Large Language Models for Clinical Decision Support by Incorporating Clinical Practice Guidelines. (arXiv:2401.11120v1 [cs.CL])</title>

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Background Large Language Models (LLMs), enhanced with Clinical Practice
Guidelines (CPGs), can significantly improve Clinical Decision Support (CDS).
However, methods for incorporating CPGs into LLMs are not well studied. Methods
We develop three distinct methods for incorporating CPGs into LLMs: Binary
Decision Tree (BDT), Program-Aided Graph Construction (PAGC), and
Chain-of-Thought-Few-Shot Prompting (CoT-FSP). To evaluate the effectiveness of
the proposed methods, we create a set of synthetic patient descriptions and
conduct both automatic and human evaluation of the responses generated by four
LLMs: GPT-4, GPT-3.5 Turbo, LLaMA, and PaLM 2. Zero-Shot Prompting (ZSP) was
used as the baseline method. We focus on CDS for COVID-19 outpatient treatment
as the case study. Results All four LLMs exhibit improved performance when
enhanced with CPGs compared to the baseline ZSP. BDT outperformed both CoT-FSP
and PAGC in automatic evaluation. All of the proposed methods demonstrated high
performance in human evaluation. Conclusion LLMs enhanced with CPGs demonstrate
superior performance, as compared to plain LLMs with ZSP, in providing accurate
recommendations for COVID-19 outpatient treatment, which also highlights the
potential for broader applications beyond the case study.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;We propose the Multi-Head Gaussian Adaptive Attention Mechanism (GAAM), a
novel probabilistic attention framework, and the Gaussian Adaptive Transformer
(GAT), designed to enhance information aggregation across multiple modalities,
including Speech, Text and Vision. GAAM integrates learnable mean and variance
into its attention mechanism, implemented in a Multi-Headed framework enabling
it to collectively model any Probability Distribution for dynamic recalibration
of feature significance. This method demonstrates significant improvements,
especially with highly non-stationary data, surpassing the state-of-the-art
attention techniques in model performance (up to approximately +20% in
accuracy) by identifying key elements within the feature space. GAAM&apos;s
compatibility with dot-product-based attention models and relatively low number
of parameters showcases its adaptability and potential to boost existing
attention frameworks. Empirically, GAAM exhibits superior adaptability and
efficacy across a diverse range of tasks, including emotion recognition in
speech, image classification, and text classification, thereby establishing its
robustness and versatility in handling multi-modal data. Furthermore, we
introduce the Importance Factor (IF), a new learning-based metric that enhances
the explainability of models trained with GAAM-based methods. Overall, GAAM
represents an advancement towards development of better performing and more
explainable attention models across multiple modalities.

the advent of large language models (LLMs) has been a double-edged sword for

these models, but because the models are so much stronger an opponent, they are
harder to defeat. To understand how these models impact adversarial question
writing process, we enrich the writing guidance with LLMs and retrieval models
for the authors to reason why their questions are not adversarial. While
authors could create interesting, challenging adversarial questions, they
sometimes resort to tricks that result in poor questions that are ambiguous,

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), they are not only
used as general-purpose AI assistants but are also customized through further
fine-tuning to meet the requirements of different applications. A pivotal
factor in the success of current LLMs is the alignment process. Current
alignment methods, such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement
learning from human feedback (RLHF), focus on training-time alignment and are
often complex and cumbersome to implement. Therefore, we develop
\textbf{InferAligner}, a novel inference-time alignment method that utilizes
cross-model guidance for harmlessness alignment. InferAligner utilizes safety
steering vectors extracted from safety-aligned model to modify the activations
of the target model when responding to harmful inputs, thereby guiding the
target model to provide harmless responses. Experimental results show that our
method can be very effectively applied to domain-specific models in finance,
medicine, and mathematics, as well as to multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) such as LLaVA. It significantly diminishes the Attack Success Rate
(ASR) of both harmful instructions and jailbreak attacks, while maintaining

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Terms of Service (ToS) form an integral part of any agreement as it defines
the legal relationship between a service provider and an end-user. Not only do
they establish and delineate reciprocal rights and responsibilities, but they
also provide users with information on essential aspects of contracts that
pertain to the use of digital spaces. These aspects include a wide range of
topics, including limitation of liability, data protection, etc. Users tend to
accept the ToS without going through it before using any application or
service. Such ignorance puts them in a potentially weaker situation in case any
action is required. Existing methodologies for the detection or classification
of unfair clauses are however obsolete and show modest performance. In this
research paper, we present SOTA(State of The Art) results on unfair clause
detection from ToS documents based on unprecedented Fine-tuning BERT in
integration with SVC(Support Vector Classifier). The study shows proficient
performance with a macro F1-score of 0.922 at unfair clause detection, and

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Rhetorical Structure Theory implies no single discourse interpretation of a

that the same argumentative structure can be found in semantically similar
texts with varying rhetorical structures. In this work, the differences between
paraphrases within the same argument scheme are evaluated from a rhetorical
perspective. The study proposes a deep dependency parsing model to assess the
connection between rhetorical and argument structures. The model utilizes
rhetorical relations; RST structures of paraphrases serve as training data
augmentations. The method allows for end-to-end argumentation analysis using a
rhetorical tree instead of a word sequence. It is evaluated on the bilingual
Microtexts corpus, and the first results on fully-fledged argument parsing for
the Russian version of the corpus are reported. The results suggest that
argument mining can benefit from multiple variants of discourse structure.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;We propose a natural language prompt-based retrieval augmented generation
(Prompt-RAG), a novel approach to enhance the performance of generative large
language models (LLMs) in niche domains. Conventional RAG methods mostly
require vector embeddings, yet the suitability of generic LLM-based embedding
representations for specialized domains remains uncertain. To explore and
exemplify this point, we compared vector embeddings from Korean Medicine (KM)
and Conventional Medicine (CM) documents, finding that KM document embeddings
correlated more with token overlaps and less with human-assessed document
relatedness, in contrast to CM embeddings. Prompt-RAG, distinct from
conventional RAG models, operates without the need for embedding vectors. Its
performance was assessed through a Question-Answering (QA) chatbot application,
where responses were evaluated for relevance, readability, and informativeness.
The results showed that Prompt-RAG outperformed existing models, including
ChatGPT and conventional vector embedding-based RAGs, in terms of relevance and
informativeness. Despite challenges like content structuring and response
latency, the advancements in LLMs are expected to encourage the use of
Prompt-RAG, making it a promising tool for other domains in need of RAG
methods.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Masked auto-encoder pre-training has emerged as a prevalent technique for
initializing and enhancing dense retrieval systems. It generally utilizes
additional Transformer decoder blocks to provide sustainable supervision
signals and compress contextual information into dense representations.
However, the underlying reasons for the effectiveness of such a pre-training
technique remain unclear. The usage of additional Transformer-based decoders
also incurs significant computational costs. In this study, we aim to shed
light on this issue by revealing that masked auto-encoder (MAE) pre-training
with enhanced decoding significantly improves the term coverage of input tokens
in dense representations, compared to vanilla BERT checkpoints. Building upon
this observation, we propose a modification to the traditional MAE by replacing
the decoder of a masked auto-encoder with a completely simplified Bag-of-Word
prediction task. This modification enables the efficient compression of lexical
signals into dense representations through unsupervised pre-training.
Remarkably, our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art retrieval performance
on several large-scale retrieval benchmarks without requiring any additional
parameters, which provides a 67% training speed-up compared to standard masked
auto-encoder pre-training with enhanced decoding.

revealing its ability to provide valuable insights into model behaviors and

January 29, 2020, to November 30, 2021, about four drugs that garnered
significant public attention during the COVID-19 pandemic: (1)
Hydroxychloroquine and Ivermectin, therapies with anecdotal evidence; and (2)
Molnupiravir and Remdesivir, FDA-approved treatments for eligible patients.
Time-trend analysis was employed to understand popularity trends and related
events. Content and demographic analyses were conducted to explore potential
rationales behind people&apos;s stances on each drug. Time-trend analysis indicated
that Hydroxychloroquine and Ivermectin were discussed more than Molnupiravir
and Remdesivir, particularly during COVID-19 surges. Hydroxychloroquine and
Ivermectin discussions were highly politicized, related to conspiracy theories,
hearsay, and celebrity influences. The distribution of stances between the two
major US political parties was significantly different (P &amp;lt; .001); Republicans
were more likely to support Hydroxychloroquine (55%) and Ivermectin (30%) than
Democrats. People with healthcare backgrounds tended to oppose
Hydroxychloroquine (7%) more than the general population, while the general
population was more likely to support Ivermectin (14%). Our study found that
social media users have varying perceptions and stances on off-label versus
FDA-authorized drug use at different stages of COVID-19. This indicates that
health systems, regulatory agencies, and policymakers should design tailored
strategies to monitor and reduce misinformation to promote safe drug use.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Self-supervision has shown great potential for audio-visual speech
recognition by vastly reducing the amount of labeled data required to build
good systems. However, existing methods are either not entirely end-to-end or
do not train joint representations of both modalities. In this paper, we
introduce AV-data2vec which addresses these challenges and builds audio-visual
representations based on predicting contextualized representations which has
been successful in the uni-modal case. The model uses a shared transformer
encoder for both audio and video and can combine both modalities to improve
speech recognition. Results on LRS3 show that AV-data2vec consistently
outperforms existing methods under all settings with the same amount of data

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;We explore incorporating natural language inference (NLI) into the text
generative pipeline by using a pre-trained NLI model to assess whether a
generated sentence entails, contradicts, or is neutral to the prompt and
preceding text. First, we show that the NLI task is predictive of generation
errors made by GPT-3. We use these results to develop an NLI-informed
generation procedure for GPT-J. Then, we evaluate these generations by
obtaining human annotations on error types and overall quality. We find that an
NLI strategy of maximizing entailment improves text generation when the nucleus
sampling randomness parameter value is high, while one which maximizes
contradiction is in fact productive when the parameter value is low. Overall,
though, we demonstrate that an NLI strategy of maximizing the neutral class
provides the highest quality of generated text (significantly better than the

<title>ETPNav: Evolving Topological Planning for Vision-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments. (arXiv:2304.03047v3 [cs.CV] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03047</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Vision-language navigation is a task that requires an agent to follow
instructions to navigate in environments. It becomes increasingly crucial in
the field of embodied AI, with potential applications in autonomous navigation,
search and rescue, and human-robot interaction. In this paper, we propose to
address a more practical yet challenging counterpart setting - vision-language
navigation in continuous environments (VLN-CE). To develop a robust VLN-CE
agent, we propose a new navigation framework, ETPNav, which focuses on two
critical skills: 1) the capability to abstract environments and generate
long-range navigation plans, and 2) the ability of obstacle-avoiding control in
continuous environments. ETPNav performs online topological mapping of
environments by self-organizing predicted waypoints along a traversed path,
without prior environmental experience. It privileges the agent to break down
the navigation procedure into high-level planning and low-level control.
Concurrently, ETPNav utilizes a transformer-based cross-modal planner to
generate navigation plans based on topological maps and instructions. The plan
is then performed through an obstacle-avoiding controller that leverages a
trial-and-error heuristic to prevent navigation from getting stuck in
obstacles. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
method. ETPNav yields more than 10% and 20% improvements over prior
state-of-the-art on R2R-CE and RxR-CE datasets, respectively. Our code is
available at https://github.com/MarSaKi/ETPNav.

<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14317</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Recent advancements in the field of natural language generation have
facilitated the use of large language models to assess the quality of generated
text. Although these models have shown promising results in tasks such as
machine translation and summarization, their applicability in code intelligence
tasks remains limited without human involvement. The complexity of programming
concepts required for such tasks makes it difficult to develop evaluation
metrics that align with human judgment. Token-matching-based metrics, such as
BLEU, have demonstrated weak correlations with human practitioners in code
intelligence tasks. Moreover, utilizing human-written test suites to evaluate
functional correctness can be challenging in domains with low resources. To
overcome these obstacles, we propose \texttt{ICE-Score}, a new evaluation
metric via instructing large language models (LLMs) for code assessments. Our
metric addresses the limitations of existing approaches by achieving superior
correlations with functional correctness and human preferences, without the
need for test oracles or references. We evaluate the efficacy of our metric on
two different aspects (\textit{human preference} and \textit{execution
success}) and four programming languages. Our results demonstrate that our
metric surpasses state-of-the-art metrics for code generation, delivering high
levels of accuracy and consistency across various programming languages and
tasks. We also make our evaluation metric and datasets available to the

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;The recent release of large language model (LLM) based chatbots, such as

believed that foundation models will serve as the fundamental building blocks
for future AI systems. As foundation models are in their early stages, the

explored. There is limited understanding about the impact of introducing
foundation models in software architecture. Therefore, in this paper, we
propose a taxonomy of foundation model based systems, which classifies and
compares the characteristics of foundation models and design options of
foundation model based systems. Our taxonomy comprises three categories: the
pretraining and adaptation of foundation models, the architecture design of
foundation model based systems, and responsible-AI-by-design. This taxonomy can
serve as concrete guidance for making major architectural design decisions when
designing foundation model based systems and highlights trade-offs arising from
design decisions.

<title>Beyond Shared Vocabulary: Increasing Representational Word Similarities across Languages for Multilingual Machine Translation. (arXiv:2305.14189v3 [cs.CL] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14189</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Using a vocabulary that is shared across languages is common practice in
Multilingual Neural Machine Translation (MNMT). In addition to its simple
design, shared tokens play an important role in positive knowledge transfer,
assuming that shared tokens refer to similar meanings across languages.
However, when word overlap is small, especially due to different writing
systems, transfer is inhibited. In this paper, we define word-level information
transfer pathways via word equivalence classes and rely on graph networks to
fuse word embeddings across languages. Our experiments demonstrate the
advantages of our approach: 1) embeddings of words with similar meanings are
better aligned across languages, 2) our method achieves consistent BLEU
improvements of up to 2.3 points for high- and low-resource MNMT, and 3) less
than 1.0\% additional trainable parameters are required with a limited increase
in computational costs, while inference time remains identical to the baseline.
We release the codebase to the community.

making it difficult to assess their effectiveness in modern settings. This work
extensively investigates graph representation methods for text classification,
identifying practical implications and open challenges. We compare different
graph construction schemes using a variety of GNN architectures and setups
across five datasets, encompassing short and long documents as well as
unbalanced scenarios in diverse domains. Two Transformer-based large language
models are also included to complement the study. The results show that i)
although the effectiveness of graphs depends on the textual input features and
domain, simple graph constructions perform better the longer the documents are,
ii) graph representations are especially beneficial for longer documents,
outperforming Transformer-based models, iii) graph methods are particularly

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Despite the frequent challenges posed by ambiguity when representing meaning
via natural language, it is often ignored or deliberately removed in tasks
mapping language to formally-designed representations, which generally assume a
one-to-one mapping between linguistic and formal representations. We attempt to
address this shortcoming by introducing AmP, a framework, dataset, and
challenge for translating ambiguous natural language to formal representations
like logic and code. We define templates and generate data for five
well-documented linguistic ambiguities. Using AmP, we investigate how several
few-shot text-to-code systems handle ambiguity, introducing three new metrics.
We find that large pre-trained models perform poorly at capturing the
distribution of possible meanings without deliberate instruction. However,
models are able to capture the distribution well when ambiguity is attested in
their inputs. These results motivate a call for including ambiguity explicitly
in datasets and promote considering the distribution of possible outputs when

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Objective: Social media-based public health research is crucial for epidemic
surveillance, but most studies identify relevant corpora with keyword matching.
This study develops a system to streamline the process of curating colloquial
medical dictionaries. We demonstrate the pipeline by curating a UMLS-colloquial
symptom dictionary from COVID-19-related tweets as proof of concept. Methods:
COVID-19-related tweets from February 1, 2020, to April 30, 2022 were used. The
pipeline includes three modules: a named entity recognition module to detect
symptoms in tweets; an entity normalization module to aggregate detected
entities; and a mapping module that iteratively maps entities to Unified
Medical Language System concepts. A random 500 entity sample were drawn from
the final dictionary for accuracy validation. Additionally, we conducted a
symptom frequency distribution analysis to compare our dictionary to a
pre-defined lexicon from previous research. Results: We identified 498,480
unique symptom entity expressions from the tweets. Pre-processing reduces the
number to 18,226. The final dictionary contains 38,175 unique expressions of
symptoms that can be mapped to 966 UMLS concepts (accuracy = 95%). Symptom
distribution analysis found that our dictionary detects more symptoms and is
effective at identifying psychiatric disorders like anxiety and depression,
often missed by pre-defined lexicons. Conclusion: This study advances public
health research by implementing a novel, systematic pipeline for curating
symptom lexicons from social media data. The final lexicon&apos;s high accuracy,
validated by medical professionals, underscores the potential of this
methodology to reliably interpret and categorize vast amounts of unstructured
social media data into actionable medical insights across diverse linguistic
and regional landscapes.

<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04408</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Open-sourced large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
efficacy in various tasks with instruction tuning. However, these models can
sometimes struggle with tasks that require more specialized knowledge such as
translation. One possible reason for such deficiency is that instruction tuning
aims to generate fluent and coherent text that continues from a given
instruction without being constrained by any task-specific requirements.
Moreover, it can be more challenging for tuning smaller LLMs with lower-quality
training data. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework using
examples in comparison to teach LLMs to learn translation. Our approach
involves presenting the model with examples of correct and incorrect
translations and using a preference loss to guide the model&apos;s learning. We
evaluate our method on WMT2022 test sets and show that it outperforms existing
methods. Our findings offer a new perspective on fine-tuning LLMs for
translation tasks and provide a promising solution for generating high-quality

<title>ChatRule: Mining Logical Rules with Large Language Models for Knowledge Graph Reasoning. (arXiv:2309.01538v3 [cs.AI] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01538</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Logical rules are essential for uncovering the logical connections between
relations, which could improve reasoning performance and provide interpretable
results on knowledge graphs (KGs). Although there have been many efforts to
mine meaningful logical rules over KGs, existing methods suffer from
computationally intensive searches over the rule space and a lack of
scalability for large-scale KGs. Besides, they often ignore the semantics of
relations which is crucial for uncovering logical connections. Recently, large
language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance in the field of
natural language processing and various applications, owing to their emergent
ability and generalizability. In this paper, we propose a novel framework,
ChatRule, unleashing the power of large language models for mining logical
rules over knowledge graphs. Specifically, the framework is initiated with an
LLM-based rule generator, leveraging both the semantic and structural
information of KGs to prompt LLMs to generate logical rules. To refine the
generated rules, a rule ranking module estimates the rule quality by
incorporating facts from existing KGs. Last, the ranked rules can be used to
conduct reasoning over KGs. ChatRule is evaluated on four large-scale KGs,
w.r.t. different rule quality metrics and downstream tasks, showing the
effectiveness and scalability of our method.

<title>DePT: Decomposed Prompt Tuning for Parameter-Efficient Fine-tuning. (arXiv:2309.05173v4 [cs.CL] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05173</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Prompt tuning (PT), where a small amount of trainable soft (continuous)
prompt vectors is affixed to the input of language models (LM), has shown
promising results across various tasks and models for parameter-efficient
fine-tuning (PEFT). PT stands out from other PEFT approaches because it
maintains competitive performance with fewer trainable parameters and does not
drastically scale up its parameters as the model size expands. However, PT
introduces additional soft prompt tokens, leading to longer input sequences,
which significantly impacts training and inference time and memory usage due to
the Transformer&apos;s quadratic complexity. Particularly concerning for Large
Language Models (LLMs) that face heavy daily querying. To address this issue,
we propose Decomposed Prompt Tuning (DePT), which decomposes the soft prompt
into a shorter soft prompt and a pair of low-rank matrices that are then
optimised with two different learning rates. This allows DePT to achieve better
performance while saving substantial memory and time costs compared to vanilla
PT and its variants, without changing trainable parameter sizes. Through
extensive experiments on 23 natural language processing (NLP) and
vision-language (VL) tasks, we demonstrate that DePT outperforms
state-of-the-art PEFT approaches, including the full fine-tuning baseline, in
some scenarios. Additionally, we empirically show that DEPT grows more
efficient as the model size increases. Our further study reveals that DePT
integrates seamlessly with parameter-efficient transfer learning in the
few-shot learning setting and highlights its adaptability to various model
architectures and sizes.

<title>ChaCha: Leveraging Large Language Models to Prompt Children to Share Their Emotions about Personal Events. (arXiv:2309.12244v2 [cs.HC] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12244</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Children typically learn to identify and express emotions through sharing
their stories and feelings with others, particularly their family. However, it
is challenging for parents or siblings to have emotional communication with
children since children are still developing their communication skills. We
present ChaCha, a chatbot that encourages and guides children to share personal
events and associated emotions. ChaCha combines a state machine and large
language models (LLMs) to keep the dialogue on track while carrying on
free-form conversations. Through an exploratory study with 20 children (aged
8-12), we examine how ChaCha prompts children to share personal events and
guides them to describe associated emotions. Participants perceived ChaCha as a
close friend and shared their stories on various topics, such as family trips
and personal achievements. Based on the findings, we discuss opportunities for
leveraging LLMs to design child-friendly chatbots to support children in
sharing emotions.

<title>Bad Actor, Good Advisor: Exploring the Role of Large Language Models in Fake News Detection. (arXiv:2309.12247v2 [cs.CL] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12247</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Detecting fake news requires both a delicate sense of diverse clues and a
profound understanding of the real-world background, which remains challenging
for detectors based on small language models (SLMs) due to their knowledge and
capability limitations. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have
shown remarkable performance in various tasks, but whether and how LLMs could
help with fake news detection remains underexplored. In this paper, we
investigate the potential of LLMs in fake news detection. First, we conduct an
empirical study and find that a sophisticated LLM such as GPT 3.5 could
generally expose fake news and provide desirable multi-perspective rationales
but still underperforms the basic SLM, fine-tuned BERT. Our subsequent analysis
attributes such a gap to the LLM&apos;s inability to select and integrate rationales
properly to conclude. Based on these findings, we propose that current LLMs may
not substitute fine-tuned SLMs in fake news detection but can be a good advisor
for SLMs by providing multi-perspective instructive rationales. To instantiate
this proposal, we design an adaptive rationale guidance network for fake news
detection (ARG), in which SLMs selectively acquire insights on news analysis
from the LLMs&apos; rationales. We further derive a rationale-free version of ARG by
distillation, namely ARG-D, which services cost-sensitive scenarios without
querying LLMs. Experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that ARG and
ARG-D outperform three types of baseline methods, including SLM-based,
LLM-based, and combinations of small and large language models.

<title>GenSim: Generating Robotic Simulation Tasks via Large Language Models. (arXiv:2310.01361v2 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01361</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Collecting large amounts of real-world interaction data to train general
robotic policies is often prohibitively expensive, thus motivating the use of
simulation data. However, existing methods for data generation have generally
focused on scene-level diversity (e.g., object instances and poses) rather than
task-level diversity, due to the human effort required to come up with and
verify novel tasks. This has made it challenging for policies trained on
simulation data to demonstrate significant task-level generalization. In this
paper, we propose to automatically generate rich simulation environments and
expert demonstrations by exploiting a large language models&apos; (LLM) grounding
and coding ability. Our approach, dubbed GenSim, has two modes: goal-directed
generation, wherein a target task is given to the LLM and the LLM proposes a
task curriculum to solve the target task, and exploratory generation, wherein
the LLM bootstraps from previous tasks and iteratively proposes novel tasks
that would be helpful in solving more complex tasks. We use GPT4 to expand the
existing benchmark by ten times to over 100 tasks, on which we conduct
supervised finetuning and evaluate several LLMs including finetuned GPTs and
Code Llama on code generation for robotic simulation tasks. Furthermore, we
observe that LLMs-generated simulation programs can enhance task-level
generalization significantly when used for multitask policy training. We
further find that with minimal sim-to-real adaptation, the multitask policies
pretrained on GPT4-generated simulation tasks exhibit stronger transfer to
unseen long-horizon tasks in the real world and outperform baselines by 25%.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently showcased their remarkable
capacities, not only in natural language processing tasks but also across
diverse domains such as clinical medicine, legal consultation, and education.
LLMs become more than mere applications, evolving into assistants capable of
addressing diverse user requests. This narrows the distinction between human
beings and artificial intelligence agents, raising intriguing questions
regarding the potential manifestation of personalities, temperaments, and
emotions within LLMs. In this paper, we propose a framework, PsychoBench, for
evaluating diverse psychological aspects of LLMs. Comprising thirteen scales
commonly used in clinical psychology, PsychoBench further classifies these
scales into four distinct categories: personality traits, interpersonal
relationships, motivational tests, and emotional abilities. Our study examines
five popular models, namely text-davinci-003, gpt-3.5-turbo, gpt-4, LLaMA-2-7b,
and LLaMA-2-13b. Additionally, we employ a jailbreak approach to bypass the

6,141 examples, derived from 28 existing multimodal datasets involving
mathematics and 3 newly created datasets (i.e., IQTest, FunctionQA, and
PaperQA). Completing these tasks requires fine-grained, deep visual
understanding and compositional reasoning, which all state-of-the-art

<title>EMO: Earth Mover Distance Optimization for Auto-Regressive Language Modeling. (arXiv:2310.04691v4 [cs.CL] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04691</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Neural language models are probabilistic models of human text. They are
predominantly trained using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), which is
equivalent to minimizing the forward cross-entropy between the empirical data
distribution and the model distribution. However, various degeneration
phenomena are still widely observed when decoding from the distributions
learned by such models. We establish that the forward cross-entropy is
suboptimal as a distance metric for aligning human and model distribution due
to its (1) recall-prioritization (2) negative diversity ignorance and (3)
train-test mismatch. In this paper, we propose Earth Mover Distance
Optimization (EMO) for auto-regressive language modeling. EMO capitalizes on
the inherent properties of earth mover distance to address the aforementioned
challenges. Due to the high complexity of direct computation, we further
introduce a feasible upper bound for EMO to ease end-to-end training. Upon
extensive evaluation of language models trained using EMO and MLE. We find that
EMO demonstrates a consistently better language modeling performance than MLE
across domains. Moreover, EMO demonstrates noteworthy enhancements in
downstream performance with minimal fine-tuning on merely 25,000 sentences.
This highlights the tremendous potential of EMO as a lightweight calibration
method for enhancing large-scale pre-trained language models.

<title>IDEAL: Influence-Driven Selective Annotations Empower In-Context Learners in Large Language Models. (arXiv:2310.10873v2 [cs.CL] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10873</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;In-context learning is a promising paradigm that utilizes in-context examples
as prompts for the predictions of large language models. These prompts are
crucial for achieving strong performance. However, since the prompts need to be
sampled from a large volume of annotated examples, finding the right prompt may
result in high annotation costs. To address this challenge, this paper
introduces an influence-driven selective annotation method that aims to
minimize annotation costs while improving the quality of in-context examples.
The essence of our method is to select a pivotal subset from a large-scale
unlabeled data pool to annotate for the subsequent sampling of prompts.
Specifically, a directed graph is first constructed to represent unlabeled
data. Afterward, the influence of candidate unlabeled subsets is quantified
with a diffusion process. A simple yet effective greedy algorithm for unlabeled
data selection is lastly introduced. It iteratively selects the data if it
provides a maximum marginal gain with respect to quantified influence. Compared
with previous efforts on selective annotations, our influence-driven method
works in an end-to-end manner, avoids an intractable explicit balance between
data diversity and representativeness, and enjoys theoretical support.
Experiments confirm the superiority of the proposed method on various
benchmarks, achieving better performance under lower time consumption during
subset selection. The project page is available at

<title>Rosetta Stone at KSAA-RD Shared Task: A Hop From Language Modeling To Word--Definition Alignment. (arXiv:2310.15823v3 [cs.CL] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15823</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;A Reverse Dictionary is a tool enabling users to discover a word based on its
provided definition, meaning, or description. Such a technique proves valuable
in various scenarios, aiding language learners who possess a description of a
word without its identity, and benefiting writers seeking precise terminology.
These scenarios often encapsulate what is referred to as the
&quot;Tip-of-the-Tongue&quot; (TOT) phenomena. In this work, we present our winning
solution for the Arabic Reverse Dictionary shared task. This task focuses on
deriving a vector representation of an Arabic word from its accompanying
description. The shared task encompasses two distinct subtasks: the first
involves an Arabic definition as input, while the second employs an English
definition. For the first subtask, our approach relies on an ensemble of
finetuned Arabic BERT-based models, predicting the word embedding for a given
definition. The final representation is obtained through averaging the output
embeddings from each model within the ensemble. In contrast, the most effective
solution for the second subtask involves translating the English test
definitions into Arabic and applying them to the finetuned models originally
trained for the first subtask. This straightforward method achieves the highest
score across both subtasks.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;When training data are collected from human annotators, the design of the
annotation instrument, the instructions given to annotators, the
characteristics of the annotators, and their interactions can impact training
data. This study demonstrates that design choices made when creating an
annotation instrument also impact the models trained on the resulting
annotations. We introduce the term annotation sensitivity to refer to the
impact of annotation data collection methods on the annotations themselves and
on downstream model performance and predictions. We collect annotations of hate
speech and offensive language in five experimental conditions of an annotation
instrument, randomly assigning annotators to conditions. We then fine-tune BERT
models on each of the five resulting datasets and evaluate model performance on
a holdout portion of each condition. We find considerable differences between
the conditions for 1) the share of hate speech/offensive language annotations,
2) model performance, 3) model predictions, and 4) model learning curves. Our
results emphasize the crucial role played by the annotation instrument which
has received little attention in the machine learning literature. We call for
additional research into how and why the instrument impacts the annotations to
inform the development of best practices in instrument design.

<title>GNN2R: Weakly-Supervised Rationale-Providing Question Answering over Knowledge Graphs. (arXiv:2312.02317v3 [cs.CL] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02317</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Most current methods for multi-hop question answering (QA) over knowledge
graphs (KGs) only provide final conclusive answers without explanations, such
as a set of KG entities that is difficult for normal users to review and
comprehend. This issue severely limits the application of KG-based QA in
real-world scenarios. However, it is non-trivial to solve due to two
challenges: First, annotations of reasoning chains of multi-hop questions,
which could serve as supervision for explanation generation, are usually
lacking. Second, it is difficult to maintain high efficiency when explicit KG
triples need to be retrieved to generate explanations. In this paper, we
propose a novel Graph Neural Network-based Two-Step Reasoning model (GNN2R) to
solve this issue. GNN2R can provide both final answers and reasoning subgraphs
as a rationale behind final answers efficiently with only weak supervision that
is available through question-final answer pairs. We extensively evaluated
GNN2R with detailed analyses in experiments. The results demonstrate that, in
terms of effectiveness, efficiency, and quality of generated explanations,
GNN2R outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods that are applicable to this
task. Our code and pre-trained models are available at

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Human educators possess an intrinsic ability to anticipate and seek
educational explanations from students, which drives them to pose
thought-provoking questions when students cannot articulate these explanations
independently. We aim to imbue Intelligent Tutoring Systems with this ability

a novel prompting technique, Assertion Enhanced Few-Shot Learning, to
facilitate the generation of accurate, detailed oriented educational
explanations. Our central hypothesis is that, in educational domain, few-shot
demonstrations are necessary but not a sufficient condition for quality
explanation generation. We conducted a study involving 12 in-service teachers,
comparing our approach to Traditional Few-Shot Learning. The results show that
Assertion Enhanced Few-Shot Learning improves explanation accuracy by 15% and
yields higher-quality explanations, as evaluated by teachers. We also conduct a
qualitative ablation study to factor the impact of assertions to provide

<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07930</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;We study statistical watermarking by formulating it as a hypothesis testing
problem, a general framework which subsumes all previous statistical
watermarking methods. Key to our formulation is a coupling of the output tokens
and the rejection region, realized by pseudo-random generators in practice,
that allows non-trivial trade-off between the Type I error and Type II error.
We characterize the Uniformly Most Powerful (UMP) watermark in the general
hypothesis testing setting and the minimax Type II error in the model-agnostic
setting. In the common scenario where the output is a sequence of $n$ tokens,
we establish nearly matching upper and lower bounds on the number of i.i.d.
tokens required to guarantee small Type I and Type II errors. Our rate of
$\Theta(h^{-1} \log (1/h))$ with respect to the average entropy per token $h$
highlights potentials for improvement from the rate of $h^{-2}$ in the previous
works. Moreover, we formulate the robust watermarking problem where users are
allowed to perform a class of perturbations on the generated texts, and
characterize the optimal type II error of robust UMP tests via a linear
programming problem. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic
statistical treatment on the watermarking problem with near-optimal rates in
the i.i.d. setting, which might be of interest for future works.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;This paper introduces a novel approach for topic modeling utilizing latent
codebooks from Vector-Quantized Variational Auto-Encoder~(VQ-VAE), discretely
encapsulating the rich information of the pre-trained embeddings such as the

codebooks and embeddings as conceptual bag-of-words, we propose a new
generative topic model called Topic-VQ-VAE~(TVQ-VAE) which inversely generates
the original documents related to the respective latent codebook. The TVQ-VAE
can visualize the topics with various generative distributions including the
traditional BoW distribution and the autoregressive image generation. Our
experimental results on document analysis and image generation demonstrate that
TVQ-VAE effectively captures the topic context which reveals the underlying
structures of the dataset and supports flexible forms of document generation.

<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15407</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Automatic evaluation is an integral aspect of dialogue system research. The
traditional reference-based NLG metrics are generally found to be unsuitable
for dialogue assessment. Consequently, recent studies have suggested various
unique, reference-free neural metrics that better align with human evaluations.
Notably among them, large language models (LLMs), particularly the
instruction-tuned variants like ChatGPT, are shown to be promising substitutes
for human judges. Yet, existing works on utilizing LLMs for automatic dialogue
evaluation are limited in their scope in terms of the number of meta-evaluation
datasets, mode of evaluation, coverage of LLMs, etc. Hence, it remains
inconclusive how effective these LLMs are. To this end, we conduct a
comprehensive study on the application of LLMs for automatic dialogue
evaluation. Specifically, we analyze the multi-dimensional evaluation
capability of 30 recently emerged LLMs at both turn and dialogue levels, using
a comprehensive set of 12 meta-evaluation datasets. Additionally, we probe the
robustness of the LLMs in handling various adversarial perturbations at both
turn and dialogue levels. Finally, we explore how model-level and
dimension-level ensembles impact the evaluation performance. All resources are

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;In this work, we introduce a novel evaluation paradigm for Large Language
Models, one that challenges them to engage in meta-reasoning. This approach
addresses critical shortcomings in existing math problem-solving benchmarks,
traditionally used to evaluate the cognitive capabilities of agents. Our
paradigm shifts the focus from result-oriented assessments, which often
overlook the reasoning process, to a more holistic evaluation that effectively
differentiates the cognitive capabilities among models. For example, in our
benchmark, GPT-4 demonstrates a performance five times better than GPT3-5. The
significance of this new paradigm lies in its ability to reveal potential
cognitive deficiencies in LLMs that current benchmarks, such as GSM8K, fail to
uncover due to their saturation and lack of effective differentiation among
varying reasoning abilities. Our comprehensive analysis includes several
state-of-the-art math models from both open-source and closed-source
communities, uncovering fundamental deficiencies in their training and
evaluation approaches. This paper not only advocates for a paradigm shift in
the assessment of LLMs but also contributes to the ongoing discourse on the
trajectory towards Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). By promoting the
adoption of meta-reasoning evaluation methods similar to ours, we aim to
facilitate a more accurate assessment of the true cognitive abilities of LLMs.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly permeating
various domains of human production and life, highlighting the importance of
aligning them with human values. The current alignment of AI systems primarily
focuses on passively aligning LLMs through human intervention. However, agents
possess characteristics like receiving environmental feedback and
self-evolution, rendering the LLM alignment methods inadequate. In response, we
propose an evolutionary framework for agent evolution and alignment, named
EvolutionaryAgent, which transforms agent alignment into a process of evolution
and selection under the principle of survival of the fittest. In an environment
where social norms continuously evolve, agents better adapted to the current
social norms will have a higher probability of survival and proliferation,
while those inadequately aligned dwindle over time. Experimental results
assessing the agents from multiple perspectives in aligning with social norms
demonstrate that EvolutionaryAgent can align progressively better with the
evolving social norms while maintaining its proficiency in general tasks.
Effectiveness tests conducted on various open and closed-source LLMs as the
foundation for agents also prove the applicability of our approach.

<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04925</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Chain of Thought (CoT) is significant in improving the reasoning abilities of
large language models (LLMs). However, the correlation between the
effectiveness of CoT and the length of reasoning steps in prompts remains
largely unknown. To shed light on this, we have conducted several empirical
experiments to explore the relations. Specifically, we design experiments that
expand and compress the rationale reasoning steps within CoT demonstrations,
while keeping all other factors constant. We have the following key findings.
First, the results indicate that lengthening the reasoning steps in prompts,
even without adding new information into the prompt, considerably enhances
LLMs&apos; reasoning abilities across multiple datasets. Alternatively, shortening
the reasoning steps, even while preserving the key information, significantly
diminishes the reasoning abilities of models. This finding highlights the
importance of the number of steps in CoT prompts and provides practical
guidance to make better use of LLMs&apos; potential in complex problem-solving
scenarios. Second, we also investigated the relationship between the
performance of CoT and the rationales used in demonstrations. Surprisingly, the
result shows that even incorrect rationales can yield favorable outcomes if
they maintain the requisite length of inference. Third, we observed that the
advantages of increasing reasoning steps are task-dependent: simpler tasks
require fewer steps, whereas complex tasks gain significantly from longer
inference sequences.

<title>Universal Vulnerabilities in Large Language Models: In-context Learning Backdoor Attacks. (arXiv:2401.05949v3 [cs.CL] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05949</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;In-context learning, a paradigm bridging the gap between pre-training and
fine-tuning, has demonstrated high efficacy in several NLP tasks, especially in
few-shot settings. Unlike traditional fine-tuning methods, in-context learning
adapts pre-trained models to unseen tasks without updating any parameters.
Despite being widely applied, in-context learning is vulnerable to malicious
attacks. In this work, we raise security concerns regarding this paradigm. Our
studies demonstrate that an attacker can manipulate the behavior of large
language models by poisoning the demonstration context, without the need for
fine-tuning the model. Specifically, we have designed a new backdoor attack
method, named ICLAttack, to target large language models based on in-context
learning. Our method encompasses two types of attacks: poisoning demonstration
examples and poisoning prompts, which can make models behave in accordance with
predefined intentions. ICLAttack does not require additional fine-tuning to
implant a backdoor, thus preserving the model&apos;s generality. Furthermore, the
poisoned examples are correctly labeled, enhancing the natural stealth of our
attack method. Extensive experimental results across several language models,
ranging in size from 1.3B to 40B parameters, demonstrate the effectiveness of

<title>Mind Your Format: Towards Consistent Evaluation of In-Context Learning Improvements. (arXiv:2401.06766v2 [cs.CL] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06766</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Large language models demonstrate a remarkable capability for learning to
solve new tasks from a few examples. The prompt template, or the way the input
examples are formatted to obtain the prompt, is an important yet often
overlooked aspect of in-context learning. In this work, we conduct a
comprehensive study of the template format&apos;s influence on the in-context
learning performance. We evaluate the impact of the prompt template across
models (from 770M to 70B parameters) and 4 standard classification datasets. We
show that a poor choice of the template can reduce the performance of the
strongest models and inference methods to a random guess level. More
importantly, the best templates do not transfer between different setups and
even between models of the same family. Our findings show that the currently
prevalent approach to evaluation, which ignores template selection, may give
misleading results due to different templates in different works. As a first
step towards mitigating this issue, we propose Template Ensembles that
aggregate model predictions across several templates. This simple test-time
augmentation boosts average performance while being robust to the choice of
random set of templates.

<title>Developing ChatGPT for Biology and Medicine: A Complete Review of Biomedical Question Answering. (arXiv:2401.07510v3 [cs.CL] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07510</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;ChatGPT explores a strategic blueprint of question answering (QA) in
delivering medical diagnosis, treatment recommendations, and other healthcare
support. This is achieved through the increasing incorporation of medical
domain data via natural language processing (NLP) and multimodal paradigms. By
transitioning the distribution of text, images, videos, and other modalities
from the general domain to the medical domain, these techniques have expedited
the progress of medical domain question answering (MDQA). They bridge the gap
between human natural language and sophisticated medical domain knowledge or
expert manual annotations, handling large-scale, diverse, unbalanced, or even
unlabeled data analysis scenarios in medical contexts. Central to our focus is
the utilizing of language models and multimodal paradigms for medical question
answering, aiming to guide the research community in selecting appropriate
mechanisms for their specific medical research requirements. Specialized tasks
such as unimodal-related question answering, reading comprehension, reasoning,
diagnosis, relation extraction, probability modeling, and others, as well as
multimodal-related tasks like vision question answering, image caption,
cross-modal retrieval, report summarization, and generation, are discussed in
detail. Each section delves into the intricate specifics of the respective
method under consideration. This paper highlights the structures and
advancements of medical domain explorations against general domain methods,
emphasizing their applications across different tasks and datasets. It also
outlines current challenges and opportunities for future medical domain
research, paving the way for continued innovation and application in this
rapidly evolving field.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Despite recent progress in improving the mathematical reasoning ability of
large language models(LLMs), solving competition-level math problems without
the use of external tools remains challenging for open-source LLMs. In this
work, we introduce the MMIQC dataset, a mixture of processed web data and
synthetic question-response pairs, to equip base models with better
mathematical reasoning skills. In different model sizes, the models fine-tuned
on MMIQC consistently outperform their counterparts by a clear margin on MATH
test set. Notably, DeepSeek-67B-MMIQC achieves a 41.0% accuracy, 4.2% higher
than the previous open-source SOTA. Our experiments also show that a large part
of the improvement can be attributed to our novel augmentation method
IQC(Iterative Question Composing), where we iteratively ask an LLM to compose
new questions from the given seed problems and do rejection sampling from
another LLM. MMIQC has now been released on

<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09074</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;We investigate the extent to which Large Language Models (LLMs) can simulate
the execution of computer code and algorithms. We begin by looking at straight
line programs, and show that current LLMs demonstrate poor performance even
with such simple programs -- performance rapidly degrades with the length of
code. We then investigate the ability of LLMs to simulate programs that contain
critical paths and redundant instructions. We also go beyond straight line
program simulation with sorting algorithms and nested loops, and we show the
computational complexity of a routine directly affects the ability of an LLM to
simulate its execution. We observe that LLMs execute instructions sequentially
and with a low error margin only for short programs or standard procedures.
LLMs&apos; code simulation is in tension with their pattern recognition and
memorisation capabilities: on tasks where memorisation is detrimental, we
propose a novel prompting method to simulate code execution line by line.
Empirically, our new Chain of Simulation (CoSm) method improves on the standard
Chain of Thought prompting approach by avoiding the pitfalls of memorisation.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Current methods to identify and classify racist language in text rely on
small-n qualitative approaches or large-n approaches focusing exclusively on
overt forms of racist discourse. This article provides a step-by-step
generalizable guideline to identify and classify different forms of racist
discourse in large corpora. In our approach, we start by conceptualizing racism
and its different manifestations. We then contextualize these racist
manifestations to the time and place of interest, which allows researchers to
identify their discursive form. Finally, we apply XLM-RoBERTa (XLM-R), a
cross-lingual model for supervised text classification with a cutting-edge
contextual understanding of text. We show that XLM-R and XLM-R-Racismo, our
pretrained model, outperform other state-of-the-art approaches in classifying

relating to the Ecuadorian ind\&apos;igena community between 2018 and 2021.

<title>All in How You Ask for It: Simple Black-Box Method for Jailbreak Attacks. (arXiv:2401.09798v2 [cs.CL] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09798</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT face `jailbreak&apos; challenges, where
safeguards are bypassed to produce ethically harmful prompts. This study
proposes a simple black-box method to effectively generate jailbreak prompts,
overcoming the high complexity and computational costs associated with existing
methods. The proposed technique iteratively rewrites harmful prompts into
non-harmful expressions using the target LLM itself, based on the hypothesis
that LLMs can directly sample expressions that bypass safeguards. Demonstrated
through experiments with ChatGPT (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4) and Gemini-Pro, this
method achieved an attack success rate of over 80% within an average of 5
iterations and remained effective despite model updates. The generated
jailbreak prompts were naturally-worded and concise; moreover, they were
difficult-to-defend. These results indicate that creating effective jailbreak
prompts is simpler than previously considered, suggesting that black-box
jailbreak attacks pose a more serious threat.

<title>Chem-FINESE: Validating Fine-Grained Few-shot Entity Extraction through Text Reconstruction. (arXiv:2401.10189v2 [cs.CL] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10189</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Fine-grained few-shot entity extraction in the chemical domain faces two
unique challenges. First, compared with entity extraction tasks in the general
domain, sentences from chemical papers usually contain more entities. Moreover,
entity extraction models usually have difficulty extracting entities of
long-tailed types. In this paper, we propose Chem-FINESE, a novel
sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) based few-shot entity extraction approach, to
address these two challenges. Our Chem-FINESE has two components: a seq2seq
entity extractor to extract named entities from the input sentence and a
seq2seq self-validation module to reconstruct the original input sentence from
extracted entities. Inspired by the fact that a good entity extraction system
needs to extract entities faithfully, our new self-validation module leverages
entity extraction results to reconstruct the original input sentence. Besides,
we design a new contrastive loss to reduce excessive copying during the
extraction process. Finally, we release ChemNER+, a new fine-grained chemical
entity extraction dataset that is annotated by domain experts with the ChemNER
schema. Experiments in few-shot settings with both ChemNER+ and CHEMET datasets
show that our newly proposed framework has contributed up to 8.26% and 6.84%
absolute F1-score gains respectively.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs) represent sophisticated attack
patterns in the cybersecurity domain, described encyclopedically in textual
knowledge bases. Identifying TTPs in cybersecurity writing, often called TTP
mapping, is an important and challenging task. Conventional learning approaches
often target the problem in the classical multi-class or multilabel
classification setting. This setting hinders the learning ability of the model
due to a large number of classes (i.e., TTPs), the inevitable skewness of the
label distribution and the complex hierarchical structure of the label space.
We formulate the problem in a different learning paradigm, where the assignment
of a text to a TTP label is decided by the direct semantic similarity between
the two, thus reducing the complexity of competing solely over the large
labeling space. To that end, we propose a neural matching architecture with an
effective sampling-based learn-to-compare mechanism, facilitating the learning
process of the matching model despite constrained resources.

<title>Knowledge Fusion of Large Language Models. (arXiv:2401.10491v2 [cs.CL] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10491</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;While training large language models (LLMs) from scratch can generate models
with distinct functionalities and strengths, it comes at significant costs and
may result in redundant capabilities. Alternatively, a cost-effective and
compelling approach is to merge existing pre-trained LLMs into a more potent
model. However, due to the varying architectures of these LLMs, directly
blending their weights is impractical. In this paper, we introduce the notion
of knowledge fusion for LLMs, aimed at combining the capabilities of existing
LLMs and transferring them into a single LLM. By leveraging the generative
distributions of source LLMs, we externalize their collective knowledge and
unique strengths, thereby potentially elevating the capabilities of the target
model beyond those of any individual source LLM. We validate our approach using
three popular LLMs with different architectures--Llama-2, MPT, and
OpenLLaMA--across various benchmarks and tasks. Our findings confirm that the
fusion of LLMs can improve the performance of the target model across a range
of capabilities such as reasoning, commonsense, and code generation. Our code,
model weights, and data are public at
