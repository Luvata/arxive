      <title>SafePowerGraph-LLM: Novel Power Grid Graph Embedding and Optimization with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficiently solving Optimal Power Flow (OPF) problems in power systems is crucial for operational planning and grid management. There is a growing need for scalable algorithms capable of handling the increasing variability, constraints, and uncertainties in modern power networks while providing accurate and fast solutions. To address this, machine learning techniques, particularly Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as promising approaches. This letter introduces SafePowerGraph-LLM, the first framework explicitly designed for solving OPF problems using Large Language Models (LLM)s. The proposed approach combines graph and tabular representations of power grids to effectively query LLMs, capturing the complex relationships and constraints in power systems. A new implementation of in-context learning and fine-tuning protocols for LLMs is introduced, tailored specifically for the OPF problem. SafePowerGraph-LLM demonstrates reliable performances using off-the-shelf LLM. Our study reveals the impact of LLM architecture, size, and fine-tuning and demonstrates our framework's ability to handle realistic grid components and constraints.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models for Interpretable Mental Health Diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a clinical decision support system (CDSS) for mental health diagnosis that combines the strengths of large language models (LLMs) and constraint logic programming (CLP). Having a CDSS is important because of the high complexity of diagnostic manuals used by mental health professionals and the danger of diagnostic errors. Our CDSS is a software tool that uses an LLM to translate diagnostic manuals to a logic program and solves the program using an off-the-shelf CLP engine to query a patient's diagnosis based on the encoded rules and provided data. By giving domain experts the opportunity to inspect the LLM-generated logic program, and making modifications when needed, our CDSS ensures that the diagnosis is not only accurate but also interpretable. We experimentally compare it with two baseline approaches of using LLMs: diagnosing patients using the LLM-only approach, and using the LLM-generated logic program but without expert inspection. The results show that, while LLMs are extremely useful in generating candidate logic programs, these programs still require expert inspection and modification to guarantee faithfulness to the official diagnostic manuals. Additionally, ethical concerns arise from the direct use of patient data in LLMs, underscoring the need for a safer hybrid approach like our proposed method.</description>

      <title>CDS: Data Synthesis Method Guided by Cognitive Diagnosis Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated outstanding capabilities across various domains, but the increasing complexity of new challenges demands enhanced performance and adaptability. Traditional benchmarks, although comprehensive, often lack the granularity needed for detailed capability analysis. This study introduces the Cognitive Diagnostic Synthesis (CDS) method, which employs Cognitive Diagnosis Theory (CDT) for precise evaluation and targeted enhancement of LLMs. By decomposing complex tasks into discrete knowledge points, CDS accurately identifies and synthesizes data targeting model weaknesses, thereby enhancing the model's performance. This framework proposes a comprehensive pipeline driven by knowledge point evaluation, synthesis, data augmentation, and filtering, which significantly improves the model's mathematical and coding capabilities, achieving up to an 11.12% improvement in optimal scenarios.</description>

      <title>Rethinking AI Cultural Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As AI systems become more integrated into society, evaluating their capacity to align with diverse cultural values is crucial for their responsible deployment. Current evaluation methods predominantly rely on multiple-choice question (MCQ) datasets. In this study, we demonstrate that MCQs are insufficient for capturing the complexity of cultural values expressed in open-ended scenarios. Our findings highlight significant discrepancies between MCQ-based assessments and the values conveyed in unconstrained interactions. Based on these findings, we recommend moving beyond MCQs to adopt more open-ended, context-specific assessments that better reflect how AI models engage with cultural values in realistic settings.</description>

      <title>Visual Language Models as Operator Agents in the Space Domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the application of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) as operator agents in the space domain, focusing on both software and hardware operational paradigms. Building on advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) and their multimodal extensions, we investigate how VLMs can enhance autonomous control and decision-making in space missions. In the software context, we employ VLMs within the Kerbal Space Program Differential Games (KSPDG) simulation environment, enabling the agent to interpret visual screenshots of the graphical user interface to perform complex orbital maneuvers. In the hardware context, we integrate VLMs with robotic systems equipped with cameras to inspect and diagnose physical space objects, such as satellites. Our results demonstrate that VLMs can effectively process visual and textual data to generate contextually appropriate actions, competing with traditional methods and non-multimodal LLMs in simulation tasks, and showing promise in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>A Low-cost and Ultra-lightweight Binary Neural Network for Traffic Signal Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The deployment of neural networks in vehicle platforms and wearable Artificial Intelligence-of-Things (AIOT) scenarios has become a research area that has attracted much attention. With the continuous evolution of deep learning technology, many image classification models are committed to improving recognition accuracy, but this is often accompanied by problems such as large model resource usage, complex structure, and high power consumption, which makes it challenging to deploy on resource-constrained platforms. Herein, we propose an ultra-lightweight binary neural network (BNN) model designed for hardware deployment, and conduct image classification research based on the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) dataset. In addition, we also verify it on the Chinese Traffic Sign (CTS) and Belgian Traffic Sign (BTS) datasets. The proposed model shows excellent recognition performance with an accuracy of up to 97.64%, making it one of the best performing BNN models in the GTSRB dataset. Compared with the full-precision model, the accuracy loss is controlled within 1%, and the parameter storage overhead of the model is only 10% of that of the full-precision model. More importantly, our network model only relies on logical operations and low-bit width fixed-point addition and subtraction operations during the inference phase, which greatly simplifies the design complexity of the processing element (PE). Our research shows the great potential of BNN in the hardware deployment of computer vision models, especially in the field of computer vision tasks related to autonomous driving.</description>

      <title>Agent-Centric Projection of Prompting Techniques and Implications for Synthetic Training Data for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in prompting techniques and multi-agent systems for Large Language Models (LLMs) have produced increasingly complex approaches. However, we lack a framework for characterizing and comparing prompting techniques or understanding their relationship to multi-agent LLM systems. This position paper introduces and explains the concepts of linear contexts (a single, continuous sequence of interactions) and non-linear contexts (branching or multi-path) in LLM systems. These concepts enable the development of an agent-centric projection of prompting techniques, a framework that can reveal deep connections between prompting strategies and multi-agent systems. We propose three conjectures based on this framework: (1) results from non-linear prompting techniques can predict outcomes in equivalent multi-agent systems, (2) multi-agent system architectures can be replicated through single-LLM prompting techniques that simulate equivalent interaction patterns, and (3) these equivalences suggest novel approaches for generating synthetic training data. We argue that this perspective enables systematic cross-pollination of research findings between prompting and multi-agent domains, while providing new directions for improving both the design and training of future LLM systems.</description>

      <title>Flow: A Modular Approach to Automated Agentic Workflow Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-agent frameworks powered by large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated great success in automated planning and task execution. However, the effective adjustment of Agentic workflows during execution has not been well-studied. A effective workflow adjustment is crucial, as in many real-world scenarios, the initial plan must adjust to unforeseen challenges and changing conditions in real-time to ensure the efficient execution of complex tasks. In this paper, we define workflows as an activity-on-vertex (AOV) graphs. We continuously refine the workflow by dynamically adjusting task allocations based on historical performance and previous AOV with LLM agents. To further enhance system performance, we emphasize modularity in workflow design based on measuring parallelism and dependence complexity. Our proposed multi-agent framework achieved efficient sub-task concurrent execution, goal achievement, and error tolerance. Empirical results across different practical tasks demonstrate dramatic improvements in the efficiency of multi-agent frameworks through dynamic workflow updating and modularization.</description>

      <title>A Driver Advisory System Based on Large Language Model for High-speed Train</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid development of China high-speed railway, drivers face increasingly significant technical challenges during operations, such as fault handling. Currently, drivers depend on the onboard mechanic when facing technical issues, for instance, traction loss or sensor faults. This dependency can hinder effective operation, even lead to accidents, while waiting for faults to be addressed. To enhance the accuracy and explainability of actions during fault handling, an Intelligent Driver Advisory System (IDAS) framework based on a large language model (LLM) named IDAS-LLM, is introduced. Initially, domain-fine-tuning of the LLM is performed using a constructed railway knowledge question-and-answer dataset to improve answer accuracy in railway-related questions. Subsequently, integration of the Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) architecture is pursued for system design to enhance the explainability of generated responses. Comparative experiments are conducted using the constructed railway driving knowledge assessment dataset. Results indicate that domain-fine-tuned LLMs show an improvement in answer accuracy by an average of 10%, outperforming some current mainstream LLMs. Additionally, the inclusion of the RAG framework increases the average recall rate of question-and-answer sessions by about 4%. Finally, the fault handling capability of IDAS-LLM is demonstrated through simulations of real operational scenarios, proving that the proposed framework has practical application prospects.</description>

      <title>Anytime Cooperative Implicit Hitting Set Solving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Implicit Hitting Set (HS) approach has shown to be very effective for MaxSAT, Pseudo-boolean optimization and other boolean frameworks. Very recently, it has also shown its potential in the very similar Weighted CSP framework by means of the so-called cost-function merging. The original formulation of the HS approach focuses on obtaining increasingly better lower bounds (HS-lb). However, and as shown for Pseudo-Boolean Optimization, this approach can also be adapted to compute increasingly better upper bounds (HS-ub). In this paper we consider both HS approaches and show how they can be easily combined in a multithread architecture where cores discovered by either component are available by the other which, interestingly, generates synergy between them. We show that the resulting algorithm (HS-lub) is consistently superior to either HS-lb and HS-ub in isolation. Most importantly, HS-lub has an effective anytime behaviour with which the optimality gap is reduced during the execution. We tested our approach on the Weighted CSP framework and show on three different benchmarks that our very simple implementation sometimes outperforms the parallel hybrid best-first search implementation of the far more developed state-of-the-art Toulbar2.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic Memory Networks (LMNs): Efficient Long-Range Sequence Modeling for Resource-Constrained Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-range sequence modeling is a crucial aspect of natural language processing and time series analysis. However, traditional models like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Transformers suffer from computational and memory inefficiencies, especially when dealing with long sequences. This paper introduces Logarithmic Memory Networks (LMNs), a novel architecture that leverages a hierarchical logarithmic tree structure to efficiently store and retrieve past information. LMNs dynamically summarize historical context, significantly reducing the memory footprint and computational complexity of attention mechanisms from O(n2) to O(log(n)). The model employs a single-vector, targeted attention mechanism to access stored information, and the memory block construction worker (summarizer) layer operates in two modes: a parallel execution mode during training for efficient processing of hierarchical tree structures and a sequential execution mode during inference, which acts as a memory management system. It also implicitly encodes positional information, eliminating the need for explicit positional encodings. These features make LMNs a robust and scalable solution for processing long-range sequences in resource-constrained environments, offering practical improvements in efficiency and scalability.

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article presents a complete process to extract hypernym relationships in the field of construction using two main steps: terminology extraction and detection of hypernyms from these terms. We first describe the corpus analysis method to extract terminology from a collection of technical specifications in the field of construction. Using statistics and word n-grams analysis, we extract the domain's terminology and then perform pruning steps with linguistic patterns and internet queries to improve the quality of the final terminology. Second, we present a machine-learning approach based on various words embedding models and combinations to deal with the detection of hypernyms from the extracted terminology. Extracted terminology is evaluated using a manual evaluation carried out by 6 experts in the domain, and the hypernym identification method is evaluated with different datasets. The global approach provides relevant and promising results.</description>

      <title>Governing AI Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The field of AI is undergoing a fundamental transition from systems that can produce synthetic content upon request to autonomous agents that can plan and execute complex tasks with only limited human involvement. Companies that pioneered the development of generative AI tools are now building AI agents that can be instructed to independently navigate the internet, perform a wide range of online tasks, and serve as artificial personal assistants and virtual coworkers. The opportunities presented by this new technology are tremendous, as are the associated risks. Fortunately, there exist robust analytic frameworks for confronting many of these challenges, namely, the economic theory of principal-agent problems and the common law doctrine of agency relationships. Drawing on these frameworks, this Article makes three contributions. First, it uses agency law and theory to identify and characterize problems arising from AI agents, including issues of information asymmetry, discretionary authority, and loyalty. Second, it illustrates the limitations of conventional solutions to agency problems: incentive design, monitoring, and enforcement might not be effective for governing AI agents that make uninterpretable decisions and operate at unprecedented speed and scale. Third, the Article explores the implications of agency law and theory for designing and regulating AI agents, arguing that new technical and legal infrastructure is needed to support governance principles of inclusivity, visibility, and liability.</description>

      <title>Large Language Model Interface for Home Energy Management Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Home Energy Management Systems (HEMSs) help households tailor their electricity usage based on power system signals such as energy prices. This technology helps to reduce energy bills and offers greater demand-side flexibility that supports the power system stability. However, residents who lack a technical background may find it difficult to use HEMSs effectively, because HEMSs require well-formatted parameterization that reflects the characteristics of the energy resources, houses, and users' needs. Recently, Large-Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated an outstanding ability in language understanding. Motivated by this, we propose an LLM-based interface that interacts with users to understand and parameterize their ``badly-formatted answers'', and then outputs well-formatted parameters to implement an HEMS. We further use Reason and Act method (ReAct) and few-shot prompting to enhance the LLM performance. Evaluating the interface performance requires multiple user--LLM interactions. To avoid the efforts in finding volunteer users and reduce the evaluation time, we additionally propose a method that uses another LLM to simulate users with varying expertise, ranging from knowledgeable to non-technical. By comprehensive evaluation, the proposed LLM-based HEMS interface achieves an average parameter retrieval accuracy of 88\%, outperforming benchmark models without ReAct and/or few-shot prompting.</description>

      <title>Exploring Aviation Incident Narratives Using Topic Modeling and Clustering Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aviation safety is a global concern, requiring detailed investigations into incidents to understand contributing factors comprehensively. This study uses the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) dataset. It applies advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques, including Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (pLSA), and K-means clustering. The main objectives are identifying latent themes, exploring semantic relationships, assessing probabilistic connections, and cluster incidents based on shared characteristics. This research contributes to aviation safety by providing insights into incident narratives and demonstrating the versatility of NLP and topic modelling techniques in extracting valuable information from complex datasets. The results, including topics identified from various techniques, provide an understanding of recurring themes. Comparative analysis reveals that LDA performed best with a coherence value of 0.597, pLSA of 0.583, LSA of 0.542, and NMF of 0.437. K-means clustering further reveals commonalities and unique insights into incident narratives. In conclusion, this study uncovers latent patterns and thematic structures within incident narratives, offering a comparative analysis of multiple-topic modelling techniques. Future research avenues include exploring temporal patterns, incorporating additional datasets, and developing predictive models for early identification of safety issues. This research lays the groundwork for enhancing the understanding and improvement of aviation safety by utilising the wealth of information embedded in incident narratives.</description>

      <title>An Adaptive Orthogonal Convolution Scheme for Efficient and Flexible CNN Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Orthogonal convolutional layers are the workhorse of multiple areas in machine learning, such as adversarial robustness, normalizing flows, GANs, and Lipschitzconstrained models. Their ability to preserve norms and ensure stable gradient propagation makes them valuable for a large range of problems. Despite their promise, the deployment of orthogonal convolution in large-scale applications is a significant challenge due to computational overhead and limited support for modern features like strides, dilations, group convolutions, and transposed convolutions.In this paper, we introduce AOC (Adaptative Orthogonal Convolution), a scalable method for constructing orthogonal convolutions, effectively overcoming these limitations. This advancement unlocks the construction of architectures that were previously considered impractical. We demonstrate through our experiments that our method produces expressive models that become increasingly efficient as they scale. To foster further advancement, we provide an open-source library implementing this method, available at https://github.com/thib-s/orthogonium.</description>

      <title>Advice for Diabetes Self-Management by ChatGPT Models: Challenges and Recommendations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given their ability for advanced reasoning, extensive contextual understanding, and robust question-answering abilities, large language models have become prominent in healthcare management research. Despite adeptly handling a broad spectrum of healthcare inquiries, these models face significant challenges in delivering accurate and practical advice for chronic conditions such as diabetes. We evaluate the responses of ChatGPT versions 3.5 and 4 to diabetes patient queries, assessing their depth of medical knowledge and their capacity to deliver personalized, context-specific advice for diabetes self-management. Our findings reveal discrepancies in accuracy and embedded biases, emphasizing the models' limitations in providing tailored advice unless activated by sophisticated prompting techniques. Additionally, we observe that both models often provide advice without seeking necessary clarification, a practice that can result in potentially dangerous advice. This underscores the limited practical effectiveness of these models without human oversight in clinical settings. To address these issues, we propose a commonsense evaluation layer for prompt evaluation and incorporating disease-specific external memory using an advanced Retrieval Augmented Generation technique. This approach aims to improve information quality and reduce misinformation risks, contributing to more reliable AI applications in healthcare settings. Our findings seek to influence the future direction of AI in healthcare, enhancing both the scope and quality of its integration.</description>

      <title>Self-Instruct Few-Shot Jailbreaking: Decompose the Attack into Pattern and Behavior Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, several works have been conducted on jailbreaking Large Language Models (LLMs) with few-shot malicious demos. In particular, Zheng et al. (2024) focuses on improving the efficiency of Few-Shot Jailbreaking (FSJ) by injecting special tokens into the demos and employing demo-level random search. Nevertheless, this method lacks generality since it specifies the instruction-response structure. Moreover, the reason why inserting special tokens takes effect in inducing harmful behaviors is only empirically discussed. In this paper, we take a deeper insight into the mechanism of special token injection and propose Self-Instruct Few-Shot Jailbreaking (Self-Instruct-FSJ) facilitated with the demo-level greedy search. This framework decomposes the FSJ attack into pattern and behavior learning to exploit the model's vulnerabilities in a more generalized and efficient way. We conduct elaborate experiments to evaluate our method on common open-source models and compare it with baseline algorithms. Our code is available at https://github.com/iphosi/Self-Instruct-FSJ.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive Metapath-based Heterogeneous Graph Transformer for Gene-Disease Association Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discovering gene-disease associations is crucial for understanding disease mechanisms, yet identifying these associations remains challenging due to the time and cost of biological experiments. Computational methods are increasingly vital for efficient and scalable gene-disease association prediction. Graph-based learning models, which leverage node features and network relationships, are commonly employed for biomolecular predictions. However, existing methods often struggle to effectively integrate node features, heterogeneous structures, and semantic information. To address these challenges, we propose COmprehensive MEtapath-based heterogeneous graph Transformer(COMET) for predicting gene-disease associations. COMET integrates diverse datasets to construct comprehensive heterogeneous networks, initializing node features with BioGPT. We define seven Metapaths and utilize a transformer framework to aggregate Metapath instances, capturing global contexts and long-distance dependencies. Through intra- and inter-metapath aggregation using attention mechanisms, COMET fuses latent vectors from multiple Metapaths to enhance GDA prediction accuracy. Our method demonstrates superior robustness compared to state-of-the-art approaches. Ablation studies and visualizations validate COMET's effectiveness, providing valuable insights for advancing human health research.</description>

      <title>LLM-Ehnanced Holonic Architecture for Ad-Hoc Scalable SoS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As modern system of systems (SoS) become increasingly adaptive and human centred, traditional architectures often struggle to support interoperability, reconfigurability, and effective human system interaction. This paper addresses these challenges by advancing the state of the art holonic architecture for SoS, offering two main contributions to support these adaptive needs. First, we propose a layered architecture for holons, which includes reasoning, communication, and capabilities layers. This design facilitates seamless interoperability among heterogeneous constituent systems by improving data exchange and integration. Second, inspired by principles of intelligent manufacturing, we introduce specialised holons namely, supervisor, planner, task, and resource holons aimed at enhancing the adaptability and reconfigurability of SoS. These specialised holons utilise large language models within their reasoning layers to support decision making and ensure real time adaptability. We demonstrate our approach through a 3D mobility case study focused on smart city transportation, showcasing its potential for managing complex, multimodal SoS environments. Additionally, we propose evaluation methods to assess the architecture efficiency and scalability,laying the groundwork for future empirical validations through simulations and real world implementations.</description>

      <title>GDiffRetro: Retrosynthesis Prediction with Dual Graph Enhanced Molecular Representation and Diffusion Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrosynthesis prediction focuses on identifying reactants capable of synthesizing a target product. Typically, the retrosynthesis prediction involves two phases: Reaction Center Identification and Reactant Generation. However, we argue that most existing methods suffer from two limitations in the two phases: (i) Existing models do not adequately capture the ``face'' information in molecular graphs for the reaction center identification. (ii) Current approaches for the reactant generation predominantly use sequence generation in a 2D space, which lacks versatility in generating reasonable distributions for completed reactive groups and overlooks molecules' inherent 3D properties. To overcome the above limitations, we propose GDiffRetro. For the reaction center identification, GDiffRetro uniquely integrates the original graph with its corresponding dual graph to represent molecular structures, which helps guide the model to focus more on the faces in the graph. For the reactant generation, GDiffRetro employs a conditional diffusion model in 3D to further transform the obtained synthon into a complete reactant. Our experimental findings reveal that GDiffRetro outperforms state-of-the-art semi-template models across various evaluative metrics.</description>

      <title>Cooperative Patrol Routing: Optimizing Urban Crime Surveillance through Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effective design of patrol strategies is a difficult and complex problem, especially in medium and large areas. The objective is to plan, in a coordinated manner, the optimal routes for a set of patrols in a given area, in order to achieve maximum coverage of the area, while also trying to minimize the number of patrols. In this paper, we propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) model, based on a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process, to plan unpredictable patrol routes within an urban environment represented as an undirected graph. The model attempts to maximize a target function that characterizes the environment within a given time frame. Our model has been tested to optimize police patrol routes in three medium-sized districts of the city of Malaga. The aim was to maximize surveillance coverage of the most crime-prone areas, based on actual crime data in the city. To address this problem, several MARL algorithms have been studied, and among these the Value Decomposition Proximal Policy Optimization (VDPPO) algorithm exhibited the best performance. We also introduce a novel metric, the coverage index, for the evaluation of the coverage performance of the routes generated by our model. This metric is inspired by the predictive accuracy index (PAI), which is commonly used in criminology to detect hotspots. Using this metric, we have evaluated the model under various scenarios in which the number of agents (or patrols), their starting positions, and the level of information they can observe in the environment have been modified. Results show that the coordinated routes generated by our model achieve a coverage of more than $90\%$ of the $3\%$ of graph nodes with the highest crime incidence, and $65\%$ for $20\%$ of these nodes; $3\%$ and $20\%$ represent the coverage standards for police resource allocation.</description>

      <title>Self-Attentive Spatio-Temporal Calibration for Precise Intermediate Layer Matching in ANN-to-SNN Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are promising for low-power computation due to their event-driven mechanism but often suffer from lower accuracy compared to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). ANN-to-SNN knowledge distillation can improve SNN performance, but previous methods either focus solely on label information, missing valuable intermediate layer features, or use a layer-wise approach that neglects spatial and temporal semantic inconsistencies, leading to performance degradation.To address these limitations, we propose a novel method called self-attentive spatio-temporal calibration (SASTC). SASTC uses self-attention to identify semantically aligned layer pairs between ANN and SNN, both spatially and temporally. This enables the autonomous transfer of relevant semantic information. Extensive experiments show that SASTC outperforms existing methods, effectively solving the mismatching problem. Superior accuracy results include 95.12% on CIFAR-10, 79.40% on CIFAR-100 with 2 time steps, and 68.69% on ImageNet with 4 time steps for static datasets, and 97.92% on DVS-Gesture and 83.60% on DVS-CIFAR10 for neuromorphic datasets. This marks the first time SNNs have outperformed ANNs on both CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, shedding the new light on the potential applications of SNNs.</description>

      <title>A Roadmap to Guide the Integration of LLMs in Hierarchical Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) are fostering their integration into several reasoning-related fields, including Automated Planning (AP). However, their integration into Hierarchical Planning (HP), a subfield of AP that leverages hierarchical knowledge to enhance planning performance, remains largely unexplored. In this preliminary work, we propose a roadmap to address this gap and harness the potential of LLMs for HP. To this end, we present a taxonomy of integration methods, exploring how LLMs can be utilized within the HP life cycle. Additionally, we provide a benchmark with a standardized dataset for evaluating the performance of future LLM-based HP approaches, and present initial results for a state-of-the-art HP planner and LLM planner. As expected, the latter exhibits limited performance (3\% correct plans, and none with a correct hierarchical decomposition) but serves as a valuable baseline for future approaches.</description>

      <title>Artificial Liver Classifier: A New Alternative to Conventional Machine Learning Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supervised machine learning classifiers often encounter challenges related to performance, accuracy, and overfitting. This paper introduces the Artificial Liver Classifier (ALC), a novel supervised learning classifier inspired by the human liver's detoxification function. The ALC is characterized by its simplicity, speed, hyperparameters-free, ability to reduce overfitting, and effectiveness in addressing multi-classification problems through straightforward mathematical operations. To optimize the ALC's parameters, an improved FOX optimization algorithm (IFOX) is employed as the training method. The proposed ALC was evaluated on five benchmark machine learning datasets: Iris Flower, Breast Cancer Wisconsin, Wine, Voice Gender, and MNIST. The results demonstrated competitive performance, with the ALC achieving 100% accuracy on the Iris dataset, surpassing logistic regression, multilayer perceptron, and support vector machine. Similarly, on the Breast Cancer dataset, it achieved 99.12% accuracy, outperforming XGBoost and logistic regression. Across all datasets, the ALC consistently exhibited lower overfitting gaps and loss compared to conventional classifiers. These findings highlight the potential of leveraging biological process simulations to develop efficient machine learning models and open new avenues for innovation in the field.</description>

      <title>NOMTO: Neural Operator-based symbolic Model approximaTion and discOvery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While many physical and engineering processes are most effectively described by non-linear symbolic models, existing non-linear symbolic regression (SR) methods are restricted to a limited set of continuous algebraic functions, thereby limiting their applicability to discover higher order non-linear differential relations. In this work, we introduce the Neural Operator-based symbolic Model approximaTion and discOvery (NOMTO) method, a novel approach to symbolic model discovery that leverages Neural Operators to encompass a broad range of symbolic operations. We demonstrate that NOMTO can successfully identify symbolic expressions containing elementary functions with singularities, special functions, and derivatives. Additionally, our experiments demonstrate that NOMTO can accurately rediscover second-order non-linear partial differential equations. By broadening the set of symbolic operations available for discovery, NOMTO significantly advances the capabilities of existing SR methods. It provides a powerful and flexible tool for model discovery, capable of capturing complex relations in a variety of physical systems.</description>

      <title>In-situ graph reasoning and knowledge expansion using Graph-PReFLexOR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pursuit of automated scientific discovery has fueled progress from symbolic logic to modern AI, forging new frontiers in reasoning and pattern recognition. Transformers function as potential systems, where every possible relationship remains latent potentiality until tasks impose constraints, akin to measurement. Yet, refining their sampling requires more than probabilistic selection: solutions must conform to specific structures or rules, ensuring consistency and the invocation of general principles. We present Graph-PReFLexOR (Graph-based Preference-based Recursive Language Modeling for Exploratory Optimization of Reasoning), a framework that combines graph reasoning with symbolic abstraction to dynamically expand domain knowledge. Inspired by reinforcement learning, Graph-PReFLexOR defines reasoning as a structured mapping, where tasks yield knowledge graphs, abstract patterns, and ultimately, final answers. Inspired by category theory, it encodes concepts as nodes and their relationships as edges, supporting hierarchical inference and adaptive learning through isomorphic representations. Demonstrations include hypothesis generation, materials design, and creative reasoning, such as discovering relationships between mythological concepts like 'thin places' with materials science. We propose a 'knowledge garden growth' strategy that integrates insights across domains, promoting interdisciplinary connections. Results with a 3-billion-parameter Graph-PReFLexOR model show superior reasoning depth and adaptability, underscoring the potential for transparent, multidisciplinary AI-driven discovery. It lays the groundwork for general autonomous reasoning solutions.</description>

      <title>Multiple-Input Variational Auto-Encoder for Anomaly Detection in Heterogeneous Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anomaly detection (AD) plays a pivotal role in AI applications, e.g., in classification, and intrusion/threat detection in cybersecurity. However, most existing methods face challenges of heterogeneity amongst feature subsets posed by non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data. We propose a novel neural network model called Multiple-Input Auto-Encoder for AD (MIAEAD) to address this. MIAEAD assigns an anomaly score to each feature subset of a data sample to indicate its likelihood of being an anomaly. This is done by using the reconstruction error of its sub-encoder as the anomaly score. All sub-encoders are then simultaneously trained using unsupervised learning to determine the anomaly scores of feature subsets. The final AUC of MIAEAD is calculated for each sub-dataset, and the maximum AUC obtained among the sub-datasets is selected. To leverage the modelling of the distribution of normal data to identify anomalies of the generative models, we develop a novel neural network architecture/model called Multiple-Input Variational Auto-Encoder (MIVAE). MIVAE can process feature subsets through its sub-encoders before learning distribution of normal data in the latent space. This allows MIVAE to identify anomalies that deviate from the learned distribution. We theoretically prove that the difference in the average anomaly score between normal samples and anomalies obtained by the proposed MIVAE is greater than that of the Variational Auto-Encoder (VAEAD), resulting in a higher AUC for MIVAE. Extensive experiments on eight real-world anomaly datasets demonstrate the superior performance of MIAEAD and MIVAE over conventional methods and the state-of-the-art unsupervised models, by up to 6% in terms of AUC score. Alternatively, MIAEAD and MIVAE have a high AUC when applied to feature subsets with low heterogeneity based on the coefficient of variation (CV) score.</description>

      <title>LeapVAD: A Leap in Autonomous Driving via Cognitive Perception and Dual-Process Thinking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While autonomous driving technology has made remarkable strides, data-driven approaches still struggle with complex scenarios due to their limited reasoning capabilities. Meanwhile, knowledge-driven autonomous driving systems have evolved considerably with the popularization of visual language models. In this paper, we propose LeapVAD, a novel method based on cognitive perception and dual-process thinking. Our approach implements a human-attentional mechanism to identify and focus on critical traffic elements that influence driving decisions. By characterizing these objects through comprehensive attributes - including appearance, motion patterns, and associated risks - LeapVAD achieves more effective environmental representation and streamlines the decision-making process. Furthermore, LeapVAD incorporates an innovative dual-process decision-making module miming the human-driving learning process. The system consists of an Analytic Process (System-II) that accumulates driving experience through logical reasoning and a Heuristic Process (System-I) that refines this knowledge via fine-tuning and few-shot learning. LeapVAD also includes reflective mechanisms and a growing memory bank, enabling it to learn from past mistakes and continuously improve its performance in a closed-loop environment. To enhance efficiency, we develop a scene encoder network that generates compact scene representations for rapid retrieval of relevant driving experiences. Extensive evaluations conducted on two leading autonomous driving simulators, CARLA and DriveArena, demonstrate that LeapVAD achieves superior performance compared to camera-only approaches despite limited training data. Comprehensive ablation studies further emphasize its effectiveness in continuous learning and domain adaptation. Project page: https://pjlab-adg.github.io/LeapVAD/.</description>

      <title>CG-MER: A Card Game-based Multimodal dataset for Emotion Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The field of affective computing has seen significant advancements in exploring the relationship between emotions and emerging technologies. This paper presents a novel and valuable contribution to this field with the introduction of a comprehensive French multimodal dataset designed specifically for emotion recognition. The dataset encompasses three primary modalities: facial expressions, speech, and gestures, providing a holistic perspective on emotions. Moreover, the dataset has the potential to incorporate additional modalities, such as Natural Language Processing (NLP) to expand the scope of emotion recognition research. The dataset was curated through engaging participants in card game sessions, where they were prompted to express a range of emotions while responding to diverse questions. The study included 10 sessions with 20 participants (9 females and 11 males). The dataset serves as a valuable resource for furthering research in emotion recognition and provides an avenue for exploring the intricate connections between human emotions and digital technologies.</description>

      <title>PRESERVE: Prefetching Model Weights and KV-Cache in Distributed LLM Serving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are widely used across various applications, but their substantial computational requirements pose significant challenges, particularly in terms of HBM bandwidth bottlenecks and inter-device communication overhead. In this paper, we present PRESERVE, a novel prefetching framework designed to optimize LLM inference by overlapping memory reads for model weights and KV-cache with collective communication operations. Through extensive experiments conducted on commercial AI accelerators, we demonstrate up to 1.6x end-to-end speedup on state-of-the-art, open-source LLMs. Additionally, we perform a design space exploration that identifies the optimal hardware configuration for the proposed method, showing a further 1.25x improvement in performance per cost by selecting the optimal L2 cache size. Our results show that PRESERVE has the potential to mitigate the memory bottlenecks and communication overheads, offering a solution to improve the performance and scalability of the LLM inference systems.</description>

      <title>Optimization of Link Configuration for Satellite Communication Using Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Satellite communication is a key technology in our modern connected world. With increasingly complex hardware, one challenge is to efficiently configure links (connections) on a satellite transponder. Planning an optimal link configuration is extremely complex and depends on many parameters and metrics. The optimal use of the limited resources, bandwidth and power of the transponder is crucial. Such an optimization problem can be approximated using metaheuristic methods such as simulated annealing, but recent research results also show that reinforcement learning can achieve comparable or even better performance in optimization methods. However, there have not yet been any studies on link configuration on satellite transponders. In order to close this research gap, a transponder environment was developed as part of this work. For this environment, the performance of the reinforcement learning algorithm PPO was compared with the metaheuristic simulated annealing in two experiments. The results show that Simulated Annealing delivers better results for this static problem than the PPO algorithm, however, the research in turn also underlines the potential of reinforcement learning for optimization problems.</description>

      <title>ADAM-1: AI and Bioinformatics for Alzheimer's Detection and Microbiome-Clinical Data Integrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Alzheimer's Disease Analysis Model Generation 1 (ADAM) is a multi-agent large language model (LLM) framework designed to integrate and analyze multi-modal data, including microbiome profiles, clinical datasets, and external knowledge bases, to enhance the understanding and detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD). By leveraging retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques along with its multi-agent architecture, ADAM-1 synthesizes insights from diverse data sources and contextualizes findings using literature-driven evidence. Comparative evaluation against XGBoost revealed similar mean F1 scores but significantly reduced variance for ADAM-1, highlighting its robustness and consistency, particularly in small laboratory datasets. While currently tailored for binary classification tasks, future iterations aim to incorporate additional data modalities, such as neuroimaging and biomarkers, to broaden the scalability and applicability for Alzheimer's research and diagnostics.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Framework for Reinsurance Optimization: Integrating Generative Models and Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinsurance optimization is critical for insurers to manage risk exposure, ensure financial stability, and maintain solvency. Traditional approaches often struggle with dynamic claim distributions, high-dimensional constraints, and evolving market conditions. This paper introduces a novel hybrid framework that integrates {Generative Models}, specifically Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), with {Reinforcement Learning (RL)} using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). The framework enables dynamic and scalable optimization of reinsurance strategies by combining the generative modeling of complex claim distributions with the adaptive decision-making capabilities of reinforcement learning.
  The VAE component generates synthetic claims, including rare and catastrophic events, addressing data scarcity and variability, while the PPO algorithm dynamically adjusts reinsurance parameters to maximize surplus and minimize ruin probability. The framework's performance is validated through extensive experiments, including out-of-sample testing, stress-testing scenarios (e.g., pandemic impacts, catastrophic events), and scalability analysis across portfolio sizes. Results demonstrate its superior adaptability, scalability, and robustness compared to traditional optimization techniques, achieving higher final surpluses and computational efficiency.
  Key contributions include the development of a hybrid approach for high-dimensional optimization, dynamic reinsurance parameterization, and validation against stochastic claim distributions. The proposed framework offers a transformative solution for modern reinsurance challenges, with potential applications in multi-line insurance operations, catastrophe modeling, and risk-sharing strategy design.</description>

      <title>Multi-task Domain Adaptation for Computation Offloading in Edge-intelligence Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the field of multi-access edge computing (MEC), efficient computation offloading is crucial for improving resource utilization and reducing latency in dynamically changing environments. This paper introduces a new approach, termed as Multi-Task Domain Adaptation (MTDA), aiming to enhance the ability of computational offloading models to generalize in the presence of domain shifts, i.e., when new data in the target environment significantly differs from the data in the source domain. The proposed MTDA model incorporates a teacher-student architecture that allows continuous adaptation without necessitating access to the source domain data during inference, thereby maintaining privacy and reducing computational overhead. Utilizing a multi-task learning framework that simultaneously manages offloading decisions and resource allocation, the proposed MTDA approach outperforms benchmark methods regarding mean squared error and accuracy, particularly in environments with increasing numbers of users. It is observed by means of computer simulation that the proposed MTDA model maintains high performance across various scenarios, demonstrating its potential for practical deployment in emerging MEC applications.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Decision-Making for Digital Twin in Additive Manufacturing with Model Predictive Control using Time-Series Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Digital Twin-a virtual replica of a physical system enabling real-time monitoring, model updating, prediction, and decision-making-combined with recent advances in machine learning (ML), offers new opportunities for proactive control strategies in autonomous manufacturing. However, achieving real-time decision-making with Digital Twins requires efficient optimization driven by accurate predictions of highly nonlinear manufacturing systems. This paper presents a simultaneous multi-step Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework for real-time decision-making, using a multi-variate deep neural network (DNN), named Time-Series Dense Encoder (TiDE), as the surrogate model. Different from the models in conventional MPC which only provide one-step ahead prediction, TiDE is capable of predicting future states within the prediction horizon in one shot (multi-step), significantly accelerating MPC. Using Directed Energy Deposition additive manufacturing as a case study, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MPC in achieving melt pool temperature tracking to ensure part quality, while reducing porosity defects by regulating laser power to maintain melt pool depth constraints. In this work, we first show that TiDE is capable of accurately predicting melt pool temperature and depth. Second, we demonstrate that the proposed MPC achieves precise temperature tracking while satisfying melt pool depth constraints within a targeted dilution range (10%-30%), reducing potential porosity defects. Compared to the PID controller, MPC results in smoother and less fluctuating laser power profiles with competitive or superior melt pool temperature control performance. This demonstrates MPC's proactive control capabilities, leveraging time-series prediction and real-time optimization, positioning it as a powerful tool for future Digital Twin applications and real-time process optimization in manufacturing.</description>

      <title>BlobGEN-Vid: Compositional Text-to-Video Generation with Blob Video Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing video generation models struggle to follow complex text prompts and synthesize multiple objects, raising the need for additional grounding input for improved controllability. In this work, we propose to decompose videos into visual primitives - blob video representation, a general representation for controllable video generation. Based on blob conditions, we develop a blob-grounded video diffusion model named BlobGEN-Vid that allows users to control object motions and fine-grained object appearance. In particular, we introduce a masked 3D attention module that effectively improves regional consistency across frames. In addition, we introduce a learnable module to interpolate text embeddings so that users can control semantics in specific frames and obtain smooth object transitions. We show that our framework is model-agnostic and build BlobGEN-Vid based on both U-Net and DiT-based video diffusion models. Extensive experimental results show that BlobGEN-Vid achieves superior zero-shot video generation ability and state-of-the-art layout controllability on multiple benchmarks. When combined with an LLM for layout planning, our framework even outperforms proprietary text-to-video generators in terms of compositional accuracy.</description>

      <title>Performance Optimization of Ratings-Based Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores multiple optimization methods to improve the performance of rating-based reinforcement learning (RbRL). RbRL, a method based on the idea of human ratings, has been developed to infer reward functions in reward-free environments for the subsequent policy learning via standard reinforcement learning, which requires the availability of reward functions. Specifically, RbRL minimizes the cross entropy loss that quantifies the differences between human ratings and estimated ratings derived from the inferred reward. Hence, a low loss means a high degree of consistency between human ratings and estimated ratings. Despite its simple form, RbRL has various hyperparameters and can be sensitive to various factors. Therefore, it is critical to provide comprehensive experiments to understand the impact of various hyperparameters on the performance of RbRL. This paper is a work in progress, providing users some general guidelines on how to select hyperparameters in RbRL.</description>

      <title>Impatient Bandits: Optimizing for the Long-Term Without Delay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Increasingly, recommender systems are tasked with improving users' long-term satisfaction. In this context, we study a content exploration task, which we formalize as a bandit problem with delayed rewards. There is an apparent trade-off in choosing the learning signal: waiting for the full reward to become available might take several weeks, slowing the rate of learning, whereas using short-term proxy rewards reflects the actual long-term goal only imperfectly. First, we develop a predictive model of delayed rewards that incorporates all information obtained to date. Rewards as well as shorter-term surrogate outcomes are combined through a Bayesian filter to obtain a probabilistic belief. Second, we devise a bandit algorithm that quickly learns to identify content aligned with long-term success using this new predictive model. We prove a regret bound for our algorithm that depends on the \textit{Value of Progressive Feedback}, an information theoretic metric that captures the quality of short-term leading indicators that are observed prior to the long-term reward. We apply our approach to a podcast recommendation problem, where we seek to recommend shows that users engage with repeatedly over two months. We empirically validate that our approach significantly outperforms methods that optimize for short-term proxies or rely solely on delayed rewards, as demonstrated by an A/B test in a recommendation system that serves hundreds of millions of users.</description>

      <title>PSReg: Prior-guided Sparse Mixture of Experts for Point Cloud Registration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discriminative feature is crucial for point cloud registration. Recent methods improve the feature discriminative by distinguishing between non-overlapping and overlapping region points. However, they still face challenges in distinguishing the ambiguous structures in the overlapping regions. Therefore, the ambiguous features they extracted resulted in a significant number of outlier matches from overlapping regions. To solve this problem, we propose a prior-guided SMoE-based registration method to improve the feature distinctiveness by dispatching the potential correspondences to the same experts. Specifically, we propose a prior-guided SMoE module by fusing prior overlap and potential correspondence embeddings for routing, assigning tokens to the most suitable experts for processing. In addition, we propose a registration framework by a specific combination of Transformer layer and prior-guided SMoE module. The proposed method not only pays attention to the importance of locating the overlapping areas of point clouds, but also commits to finding more accurate correspondences in overlapping areas. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving state-of-the-art registration recall (95.7\%/79.3\%) on the 3DMatch/3DLoMatch benchmark. Moreover, we also test the performance on ModelNet40 and demonstrate excellent performance.</description>

      <title>On the Statistical Capacity of Deep Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep generative models are routinely used in generating samples from complex, high-dimensional distributions. Despite their apparent successes, their statistical properties are not well understood. A common assumption is that with enough training data and sufficiently large neural networks, deep generative model samples will have arbitrarily small errors in sampling from any continuous target distribution. We set up a unifying framework that debunks this belief. We demonstrate that broad classes of deep generative models, including variational autoencoders and generative adversarial networks, are not universal generators. Under the predominant case of Gaussian latent variables, these models can only generate concentrated samples that exhibit light tails. Using tools from concentration of measure and convex geometry, we give analogous results for more general log-concave and strongly log-concave latent variable distributions. We extend our results to diffusion models via a reduction argument. We use the Gromov--Levy inequality to give similar guarantees when the latent variables lie on manifolds with positive Ricci curvature. These results shed light on the limited capacity of common deep generative models to handle heavy tails. We illustrate the empirical relevance of our work with simulations and financial data.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning for Disease Outbreak Prediction: A Robust Early Warning Signal for Transcritical Bifurcations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Early Warning Signals (EWSs) are vital for implementing preventive measures before a disease turns into a pandemic. While new diseases exhibit unique behaviors, they often share fundamental characteristics from a dynamical systems perspective. Moreover, measurements during disease outbreaks are often corrupted by different noise sources, posing challenges for Time Series Classification (TSC) tasks. In this study, we address the problem of having a robust EWS for disease outbreak prediction using a best-performing deep learning model in the domain of TSC. We employed two simulated datasets to train the model: one representing generated dynamical systems with randomly selected polynomial terms to model new disease behaviors, and another simulating noise-induced disease dynamics to account for noisy measurements. The model's performance was analyzed using both simulated data from different disease models and real-world data, including influenza and COVID-19. Results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms previous models, effectively providing EWSs of impending outbreaks across various scenarios. This study bridges advancements in deep learning with the ability to provide robust early warning signals in noisy environments, making it highly applicable to real-world crises involving emerging disease outbreaks.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models for Knowledge Graph Embedding Techniques, Methods, and Challenges: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07766</link>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have attracted a lot of attention in various fields due to their superior performance, aiming to train hundreds of millions or more parameters on large amounts of text data to understand and generate natural language. As the superior performance of LLMs becomes apparent, they are increasingly being applied to knowledge graph embedding (KGE) related tasks to improve the processing results. As a deep learning model in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), it learns a large amount of textual data to predict the next word or generate content related to a given text. However, LLMs have recently been invoked to varying degrees in different types of KGE related scenarios such as multi-modal KGE and open KGE according to their task characteristics. In this paper, we investigate a wide range of approaches for performing LLMs-related tasks in different types of KGE scenarios. To better compare the various approaches, we summarize each KGE scenario in a classification. In addition to the categorization methods, we provide a tabular overview of the methods and their source code links for a more direct comparison. In the article we also discuss the applications in which the methods are mainly used and suggest several forward-looking directions for the development of this new research area.</description>

      <title>Transforming Indoor Localization: Advanced Transformer Architecture for NLOS Dominated Wireless Environments with Distributed Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07774v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Indoor localization in challenging non-line-of-sight (NLOS) environments often leads to mediocre accuracy with traditional approaches. Deep learning (DL) has been applied to tackle these challenges; however, many DL approaches overlook computational complexity, especially for floating-point operations (FLOPs), making them unsuitable for resource-limited devices. Transformer-based models have achieved remarkable success in natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV) tasks, motivating their use in wireless applications. However, their use in indoor localization remains nascent, and directly applying Transformers for indoor localization can be both computationally intensive and exhibit limitations in accuracy. To address these challenges, in this work, we introduce a novel tokenization approach, referred to as Sensor Snapshot Tokenization (SST), which preserves variable-specific representations of power delay profile (PDP) and enhances attention mechanisms by effectively capturing multi-variate correlation. Complementing this, we propose a lightweight Swish-Gated Linear Unit-based Transformer (L-SwiGLU Transformer) model, designed to reduce computational complexity without compromising localization accuracy. Together, these contributions mitigate the computational burden and dependency on large datasets, making Transformer models more efficient and suitable for resource-constrained scenarios. The proposed tokenization method enables the Vanilla Transformer to achieve a 90th percentile positioning error of 0.388 m in a highly NLOS indoor factory, surpassing conventional tokenization methods. The L-SwiGLU ViT further reduces the error to 0.355 m, achieving an 8.51% improvement. Additionally, the proposed model outperforms a 14.1 times larger model with a 46.13% improvement, underscoring its computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>BioPose: Biomechanically-accurate 3D Pose Estimation from Monocular Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in 3D human pose estimation from single-camera images and videos have relied on parametric models, like SMPL. However, these models oversimplify anatomical structures, limiting their accuracy in capturing true joint locations and movements, which reduces their applicability in biomechanics, healthcare, and robotics. Biomechanically accurate pose estimation, on the other hand, typically requires costly marker-based motion capture systems and optimization techniques in specialized labs. To bridge this gap, we propose BioPose, a novel learning-based framework for predicting biomechanically accurate 3D human pose directly from monocular videos. BioPose includes three key components: a Multi-Query Human Mesh Recovery model (MQ-HMR), a Neural Inverse Kinematics (NeurIK) model, and a 2D-informed pose refinement technique. MQ-HMR leverages a multi-query deformable transformer to extract multi-scale fine-grained image features, enabling precise human mesh recovery. NeurIK treats the mesh vertices as virtual markers, applying a spatial-temporal network to regress biomechanically accurate 3D poses under anatomical constraints. To further improve 3D pose estimations, a 2D-informed refinement step optimizes the query tokens during inference by aligning the 3D structure with 2D pose observations. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that BioPose significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

      <title>A Comparative Analysis of DNN-based White-Box Explainable AI Methods in Network Security</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: New research focuses on creating artificial intelligence (AI) solutions for network intrusion detection systems (NIDS), drawing its inspiration from the ever-growing number of intrusions on networked systems, increasing its complexity and intelligibility. Hence, the use of explainable AI (XAI) techniques in real-world intrusion detection systems comes from the requirement to comprehend and elucidate black-box AI models to security analysts. In an effort to meet such requirements, this paper focuses on applying and evaluating White-Box XAI techniques (particularly LRP, IG, and DeepLift) for NIDS via an end-to-end framework for neural network models, using three widely used network intrusion datasets (NSL-KDD, CICIDS-2017, and RoEduNet-SIMARGL2021), assessing its global and local scopes, and examining six distinct assessment measures (descriptive accuracy, sparsity, stability, robustness, efficiency, and completeness). We also compare the performance of white-box XAI methods with black-box XAI methods. The results show that using White-box XAI techniques scores high in robustness and completeness, which are crucial metrics for IDS. Moreover, the source codes for the programs developed for our XAI evaluation framework are available to be improved and used by the research community.</description>

      <title>Conformal mapping Coordinates Physics-Informed Neural Networks (CoCo-PINNs): learning neural networks for designing neutral inclusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We focus on designing and solving the neutral inclusion problem via neural networks. The neutral inclusion problem has a long history in the theory of composite materials, and it is exceedingly challenging to identify the precise condition that precipitates a general-shaped inclusion into a neutral inclusion. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have recently become a highly successful approach to addressing both forward and inverse problems associated with partial differential equations. We found that traditional PINNs perform inadequately when applied to the inverse problem of designing neutral inclusions with arbitrary shapes. In this study, we introduce a novel approach, Conformal mapping Coordinates Physics-Informed Neural Networks (CoCo-PINNs), which integrates complex analysis techniques into PINNs. This method exhibits strong performance in solving forward-inverse problems to construct neutral inclusions of arbitrary shapes in two dimensions, where the imperfect interface condition on the inclusion's boundary is modeled by training neural networks. Notably, we mathematically prove that training with a single linear field is sufficient to achieve neutrality for untrained linear fields in arbitrary directions, given a minor assumption. We demonstrate that CoCo-PINNs offer enhanced performances in terms of credibility, consistency, and stability.</description>

      <title>Talk to Right Specialists: Routing and Planning in Multi-agent System for Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Leveraging large language models (LLMs), an agent can utilize retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques to integrate external knowledge and increase the reliability of its responses. Current RAG-based agents integrate single, domain-specific knowledge sources, limiting their ability and leading to hallucinated or inaccurate responses when addressing cross-domain queries. Integrating multiple knowledge bases into a unified RAG-based agent raises significant challenges, including increased retrieval overhead and data sovereignty when sensitive data is involved. In this work, we propose RopMura, a novel multi-agent system that addresses these limitations by incorporating highly efficient routing and planning mechanisms. RopMura features two key components: a router that intelligently selects the most relevant agents based on knowledge boundaries and a planner that decomposes complex multi-hop queries into manageable steps, allowing for coordinating cross-domain responses. Experimental results demonstrate that RopMura effectively handles both single-hop and multi-hop queries, with the routing mechanism enabling precise answers for single-hop queries and the combined routing and planning mechanisms achieving accurate, multi-step resolutions for complex queries.</description>

      <title>STTS-EAD: Improving Spatio-Temporal Learning Based Time Series Prediction via</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Handling anomalies is a critical preprocessing step in multivariate time series prediction. However, existing approaches that separate anomaly preprocessing from model training for multivariate time series prediction encounter significant limitations. Specifically, these methods fail to utilize auxiliary information crucial for identifying latent anomalies associated with spatiotemporal factors during the preprocessing stage. Instead, they rely solely on data distribution for anomaly detection, which can result in the incorrect processing of numerous samples that could otherwise contribute positively to model training. To address this, we propose STTS-EAD, an end-to-end method that seamlessly integrates anomaly detection into the training process of multivariate time series forecasting and aims to improve Spatio-Temporal learning based Time Series prediction via Embedded Anomaly Detection. Our proposed STTS-EAD leverages spatio-temporal information for forecasting and anomaly detection, with the two parts alternately executed and optimized for each other. To the best of our knowledge, STTS-EAD is the first to integrate anomaly detection and forecasting tasks in the training phase for improving the accuracy of multivariate time series forecasting. Extensive experiments on a public stock dataset and two real-world sales datasets from a renowned coffee chain enterprise show that our proposed method can effectively process detected anomalies in the training stage to improve forecasting performance in the inference stage and significantly outperform baselines.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Encoder Frozen-Decoder Approach for Fine-Tuning Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Among parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods, freezing has emerged as a popular strategy for speeding up training, reducing catastrophic forgetting, and improving downstream performance. We investigate the impact of freezing the decoder in a multi-task setup comprising diverse natural language tasks, aiming to reduce deployment overhead and enhance portability to novel tasks. Our experiments, conducted by fine-tuning both individual and multi-task setups on the AlexaTM model, reveal that freezing decoders is highly effective for tasks with natural language outputs and mitigates catastrophic forgetting in multilingual tasks. However, we find that pairing frozen decoders with a larger model can effectively maintain or even enhance performance in structured and QA tasks, making it a viable strategy for a broader range of task types.</description>

      <title>Real-time Verification and Refinement of Language Model Text Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance across a wide range of natural language tasks. However, a critical challenge remains in that they sometimes generate factually incorrect answers. To address this, while many previous work has focused on identifying errors in their generation and further refining them, they are slow in deployment since they are designed to verify the response from LLMs only after their entire generation (from the first to last tokens) is done. Further, we observe that once LLMs generate incorrect tokens early on, there is a higher likelihood that subsequent tokens will also be factually incorrect. To this end, in this work, we propose Streaming-VR (Streaming Verification and Refinement), a novel approach designed to enhance the efficiency of verification and refinement of LLM outputs. Specifically, the proposed Streaming-VR enables on-the-fly verification and correction of tokens as they are being generated, similar to a streaming process, ensuring that each subset of tokens is checked and refined in real-time by another LLM as the LLM constructs its response. Through comprehensive evaluations on multiple datasets, we demonstrate that our approach not only enhances the factual accuracy of LLMs, but also offers a more efficient solution compared to prior refinement methods.</description>

Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly transformed global lifestyles, enforcing physical isolation and accelerating digital adoption for work, education, and social interaction. This study examines the pandemic's impact on mental health by analyzing dream content shared on the Reddit r/Dreams community. With over 374,000 subscribers, this platform offers a rich dataset for exploring subconscious responses to the pandemic. Using statistical methods, we assess shifts in dream positivity, negativity, and neutrality from the pre-pandemic to post-pandemic era. To enhance our analysis, we fine-tuned the LLaMA 3.1-8B model with labeled data, enabling precise sentiment classification of dream content. Our findings aim to uncover patterns in dream content, providing insights into the psychological effects of the pandemic and its influence on subconscious processes. This research highlights the profound changes in mental landscapes and the role of dreams as indicators of public well-being during unprecedented times.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Provider Bias in Large Language Models for Code Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as the new recommendation engines, outperforming traditional methods in both capability and scope, particularly in code generation applications. Our research reveals a novel provider bias in LLMs, namely without explicit input prompts, these models show systematic preferences for services from specific providers in their recommendations (e.g., favoring Google Cloud over Microsoft Azure). This bias holds significant implications for market dynamics and societal equilibrium, potentially promoting digital monopolies. It may also deceive users and violate their expectations, leading to various consequences. This paper presents the first comprehensive empirical study of provider bias in LLM code generation. We develop a systematic methodology encompassing an automated pipeline for dataset generation, incorporating 6 distinct coding task categories and 30 real-world application scenarios. Our analysis encompasses over 600,000 LLM-generated responses across seven state-of-the-art models, utilizing approximately 500 million tokens (equivalent to \$5,000+ in computational costs). The study evaluates both the generated code snippets and their embedded service provider selections to quantify provider bias. Additionally, we conduct a comparative analysis of seven debiasing prompting techniques to assess their efficacy in mitigating these biases. Our findings demonstrate that LLMs exhibit significant provider preferences, predominantly favoring services from Google and Amazon, and can autonomously modify input code to incorporate their preferred providers without users' requests. Notably, we observe discrepancies between providers recommended in conversational contexts versus those implemented in generated code. The complete dataset and analysis results are available in our repository.</description>

Abstract: This study explores the fine-tuning (FT) of the Open Pre-trained Transformer (OPT-125M) for grammatical acceptability tasks using the CoLA dataset. By comparing Vanilla-Fine-Tuning (VFT), Pattern-Based-Fine-Tuning (PBFT), and Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning techniques (PEFT) like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), we demonstrate significant improvements in computational efficiency while maintaining high accuracy. Our experiments reveal that while VFT achieves the highest accuracy (81.2%), LoRA enhancing FT by reducing memory usage and iteration time by more than 50%, and increases accuracy in PBFT case. Context Distillation (CD), though computationally efficient, underperformed with accuracy around 31%. Our findings contribute to democratizing access to large language models (LLM) by reducing computational barriers.</description>

      <title>State-of-the-Art Transformer Models for Image Super-Resolution: Techniques, Challenges, and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Image Super-Resolution (SR) aims to recover a high-resolution image from its low-resolution counterpart, which has been affected by a specific degradation process. This is achieved by enhancing detail and visual quality. Recent advancements in transformer-based methods have remolded image super-resolution by enabling high-quality reconstructions surpassing previous deep-learning approaches like CNN and GAN-based. This effectively addresses the limitations of previous methods, such as limited receptive fields, poor global context capture, and challenges in high-frequency detail recovery. Additionally, the paper reviews recent trends and advancements in transformer-based SR models, exploring various innovative techniques and architectures that combine transformers with traditional networks to balance global and local contexts. These neoteric methods are critically analyzed, revealing promising yet unexplored gaps and potential directions for future research. Several visualizations of models and techniques are included to foster a holistic understanding of recent trends. This work seeks to offer a structured roadmap for researchers at the forefront of deep learning, specifically exploring the impact of transformers on super-resolution techniques.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Repository-Level Code Summarization for Business Applications Using Local LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In large-scale software development, understanding the functionality and intent behind complex codebases is critical for effective development and maintenance. While code summarization has been widely studied, existing methods primarily focus on smaller code units, such as functions, and struggle with larger code artifacts like files and packages. Additionally, current summarization models tend to emphasize low-level implementation details, often overlooking the domain and business context that are crucial for real-world applications. This paper proposes a two-step hierarchical approach for repository-level code summarization, tailored to business applications. First, smaller code units such as functions and variables are identified using syntax analysis and summarized with local LLMs. These summaries are then aggregated to generate higher-level file and package summaries. To ensure the summaries are grounded in business context, we design custom prompts that capture the intended purpose of code artifacts based on the domain and problem context of the business application. We evaluate our approach on a business support system (BSS) for the telecommunications domain, showing that syntax analysis-based hierarchical summarization improves coverage, while business-context grounding enhances the relevance of the generated summaries.</description>

      <title>Continual Learning with Embedding Layer Surgery and Task-wise Beam Search using Whisper</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current Multilingual ASR models only support a fraction of the world's languages. Continual Learning (CL) aims to tackle this problem by adding new languages to pre-trained models while avoiding the loss of performance on existing languages, also known as Catastrophic Forgetting (CF). However, existing CL methods overlook the adaptation of the token embedding lookup table at the decoder, despite its significant contribution to CF. We propose Embedding Layer Surgery where separate copies of the token embeddings are created for each new languages, and one of the copies is selected to replace the old languages embeddings when transcribing the corresponding new language. Unfortunately, this approach means LID errors also cause incorrect ASR embedding selection. Our Task-wise Beam Search allows self-correction for such mistakes. By adapting Whisper to 10 hours of data for each of 10 unseen languages from Common Voice, results show that our method reduces the Average WER (AWER) of pre-trained languages from 14.2% to 11.9% compared with Experience Replay, without compromising the AWER of the unseen languages.</description>

      <title>Iterative Label Refinement Matters More than Preference Optimization under Weak Supervision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Language model (LM) post-training relies on two stages of human supervision: task demonstrations for supervised finetuning (SFT), followed by preference comparisons for reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). As LMs become more capable, the tasks they are given become harder to supervise. Will post-training remain effective under unreliable supervision? To test this, we simulate unreliable demonstrations and comparison feedback using small LMs and time-constrained humans. We find that in the presence of unreliable supervision, SFT still retains some effectiveness, but DPO (a common RLHF algorithm) fails to improve the model beyond SFT. To address this, we propose iterative label refinement (ILR) as an alternative to RLHF. ILR improves the SFT data by using comparison feedback to decide whether human demonstrations should be replaced by model-generated alternatives, then retrains the model via SFT on the updated data. SFT+ILR outperforms SFT+DPO on several tasks with unreliable supervision (math, coding, and safe instruction-following). Our findings suggest that as LMs are used for complex tasks where human supervision is unreliable, RLHF may no longer be the best use of human comparison feedback; instead, it is better to direct feedback towards improving the training data rather than continually training the model. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/helloelwin/iterative-label-refinement.</description>

      <title>Tarsier2: Advancing Large Vision-Language Models from Detailed Video Description to Comprehensive Video Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Tarsier2, a state-of-the-art large vision-language model (LVLM) designed for generating detailed and accurate video descriptions, while also exhibiting superior general video understanding capabilities. Tarsier2 achieves significant advancements through three key upgrades: (1) Scaling pre-training data from 11M to 40M video-text pairs, enriching both volume and diversity; (2) Performing fine-grained temporal alignment during supervised fine-tuning; (3) Using model-based sampling to automatically construct preference data and applying DPO training for optimization. Extensive experiments show that Tarsier2-7B consistently outperforms leading proprietary models, including GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro, in detailed video description tasks. On the DREAM-1K benchmark, Tarsier2-7B improves F1 by 2.8\% over GPT-4o and 5.8\% over Gemini-1.5-Pro. In human side-by-side evaluations, Tarsier2-7B shows a +8.6\% performance advantage over GPT-4o and +24.9\% over Gemini-1.5-Pro. Tarsier2-7B also sets new state-of-the-art results across 15 public benchmarks, spanning tasks such as video question-answering, video grounding, hallucination test, and embodied question-answering, demonstrating its versatility as a robust generalist vision-language model.</description>

      <title>GRAPHMOE: Amplifying Cognitive Depth of Mixture-of-Experts Network via Introducing Self-Rethinking Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) networks benefit from utilizing multiple smaller expert models as opposed to a single large network. However, these experts typically operate independently, leaving a question open about whether interconnecting these models could enhance the performance of MoE networks. In response, we introduce GRAPHMOE, a novel method aimed at augmenting the cognitive depth of language models via a self-rethinking mechanism constructed on Pseudo GraphMoE networks. GRAPHMOE employs a recurrent routing strategy to simulate iterative thinking steps, thereby facilitating the flow of information among expert nodes. We implement the GRAPHMOE architecture using Low-Rank Adaptation techniques (LoRA) and conduct extensive experiments on various benchmark datasets. The experimental results reveal that GRAPHMOE outperforms other LoRA based models, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. Additionally, this study explores a novel recurrent routing strategy that may inspire further advancements in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of language models.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Metamemory Mechanisms for Enhanced Data-Free Code Generation in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automated code generation using large language models (LLMs) has gained attention due to its efficiency and adaptability. However, real-world coding tasks or benchmarks like HumanEval and StudentEval often lack dedicated training datasets, challenging existing few-shot prompting approaches that rely on reference examples. Inspired by human metamemory-a cognitive process involving recall and evaluation-we present a novel framework (namely M^2WF) for improving LLMs' one-time code generation. This approach enables LLMs to autonomously generate, evaluate, and utilize synthetic examples to enhance reliability and performance. Unlike prior methods, it minimizes dependency on curated data and adapts flexibly to various coding scenarios. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements in coding benchmarks, offering a scalable and robust solution for data-free environments. The code and framework will be publicly available on GitHub and HuggingFace.</description>

      <title>Optimal Classification Trees for Continuous Feature Data Using Dynamic Programming with Branch-and-Bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07903v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computing an optimal classification tree that provably maximizes training performance within a given size limit, is NP-hard, and in practice, most state-of-the-art methods do not scale beyond computing optimal trees of depth three. Therefore, most methods rely on a coarse binarization of continuous features to maintain scalability. We propose a novel algorithm that optimizes trees directly on the continuous feature data using dynamic programming with branch-and-bound. We develop new pruning techniques that eliminate many sub-optimal splits in the search when similar to previously computed splits and we provide an efficient subroutine for computing optimal depth-two trees. Our experiments demonstrate that these techniques improve runtime by one or more orders of magnitude over state-of-the-art optimal methods and improve test accuracy by 5% over greedy heuristics.</description>

      <title>Gandalf the Red: Adaptive Security for LLMs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current evaluations of defenses against prompt attacks in large language model (LLM) applications often overlook two critical factors: the dynamic nature of adversarial behavior and the usability penalties imposed on legitimate users by restrictive defenses. We propose D-SEC (Dynamic Security Utility Threat Model), which explicitly separates attackers from legitimate users, models multi-step interactions, and rigorously expresses the security-utility in an optimizable form. We further address the shortcomings in existing evaluations by introducing Gandalf, a crowd-sourced, gamified red-teaming platform designed to generate realistic, adaptive attack datasets. Using Gandalf, we collect and release a dataset of 279k prompt attacks. Complemented by benign user data, our analysis reveals the interplay between security and utility, showing that defenses integrated in the LLM (e.g., system prompts) can degrade usability even without blocking requests. We demonstrate that restricted application domains, defense-in-depth, and adaptive defenses are effective strategies for building secure and useful LLM applications.

      <title>Early prediction of the transferability of bovine embryos from videomicroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Videomicroscopy is a promising tool combined with machine learning for studying the early development of in vitro fertilized bovine embryos and assessing its transferability as soon as possible. We aim to predict the embryo transferability within four days at most, taking 2D time-lapse microscopy videos as input. We formulate this problem as a supervised binary classification problem for the classes transferable and not transferable. The challenges are three-fold: 1) poorly discriminating appearance and motion, 2) class ambiguity, 3) small amount of annotated data. We propose a 3D convolutional neural network involving three pathways, which makes it multi-scale in time and able to handle appearance and motion in different ways. For training, we retain the focal loss. Our model, named SFR, compares favorably to other methods. Experiments demonstrate its effectiveness and accuracy for our challenging biological task.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces AI Guide Dog (AIGD), a lightweight egocentric navigation assistance system for visually impaired individuals, designed for real-time deployment on smartphones. AIGD addresses key challenges in blind navigation by employing a vision-only, multi-label classification approach to predict directional commands, ensuring safe traversal across diverse environments. We propose a novel technique to enable goal-based outdoor navigation by integrating GPS signals and high-level directions, while also addressing uncertain multi-path predictions for destination-free indoor navigation. Our generalized model is the first navigation assistance system to handle both goal-oriented and exploratory navigation scenarios across indoor and outdoor settings, establishing a new state-of-the-art in blind navigation. We present methods, datasets, evaluations, and deployment insights to encourage further innovations in assistive navigation systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gaussian process (GP) is arguably one of the most widely used machine learning algorithms in practice. One of its prominent applications is Bayesian optimization (BO). Although the vanilla GP itself is already a powerful tool for BO, it is often beneficial to be able to consider the dependencies of multiple outputs. To do so, Multi-task GP (MTGP) is formulated, but it is not trivial to fully understand the derivations of its formulations and their gradients from the previous literature. This paper serves friendly derivations of the MTGP formulations and their gradients.</description>

      <title>Facial Dynamics in Video: Instruction Tuning for Improved Facial Expression Perception and Contextual Awareness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Facial expression captioning has found widespread application across various domains. Recently, the emergence of video Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has shown promise in general video understanding tasks. However, describing facial expressions within videos poses two major challenges for these models: (1) the lack of adequate datasets and benchmarks, and (2) the limited visual token capacity of video MLLMs. To address these issues, this paper introduces a new instruction-following dataset tailored for dynamic facial expression caption. The dataset comprises 5,033 high-quality video clips annotated manually, containing over 700,000 tokens. Its purpose is to improve the capability of video MLLMs to discern subtle facial nuances. Furthermore, we propose FaceTrack-MM, which leverages a limited number of tokens to encode the main character's face. This model demonstrates superior performance in tracking faces and focusing on the facial expressions of the main characters, even in intricate multi-person scenarios. Additionally, we introduce a novel evaluation metric combining event extraction, relation classification, and the longest common subsequence (LCS) algorithm to assess the content consistency and temporal sequence consistency of generated text. Moreover, we present FEC-Bench, a benchmark designed to assess the performance of existing video MLLMs in this specific task. All data and source code will be made publicly available.</description>

      <title>GAC-Net_Geometric and attention-based Network for Depth Completion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Depth completion is a key task in autonomous driving, aiming to complete sparse LiDAR depth measurements into high-quality dense depth maps through image guidance. However, existing methods usually treat depth maps as an additional channel of color images, or directly perform convolution on sparse data, failing to fully exploit the 3D geometric information in depth maps, especially with limited performance in complex boundaries and sparse areas. To address these issues, this paper proposes a depth completion network combining channel attention mechanism and 3D global feature perception (CGA-Net). The main innovations include: 1) Utilizing PointNet++ to extract global 3D geometric features from sparse depth maps, enhancing the scene perception ability of low-line LiDAR data; 2) Designing a channel-attention-based multimodal feature fusion module to efficiently integrate sparse depth, RGB images, and 3D geometric features; 3) Combining residual learning with CSPN++ to optimize the depth refinement stage, further improving the completion quality in edge areas and complex scenes. Experiments on the KITTI depth completion dataset show that CGA-Net can significantly improve the prediction accuracy of dense depth maps, achieving a new state-of-the-art (SOTA), and demonstrating strong robustness to sparse and complex scenes.</description>

      <title>Training Hybrid Neural Networks with Multimode Optical Nonlinearities Using Digital Twins</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability to train ever-larger neural networks brings artificial intelligence to the forefront of scientific and technical discoveries. However, their exponentially increasing size creates a proportionally greater demand for energy and computational hardware. Incorporating complex physical events in networks as fixed, efficient computation modules can address this demand by decreasing the complexity of trainable layers. Here, we utilize ultrashort pulse propagation in multimode fibers, which perform large-scale nonlinear transformations, for this purpose. Training the hybrid architecture is achieved through a neural model that differentiably approximates the optical system. The training algorithm updates the neural simulator and backpropagates the error signal over this proxy to optimize layers preceding the optical one. Our experimental results achieve state-of-the-art image classification accuracies and simulation fidelity. Moreover, the framework demonstrates exceptional resilience to experimental drifts. By integrating low-energy physical systems into neural networks, this approach enables scalable, energy-efficient AI models with significantly reduced computational demands.</description>

      <title>Maximizing Uncertainty for Federated learning via Bayesian Optimisation-based Model Poisoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As we transition from Narrow Artificial Intelligence towards Artificial Super Intelligence, users are increasingly concerned about their privacy and the trustworthiness of machine learning (ML) technology. A common denominator for the metrics of trustworthiness is the quantification of uncertainty inherent in DL algorithms, and specifically in the model parameters, input data, and model predictions. One of the common approaches to address privacy-related issues in DL is to adopt distributed learning such as federated learning (FL), where private raw data is not shared among users. Despite the privacy-preserving mechanisms in FL, it still faces challenges in trustworthiness. Specifically, the malicious users, during training, can systematically create malicious model parameters to compromise the models predictive and generative capabilities, resulting in high uncertainty about their reliability. To demonstrate malicious behaviour, we propose a novel model poisoning attack method named Delphi which aims to maximise the uncertainty of the global model output. We achieve this by taking advantage of the relationship between the uncertainty and the model parameters of the first hidden layer of the local model. Delphi employs two types of optimisation , Bayesian Optimisation and Least Squares Trust Region, to search for the optimal poisoned model parameters, named as Delphi-BO and Delphi-LSTR. We quantify the uncertainty using the KL Divergence to minimise the distance of the predictive probability distribution towards an uncertain distribution of model output. Furthermore, we establish a mathematical proof for the attack effectiveness demonstrated in FL. Numerical results demonstrate that Delphi-BO induces a higher amount of uncertainty than Delphi-LSTR highlighting vulnerability of FL systems to model poisoning attacks.</description>

      <title>DisCoPatch: Batch Statistics Are All You Need For OOD Detection, But Only If You Can Trust Them</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection holds significant importance across many applications. While semantic and domain-shift OOD problems are well-studied, this work focuses on covariate shifts - subtle variations in the data distribution that can degrade machine learning performance. We hypothesize that detecting these subtle shifts can improve our understanding of in-distribution boundaries, ultimately improving OOD detection. In adversarial discriminators trained with Batch Normalization (BN), real and adversarial samples form distinct domains with unique batch statistics - a property we exploit for OOD detection. We introduce DisCoPatch, an unsupervised Adversarial Variational Autoencoder (VAE) framework that harnesses this mechanism. During inference, batches consist of patches from the same image, ensuring a consistent data distribution that allows the model to rely on batch statistics. DisCoPatch uses the VAE's suboptimal outputs (generated and reconstructed) as negative samples to train the discriminator, thereby improving its ability to delineate the boundary between in-distribution samples and covariate shifts. By tightening this boundary, DisCoPatch achieves state-of-the-art results in public OOD detection benchmarks. The proposed model not only excels in detecting covariate shifts, achieving 95.5% AUROC on ImageNet-1K(-C) but also outperforms all prior methods on public Near-OOD (95.0%) benchmarks. With a compact model size of 25MB, it achieves high OOD detection performance at notably lower latency than existing methods, making it an efficient and practical solution for real-world OOD detection applications. The code will be made publicly available</description>

      <title>TriAdaptLoRA: Brain-Inspired Triangular Adaptive Low-Rank Adaptation for Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08008v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fine-tuning of Large Language Models (LLMs) is pivotal for achieving optimal performance across diverse downstream tasks. However, while full fine-tuning delivers superior results, it entails significant computational and resource costs. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, such as LoRA, address these challenges by reducing the number of trainable parameters, but they often struggle with rank adjustment efficiency and task-specific adaptability. We propose Triangular Adaptive Low-Rank Adaptation (TriAdaptLoRA), a novel PEFT framework inspired by neuroscience principles, which dynamically optimizes the allocation of trainable parameters. TriAdaptLoRA introduces three key innovations: 1) a triangular split of transformation matrices into lower and upper triangular components to maximize parameter utilization, 2) a parameter importance metric based on normalized Frobenius norms for efficient adaptation, and 3) an adaptive rank-growth strategy governed by dynamic thresholds, allowing flexible parameter allocation across training steps. Experiments conducted on a variety of natural language understanding and generation tasks demonstrate that TriAdaptLoRA consistently outperforms existing PEFT methods. It achieves superior performance, enhanced stability, and reduced computational overhead, particularly under linear threshold-driven rank growth. These results highlight its efficacy as a scalable and resource-efficient solution for fine-tuning LLMs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this tutorial, we explore Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), an essential framework for unsupervised learning, particularly suited for high-dimensional datasets such as neuroimaging. By integrating deep learning with Bayesian inference, VAEs enable the generation of interpretable latent representations. This tutorial outlines the theoretical foundations of VAEs, addresses practical challenges such as convergence issues and over-fitting, and discusses strategies like the reparameterization trick and hyperparameter optimization. We also highlight key applications of VAEs in neuroimaging, demonstrating their potential to uncover meaningful patterns, including those associated with neurodegenerative processes, and their broader implications for analyzing complex brain data.</description>

      <title>An AI-driven framework for rapid and localized optimizations of urban open spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As urbanization accelerates, open spaces are increasingly recognized for their role in enhancing sustainability and well-being, yet they remain underexplored compared to built spaces. This study introduces an AI-driven framework that integrates machine learning models (MLMs) and explainable AI techniques to optimize Sky View Factor (SVF) and visibility, key spatial metrics influencing thermal comfort and perceived safety in urban spaces. Unlike global optimization methods, which are computationally intensive and impractical for localized adjustments, this framework supports incremental design improvements with lower computational costs and greater flexibility. The framework employs SHapley Adaptive Explanations (SHAP) to analyze feature importance and Counterfactual Explanations (CFXs) to propose minimal design changes. Simulations tested five MLMs, identifying XGBoost as the most accurate, with building width, park area, and heights of surrounding buildings as critical for SVF, and distances from southern buildings as key for visibility. Compared to Genetic Algorithms, which required approximately 15/30 minutes across 3/4 generations to converge, the tested CFX approach achieved optimized results in 1 minute with a 5% RMSE error, demonstrating significantly faster performance and suitability for scalable retrofitting strategies. This interpretable and computationally efficient framework advances urban performance optimization, providing data-driven insights and practical retrofitting solutions for enhancing usability and environmental quality across diverse urban contexts.</description>

      <title>READ: Reinforcement-based Adversarial Learning for Text Classification with Limited Labeled Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pre-trained transformer models such as BERT have shown massive gains across many text classification tasks. However, these models usually need enormous labeled data to achieve impressive performances. Obtaining labeled data is often expensive and time-consuming, whereas collecting unlabeled data using some heuristics is relatively much cheaper for any task. Therefore, this paper proposes a method that encapsulates reinforcement learning-based text generation and semi-supervised adversarial learning approaches in a novel way to improve the model's performance. Our method READ, Reinforcement-based Adversarial learning, utilizes an unlabeled dataset to generate diverse synthetic text through reinforcement learning, improving the model's generalization capability using adversarial learning. Our experimental results show that READ outperforms the existing state-of-art methods on multiple datasets.</description>

      <title>Exploring visual language models as a powerful tool in the diagnosis of Ewing Sarcoma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ewing's sarcoma (ES), characterized by a high density of small round blue cells without structural organization, presents a significant health concern, particularly among adolescents aged 10 to 19. Artificial intelligence-based systems for automated analysis of histopathological images are promising to contribute to an accurate diagnosis of ES. In this context, this study explores the feature extraction ability of different pre-training strategies for distinguishing ES from other soft tissue or bone sarcomas with similar morphology in digitized tissue microarrays for the first time, as far as we know. Vision-language supervision (VLS) is compared to fully-supervised ImageNet pre-training within a multiple instance learning paradigm. Our findings indicate a substantial improvement in diagnostic accuracy with the adaption of VLS using an in-domain dataset. Notably, these models not only enhance the accuracy of predicted classes but also drastically reduce the number of trainable parameters and computational costs.</description>

      <title>Building Symbiotic AI: Reviewing the AI Act for a Human-Centred, Principle-Based Framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) spreads quickly as new technologies and services take over modern society. The need to regulate AI design, development, and use is strictly necessary to avoid unethical and potentially dangerous consequences to humans. The European Union (EU) has released a new legal framework, the AI Act, to regulate AI by undertaking a risk-based approach to safeguard humans during interaction. At the same time, researchers offer a new perspective on AI systems, commonly known as Human-Centred AI (HCAI), highlighting the need for a human-centred approach to their design. In this context, Symbiotic AI (a subtype of HCAI) promises to enhance human capabilities through a deeper and continuous collaboration between human intelligence and AI. This article presents the results of a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) that aims to identify principles that characterise the design and development of Symbiotic AI systems while considering humans as the core of the process. Through content analysis, four principles emerged from the review that must be applied to create Human-Centred AI systems that can establish a symbiotic relationship with humans. In addition, current trends and challenges were defined to indicate open questions that may guide future research for the development of SAI systems that comply with the AI Act.</description>

      <title>Exploring Narrative Clustering in Large Language Models: A Layerwise Analysis of BERT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the internal mechanisms of BERT, a transformer-based large language model, with a focus on its ability to cluster narrative content and authorial style across its layers. Using a dataset of narratives developed via GPT-4, featuring diverse semantic content and stylistic variations, we analyze BERT's layerwise activations to uncover patterns of localized neural processing. Through dimensionality reduction techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Multidimensional Scaling (MDS), we reveal that BERT exhibits strong clustering based on narrative content in its later layers, with progressively compact and distinct clusters. While strong stylistic clustering might occur when narratives are rephrased into different text types (e.g., fables, sci-fi, kids' stories), minimal clustering is observed for authorial style specific to individual writers. These findings highlight BERT's prioritization of semantic content over stylistic features, offering insights into its representational capabilities and processing hierarchy. This study contributes to understanding how transformer models like BERT encode linguistic information, paving the way for future interdisciplinary research in artificial intelligence and cognitive neuroscience.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Speech Multi-View Feature Fusion through Conditional Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements have highlighted the efficacy of self-supervised learning (SSL) features in various speech-related tasks, providing lightweight and versatile multi-view speech representations. However, our study reveals that while SSL features expedite model convergence, they conflict with traditional spectral features like FBanks in terms of update directions. In response, we propose a novel generalized feature fusion framework grounded in conditional computation, featuring a gradient-sensitive gating network and a multi-stage dropout strategy. This framework mitigates feature conflicts and bolsters model robustness to multi-view input features. By integrating SSL and spectral features, our approach accelerates convergence and maintains performance on par with spectral models across multiple speech translation tasks on the MUSTC dataset.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Autoscaling for Large Language Model Serving with Chiron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language model (LLM) serving is becoming an increasingly important workload for cloud providers. Based on performance SLO requirements, LLM inference requests can be divided into (a) interactive requests that have tight SLOs in the order of seconds, and (b) batch requests that have relaxed SLO in the order of minutes to hours. These SLOs can degrade based on the arrival rates, multiplexing, and configuration parameters, thus necessitating the use of resource autoscaling on serving instances and their batch sizes. However, previous autoscalers for LLM serving do not consider request SLOs leading to unnecessary scaling and resource under-utilization. To address these limitations, we introduce Chiron, an autoscaler that uses the idea of hierarchical backpressure estimated using queue size, utilization, and SLOs. Our experiments show that Chiron achieves up to 90% higher SLO attainment and improves GPU efficiency by up to 70% compared to existing solutions.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Action Based Reinforcement Learning for Multi-Objective Compatible Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown excellent performance in solving decision-making and control problems of autonomous driving, which is increasingly applied in diverse driving scenarios. However, driving is a multi-attribute problem, leading to challenges in achieving multi-objective compatibility for current RL methods, especially in both policy execution and policy iteration. On the one hand, the common action space structure with single action type limits driving flexibility or results in large behavior fluctuations during policy execution. On the other hand, the multi-attribute weighted single reward function result in the agent's disproportionate attention to certain objectives during policy iterations. To this end, we propose a Multi-objective Ensemble-Critic reinforcement learning method with Hybrid Parametrized Action for multi-objective compatible autonomous driving. Specifically, a parameterized action space is constructed to generate hybrid driving actions, combining both abstract guidance and concrete control commands. A multi-objective critics architecture is constructed considering multiple attribute rewards, to ensure simultaneously focusing on different driving objectives. Additionally, uncertainty-based exploration strategy is introduced to help the agent faster approach viable driving policy. The experimental results in both the simulated traffic environment and the HighD dataset demonstrate that our method can achieve multi-objective compatible autonomous driving in terms of driving efficiency, action consistency, and safety. It enhances the general performance of the driving while significantly increasing training efficiency.</description>

      <title>Guiding the classification of hepatocellular carcinoma on 3D CT-scans using deep and handcrafted radiological features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hepatocellular carcinoma is the most spread primary liver cancer across the world ($\sim$80\% of the liver tumors). The gold standard for HCC diagnosis is liver biopsy. However, in the clinical routine, expert radiologists provide a visual diagnosis by interpreting hepatic CT-scans according to a standardized protocol, the LI-RADS, which uses five radiological criteria with an associated decision tree. In this paper, we propose an automatic approach to predict histology-proven HCC from CT images in order to reduce radiologists' inter-variability. We first show that standard deep learning methods fail to accurately predict HCC from CT-scans on a challenging database, and propose a two-step approach inspired by the LI-RADS system to improve the performance. We achieve improvements from 6 to 18 points of AUC with respect to deep learning baselines trained with different architectures. We also provide clinical validation of our method, achieving results that outperform non-expert radiologists and are on par with expert ones.</description>

      <title>Consistency of Responses and Continuations Generated by Large Language Models on Social Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities in text generation, yet their emotional consistency and semantic coherence in social media contexts remain insufficiently understood. This study investigates how LLMs handle emotional content and maintain semantic relationships through continuation and response tasks using two open-source models: Gemma and Llama. By analyzing climate change discussions from Twitter and Reddit, we examine emotional transitions, intensity patterns, and semantic similarity between human-authored and LLM-generated content. Our findings reveal that while both models maintain high semantic coherence, they exhibit distinct emotional patterns: Gemma shows a tendency toward negative emotion amplification, particularly anger, while maintaining certain positive emotions like optimism. Llama demonstrates superior emotional preservation across a broader spectrum of affects. Both models systematically generate responses with attenuated emotional intensity compared to human-authored content and show a bias toward positive emotions in response tasks. Additionally, both models maintain strong semantic similarity with original texts, though performance varies between continuation and response tasks. These findings provide insights into LLMs' emotional and semantic processing capabilities, with implications for their deployment in social media contexts and human-AI interaction design.</description>

      <title>Data-driven inventory management for new products: A warm-start and adjusted Dyna-$Q$ approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel reinforcement learning algorithm for inventory management of newly launched products with no or limited historical demand information. The algorithm follows the classic Dyna-$Q$ structure, balancing the model-based and model-free approaches, while accelerating the training process of Dyna-$Q$ and mitigating the model discrepancy generated by the model-based feedback. Warm-start information from the demand data of existing similar products can be incorporated into the algorithm to further stabilize the early-stage training and reduce the variance of the estimated optimal policy. Our approach is validated through a case study of bakery inventory management with real data. The adjusted Dyna-$Q$ shows up to a 23.7\% reduction in average daily cost compared with $Q$-learning, and up to a 77.5\% reduction in training time within the same horizon compared with classic Dyna-$Q$. By incorporating the warm-start information, it can be found that the adjusted Dyna-$Q$ has the lowest total cost, lowest variance in total cost, and relatively low shortage percentages among all the algorithms under a 30-day testing.</description>

      <title>An Empirical Wall-Pressure Spectrum Model for Aeroacoustic Predictions Based on Symbolic Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fast-turn around methods to predict airfoil trailing-edge noise are crucial for incorporating noise limitations into design optimization loops of several applications. Among these aeroacoustic predictive models, Amiet's theory offers the best balance between accuracy and simplicity. The accuracy of the model relies heavily on precise wall-pressure spectrum predictions, which are often based on single-equation formulations with adjustable parameters. These parameters are calibrated for particular airfoils and flow conditions and consequently tend to fail when applied outside their calibration range. This paper introduces a new wall-pressure spectrum empirical model designed to enhance the robustness and accuracy of current state-of-the-art predictions while widening the range of applicability of the model to different airfoils and flow conditions. The model is developed using AI-based symbolic regression via a genetic-algorithm-based approach, and applied to a dataset of wall-pressure fluctuations measured on NACA 0008 and NACA 63018 airfoils at multiple angles of attack and inflow velocities, covering turbulent boundary layers with both adverse and favorable pressure gradients. Validation against experimental data (outside the training dataset) demonstrates the robustness of the model compared to well-accepted semi-empirical models. Finally, the model is integrated with Amiet's theory to predict the aeroacoustic noise of a full-scale wind turbine, showing good agreement with experimental measurements.</description>

      <title>EEG-ReMinD: Enhancing Neurodegenerative EEG Decoding through Self-Supervised State Reconstruction-Primed Riemannian Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of EEG decoding algorithms confronts challenges such as data sparsity, subject variability, and the need for precise annotations, all of which are vital for advancing brain-computer interfaces and enhancing the diagnosis of diseases. To address these issues, we propose a novel two-stage approach named Self-Supervised State Reconstruction-Primed Riemannian Dynamics (EEG-ReMinD) , which mitigates reliance on supervised learning and integrates inherent geometric features. This approach efficiently handles EEG data corruptions and reduces the dependency on labels. EEG-ReMinD utilizes self-supervised and geometric learning techniques, along with an attention mechanism, to analyze the temporal dynamics of EEG features within the framework of Riemannian geometry, referred to as Riemannian dynamics. Comparative analyses on both intact and corrupted datasets from two different neurodegenerative disorders underscore the enhanced performance of EEG-ReMinD.</description>

      <title>Refusal Behavior in Large Language Models: A Nonlinear Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Refusal behavior in large language models (LLMs) enables them to decline responding to harmful, unethical, or inappropriate prompts, ensuring alignment with ethical standards. This paper investigates refusal behavior across six LLMs from three architectural families. We challenge the assumption of refusal as a linear phenomenon by employing dimensionality reduction techniques, including PCA, t-SNE, and UMAP. Our results reveal that refusal mechanisms exhibit nonlinear, multidimensional characteristics that vary by model architecture and layer. These findings highlight the need for nonlinear interpretability to improve alignment research and inform safer AI deployment strategies.</description>

      <title>FairTTTS: A Tree Test Time Simulation Method for Fairness-Aware Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Algorithmic decision-making has become deeply ingrained in many domains, yet biases in machine learning models can still produce discriminatory outcomes, often harming unprivileged groups. Achieving fair classification is inherently challenging, requiring a careful balance between predictive performance and ethical considerations. We present FairTTTS, a novel post-processing bias mitigation method inspired by the Tree Test Time Simulation (TTTS) method. Originally developed to enhance accuracy and robustness against adversarial inputs through probabilistic decision-path adjustments, TTTS serves as the foundation for FairTTTS. By building on this accuracy-enhancing technique, FairTTTS mitigates bias and improves predictive performance. FairTTTS uses a distance-based heuristic to adjust decisions at protected attribute nodes, ensuring fairness for unprivileged samples. This fairness-oriented adjustment occurs as a post-processing step, allowing FairTTTS to be applied to pre-trained models, diverse datasets, and various fairness metrics without retraining. Extensive evaluation on seven benchmark datasets shows that FairTTTS outperforms traditional methods in fairness improvement, achieving a 20.96% average increase over the baseline compared to 18.78% for related work, and further enhances accuracy by 0.55%. In contrast, competing methods typically reduce accuracy by 0.42%. These results confirm that FairTTTS effectively promotes more equitable decision-making while simultaneously improving predictive performance.</description>

      <title>I Can Find You in Seconds! Leveraging Large Language Models for Code Authorship Attribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Source code authorship attribution is important in software forensics, plagiarism detection, and protecting software patch integrity. Existing techniques often rely on supervised machine learning, which struggles with generalization across different programming languages and coding styles due to the need for large labeled datasets. Inspired by recent advances in natural language authorship analysis using large language models (LLMs), which have shown exceptional performance without task-specific tuning, this paper explores the use of LLMs for source code authorship attribution.
  We present a comprehensive study demonstrating that state-of-the-art LLMs can successfully attribute source code authorship across different languages. LLMs can determine whether two code snippets are written by the same author with zero-shot prompting, achieving a Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 0.78, and can attribute code authorship from a small set of reference code snippets via few-shot learning, achieving MCC of 0.77. Additionally, LLMs show some adversarial robustness against misattribution attacks.
  Despite these capabilities, we found that naive prompting of LLMs does not scale well with a large number of authors due to input token limitations. To address this, we propose a tournament-style approach for large-scale attribution. Evaluating this approach on datasets of C++ (500 authors, 26,355 samples) and Java (686 authors, 55,267 samples) code from GitHub, we achieve classification accuracy of up to 65% for C++ and 68.7% for Java using only one reference per author. These results open new possibilities for applying LLMs to code authorship attribution in cybersecurity and software engineering.</description>

      <title>Potential and Perils of Large Language Models as Judges of Unstructured Textual Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rapid advancements in large language models have unlocked remarkable capabilities when it comes to processing and summarizing unstructured text data. This has implications for the analysis of rich, open-ended datasets, such as survey responses, where LLMs hold the promise of efficiently distilling key themes and sentiments. However, as organizations increasingly turn to these powerful AI systems to make sense of textual feedback, a critical question arises, can we trust LLMs to accurately represent the perspectives contained within these text based datasets? While LLMs excel at generating human-like summaries, there is a risk that their outputs may inadvertently diverge from the true substance of the original responses. Discrepancies between the LLM-generated outputs and the actual themes present in the data could lead to flawed decision-making, with far-reaching consequences for organizations. This research investigates the effectiveness of LLMs as judge models to evaluate the thematic alignment of summaries generated by other LLMs. We utilized an Anthropic Claude model to generate thematic summaries from open-ended survey responses, with Amazon's Titan Express, Nova Pro, and Meta's Llama serving as LLM judges. The LLM-as-judge approach was compared to human evaluations using Cohen's kappa, Spearman's rho, and Krippendorff's alpha, validating a scalable alternative to traditional human centric evaluation methods. Our findings reveal that while LLMs as judges offer a scalable solution comparable to human raters, humans may still excel at detecting subtle, context-specific nuances. This research contributes to the growing body of knowledge on AI assisted text analysis. We discuss limitations and provide recommendations for future research, emphasizing the need for careful consideration when generalizing LLM judge models across various contexts and use cases.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Modal AI Copilot for Single-Cell Analysis with Instruction Following</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models excel at interpreting complex natural language instructions, enabling them to perform a wide range of tasks. In the life sciences, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data serves as the "language of cellular biology", capturing intricate gene expression patterns at the single-cell level. However, interacting with this "language" through conventional tools is often inefficient and unintuitive, posing challenges for researchers. To address these limitations, we present InstructCell, a multi-modal AI copilot that leverages natural language as a medium for more direct and flexible single-cell analysis. We construct a comprehensive multi-modal instruction dataset that pairs text-based instructions with scRNA-seq profiles from diverse tissues and species. Building on this, we develop a multi-modal cell language architecture capable of simultaneously interpreting and processing both modalities. InstructCell empowers researchers to accomplish critical tasks-such as cell type annotation, conditional pseudo-cell generation, and drug sensitivity prediction-using straightforward natural language commands. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that InstructCell consistently meets or exceeds the performance of existing single-cell foundation models, while adapting to diverse experimental conditions. More importantly, InstructCell provides an accessible and intuitive tool for exploring complex single-cell data, lowering technical barriers and enabling deeper biological insights.</description>

      <title>A Critical Synthesis of Uncertainty Quantification and Foundation Models in Monocular Depth Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While recent foundation models have enabled significant breakthroughs in monocular depth estimation, a clear path towards safe and reliable deployment in the real-world remains elusive. Metric depth estimation, which involves predicting absolute distances, poses particular challenges, as even the most advanced foundation models remain prone to critical errors. Since quantifying the uncertainty has emerged as a promising endeavor to address these limitations and enable trustworthy deployment, we fuse five different uncertainty quantification methods with the current state-of-the-art DepthAnythingV2 foundation model. To cover a wide range of metric depth domains, we evaluate their performance on four diverse datasets. Our findings identify fine-tuning with the Gaussian Negative Log-Likelihood Loss (GNLL) as a particularly promising approach, offering reliable uncertainty estimates while maintaining predictive performance and computational efficiency on par with the baseline, encompassing both training and inference time. By fusing uncertainty quantification and foundation models within the context of monocular depth estimation, this paper lays a critical foundation for future research aimed at improving not only model performance but also its explainability. Extending this critical synthesis of uncertainty quantification and foundation models into other crucial tasks, such as semantic segmentation and pose estimation, presents exciting opportunities for safer and more reliable machine vision systems.</description>

Abstract: Facial expressions play a crucial role in human communication serving as a powerful and impactful means to express a wide range of emotions. With advancements in artificial intelligence and computer vision, deep neural networks have emerged as effective tools for facial emotion recognition. In this paper, we propose EmoNeXt, a novel deep learning framework for facial expression recognition based on an adapted ConvNeXt architecture network. We integrate a Spatial Transformer Network (STN) to focus on feature-rich regions of the face and Squeeze-and-Excitation blocks to capture channel-wise dependencies. Moreover, we introduce a self-attention regularization term, encouraging the model to generate compact feature vectors. We demonstrate the superiority of our model over existing state-of-the-art deep learning models on the FER2013 dataset regarding emotion classification accuracy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum Machine Learning (QML) offers significant potential for complex tasks like genome sequence classification, but quantum noise on Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices poses practical challenges. This study systematically evaluates how various quantum noise models including dephasing, amplitude damping, depolarizing, thermal noise, bit-flip, and phase-flip affect key QML algorithms (QSVC, Peg-QSVC, QNN, VQC) and feature mapping techniques (ZFeatureMap, ZZFeatureMap, and PauliFeatureMap). Results indicate that QSVC is notably robust under noise, whereas Peg-QSVC and QNN are more sensitive, particularly to depolarizing and amplitude-damping noise. The PauliFeatureMap is especially vulnerable, highlighting difficulties in maintaining accurate classification under noisy conditions. These findings underscore the critical importance of feature map selection and noise mitigation strategies in optimizing QML for genomic classification, with promising implications for personalized medicine.</description>

      <title>ASTRID -- An Automated and Scalable TRIaD for the Evaluation of RAG-based Clinical Question Answering Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive potential in clinical question answering (QA), with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) emerging as a leading approach for ensuring the factual accuracy of model responses. However, current automated RAG metrics perform poorly in clinical and conversational use cases. Using clinical human evaluations of responses is expensive, unscalable, and not conducive to the continuous iterative development of RAG systems. To address these challenges, we introduce ASTRID - an Automated and Scalable TRIaD for evaluating clinical QA systems leveraging RAG - consisting of three metrics: Context Relevance (CR), Refusal Accuracy (RA), and Conversational Faithfulness (CF). Our novel evaluation metric, CF, is designed to better capture the faithfulness of a model's response to the knowledge base without penalising conversational elements. To validate our triad, we curate a dataset of over 200 real-world patient questions posed to an LLM-based QA agent during surgical follow-up for cataract surgery - the highest volume operation in the world - augmented with clinician-selected questions for emergency, clinical, and non-clinical out-of-domain scenarios. We demonstrate that CF can predict human ratings of faithfulness better than existing definitions for conversational use cases. Furthermore, we show that evaluation using our triad consisting of CF, RA, and CR exhibits alignment with clinician assessment for inappropriate, harmful, or unhelpful responses. Finally, using nine different LLMs, we demonstrate that the three metrics can closely agree with human evaluations, highlighting the potential of these metrics for use in LLM-driven automated evaluation pipelines. We also publish the prompts and datasets for these experiments, providing valuable resources for further research and development.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Pricing in High-Speed Railways Using Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses a critical challenge in the high-speed passenger railway industry: designing effective dynamic pricing strategies in the context of competing and cooperating operators. To address this, a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework based on a non-zero-sum Markov game is proposed, incorporating random utility models to capture passenger decision making. Unlike prior studies in areas such as energy, airlines, and mobile networks, dynamic pricing for railway systems using deep reinforcement learning has received limited attention. A key contribution of this paper is a parametrisable and versatile reinforcement learning simulator designed to model a variety of railway network configurations and demand patterns while enabling realistic, microscopic modelling of user behaviour, called RailPricing-RL. This environment supports the proposed MARL framework, which models heterogeneous agents competing to maximise individual profits while fostering cooperative behaviour to synchronise connecting services. Experimental results validate the framework, demonstrating how user preferences affect MARL performance and how pricing policies influence passenger choices, utility, and overall system dynamics. This study provides a foundation for advancing dynamic pricing strategies in railway systems, aligning profitability with system-wide efficiency, and supporting future research on optimising pricing policies.</description>

      <title>A Feature-Level Ensemble Model for COVID-19 Identification in CXR Images using Choquet Integral and Differential Evolution Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly impacted billions globally. It challenges public health and healthcare systems due to its rapid spread and severe respiratory effects. An effective strategy to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic involves integrating testing to identify infected individuals. While RT-PCR is considered the gold standard for diagnosing COVID-19, it has some limitations such as the risk of false negatives. To address this problem, this paper introduces a novel Deep Learning Diagnosis System that integrates pre-trained Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) within an ensemble learning framework to achieve precise identification of COVID-19 cases from Chest X-ray (CXR) images. We combine feature vectors from the final hidden layers of pre-trained DCNNs using the Choquet integral to capture interactions between different DCNNs that a linear approach cannot. We employed Sugeno-$\lambda$ measure theory to derive fuzzy measures for subsets of networks to enable aggregation. We utilized Differential Evolution to estimate fuzzy densities. We developed a TensorFlow-based layer for Choquet operation to facilitate efficient aggregation, due to the intricacies involved in aggregating feature vectors. Experimental results on the COVIDx dataset show that our ensemble model achieved 98\% accuracy in three-class classification and 99.50\% in binary classification, outperforming its components-DenseNet-201 (97\% for three-class, 98.75\% for binary), Inception-v3 (96.25\% for three-class, 98.50\% for binary), and Xception (94.50\% for three-class, 98\% for binary)-and surpassing many previous methods.</description>

Abstract: Cloud Operations (CloudOps) is a rapidly growing field focused on the automated management and optimization of cloud infrastructure which is essential for organizations navigating increasingly complex cloud environments. MontyCloud Inc. is one of the major companies in the CloudOps domain that leverages autonomous bots to manage cloud compliance, security, and continuous operations. To make the platform more accessible and effective to the customers, we leveraged the use of GenAI.
  Developing a GenAI-based solution for autonomous CloudOps for the existing MontyCloud system presented us with various challenges such as i) diverse data sources; ii) orchestration of multiple processes; and iii) handling complex workflows to automate routine tasks. To this end, we developed MOYA, a multi-agent framework that leverages GenAI and balances autonomy with the necessary human control. This framework integrates various internal and external systems and is optimized for factors like task orchestration, security, and error mitigation while producing accurate, reliable, and relevant insights by utilizing Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). Evaluations of our multi-agent system with the help of practitioners as well as using automated checks demonstrate enhanced accuracy, responsiveness, and effectiveness over non-agentic approaches across complex workflows.</description>

      <title>Eliciting In-context Retrieval and Reasoning for Long-context Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in long-context language models (LCLMs) promise to transform Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by simplifying pipelines. With their expanded context windows, LCLMs can process entire knowledge bases and perform retrieval and reasoning directly -- a capability we define as In-Context Retrieval and Reasoning (ICR^2). However, existing benchmarks like LOFT often overestimate LCLM performance by providing overly simplified contexts. To address this, we introduce ICR^2, a benchmark that evaluates LCLMs in more realistic scenarios by including confounding passages retrieved with strong retrievers. We then propose three methods to enhance LCLM performance: (1) retrieve-then-generate fine-tuning, (2) retrieval-attention-probing, which uses attention heads to filter and de-noise long contexts during decoding, and (3) joint retrieval head training alongside the generation head. Our evaluation of five well-known LCLMs on LOFT and ICR^2 demonstrates significant gains with our best approach applied to Mistral-7B: +17 and +15 points by Exact Match on LOFT, and +13 and +2 points on ICR^2, compared to vanilla RAG and supervised fine-tuning, respectively. It even outperforms GPT-4-Turbo on most tasks despite being a much smaller model.</description>

      <title>AI Driven Water Segmentation with deep learning models for Enhanced Flood Monitoring</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flooding is a major natural hazard causing significant fatalities and economic losses annually, with increasing frequency due to climate change. Rapid and accurate flood detection and monitoring are crucial for mitigating these impacts. This study compares the performance of three deep learning models UNet, ResNet, and DeepLabv3 for pixelwise water segmentation to aid in flood detection, utilizing images from drones, in field observations, and social media. This study involves creating a new dataset that augments wellknown benchmark datasets with flood-specific images, enhancing the robustness of the models. The UNet, ResNet, and DeepLab v3 architectures are tested to determine their effectiveness in various environmental conditions and geographical locations, and the strengths and limitations of each model are also discussed here, providing insights into their applicability in different scenarios by predicting image segmentation masks. This fully automated approach allows these models to isolate flooded areas in images, significantly reducing processing time compared to traditional semi-automated methods. The outcome of this study is to predict segmented masks for each image effected by a flood disaster and the validation accuracy of these models. This methodology facilitates timely and continuous flood monitoring, providing vital data for emergency response teams to reduce loss of life and economic damages. It offers a significant reduction in the time required to generate flood maps, cutting down the manual processing time. Additionally, we present avenues for future research, including the integration of multimodal data sources and the development of robust deep learning architectures tailored specifically for flood detection tasks. Overall, our work contributes to the advancement of flood management strategies through innovative use of deep learning technologies.</description>

      <title>Comparative Analysis of Efficient Adapter-Based Fine-Tuning of State-of-the-Art Transformer Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08271v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the efficacy of various adapter architectures on supervised binary classification tasks from the SuperGLUE benchmark as well as a supervised multi-class news category classification task from Kaggle. Specifically, we compare classification performance and time complexity of three transformer models, namely DistilBERT, ELECTRA, and BART, using conventional fine-tuning as well as nine state-of-the-art (SoTA) adapter architectures. Our analysis reveals performance differences across adapter architectures, highlighting their ability to achieve comparable or better performance relative to fine-tuning at a fraction of the training time. Similar results are observed on the new classification task, further supporting our findings and demonstrating adapters as efficient and flexible alternatives to fine-tuning. This study provides valuable insights and guidelines for selecting and implementing adapters in diverse natural language processing (NLP) applications.</description>

      <title>HALoGEN: Fantastic LLM Hallucinations and Where to Find Them</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite their impressive ability to generate high-quality and fluent text, generative large language models (LLMs) also produce hallucinations: statements that are misaligned with established world knowledge or provided input context. However, measuring hallucination can be challenging, as having humans verify model generations on-the-fly is both expensive and time-consuming. In this work, we release HALoGEN, a comprehensive hallucination benchmark consisting of: (1) 10,923 prompts for generative models spanning nine domains including programming, scientific attribution, and summarization, and (2) automatic high-precision verifiers for each use case that decompose LLM generations into atomic units, and verify each unit against a high-quality knowledge source. We use this framework to evaluate ~150,000 generations from 14 language models, finding that even the best-performing models are riddled with hallucinations (sometimes up to 86% of generated atomic facts depending on the domain). We further define a novel error classification for LLM hallucinations based on whether they likely stem from incorrect recollection of training data (Type A errors), or incorrect knowledge in training data (Type B errors), or are fabrication (Type C errors). We hope our framework provides a foundation to enable the principled study of why generative models hallucinate, and advances the development of trustworthy large language models.</description>

      <title>Polynomial Threshold Functions of Bounded Tree-Width: Some Explainability and Complexity Aspects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The tree-width of a multivariate polynomial is the tree-width of the hypergraph with hyperedges corresponding to its terms. Multivariate polynomials of bounded tree-width have been studied by Makowsky and Meer as a new sparsity condition that allows for polynomial solvability of problems which are intractable in general. We consider a variation on this theme for Boolean variables. A representation of a Boolean function as the sign of a polynomial is called a polynomial threshold representation. We discuss Boolean functions representable as polynomial threshold functions of bounded tree-width and present two applications to Bayesian network classifiers, a probabilistic graphical model. Both applications are in Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), the research area dealing with the black-box nature of many recent machine learning models. We also give a separation result between the representational power of positive and general polynomial threshold functions.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Adversarial Post-Training for One-Step Video Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The diffusion models are widely used for image and video generation, but their iterative generation process is slow and expansive. While existing distillation approaches have demonstrated the potential for one-step generation in the image domain, they still suffer from significant quality degradation. In this work, we propose Adversarial Post-Training (APT) against real data following diffusion pre-training for one-step video generation. To improve the training stability and quality, we introduce several improvements to the model architecture and training procedures, along with an approximated R1 regularization objective. Empirically, our experiments show that our adversarial post-trained model, Seaweed-APT, can generate 2-second, 1280x720, 24fps videos in real time using a single forward evaluation step. Additionally, our model is capable of generating 1024px images in a single step, achieving quality comparable to state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>PokerBench: Training Large Language Models to become Professional Poker Players</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce PokerBench - a benchmark for evaluating the poker-playing abilities of large language models (LLMs). As LLMs excel in traditional NLP tasks, their application to complex, strategic games like poker poses a new challenge. Poker, an incomplete information game, demands a multitude of skills such as mathematics, reasoning, planning, strategy, and a deep understanding of game theory and human psychology. This makes Poker the ideal next frontier for large language models. PokerBench consists of a comprehensive compilation of 11,000 most important scenarios, split between pre-flop and post-flop play, developed in collaboration with trained poker players. We evaluate prominent models including GPT-4, ChatGPT 3.5, and various Llama and Gemma series models, finding that all state-of-the-art LLMs underperform in playing optimal poker. However, after fine-tuning, these models show marked improvements. We validate PokerBench by having models with different scores compete with each other, demonstrating that higher scores on PokerBench lead to higher win rates in actual poker games. Through gameplay between our fine-tuned model and GPT-4, we also identify limitations of simple supervised fine-tuning for learning optimal playing strategy, suggesting the need for more advanced methodologies for effectively training language models to excel in games. PokerBench thus presents a unique benchmark for a quick and reliable evaluation of the poker-playing ability of LLMs as well as a comprehensive benchmark to study the progress of LLMs in complex game-playing scenarios. The dataset and code will be made available at: \url{https://github.com/pokerllm/pokerbench}.</description>

      <title>GenSafe: A Generalizable Safety Enhancer for Safe Reinforcement Learning Algorithms Based on Reduced Order Markov Decision Process Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03912v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Safe Reinforcement Learning (SRL) aims to realize a safe learning process for Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms by incorporating safety constraints. However, the efficacy of SRL approaches often relies on accurate function approximations, which are notably challenging to achieve in the early learning stages due to data insufficiency. To address this issue, we introduce in this work a novel Generalizable Safety enhancer (GenSafe) that is able to overcome the challenge of data insufficiency and enhance the performance of SRL approaches. Leveraging model order reduction techniques, we first propose an innovative method to construct a Reduced Order Markov Decision Process (ROMDP) as a low-dimensional approximator of the original safety constraints. Then, by solving the reformulated ROMDP-based constraints, GenSafe refines the actions of the agent to increase the possibility of constraint satisfaction. Essentially, GenSafe acts as an additional safety layer for SRL algorithms. We evaluate GenSafe on multiple SRL approaches and benchmark problems. The results demonstrate its capability to improve safety performance, especially in the early learning phases, while maintaining satisfactory task performance. Our proposed GenSafe not only offers a novel measure to augment existing SRL methods but also shows broad compatibility with various SRL algorithms, making it applicable to a wide range of systems and SRL problems.</description>

      <title>What type of inference is planning?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17863v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multiple types of inference are available for probabilistic graphical models, e.g., marginal, maximum-a-posteriori, and even marginal maximum-a-posteriori. Which one do researchers mean when they talk about "planning as inference"? There is no consistency in the literature, different types are used, and their ability to do planning is further entangled with specific approximations or additional constraints. In this work we use the variational framework to show that, just like all commonly used types of inference correspond to different weightings of the entropy terms in the variational problem, planning corresponds exactly to a different set of weights. This means that all the tricks of variational inference are readily applicable to planning. We develop an analogue of loopy belief propagation that allows us to perform approximate planning in factored-state Markov decisions processes without incurring intractability due to the exponentially large state space. The variational perspective shows that the previous types of inference for planning are only adequate in environments with low stochasticity, and allows us to characterize each type by its own merits, disentangling the type of inference from the additional approximations that its practical use requires. We validate these results empirically on synthetic MDPs and tasks posed in the International Planning Competition.</description>

Abstract: Semantic Knowledge Graphs (SKG) face challenges with scalability, flexibility, contextual understanding, and handling unstructured or ambiguous information. However, they offer formal and structured knowledge enabling highly interpretable and reliable results by means of reasoning and querying. Large Language Models (LLMs) overcome those limitations making them suitable in open-ended tasks and unstructured environments. Nevertheless, LLMs are neither interpretable nor reliable. To solve the dichotomy between LLMs and SKGs we envision Logic Augmented Generation (LAG) that combines the benefits of the two worlds. LAG uses LLMs as Reactive Continuous Knowledge Graphs that can generate potentially infinite relations and tacit knowledge on-demand. SKGs are key for injecting a discrete heuristic dimension with clear logical and factual boundaries. We exemplify LAG in two tasks of collective intelligence, i.e., medical diagnostics and climate projections. Understanding the properties and limitations of LAG, which are still mostly unknown, is of utmost importance for enabling a variety of tasks involving tacit knowledge in order to provide interpretable and effective results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19784v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a transformative development in artificial intelligence (AI), drawing significant attention from industry and academia. Trained on vast datasets, these sophisticated AI systems exhibit impressive natural language processing and content generation capabilities. This paper explores the potential of LLMs to address key challenges in personal finance, focusing on the United States. We evaluate several leading LLMs, including OpenAI's ChatGPT, Google's Gemini, Anthropic's Claude, and Meta's Llama, to assess their effectiveness in providing accurate financial advice on topics such as mortgages, taxes, loans, and investments. Our findings show that while these models achieve an average accuracy rate of approximately 70%, they also display notable limitations in certain areas. Specifically, LLMs struggle to provide accurate responses for complex financial queries, with performance varying significantly across different topics. Despite these limitations, the analysis reveals notable improvements in newer versions of these models, highlighting their growing utility for individuals and financial advisors. As these AI systems continue to evolve, their potential for advancing AI-driven applications in personal finance becomes increasingly promising.</description>

      <title>MiniRAG: Towards Extremely Simple Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06713v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The growing demand for efficient and lightweight Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems has highlighted significant challenges when deploying Small Language Models (SLMs) in existing RAG frameworks. Current approaches face severe performance degradation due to SLMs' limited semantic understanding and text processing capabilities, creating barriers for widespread adoption in resource-constrained scenarios. To address these fundamental limitations, we present MiniRAG, a novel RAG system designed for extreme simplicity and efficiency. MiniRAG introduces two key technical innovations: (1) a semantic-aware heterogeneous graph indexing mechanism that combines text chunks and named entities in a unified structure, reducing reliance on complex semantic understanding, and (2) a lightweight topology-enhanced retrieval approach that leverages graph structures for efficient knowledge discovery without requiring advanced language capabilities. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that MiniRAG achieves comparable performance to LLM-based methods even when using SLMs while requiring only 25\% of the storage space. Additionally, we contribute a comprehensive benchmark dataset for evaluating lightweight RAG systems under realistic on-device scenarios with complex queries. We fully open-source our implementation and datasets at: https://github.com/HKUDS/MiniRAG.</description>

Abstract: Over the last century, deep learning models have become the state-of-the-art for solving complex computer vision problems. These modern computer vision models have millions of parameters, which presents two major challenges: (1) the increased computational requirements hamper the deployment in resource-constrained environments, such as mobile or IoT devices, and (2) explaining the complex decisions of such networks to humans is challenging. Network pruning is a technical approach to reduce the complexity of models, where less important parameters are removed. The work presented in this paper investigates whether this reduction in technical complexity also helps with perceived explainability. To do so, we conducted a pre-study and two human-grounded experiments, assessing the effects of different pruning ratios on explainability. Overall, we evaluate four different compression rates (i.e., 2, 4, 8, and 32) with 37 500 tasks on Mechanical Turk. Results indicate that lower compression rates have a positive influence on explainability, while higher compression rates show negative effects. Furthermore, we were able to identify sweet spots that increase both the perceived explainability and the model's performance.</description>

      <title>PastNet: Introducing Physical Inductive Biases for Spatio-temporal Video Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.11421v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the challenge of spatio-temporal video prediction task, which involves generating future video frames based on historical spatio-temporal observation streams. Existing approaches typically utilize external information such as semantic maps to improve video prediction accuracy, which often neglect the inherent physical knowledge embedded within videos. Worse still, their high computational costs could impede their applications for high-resolution videos. To address these constraints, we introduce a novel framework called \underline{P}hysics-\underline{a}ssisted \underline{S}patio-\underline{t}emporal \underline{Net}work (PastNet) for high-quality video prediction. The core of PastNet lies in incorporating a spectral convolution operator in the Fourier domain, which efficiently introduces inductive biases from the underlying physical laws. Additionally, we employ a memory bank with the estimated intrinsic dimensionality to discretize local features during the processing of complex spatio-temporal signals, thereby reducing computational costs and facilitating efficient high-resolution video prediction. Extensive experiments on various widely-used spatio-temporal video benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed PastNet compared with a range of state-of-the-art methods, particularly in high-resolution scenarios.</description>

      <title>Set-based Neural Network Encoding Without Weight Tying</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.16625v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a neural network weight encoding method for network property prediction that utilizes set-to-set and set-to-vector functions to efficiently encode neural network parameters. Our approach is capable of encoding neural networks in a model zoo of mixed architecture and different parameter sizes as opposed to previous approaches that require custom encoding models for different architectures. Furthermore, our \textbf{S}et-based \textbf{N}eural network \textbf{E}ncoder (SNE) takes into consideration the hierarchical computational structure of neural networks. To respect symmetries inherent in network weight space, we utilize Logit Invariance to learn the required minimal invariance properties. Additionally, we introduce a \textit{pad-chunk-encode} pipeline to efficiently encode neural network layers that is adjustable to computational and memory constraints. We also introduce two new tasks for neural network property prediction: cross-dataset and cross-architecture. In cross-dataset property prediction, we evaluate how well property predictors generalize across model zoos trained on different datasets but of the same architecture. In cross-architecture property prediction, we evaluate how well property predictors transfer to model zoos of different architecture not seen during training. We show that SNE outperforms the relevant baselines on standard benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Text-guided Image Restoration and Semantic Enhancement for Text-to-Image Person Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.09059v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The goal of Text-to-Image Person Retrieval (TIPR) is to retrieve specific person images according to the given textual descriptions. A primary challenge in this task is bridging the substantial representational gap between visual and textual modalities. The prevailing methods map texts and images into unified embedding space for matching, while the intricate semantic correspondences between texts and images are still not effectively constructed. To address this issue, we propose a novel TIPR framework to build fine-grained interactions and alignment between person images and the corresponding texts. Specifically, via fine-tuning the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model, a visual-textual dual encoder is firstly constructed, to preliminarily align the image and text features. Secondly, a Text-guided Image Restoration (TIR) auxiliary task is proposed to map abstract textual entities to specific image regions, improving the alignment between local textual and visual embeddings. Additionally, a cross-modal triplet loss is presented to handle hard samples, and further enhance the model's discriminability for minor differences. Moreover, a pruning-based text data augmentation approach is proposed to enhance focus on essential elements in descriptions, thereby avoiding excessive model attention to less significant information. The experimental results show our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on three popular benchmark datasets, and the code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/Delong-liu-bupt/SEN.</description>

      <title>FLM-101B: An Open LLM and How to Train It with $100K Budget</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.03852v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are considered important approaches towards foundational machine intelligence, achieving remarkable success in Natural Language Processing and multimodal tasks, among others. However, the carbon footprints and financial costs originating from heavy pre-training computation is a non-negligible issue. Progressive training methods, inspired by the neurogenesis process that grows neural structures, have shown potential to accelerate LLM pre-training. However, the algorithms, implementation, and practices for progressively training LLMs beyond 100B parameters remain underexplored. In this paper, we show that our model, namely FLM-101B, trained with our growth strategy under a budget of \$100K, reaches 80\% of the baselines' performances with only 10\% of their floating-point operations. We believe that further studies on progressive training will benefit the community by cutting down the costs and promoting green AI. The checkpoint of FLM-101B is released at https://huggingface.co/CofeAI/FLM-101B.</description>

      <title>Divergences between Language Models and Human Brains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.09308v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Do machines and humans process language in similar ways? Recent research has hinted at the affirmative, showing that human neural activity can be effectively predicted using the internal representations of language models (LMs). Although such results are thought to reflect shared computational principles between LMs and human brains, there are also clear differences in how LMs and humans represent and use language. In this work, we systematically explore the divergences between human and machine language processing by examining the differences between LM representations and human brain responses to language as measured by Magnetoencephalography (MEG) across two datasets in which subjects read and listened to narrative stories. Using an LLM-based data-driven approach, we identify two domains that LMs do not capture well: social/emotional intelligence and physical commonsense. We validate these findings with human behavioral experiments and hypothesize that the gap is due to insufficient representations of social/emotional and physical knowledge in LMs. Our results show that fine-tuning LMs on these domains can improve their alignment with human brain responses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09982v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The key to performance optimization of a program is to decide correctly when a certain transformation should be applied by a compiler. This is an ideal opportunity to apply machine-learning models to speed up the tuning process; while this realization has been around since the late 90s, only recent advancements in ML enabled a practical application of ML to compilers as an end-to-end framework.
  This paper presents ACPO: An AI-Enabled Compiler Framework, a novel framework that provides LLVM with simple and comprehensive tools to benefit from employing ML models for different optimization passes. We first showcase the high-level view, class hierarchy, and functionalities of ACPO and subsequently, demonstrate \taco{a couple of use cases of ACPO by ML-enabling the Loop Unroll and Function Inlining passes used in LLVM's O3. and finally, describe how ACPO can be leveraged to optimize other passes. Experimental results reveal that the ACPO model for Loop Unroll can gain on average 4%, 3%, 5.4%, and 0.2% compared to LLVM's vanilla O3 optimization when deployed on Polybench, Coral-2, CoreMark, and Graph-500, respectively. Furthermore, by including both Function Inlining and Loop Unroll models, ACPO can provide a combined speedup of 4.5% on Polybench and 2.4% on Cbench when compared with LLVM's O3, respectively.</description>

      <title>Spurious Feature Eraser: Stabilizing Test-Time Adaptation for Vision-Language Foundation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00376v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vision-language foundation models have exhibited remarkable success across a multitude of downstream tasks due to their scalability on extensive image-text paired data. However, these models also display significant limitations when applied to downstream tasks, such as fine-grained image classification, as a result of ``decision shortcuts'' that hinder their generalization capabilities. In this work, we find that the CLIP model possesses a rich set of features, encompassing both \textit{desired invariant causal features} and \textit{undesired decision shortcuts}. Moreover, the underperformance of CLIP on downstream tasks originates from its inability to effectively utilize pre-trained features in accordance with specific task requirements. To address this challenge, we propose a simple yet effective method, Spurious Feature Eraser (SEraser), to alleviate the decision shortcuts by erasing the spurious features. Specifically, we introduce a test-time prompt tuning paradigm that optimizes a learnable prompt, thereby compelling the model to exploit invariant features while disregarding decision shortcuts during the inference phase. The proposed method effectively alleviates excessive dependence on potentially misleading spurious information. We conduct comparative analysis of the proposed method against various approaches which validates the significant superiority.</description>

      <title>Remove that Square Root: A New Efficient Scale-Invariant Version of AdaGrad</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02648v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Adaptive methods are extremely popular in machine learning as they make learning rate tuning less expensive. This paper introduces a novel optimization algorithm named KATE, which presents a scale-invariant adaptation of the well-known AdaGrad algorithm. We prove the scale-invariance of KATE for the case of Generalized Linear Models. Moreover, for general smooth non-convex problems, we establish a convergence rate of $O \left(\frac{\log T}{\sqrt{T}} \right)$ for KATE, matching the best-known ones for AdaGrad and Adam. We also compare KATE to other state-of-the-art adaptive algorithms Adam and AdaGrad in numerical experiments with different problems, including complex machine learning tasks like image classification and text classification on real data. The results indicate that KATE consistently outperforms AdaGrad and matches/surpasses the performance of Adam in all considered scenarios.</description>

      <title>A Mixed-Integer Conic Program for the Moving-Target Traveling Salesman Problem based on a Graph of Convex Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04917v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new formulation that finds the optimum for the Moving-Target Traveling Salesman Problem (MT-TSP), which seeks to find a shortest path for an agent, that starts at a depot, visits a set of moving targets exactly once within their assigned time-windows, and returns to the depot. The formulation relies on the key idea that when the targets move along lines, their trajectories become convex sets within the space-time coordinate system. The problem then reduces to finding the shortest path within a graph of convex sets, subject to some speed constraints. We compare our formulation with the current state-of-the-art Mixed Integer Conic Program (MICP) solver for the MT-TSP. The experimental results show that our formulation outperforms the MICP for instances with up to 20 targets, with up to two orders of magnitude reduction in runtime, and up to a 60\% tighter optimality gap. We also show that the solution cost from the convex relaxation of our formulation provides significantly tighter lower bounds for the MT-TSP than the ones from the MICP.</description>

      <title>MoPE: Mixture of Prompt Experts for Parameter-Efficient and Scalable Multimodal Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10568v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the demonstrated parameter efficiency of prompt-based multimodal fusion methods, their limited adaptivity and expressiveness often result in suboptimal performance compared to other tuning approaches. In this paper, we introduce the Mixture of Prompt Experts (MoPE), the first technique designed to overcome these limitations by decomposing standard prompts to capture instance-level features adaptively. Building on this decomposition, MoPE enhances prompt fusion's expressiveness by leveraging multimodal pairing priors to route the most effective prompt for each instance dynamically. Compared to vanilla prompting, our MoPE-based fusion method exhibits greater expressiveness, scaling more effectively with the training data and the overall number of trainable parameters. We also investigate regularization terms for expert routing, which lead to emergent expert specialization with enhanced adaptiveness and interpretablity. Extensive experiments across six multimodal datasets spanning four modalities demonstrate state-of-the-art performance for prompt fusion, matching or even surpassing the performance of fine-tuning while requiring only 0.8% of the trainable parameters.

      <title>GOMA: Proactive Embodied Cooperative Communication via Goal-Oriented Mental Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11075v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Verbal communication plays a crucial role in human cooperation, particularly when the partners only have incomplete information about the task, environment, and each other's mental state. In this paper, we propose a novel cooperative communication framework, Goal-Oriented Mental Alignment (GOMA). GOMA formulates verbal communication as a planning problem that minimizes the misalignment between the parts of agents' mental states that are relevant to the goals. This approach enables an embodied assistant to reason about when and how to proactively initialize communication with humans verbally using natural language to help achieve better cooperation. We evaluate our approach against strong baselines in two challenging environments, Overcooked (a multiplayer game) and VirtualHome (a household simulator). Our experimental results demonstrate that large language models struggle with generating meaningful communication that is grounded in the social and physical context. In contrast, our approach can successfully generate concise verbal communication for the embodied assistant to effectively boost the performance of the cooperation as well as human users' perception of the assistant.</description>

      <title>DIDLM: A SLAM Dataset for Difficult Scenarios Featuring Infrared, Depth Cameras, LIDAR, 4D Radar, and Others under Adverse Weather, Low Light Conditions, and Rough Roads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09622v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Adverse weather conditions, low-light environments, and bumpy road surfaces pose significant challenges to SLAM in robotic navigation and autonomous driving. Existing datasets in this field predominantly rely on single sensors or combinations of LiDAR, cameras, and IMUs. However, 4D millimeter-wave radar demonstrates robustness in adverse weather, infrared cameras excel in capturing details under low-light conditions, and depth images provide richer spatial information. Multi-sensor fusion methods also show potential for better adaptation to bumpy roads. Despite some SLAM studies incorporating these sensors and conditions, there remains a lack of comprehensive datasets addressing low-light environments and bumpy road conditions, or featuring a sufficiently diverse range of sensor data. In this study, we introduce a multi-sensor dataset covering challenging scenarios such as snowy weather, rainy weather, nighttime conditions, speed bumps, and rough terrains. The dataset includes rarely utilized sensors for extreme conditions, such as 4D millimeter-wave radar, infrared cameras, and depth cameras, alongside 3D LiDAR, RGB cameras, GPS, and IMU. It supports both autonomous driving and ground robot applications and provides reliable GPS/INS ground truth data, covering structured and semi-structured terrains. We evaluated various SLAM algorithms using this dataset, including RGB images, infrared images, depth images, LiDAR, and 4D millimeter-wave radar. The dataset spans a total of 18.5 km, 69 minutes, and approximately 660 GB, offering a valuable resource for advancing SLAM research under complex and extreme conditions. Our dataset is available at https://github.com/GongWeiSheng/DIDLM.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12404v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable in-context learning capabilities across diverse applications. In this work, we explore the effectiveness of LLMs for generating realistic synthetic tabular data, identifying key prompt design elements to optimize performance. We introduce EPIC, a novel approach that leverages balanced, grouped data samples and consistent formatting with unique variable mapping to guide LLMs in generating accurate synthetic data across all classes, even for imbalanced datasets. Evaluations on real-world datasets show that EPIC achieves state-of-the-art machine learning classification performance, significantly improving generation efficiency.

      <title>Pre-trained Vision-Language Models Learn Discoverable Visual Concepts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12652v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Do vision-language models (VLMs) pre-trained to caption an image of a "durian" learn visual concepts such as "brown" (color) and "spiky" (texture) at the same time? We aim to answer this question as visual concepts learned "for free" would enable wide applications such as neuro-symbolic reasoning or human-interpretable object classification. We assume that the visual concepts, if captured by pre-trained VLMs, can be extracted by their vision-language interface with text-based concept prompts. We observe that recent works prompting VLMs with concepts often differ in their strategies to define and evaluate the visual concepts, leading to conflicting conclusions. We propose a new concept definition strategy based on two observations: First, certain concept prompts include shortcuts that recognize correct concepts for wrong reasons; Second, multimodal information (e.g. visual discriminativeness, and textual knowledge) should be leveraged when selecting the concepts. Our proposed concept discovery and learning (CDL) framework is thus designed to identify a diverse list of generic visual concepts (e.g. "spiky" as opposed to "spiky durian"), which are ranked and selected based on visual and language mutual information. We carefully design quantitative and human evaluations of the discovered concepts on six diverse visual recognition datasets, which confirm that pre-trained VLMs do learn visual concepts that provide accurate and thorough descriptions for the recognized objects. All code and models are publicly released.</description>

      <title>Snake Learning: A Communication- and Computation-Efficient Distributed Learning Framework for 6G</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03372v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the evolution towards 6G, integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) with advanced network infrastructure emerges as a pivotal strategy for enhancing network intelligence and resource utilization. Existing distributed learning frameworks like Federated Learning and Split Learning often struggle with significant challenges in dynamic network environments including high synchronization demands, costly communication overhead, severe computing resource consumption, and data heterogeneity across network nodes. These obstacles hinder the applications of ubiquitous computing capabilities of 6G networks, especially in light of the trend of escalating model parameters and training data volumes. To address these challenges effectively, this paper introduces ``Snake Learning", a cost-effective distributed learning framework. Specifically, Snake Learning respects the heterogeneity of inter-node computing capability and local data distribution in 6G networks, and sequentially trains the designated part of model layers on individual nodes. This layer-by-layer serpentine update mechanism contributes to significantly reducing the requirements for storage, memory and communication during the model training phase, and demonstrates superior adaptability and efficiency for both classification and fine-tuning tasks across homogeneous and heterogeneous data distributions.</description>

      <title>HippoRAG: Neurobiologically Inspired Long-Term Memory for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14831v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In order to thrive in hostile and ever-changing natural environments, mammalian brains evolved to store large amounts of knowledge about the world and continually integrate new information while avoiding catastrophic forgetting. Despite the impressive accomplishments, large language models (LLMs), even with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), still struggle to efficiently and effectively integrate a large amount of new experiences after pre-training. In this work, we introduce HippoRAG, a novel retrieval framework inspired by the hippocampal indexing theory of human long-term memory to enable deeper and more efficient knowledge integration over new experiences. HippoRAG synergistically orchestrates LLMs, knowledge graphs, and the Personalized PageRank algorithm to mimic the different roles of neocortex and hippocampus in human memory. We compare HippoRAG with existing RAG methods on multi-hop question answering and show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods remarkably, by up to 20%. Single-step retrieval with HippoRAG achieves comparable or better performance than iterative retrieval like IRCoT while being 10-30 times cheaper and 6-13 times faster, and integrating HippoRAG into IRCoT brings further substantial gains. Finally, we show that our method can tackle new types of scenarios that are out of reach of existing methods. Code and data are available at https://github.com/OSU-NLP-Group/HippoRAG.</description>

      <title>Dissecting Query-Key Interaction in Vision Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14880v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Self-attention in vision transformers is often thought to perform perceptual grouping where tokens attend to other tokens with similar embeddings, which could correspond to semantically similar features of an object. However, attending to dissimilar tokens can be beneficial by providing contextual information. We propose to analyze the query-key interaction by the singular value decomposition of the interaction matrix (i.e. ${\textbf{W}_q}^\top\textbf{W}_k$). We find that in many ViTs, especially those with classification training objectives, early layers attend more to similar tokens, while late layers show increased attention to dissimilar tokens, providing evidence corresponding to perceptual grouping and contextualization, respectively. Many of these interactions between features represented by singular vectors are interpretable and semantic, such as attention between relevant objects, between parts of an object, or between the foreground and background. This offers a novel perspective on interpreting the attention mechanism, which contributes to understanding how transformer models utilize context and salient features when processing images.</description>

      <title>VBIM-Net: Variational Born Iterative Network for Inverse Scattering Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18731v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, studies have shown the potential of integrating field-type iterative methods with deep learning (DL) techniques in solving inverse scattering problems (ISPs). In this article, we propose a novel Variational Born Iterative Network, namely, VBIM-Net, to solve the full-wave ISPs with significantly improved structural rationality and inversion quality. The proposed VBIM-Net emulates the alternating updates of the total electric field and the contrast in the variational Born iterative method (VBIM) by multiple layers of subnetworks. We embed the analytical calculation of the contrast variation into each subnetwork, converting the scattered field residual into an approximate contrast variation and then enhancing it by a U-Net, thus avoiding the requirement of matched measurement dimension and grid resolution as in existing approaches. The total field and contrast of each layer's output is supervised in the loss function of VBIM-Net, imposing soft physical constraints on the variables in the subnetworks, which benefits the model's performance.In addition, we design a training scheme with extra noise to enhance the model's stability. Extensive numerical results on synthetic and experimental data both verify the inversion quality, generalization ability, and robustness of the proposed VBIM-Net. This work may provide some new inspiration for the design of efficient field-type DL schemes.</description>

      <title>RMem: Restricted Memory Banks Improve Video Object Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08476v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With recent video object segmentation (VOS) benchmarks evolving to challenging scenarios, we revisit a simple but overlooked strategy: restricting the size of memory banks. This diverges from the prevalent practice of expanding memory banks to accommodate extensive historical information. Our specially designed "memory deciphering" study offers a pivotal insight underpinning such a strategy: expanding memory banks, while seemingly beneficial, actually increases the difficulty for VOS modules to decode relevant features due to the confusion from redundant information. By restricting memory banks to a limited number of essential frames, we achieve a notable improvement in VOS accuracy. This process balances the importance and freshness of frames to maintain an informative memory bank within a bounded capacity. Additionally, restricted memory banks reduce the training-inference discrepancy in memory lengths compared with continuous expansion. This fosters new opportunities in temporal reasoning and enables us to introduce the previously overlooked "temporal positional embedding." Finally, our insights are embodied in "RMem" ("R" for restricted), a simple yet effective VOS modification that excels at challenging VOS scenarios and establishes new state of the art for object state changes (on the VOST dataset) and long videos (on the Long Videos dataset). Our code and demo are available at https://restricted-memory.github.io/.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Survey of Foundation Models in Medicine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10729v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) are large-scale deep learning models that are developed using large datasets and self-supervised learning methods. These models serve as a base for different downstream tasks, including healthcare. FMs have been adopted with great success across various domains within healthcare. Existing healthcare-based surveys have not yet included all of these domains. Therefore, we provide a detailed survey of FMs in healthcare. We focus on the history, learning strategies, flagship models, applications, and challenges of FMs. We explore how FMs such as the BERT and GPT families are reshaping various healthcare domains, including clinical large language models, medical image analysis, and omics. Furthermore, we provide a detailed taxonomy of healthcare applications facilitated by FMs, such as clinical NLP, medical computer vision, graph learning, and other biology-related tasks. Despite the promising opportunities FMs provide, they also have several associated challenges, which are explained in detail. We also outline open research issues and potential lessons learned to provide researchers and practitioners with insights into the capabilities of FMs in healthcare to advance their deployment and mitigate associated risks.</description>

      <title>Can Go AIs be adversarially robust?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12843v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Prior work found that superhuman Go AIs can be defeated by simple adversarial strategies, especially "cyclic" attacks. In this paper, we study whether adding natural countermeasures can achieve robustness in Go, a favorable domain for robustness since it benefits from incredible average-case capability and a narrow, innately adversarial setting. We test three defenses: adversarial training on hand-constructed positions, iterated adversarial training, and changing the network architecture. We find that though some of these defenses protect against previously discovered attacks, none withstand freshly trained adversaries. Furthermore, most of the reliably effective attacks these adversaries discover are different realizations of the same overall class of cyclic attacks. Our results suggest that building robust AI systems is challenging even with extremely superhuman systems in some of the most tractable settings, and highlight two key gaps: efficient generalization of defenses, and diversity in training. For interactive examples of attacks and a link to our codebase, see https://goattack.far.ai.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05467v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: AI Infrastructure plays a key role in the speed and cost-competitiveness of developing and deploying advanced AI models. The current demand for powerful AI infrastructure for model training is driven by the emergence of generative AI and foundational models, where on occasion thousands of GPUs must cooperate on a single training job for the model to be trained in a reasonable time. Delivering efficient and high-performing AI training requires an end-to-end solution that combines hardware, software and holistic telemetry to cater for multiple types of AI workloads. In this report, we describe IBM's hybrid cloud infrastructure that powers our generative AI model development. This infrastructure includes (1) Vela: an AI-optimized supercomputing capability directly integrated into the IBM Cloud, delivering scalable, dynamic, multi-tenant and geographically distributed infrastructure for large-scale model training and other AI workflow steps and (2) Blue Vela: a large-scale, purpose-built, on-premises hosting environment that is optimized to support our largest and most ambitious AI model training tasks. Vela provides IBM with the dual benefit of high performance for internal use along with the flexibility to adapt to an evolving commercial landscape. Blue Vela provides us with the benefits of rapid development of our largest and most ambitious models, as well as future-proofing against the evolving model landscape in the industry. Taken together, they provide IBM with the ability to rapidly innovate in the development of both AI models and commercial offerings.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Masked Image Modeling to Avoid Model Collapse on Multi-modal MRI Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10377v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-modal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides information of lesions for computer-aided diagnosis from different views. Deep learning algorithms are suitable for identifying specific anatomical structures, segmenting lesions, and classifying diseases. Manual labels are limited due to the high expense, which hinders further improvement of accuracy. Self-supervised learning, particularly masked image modeling (MIM), has shown promise in utilizing unlabeled data. However, we spot model collapse when applying MIM to multi-modal MRI datasets. The performance of downstream tasks does not see any improvement following the collapsed model. To solve model collapse, we analyze and address it in two types: complete collapse and dimensional collapse. We find complete collapse occurs because the collapsed loss value in multi-modal MRI datasets falls below the normally converged loss value. Based on this, the hybrid mask pattern (HMP) masking strategy is introduced to elevate the collapsed loss above the normally converged loss value and avoid complete collapse. Additionally, we reveal that dimensional collapse stems from insufficient feature uniformity in MIM. We mitigate dimensional collapse by introducing the pyramid barlow twins (PBT) module as an explicit regularization method. Overall, we construct the enhanced MIM (E-MIM) with HMP and PBT module to avoid model collapse multi-modal MRI. Experiments are conducted on three multi-modal MRI datasets to validate the effectiveness of our approach in preventing both types of model collapse. By preventing model collapse, the training of the model becomes more stable, resulting in a decent improvement in performance for segmentation and classification tasks.

      <description>arXiv:2407.21151v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider collaborative inference at the wireless edge, where each client's model is trained independently on its local dataset. Clients are queried in parallel to make an accurate decision collaboratively. In addition to maximizing the inference accuracy, we also want to ensure the privacy of local models. To this end, we leverage the superposition property of the multiple access channel to implement bandwidth-efficient multi-user inference methods. We propose different methods for ensemble and multi-view classification that exploit over-the-air computation (OAC). We show that these schemes perform better than their orthogonal counterparts with statistically significant differences while using fewer resources and providing privacy guarantees. We also provide experimental results verifying the benefits of the proposed OAC approach to multi-user inference, and perform an ablation study to demonstrate the effectiveness of our design choices. We share the source code of the framework publicly on Github to facilitate further research and reproducibility.</description>

Abstract: With significant advancements in Transformers LLMs, NLP has extended its reach into many research fields due to its enhanced capabilities in text generation and user interaction. One field benefiting greatly from these advancements is cybersecurity. In cybersecurity, many parameters that need to be protected and exchanged between senders and receivers are in the form of text and tabular data, making NLP a valuable tool in enhancing the security measures of communication protocols. This survey paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the utilization of Transformers and LLMs in cyber-threat detection systems. The methodology of paper selection and bibliometric analysis is outlined to establish a rigorous framework for evaluating existing research. The fundamentals of Transformers are discussed, including background information on various cyber-attacks and datasets commonly used in this field. The survey explores the application of Transformers in IDSs, focusing on different architectures such as Attention-based models, LLMs like BERT and GPT, CNN/LSTM-Transformer hybrids, emerging approaches like ViTs, among others. Furthermore, it explores the diverse environments and applications where Transformers and LLMs-based IDS have been implemented, including computer networks, IoT devices, critical infrastructure protection, cloud computing, SDN, as well as in autonomous vehicles. The paper also addresses research challenges and future directions in this area, identifying key issues such as interpretability, scalability, and adaptability to evolving threats, and more. Finally, the conclusion summarizes the findings and highlights the significance of Transformers and LLMs in enhancing cyber-threat detection capabilities, while also outlining potential avenues for further research and development.</description>

Abstract: Modern hardware architectures for Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), other than targeting high performance, aim at dissipating limited energy. Reducing the data movement cost between the computing cores and the memory is a way to mitigate the energy consumption. Systolic arrays are suitable architectures to achieve this objective: they use multiple processing elements that communicate each other to maximize data utilization, based on proper dataflows like the weight stationary and row stationary. Motivated by this, we have proposed TrIM, an innovative dataflow based on a triangular movement of inputs, and capable to reduce the number of memory accesses by one order of magnitude when compared to state-of-the-art systolic arrays. In this paper, we present a TrIM-based hardware architecture for CNNs. As a showcase, the accelerator is implemented onto a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) to execute the VGG-16 and AlexNet CNNs. The architecture achieves a peak throughput of 453.6 Giga Operations per Second, outperforming a state-of-the-art row stationary systolic array up to ~3x in terms of memory accesses, and being up to ~11.9x more energy-efficient than other FPGA accelerators.</description>

      <title>ELDER: Enhancing Lifelong Model Editing with Mixture-of-LoRA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11869v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) require model editing to efficiently update specific knowledge within them and avoid factual errors. Most model editing methods are solely designed for single-time use and result in a significant forgetting effect in lifelong editing scenarios, where sequential edits are conducted over time. Previous approaches manage sequential edits by freezing original parameters and discretely allocating new parameters for each knowledge update. However, these methods lack robustness to minor input variations due to the discrete mapping between data and parameters. To overcome this challenge, we propose ELDER, a novel approach to create a continuous association between data and adapters. ELDER integrates multiple LoRAs through a router network and is trained to establish a smooth data-adapter association, thereby enhancing the edit robustness and generalization of semantically equivalent inputs. To ensure inputs containing the same knowledge will be processed by the same LoRAs, we design a novel loss to guide the model link LoRA allocations with edit knowledge. Furthermore, we propose a deferral mechanism to retain the original LLM capabilities post-edit. Extensive experiments on GPT-2 XL and LLaMA2-7B demonstrate that ELDER effectively edits models in the lifelong setting, outperforming eight baselines while exhibiting strong scalability and preserving LLMs' general abilities on downstream tasks.

      <title>Relaxed Rotational Equivariance via $G$-Biases in Vision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12454v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Group Equivariant Convolution (GConv) can capture rotational equivariance from original data. It assumes uniform and strict rotational equivariance across all features as the transformations under the specific group. However, the presentation or distribution of real-world data rarely conforms to strict rotational equivariance, commonly referred to as Rotational Symmetry-Breaking (RSB) in the system or dataset, making GConv unable to adapt effectively to this phenomenon. Motivated by this, we propose a simple but highly effective method to address this problem, which utilizes a set of learnable biases called $G$-Biases under the group order to break strict group constraints and then achieve a Relaxed Rotational Equivariant Convolution (RREConv). To validate the efficiency of RREConv, we conduct extensive ablation experiments on the discrete rotational group $\mathcal{C}_n$. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed RREConv-based methods achieve excellent performance compared to existing GConv-based methods in both classification and 2D object detection tasks on the natural image datasets.</description>

      <title>Inductive Learning of Logical Theories with LLMs: An Expressivity-Graded Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16779v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work presents a novel systematic methodology to analyse the capabilities and limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs) with feedback from a formal inference engine, on logic theory induction. The analysis is complexity-graded w.r.t. rule dependency structure, allowing quantification of specific inference challenges on LLM performance. Integrating LLMs with formal methods is a promising frontier in the Natural Language Processing field, as an important avenue for improving model inference control and explainability. In particular, inductive learning over complex sets of facts and rules, poses unique challenges for current autoregressive models, as they lack explicit symbolic grounding. While they can be complemented by formal systems, the properties delivered by LLMs regarding inductive learning, are not well understood and quantified. Empirical results indicate that the largest LLMs can achieve competitive results against a SOTA Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) system baseline, but also that tracking long predicate relationship chains is a more difficult obstacle than theory complexity for LLMs.</description>

      <title>Scideator: Human-LLM Scientific Idea Generation Grounded in Research-Paper Facet Recombination</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14634v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The scientific ideation process often involves blending salient aspects of existing papers to create new ideas. To see if large language models (LLMs) can assist this process, we contribute Scideator, a novel mixed-initiative tool for scientific ideation. Starting from a user-provided set of papers, Scideator extracts key facets (purposes, mechanisms, and evaluations) from these and relevant papers, allowing users to explore the idea space by interactively recombining facets to synthesize inventive ideas. Scideator also helps users to gauge idea novelty by searching the literature for potential overlaps and showing automated novelty assessments and explanations. To support these tasks, Scideator introduces four LLM-powered retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) modules: Analogous Paper Facet Finder, Faceted Idea Generator, Idea Novelty Checker, and Idea Novelty Iterator. In a within-subjects user study, 19 computer-science researchers identified significantly more interesting ideas using Scideator compared to a strong baseline combining a scientific search engine with LLM interaction.</description>

      <title>CriSPO: Multi-Aspect Critique-Suggestion-guided Automatic Prompt Optimization for Text Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02748v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing automatic prompt engineering methods are typically designed for discriminative tasks, where new task prompts are iteratively refined with limited feedback from a single metric reflecting a single aspect. However, these approaches are suboptimal for generative tasks, which require more nuanced guidance beyond a single numeric metric to improve the prompt and optimize multiple aspects of the generated text. To address these challenges, we propose a novel multi-aspect Critique-Suggestion-guided automatic Prompt Optimization (CriSPO) approach. CriSPO introduces a critique-suggestion module as its core component. This module spontaneously discovers aspects, and compares generated and reference texts across these aspects, providing specific suggestions for prompt modification. These clear critiques and actionable suggestions guide a receptive optimizer module to make more substantial changes, exploring a broader and more effective search space. To further improve CriSPO with multi-metric optimization, we introduce an Automatic Suffix Tuning (AST) extension to enhance the performance of task prompts across multiple metrics. We evaluate CriSPO on 4 state-of-the-art LLMs across 4 summarization and 5 QA datasets. Extensive experiments show 3-4% ROUGE score improvement on summarization and substantial improvement of various metrics on QA. Code available at https://github.com/amazon-science/crispo</description>

      <title>Deep Compression Autoencoder for Efficient High-Resolution Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10733v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present Deep Compression Autoencoder (DC-AE), a new family of autoencoder models for accelerating high-resolution diffusion models. Existing autoencoder models have demonstrated impressive results at a moderate spatial compression ratio (e.g., 8x), but fail to maintain satisfactory reconstruction accuracy for high spatial compression ratios (e.g., 64x). We address this challenge by introducing two key techniques: (1) Residual Autoencoding, where we design our models to learn residuals based on the space-to-channel transformed features to alleviate the optimization difficulty of high spatial-compression autoencoders; (2) Decoupled High-Resolution Adaptation, an efficient decoupled three-phases training strategy for mitigating the generalization penalty of high spatial-compression autoencoders. With these designs, we improve the autoencoder's spatial compression ratio up to 128 while maintaining the reconstruction quality. Applying our DC-AE to latent diffusion models, we achieve significant speedup without accuracy drop. For example, on ImageNet 512x512, our DC-AE provides 19.1x inference speedup and 17.9x training speedup on H100 GPU for UViT-H while achieving a better FID, compared with the widely used SD-VAE-f8 autoencoder.

      <title>Context Matters: Leveraging Contextual Features for Time Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12672v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time series forecasts are often influenced by exogenous contextual features in addition to their corresponding history. For example, in financial settings, it is hard to accurately predict a stock price without considering public sentiments and policy decisions in the form of news articles, tweets, etc. Though this is common knowledge, the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) forecasting models fail to incorporate such contextual information, owing to its heterogeneity and multimodal nature. To address this, we introduce ContextFormer, a novel plug-and-play method to surgically integrate multimodal contextual information into existing pre-trained forecasting models. ContextFormer effectively distills forecast-specific information from rich multimodal contexts, including categorical, continuous, time-varying, and even textual information, to significantly enhance the performance of existing base forecasters. ContextFormer outperforms SOTA forecasting models by up to 30% on a range of real-world datasets spanning energy, traffic, environmental, and financial domains.</description>

      <title>FoMo: A Foundation Model for Mobile Traffic Forecasting with Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15322v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mobile traffic forecasting allows operators to anticipate network dynamics and performance in advance, offering substantial potential for enhancing service quality and improving user experience. However, existing models are often task-oriented and are trained with tailored data, which limits their effectiveness in diverse mobile network tasks of Base Station (BS) deployment, resource allocation, energy optimization, etc. and hinders generalization across different urban environments. Foundation models have made remarkable strides across various domains of NLP and CV due to their multi-tasking adaption and zero/few-shot learning capabilities. In this paper, we propose an innovative Foundation model for Mo}bile traffic forecasting (FoMo), aiming to handle diverse forecasting tasks of short/long-term predictions and distribution generation across multiple cities to support network planning and optimization. FoMo combines diffusion models and transformers, where various spatio-temporal masks are proposed to enable FoMo to learn intrinsic features of different tasks, and a contrastive learning strategy is developed to capture the correlations between mobile traffic and urban contexts, thereby improving its transfer learning capability. Extensive experiments on 9 real-world datasets demonstrate that FoMo outperforms current models concerning diverse forecasting tasks and zero/few-shot learning, showcasing a strong universality.</description>

      <title>Random Policy Enables In-Context Reinforcement Learning within Trust Horizons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19982v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pretrained foundation models have exhibited extraordinary in-context learning performance, allowing zero-shot generalization to new tasks not encountered during pretraining. In the case of reinforcement learning (RL), in-context RL (ICRL) emerges when pretraining FMs on decision-making problems in an autoregressive-supervised manner. Nevertheless, current state-of-the-art ICRL algorithms, like Algorithm Distillation, Decision Pretrained Transformer and Decision Importance Transformer, impose stringent requirements on the pretraining dataset concerning the source policies, context information, and action labels. Notably, these algorithms either demand optimal policies or require varying degrees of well-trained behavior policies for all pretraining environments. This significantly hinders the application of ICRL to real-world scenarios, where acquiring optimal or well-trained policies for a substantial volume of real-world training environments can be intractable. To overcome this challenge, we introduce a novel approach, termed State-Action Distillation (SAD), that allows to generate an effective pretraining dataset guided solely by random policies. In particular, SAD selects query states and corresponding action labels by distilling outstanding state-action pairs from the entire state and action spaces by using random policies within a trust horizon, and then inherits the classical autoregressive-supervised mechanism during pretraining. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that enables effective ICRL under random policies and random contexts. We also establish quantitative analysis of the trustworthiness as well as the performance guarantees of SAD. Moreover, our empirical results across multiple popular ICRL benchmark environments demonstrate that, on average, SAD outperforms the best baseline by 236.3% in the offline evaluation and by 135.2% in the online evaluation.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Modal Approach for Face Anti-Spoofing in Non-Calibrated Systems using Disparity Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24031v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Face recognition technologies are increasingly used in various applications, yet they are vulnerable to face spoofing attacks. These spoofing attacks often involve unique 3D structures, such as printed papers or mobile device screens. Although stereo-depth cameras can detect such attacks effectively, their high-cost limits their widespread adoption. Conversely, two-sensor systems without extrinsic calibration offer a cost-effective alternative but are unable to calculate depth using stereo techniques. In this work, we propose a method to overcome this challenge by leveraging facial attributes to derive disparity information and estimate relative depth for anti-spoofing purposes, using non-calibrated systems. We introduce a multi-modal anti-spoofing model, coined Disparity Model, that incorporates created disparity maps as a third modality alongside the two original sensor modalities. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the Disparity Model in countering various spoof attacks using a comprehensive dataset collected from the Intel RealSense ID Solution F455. Our method outperformed existing methods in the literature, achieving an Equal Error Rate (EER) of 1.71% and a False Negative Rate (FNR) of 2.77% at a False Positive Rate (FPR) of 1%. These errors are lower by 2.45% and 7.94% than the errors of the best comparison method, respectively. Additionally, we introduce a model ensemble that addresses 3D spoof attacks as well, achieving an EER of 2.04% and an FNR of 3.83% at an FPR of 1%. Overall, our work provides a state-of-the-art solution for the challenging task of anti-spoofing in non-calibrated systems that lack depth information.</description>

      <title>AdaSociety: An Adaptive Environment with Social Structures for Multi-Agent Decision-Making</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03865v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traditional interactive environments limit agents' intelligence growth with fixed tasks. Recently, single-agent environments address this by generating new tasks based on agent actions, enhancing task diversity. We consider the decision-making problem in multi-agent settings, where tasks are further influenced by social connections, affecting rewards and information access. However, existing multi-agent environments lack a combination of adaptive physical surroundings and social connections, hindering the learning of intelligent behaviors. To address this, we introduce AdaSociety, a customizable multi-agent environment featuring expanding state and action spaces, alongside explicit and alterable social structures. As agents progress, the environment adaptively generates new tasks with social structures for agents to undertake. In AdaSociety, we develop three mini-games showcasing distinct social structures and tasks. Initial results demonstrate that specific social structures can promote both individual and collective benefits, though current reinforcement learning and LLM-based algorithms show limited effectiveness in leveraging social structures to enhance performance. Overall, AdaSociety serves as a valuable research platform for exploring intelligence in diverse physical and social settings.

      <title>UTMath: Math Evaluation with Unit Test via Reasoning-to-Coding Thoughts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07240v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The evaluation of mathematical reasoning capabilities is essential for advancing Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance in solving mathematical problems, existing benchmarks such as GSM8K and MATH present limitations, including narrow problem definitions with specific numbers and reliance on predetermined rules that hinder accurate assessments of reasoning and generality. This paper introduces the UTMath Benchmark, a robust evaluation framework designed to assess LLMs through extensive unit tests, with a focus on both the accuracy and generality of model responses. It comprises 1,053 cutting-edge problems spanning nine mathematical domains, with an average of 68 test cases per problem. UTMath is highly challenging, with the best-performing model, o1-mini, solving only 32.57\% of the problems, followed by o1-preview at 27.16\%, and GPT-4o at 26.93\%. Furthermore, we present the Reasoning-to-Coding of Thoughts (RCoT) approach, which encourages LLMs to engage in explicit reasoning prior to code generation, thereby facilitating the production of more sophisticated solutions and enhancing overall performance and efficiency. Additionally, we also release the UTMath-Train training dataset (more than 70k samples), to support the community in further exploring mathematical reasoning.

      <title>Addressing Hallucinations in Language Models with Knowledge Graph Embeddings as an Additional Modality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11531v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we present an approach to reduce hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs) by incorporating Knowledge Graphs (KGs) as an additional modality. Our method involves transforming input text into a set of KG embeddings and using an adapter to integrate these embeddings into the language model space, without relying on external retrieval processes.
  To facilitate this, we created WikiEntities, a dataset containing over 3 million Wikipedia texts annotated with entities from Wikidata and their corresponding embeddings from PyTorch-BigGraph. This dataset serves as a valuable resource for training Entity Linking models and adapting the described method to various LLMs using specialized adapters.
  Our method does not require fine-tuning of the language models themselves; instead, we only train the adapter. This ensures that the model's performance on other tasks is not affected. We trained an adapter for the Mistral 7B, LLaMA 2-7B (chat), and LLaMA 3-8B (instruct) models using this dataset and demonstrated that our approach improves performance on the HaluEval, True-False benchmarks and FEVER dataset. The results indicate that incorporating KGs as a new modality can effectively reduce hallucinations and improve the factual accuracy of language models, all without the need for external retrieval.</description>

      <title>Exploiting Boosting in Hyperdimensional Computing for Enhanced Reliability in Healthcare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14612v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hyperdimensional computing (HDC) enables efficient data encoding and processing in high-dimensional space, benefiting machine learning and data analysis. However, underutilization of these spaces can lead to overfitting and reduced model reliability, especially in data-limited systems a critical issue in sectors like healthcare that demand robustness and consistent performance. We introduce BoostHD, an approach that applies boosting algorithms to partition the hyperdimensional space into subspaces, creating an ensemble of weak learners. By integrating boosting with HDC, BoostHD enhances performance and reliability beyond existing HDC methods. Our analysis highlights the importance of efficient utilization of hyperdimensional spaces for improved model performance. Experiments on healthcare datasets show that BoostHD outperforms state-of-the-art methods. On the WESAD dataset, it achieved an accuracy of 98.37%, surpassing Random Forest, XGBoost, and OnlineHD. BoostHD also demonstrated superior inference efficiency and stability, maintaining high accuracy under data imbalance and noise. In person-specific evaluations, it achieved an average accuracy of 96.19%, outperforming other models. By addressing the limitations of both boosting and HDC, BoostHD expands the applicability of HDC in critical domains where reliability and precision are paramount.</description>

      <title>Mode-conditioned music learning and composition: a spiking neural network inspired by neuroscience and psychology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14773v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Musical mode is one of the most critical element that establishes the framework of pitch organization and determines the harmonic relationships. Previous works often use the simplistic and rigid alignment method, and overlook the diversity of modes. However, in contrast to AI models, humans possess cognitive mechanisms for perceiving the various modes and keys. In this paper, we propose a spiking neural network inspired by brain mechanisms and psychological theories to represent musical modes and keys, ultimately generating musical pieces that incorporate tonality features. Specifically, the contributions are detailed as follows: 1) The model is designed with multiple collaborated subsystems inspired by the structures and functions of corresponding brain regions; 2)We incorporate mechanisms for neural circuit evolutionary learning that enable the network to learn and generate mode-related features in music, reflecting the cognitive processes involved in human music perception. 3)The results demonstrate that the proposed model shows a connection framework closely similar to the Krumhansl-Schmuckler model, which is one of the most significant key perception models in the music psychology domain. 4) Experiments show that the model can generate music pieces with characteristics of the given modes and keys. Additionally, the quantitative assessments of generated pieces reveals that the generating music pieces have both tonality characteristics and the melodic adaptability needed to generate diverse and musical content. By combining insights from neuroscience, psychology, and music theory with advanced neural network architectures, our research aims to create a system that not only learns and generates music but also bridges the gap between human cognition and artificial intelligence.</description>

      <title>AI Foundation Models for Wearable Movement Data in Mental Health Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15240v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pretrained foundation models and transformer architectures have driven the success of large language models (LLMs) and other modern AI breakthroughs. However, similar advancements in health data modeling remain limited due to the need for innovative adaptations. Wearable movement data offers a valuable avenue for exploration, as it's a core feature in nearly all commercial smartwatches, well established in clinical and mental health research, and the sequential nature of the data shares similarities to language. We introduce the Pretrained Actigraphy Transformer (PAT), the first open source foundation model designed for time-series wearable movement data. Leveraging transformer-based architectures and novel techniques, such as patch embeddings, and pretraining on data from 29,307 participants in a national U.S. sample, PAT achieves state-of-the-art performance in several mental health prediction tasks. PAT is also lightweight and easily interpretable, making it a robust tool for mental health research.

      <title>Sparse Attention Vectors: Generative Multimodal Model Features Are Discriminative Vision-Language Classifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00142v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) like LLaVA and Qwen-VL excel at a wide variety of vision-language (VL) tasks such as image captioning or visual question answering. Despite strong performance, LMMs are not directly suited for foundational discriminative vision-language tasks (i.e., tasks requiring discrete label predictions) such as image classification and multiple-choice VQA. One key challenge in utilizing LMMs for discriminative tasks is the extraction of useful features from generative models. To overcome this issue, we propose an approach for finding features in the model's latent space to more effectively leverage LMMs for discriminative tasks. Toward this end, we present Sparse Attention Vectors (SAVs) -- a finetuning-free method that leverages sparse attention head activations (fewer than 1\% of the heads) in LMMs as strong features for VL tasks. With only few-shot examples, SAVs demonstrate state-of-the-art performance compared to a variety of few-shot and finetuned baselines on a collection of discriminative tasks. Our experiments also imply that SAVs can scale in performance with additional examples and generalize to similar tasks, establishing SAVs as both effective and robust multimodal feature representations.</description>

      <title>What Makes Cryptic Crosswords Challenging for LLMs?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09012v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cryptic crosswords are puzzles that rely on general knowledge and the solver's ability to manipulate language on different levels, dealing with various types of wordplay. Previous research suggests that solving such puzzles is challenging even for modern NLP models, including Large Language Models (LLMs). However, there is little to no research on the reasons for their poor performance on this task. In this paper, we establish the benchmark results for three popular LLMs: Gemma2, LLaMA3 and ChatGPT, showing that their performance on this task is still significantly below that of humans. We also investigate why these models struggle to achieve superior performance. We release our code and introduced datasets at https://github.com/bodasadallah/decrypting-crosswords.</description>

      <title>A Cascaded Dilated Convolution Approach for Mpox Lesion Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10106v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The global outbreak of the Mpox virus, classified as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) by the World Health Organization, presents significant diagnostic challenges due to its visual similarity to other skin lesion diseases. Traditional diagnostic methods for Mpox, which rely on clinical symptoms and laboratory tests, are slow and labor intensive. Deep learning-based approaches for skin lesion classification offer a promising alternative. However, developing a model that balances efficiency with accuracy is crucial to ensure reliable and timely diagnosis without compromising performance. This study introduces the Cascaded Atrous Group Attention (CAGA) framework to address these challenges, combining the Cascaded Atrous Attention module and the Cascaded Group Attention mechanism. The Cascaded Atrous Attention module utilizes dilated convolutions and cascades the outputs to enhance multi-scale representation. This is integrated into the Cascaded Group Attention mechanism, which reduces redundancy in Multi-Head Self-Attention. By integrating the Cascaded Atrous Group Attention module with EfficientViT-L1 as the backbone architecture, this approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, reaching an accuracy of 98% on the Mpox Close Skin Image (MCSI) dataset while reducing model parameters by 37.5% compared to the original EfficientViT-L1. The model's robustness is demonstrated through extensive validation on two additional benchmark datasets, where it consistently outperforms existing approaches.</description>

      <title>Cocoa: Co-Planning and Co-Execution with AI Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10999v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present Cocoa, a system that implements a novel interaction design pattern -- interactive plans -- for users to collaborate with an AI agent on complex, multi-step tasks in a document editor. Cocoa harmonizes human and AI efforts and enables flexible delegation of agency through two actions: Co-planning (where users collaboratively compose a plan of action with the agent) and Co-execution (where users collaboratively execute plan steps with the agent). Using scientific research as a sample domain, we motivate the design of Cocoa through a formative study with 9 researchers while also drawing inspiration from the design of computational notebooks. We evaluate Cocoa through a user study with 16 researchers and find that when compared to a strong chat baseline, Cocoa improved agent steerability without sacrificing ease of use. A deeper investigation of the general utility of both systems uncovered insights into usage contexts where interactive plans may be more appropriate than chat, and vice versa. Our work surfaces numerous practical implications and paves new paths for interactive interfaces that foster more effective collaboration between humans and agentic AI systems.</description>

      <title>ORFormer: Occlusion-Robust Transformer for Accurate Facial Landmark Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13174v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although facial landmark detection (FLD) has gained significant progress, existing FLD methods still suffer from performance drops on partially non-visible faces, such as faces with occlusions or under extreme lighting conditions or poses. To address this issue, we introduce ORFormer, a novel transformer-based method that can detect non-visible regions and recover their missing features from visible parts. Specifically, ORFormer associates each image patch token with one additional learnable token called the messenger token. The messenger token aggregates features from all but its patch. This way, the consensus between a patch and other patches can be assessed by referring to the similarity between its regular and messenger embeddings, enabling non-visible region identification. Our method then recovers occluded patches with features aggregated by the messenger tokens. Leveraging the recovered features, ORFormer compiles high-quality heatmaps for the downstream FLD task. Extensive experiments show that our method generates heatmaps resilient to partial occlusions. By integrating the resultant heatmaps into existing FLD methods, our method performs favorably against the state of the arts on challenging datasets such as WFLW and COFW.</description>

      <title>TSEML: A task-specific embedding-based method for few-shot classification of cancer molecular subtypes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13228v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Molecular subtyping of cancer is recognized as a critical and challenging upstream task for personalized therapy. Existing deep learning methods have achieved significant performance in this domain when abundant data samples are available. However, the acquisition of densely labeled samples for cancer molecular subtypes remains a significant challenge for conventional data-intensive deep learning approaches. In this work, we focus on the few-shot molecular subtype prediction problem in heterogeneous and small cancer datasets, aiming to enhance precise diagnosis and personalized treatment. We first construct a new few-shot dataset for cancer molecular subtype classification and auxiliary cancer classification, named TCGA Few-Shot, from existing publicly available datasets. To effectively leverage the relevant knowledge from both tasks, we introduce a task-specific embedding-based meta-learning framework (TSEML). TSEML leverages the synergistic strengths of a model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) approach and a prototypical network (ProtoNet) to capture diverse and fine-grained features. Comparative experiments conducted on the TCGA Few-Shot dataset demonstrate that our TSEML framework achieves superior performance in addressing the problem of few-shot molecular subtype classification.</description>

      <title>Are LLMs Good Literature Review Writers? Evaluating the Literature Review Writing Ability of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13612v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The literature review is a crucial form of academic writing that involves complex processes of literature collection, organization, and summarization. The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has introduced promising tools to automate these processes. However, their actual capabilities in writing comprehensive literature reviews remain underexplored, such as whether they can generate accurate and reliable references. To address this gap, we propose a framework to assess the literature review writing ability of LLMs automatically. We evaluate the performance of LLMs across three tasks: generating references, writing abstracts, and writing literature reviews. We employ external tools for a multidimensional evaluation, which includes assessing hallucination rates in references, semantic coverage, and factual consistency with human-written context. By analyzing the experimental results, we find that, despite advancements, even the most sophisticated models still cannot avoid generating hallucinated references. Additionally, different models exhibit varying performance in literature review writing across different disciplines.</description>

      <title>To Analyze and Regulate Human-in-the-loop Learning for Congestion Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03055v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In congestion games, selfish users behave myopically to crowd to the shortest paths, and the social planner designs mechanisms to regulate such selfish routing through information or payment incentives. However, such mechanism design requires the knowledge of time-varying traffic conditions and it is the users themselves to learn and report past road experiences to the social planner (e.g., Waze or Google Maps). When congestion games meet mobile crowdsourcing, it is critical to incentivize selfish users to explore non-shortest paths in the best exploitation-exploration trade-off. First, we consider a simple but fundamental parallel routing network with one deterministic path and multiple stochastic paths for users with an average arrival probability $\lambda$. We prove that the current myopic routing policy (widely used in Waze and Google Maps) misses both exploration (when strong hazard belief) and exploitation (when weak hazard belief) as compared to the social optimum. Due to the myopic policy's under-exploration, we prove that the caused price of anarchy (PoA) is larger than \(\frac{1}{1-\rho^{\frac{1}{\lambda}}}\), which can be arbitrarily large as discount factor \(\rho\rightarrow1\). To mitigate such huge efficiency loss, we propose a novel selective information disclosure (SID) mechanism: we only reveal the latest traffic information to users when they intend to over-explore stochastic paths upon arrival, while hiding such information when they want to under-explore. We prove that our mechanism successfully reduces PoA to be less than~\(2\). Besides the parallel routing network, we further extend our mechanism and PoA results to any linear path graphs with multiple intermediate nodes.</description>

      <title>Radar Signal Recognition through Self-Supervised Learning and Domain Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03461v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Automatic radar signal recognition (RSR) plays a pivotal role in electronic warfare (EW), as accurately classifying radar signals is critical for informing decision-making processes. Recent advances in deep learning have shown significant potential in improving RSR performance in domains with ample annotated data. However, these methods fall short in EW scenarios where annotated RF data are scarce or impractical to obtain. To address these challenges, we introduce a self-supervised learning (SSL) method which utilises masked signal modelling and RF domain adaption to enhance RSR performance in environments with limited RF samples and labels. Specifically, we investigate pre-training masked autoencoders (MAE) on baseband in-phase and quadrature (I/Q) signals from various RF domains and subsequently transfer the learned representation to the radar domain, where annotated data are limited. Empirical results show that our lightweight self-supervised ResNet model with domain adaptation achieves up to a 17.5% improvement in 1-shot classification accuracy when pre-trained on in-domain signals (i.e., radar signals) and up to a 16.31% improvement when pre-trained on out-of-domain signals (i.e., comm signals), compared to its baseline without SSL. We also provide reference results for several MAE designs and pre-training strategies, establishing a new benchmark for few-shot radar signal classification.</description>

      <title>ExPO: Explainable Phonetic Trait-Oriented Network for Speaker Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05729v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In speaker verification, we use computational method to verify if an utterance matches the identity of an enrolled speaker. This task is similar to the manual task of forensic voice comparison, where linguistic analysis is combined with auditory measurements to compare and evaluate voice samples. Despite much success, we have yet to develop a speaker verification system that offers explainable results comparable to those from manual forensic voice comparison. A novel approach, Explainable Phonetic Trait-Oriented (ExPO) network, is proposed in this paper to introduce the speaker's phonetic trait which describes the speaker's characteristics at the phonetic level, resembling what forensic comparison does. ExPO not only generates utterance-level speaker embeddings but also allows for fine-grained analysis and visualization of phonetic traits, offering an explainable speaker verification process. Furthermore, we investigate phonetic traits from within-speaker and between-speaker variation perspectives to determine which trait is most effective for speaker verification, marking an important step towards explainable speaker verification. Our code is available at https://github.com/mmmmayi/ExPO.</description>

      <title>$\text{Transformer}^2$: Self-adaptive LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06252v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Self-adaptive large language models (LLMs) aim to solve the challenges posed by traditional fine-tuning methods, which are often computationally intensive and static in their ability to handle diverse tasks. We introduce $\text{Transformer}^2$, a novel self-adaptation framework that adapts LLMs for unseen tasks in real-time by selectively adjusting only the singular components of their weight matrices. During inference, $\text{Transformer}^2$ employs a two-pass mechanism: first, a dispatch system identifies the task properties, and then task-specific "expert" vectors, trained using reinforcement learning, are dynamically mixed to obtain targeted behavior for the incoming prompt. Our method outperforms ubiquitous approaches such as LoRA, with fewer parameters and greater efficiency. $\text{Transformer}^2$ demonstrates versatility across different LLM architectures and modalities, including vision-language tasks. $\text{Transformer}^2$ represents a significant leap forward, offering a scalable, efficient solution for enhancing the adaptability and task-specific performance of LLMs, paving the way for truly dynamic, self-organizing AI systems.</description>

      <title>Cost-Effective Robotic Handwriting System with AI Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06783v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a cost-effective robotic handwriting system designed to replicate human-like handwriting with high precision. Combining a Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller, 3D-printed components, and a machine learning-based handwriting generation model implemented via TensorFlow, the system converts user-supplied text into realistic stroke trajectories. By leveraging lightweight 3D-printed materials and efficient mechanical designs, the system achieves a total hardware cost of approximately \$56, significantly undercutting commercial alternatives. Experimental evaluations demonstrate handwriting precision within $\pm$0.3 millimeters and a writing speed of approximately 200 mm/min, positioning the system as a viable solution for educational, research, and assistive applications. This study seeks to lower the barriers to personalized handwriting technologies, making them accessible to a broader audience.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of Artificial Intelligence Methods for Lead Time Prediction in Non-Cycled Areas of Automotive Production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07317v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The present study examines the effectiveness of applying Artificial Intelligence methods in an automotive production environment to predict unknown lead times in a non-cycle-controlled production area. Data structures are analyzed to identify contextual features and then preprocessed using one-hot encoding. Methods selection focuses on supervised machine learning techniques. In supervised learning methods, regression and classification methods are evaluated. Continuous regression based on target size distribution is not feasible. Classification methods analysis shows that Ensemble Learning and Support Vector Machines are the most suitable. Preliminary study results indicate that gradient boosting algorithms LightGBM, XGBoost, and CatBoost yield the best results. After further testing and extensive hyperparameter optimization, the final method choice is the LightGBM algorithm. Depending on feature availability and prediction interval granularity, relative prediction accuracies of up to 90% can be achieved. Further tests highlight the importance of periodic retraining of AI models to accurately represent complex production processes using the database. The research demonstrates that AI methods can be effectively applied to highly variable production data, adding business value by providing an additional metric for various control tasks while outperforming current non AI-based systems.</description>

      <title>WebWalker: Benchmarking LLMs in Web Traversal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07572v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) demonstrates remarkable performance across tasks in open-domain question-answering. However, traditional search engines may retrieve shallow content, limiting the ability of LLMs to handle complex, multi-layered information. To address it, we introduce WebWalkerQA, a benchmark designed to assess the ability of LLMs to perform web traversal. It evaluates the capacity of LLMs to traverse a website's subpages to extract high-quality data systematically. We propose WebWalker, which is a multi-agent framework that mimics human-like web navigation through an explore-critic paradigm. Extensive experimental results show that WebWalkerQA is challenging and demonstrates the effectiveness of RAG combined with WebWalker, through the horizontal and vertical integration in real-world scenarios.</description>
