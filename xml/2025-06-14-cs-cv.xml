      <title>Multimodal Cinematic Video Synthesis Using Text-to-Image and Audio Generation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advances in generative artificial intelligence have altered multimedia creation, allowing for automatic cinematic video synthesis from text inputs. This work describes a method for creating 60-second cinematic movies incorporating Stable Diffusion for high-fidelity image synthesis, GPT-2 for narrative structuring, and a hybrid audio pipeline using gTTS and YouTube-sourced music. It uses a five-scene framework, which is augmented by linear frame interpolation, cinematic post-processing (e.g., sharpening), and audio-video synchronization to provide professional-quality results. It was created in a GPU-accelerated Google Colab environment using Python 3.11. It has a dual-mode Gradio interface (Simple and Advanced), which supports resolutions of up to 1024x768 and frame rates of 15-30 FPS. Optimizations such as CUDA memory management and error handling ensure reliability. The experiments demonstrate outstanding visual quality, narrative coherence, and efficiency, furthering text-to-video synthesis for creative, educational, and industrial applications.</description>

      <title>LoRA-Edit: Controllable First-Frame-Guided Video Editing via Mask-Aware LoRA Fine-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video editing using diffusion models has achieved remarkable results in generating high-quality edits for videos. However, current methods often rely on large-scale pretraining, limiting flexibility for specific edits. First-frame-guided editing provides control over the first frame, but lacks flexibility over subsequent frames. To address this, we propose a mask-based LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) tuning method that adapts pretrained Image-to-Video (I2V) models for flexible video editing. Our approach preserves background regions while enabling controllable edits propagation. This solution offers efficient and adaptable video editing without altering the model architecture. To better steer this process, we incorporate additional references, such as alternate viewpoints or representative scene states, which serve as visual anchors for how content should unfold. We address the control challenge using a mask-driven LoRA tuning strategy that adapts a pre-trained image-to-video model to the editing context. The model must learn from two distinct sources: the input video provides spatial structure and motion cues, while reference images offer appearance guidance. A spatial mask enables region-specific learning by dynamically modulating what the model attends to, ensuring that each area draws from the appropriate source. Experimental results show our method achieves superior video editing performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>DeepTraverse: A Depth-First Search Inspired Network for Algorithmic Visual Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional vision backbones, despite their success, often construct features through a largely uniform cascade of operations, offering limited explicit pathways for adaptive, iterative refinement. This raises a compelling question: can principles from classical search algorithms instill a more algorithmic, structured, and logical processing flow within these networks, leading to representations built through more interpretable, perhaps reasoning-like decision processes? We introduce DeepTraverse, a novel vision architecture directly inspired by algorithmic search strategies, enabling it to learn features through a process of systematic elucidation and adaptive refinement distinct from conventional approaches. DeepTraverse operationalizes this via two key synergistic components: recursive exploration modules that methodically deepen feature analysis along promising representational paths with parameter sharing for efficiency, and adaptive calibration modules that dynamically adjust feature salience based on evolving global context. The resulting algorithmic interplay allows DeepTraverse to intelligently construct and refine feature patterns. Comprehensive evaluations across a diverse suite of image classification benchmarks show that DeepTraverse achieves highly competitive classification accuracy and robust feature discrimination, often outperforming conventional models with similar or larger parameter counts. Our work demonstrates that integrating such algorithmic priors provides a principled and effective strategy for building more efficient, performant, and structured vision backbones.</description>

      <title>Test-Time Adaptation for Generalizable Task Progress Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a test-time adaptation method that enables a progress estimation model to adapt online to the visual and temporal context of test trajectories by optimizing a learned self-supervised objective. To this end, we introduce a gradient-based meta-learning strategy to train the model on expert visual trajectories and their natural language task descriptions, such that test-time adaptation improves progress estimation relying on semantic content over temporal order. Our test-time adaptation method generalizes from a single training environment to diverse out-of-distribution tasks, environments, and embodiments, outperforming the state-of-the-art in-context learning approach using autoregressive vision-language models.</description>

      <title>EfficientVLA: Training-Free Acceleration and Compression for Vision-Language-Action Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, particularly diffusion-based architectures, demonstrate transformative potential for embodied intelligence but are severely hampered by high computational and memory demands stemming from extensive inherent and inference-time redundancies. While existing acceleration efforts often target isolated inefficiencies, such piecemeal solutions typically fail to holistically address the varied computational and memory bottlenecks across the entire VLA pipeline, thereby limiting practical deployability. We introduce EfficientVLA, a structured and training-free inference acceleration framework that systematically eliminates these barriers by cohesively exploiting multifaceted redundancies. EfficientVLA synergistically integrates three targeted strategies: (1) pruning of functionally inconsequential layers from the language module, guided by an analysis of inter-layer redundancies; (2) optimizing the visual processing pathway through a task-aware strategy that selects a compact, diverse set of visual tokens, balancing task-criticality with informational coverage; and (3) alleviating temporal computational redundancy within the iterative diffusion-based action head by strategically caching and reusing key intermediate features. We apply our method to a standard VLA model CogACT, yielding a 1.93X inference speedup and reduces FLOPs to 28.9%, with only a 0.6% success rate drop in the SIMPLER benchmark.</description>

      <title>A Manually Annotated Image-Caption Dataset for Detecting Children in the Wild</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Platforms and the law regulate digital content depicting minors (defined as individuals under 18 years of age) differently from other types of content. Given the sheer amount of content that needs to be assessed, machine learning-based automation tools are commonly used to detect content depicting minors. To our knowledge, no dataset or benchmark currently exists for detecting these identification methods in a multi-modal environment. To fill this gap, we release the Image-Caption Children in the Wild Dataset (ICCWD), an image-caption dataset aimed at benchmarking tools that detect depictions of minors. Our dataset is richer than previous child image datasets, containing images of children in a variety of contexts, including fictional depictions and partially visible bodies. ICCWD contains 10,000 image-caption pairs manually labeled to indicate the presence or absence of a child in the image. To demonstrate the possible utility of our dataset, we use it to benchmark three different detectors, including a commercial age estimation system applied to images. Our results suggest that child detection is a challenging task, with the best method achieving a 75.3% true positive rate. We hope the release of our dataset will aid in the design of better minor detection methods in a wide range of scenarios.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents a comparison of the performance of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs) in the task of multi-classifying images containing lesions of psoriasis and diseases similar to it. Models pre-trained on ImageNet were adapted to a specific data set. Both achieved high predictive metrics, but the ViTs stood out for their superior performance with smaller models. Dual Attention Vision Transformer-Base (DaViT-B) obtained the best results, with an f1-score of 96.4%, and is recommended as the most efficient architecture for automated psoriasis detection. This article reinforces the potential of ViTs for medical image classification tasks.</description>

      <title>ViCrit: A Verifiable Reinforcement Learning Proxy Task for Visual Perception in VLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown great effectiveness for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) using tasks that are challenging yet easily verifiable, such as math reasoning or code generation. However, extending this success to visual perception in vision-language models (VLMs) has been impeded by the scarcity of vision-centric tasks that are simultaneously challenging and unambiguously verifiable. To this end, we introduce ViCrit (Visual Caption Hallucination Critic), an RL proxy task that trains VLMs to localize a subtle, synthetic visual hallucination injected into paragraphs of human-written image captions. Starting from a 200-word captions, we inject a single, subtle visual description error-altering a few words on objects, attributes, counts, or spatial relations-and task the model to pinpoint the corrupted span given the image and the modified caption. This formulation preserves the full perceptual difficulty while providing a binary, exact-match reward that is easy to compute and unambiguous. Models trained with the ViCrit Task exhibit substantial gains across a variety of VL benchmarks. Crucially, the improvements transfer beyond natural-image training data to abstract image reasoning and visual math, showing promises of learning to perceive rather than barely memorizing seen objects. To facilitate evaluation, we further introduce ViCrit-Bench, a category-balanced diagnostic benchmark that systematically probes perception errors across diverse image domains and error types. Together, our results demonstrate that fine-grained hallucination criticism is an effective and generalizable objective for enhancing visual perception in VLMs.</description>

      <title>RoCA: Robust Cross-Domain End-to-End Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: End-to-end (E2E) autonomous driving has recently emerged as a new paradigm, offering significant potential. However, few studies have looked into the practical challenge of deployment across domains (e.g., cities). Although several works have incorporated Large Language Models (LLMs) to leverage their open-world knowledge, LLMs do not guarantee cross-domain driving performance and may incur prohibitive retraining costs during domain adaptation. In this paper, we propose RoCA, a novel framework for robust cross-domain E2E autonomous driving. RoCA formulates the joint probabilistic distribution over the tokens that encode ego and surrounding vehicle information in the E2E pipeline. Instantiating with a Gaussian process (GP), RoCA learns a set of basis tokens with corresponding trajectories, which span diverse driving scenarios. Then, given any driving scene, it is able to probabilistically infer the future trajectory. By using RoCA together with a base E2E model in source-domain training, we improve the generalizability of the base model, without requiring extra inference computation. In addition, RoCA enables robust adaptation on new target domains, significantly outperforming direct finetuning. We extensively evaluate RoCA on various cross-domain scenarios and show that it achieves strong domain generalization and adaptation performance.</description>

      <title>SPARKE: Scalable Prompt-Aware Diversity Guidance in Diffusion Models via RKE Score</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable success in high-fidelity image synthesis and prompt-guided generative modeling. However, ensuring adequate diversity in generated samples of prompt-guided diffusion models remains a challenge, particularly when the prompts span a broad semantic spectrum and the diversity of generated data needs to be evaluated in a prompt-aware fashion across semantically similar prompts. Recent methods have introduced guidance via diversity measures to encourage more varied generations. In this work, we extend the diversity measure-based approaches by proposing the Scalable Prompt-Aware R\'eny Kernel Entropy Diversity Guidance (SPARKE) method for prompt-aware diversity guidance. SPARKE utilizes conditional entropy for diversity guidance, which dynamically conditions diversity measurement on similar prompts and enables prompt-aware diversity control. While the entropy-based guidance approach enhances prompt-aware diversity, its reliance on the matrix-based entropy scores poses computational challenges in large-scale generation settings. To address this, we focus on the special case of Conditional latent RKE Score Guidance, reducing entropy computation and gradient-based optimization complexity from the $O(n^3)$ of general entropy measures to $O(n)$. The reduced computational complexity allows for diversity-guided sampling over potentially thousands of generation rounds on different prompts. We numerically test the SPARKE method on several text-to-image diffusion models, demonstrating that the proposed method improves the prompt-aware diversity of the generated data without incurring significant computational costs. We release our code on the project page: https://mjalali.github.io/SPARKE</description>

      <title>Retrieval of Surface Solar Radiation through Implicit Albedo Recovery from Temporal Context</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate retrieval of surface solar radiation (SSR) from satellite imagery critically depends on estimating the background reflectance that a spaceborne sensor would observe under clear-sky conditions. Deviations from this baseline can then be used to detect cloud presence and guide radiative transfer models in inferring atmospheric attenuation. Operational retrieval algorithms typically approximate background reflectance using monthly statistics, assuming surface properties vary slowly relative to atmospheric conditions. However, this approach fails in mountainous regions where intermittent snow cover and changing snow surfaces are frequent. We propose an attention-based emulator for SSR retrieval that implicitly learns to infer clear-sky surface reflectance from raw satellite image sequences. Built on the Temporo-Spatial Vision Transformer, our approach eliminates the need for hand-crafted features such as explicit albedo maps or cloud masks. The emulator is trained on instantaneous SSR estimates from the HelioMont algorithm over Switzerland, a region characterized by complex terrain and dynamic snow cover. Inputs include multi-spectral SEVIRI imagery from the Meteosat Second Generation platform, augmented with static topographic features and solar geometry. The target variable is HelioMont's SSR, computed as the sum of its direct and diffuse horizontal irradiance components, given at a spatial resolution of 1.7 km. We show that, when provided a sufficiently long temporal context, the model matches the performances of albedo-informed models, highlighting the model's ability to internally learn and exploit latent surface reflectance dynamics. Our geospatial analysis shows this effect is most powerful in mountainous regions and improves generalization in both simple and complex topographic settings.

      <title>Attention, Please! Revisiting Attentive Probing for Masked Image Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As fine-tuning (FT) becomes increasingly impractical at scale, probing is emerging as the preferred evaluation protocol for self-supervised learning (SSL). Yet, the standard linear probing (LP) fails to adequately reflect the potential of models trained with Masked Image Modeling (MIM), due to the distributed nature of patch tokens. This motivates the need for attentive probing, an alternative that uses attention to selectively aggregate patch-level features. Despite its growing adoption, attentive probing remains under-explored, with existing methods suffering from excessive parameterization and poor computational efficiency.
  In this work, we revisit attentive probing through the lens of the accuracy-efficiency trade-off. We conduct a systematic study of existing methods, analyzing their mechanisms and benchmarking their performance. We introduce efficient probing (EP), a multi-query cross-attention mechanism that eliminates redundant projections, reduces the number of trainable parameters, and achieves up to a 10$\times$ speed-up over conventional multi-head attention. Despite its simplicity, EP outperforms LP and prior attentive probing approaches across seven benchmarks, generalizes well beyond MIM to diverse pre-training paradigms, produces interpretable attention maps, and achieves strong gains in low-shot and layer-wise settings.

      <title>Improving Personalized Search with Regularized Low-Rank Parameter Updates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Personalized vision-language retrieval seeks to recognize new concepts (e.g. "my dog Fido") from only a few examples. This task is challenging because it requires not only learning a new concept from a few images, but also integrating the personal and general knowledge together to recognize the concept in different contexts. In this paper, we show how to effectively adapt the internal representation of a vision-language dual encoder model for personalized vision-language retrieval. We find that regularized low-rank adaption of a small set of parameters in the language encoder's final layer serves as a highly effective alternative to textual inversion for recognizing the personal concept while preserving general knowledge. Additionally, we explore strategies for combining parameters of multiple learned personal concepts, finding that parameter addition is effective. To evaluate how well general knowledge is preserved in a finetuned representation, we introduce a metric that measures image retrieval accuracy based on captions generated by a vision language model (VLM). Our approach achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on two benchmarks for personalized image retrieval with natural language queries - DeepFashion2 and ConCon-Chi - outperforming the prior art by 4%-22% on personal retrievals.</description>

      <title>ScoreMix: Improving Face Recognition via Score Composition in Diffusion Generators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose ScoreMix, a novel yet simple data augmentation strategy leveraging the score compositional properties of diffusion models to enhance discriminator performance, particularly under scenarios with limited labeled data. By convexly mixing the scores from different class-conditioned trajectories during diffusion sampling, we generate challenging synthetic samples that significantly improve discriminative capabilities in all studied benchmarks. We systematically investigate class-selection strategies for mixing and discover that greater performance gains arise when combining classes distant in the discriminator's embedding space, rather than close in the generator's condition space. Moreover, we empirically show that, under standard metrics, the correlation between the generator's learned condition space and the discriminator's embedding space is minimal.

      <title>California Crop Yield Benchmark: Combining Satellite Image, Climate, Evapotranspiration, and Soil Data Layers for County-Level Yield Forecasting of Over 70 Crops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: California is a global leader in agricultural production, contributing 12.5% of the United States total output and ranking as the fifth-largest food and cotton supplier in the world. Despite the availability of extensive historical yield data from the USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service, accurate and timely crop yield forecasting remains a challenge due to the complex interplay of environmental, climatic, and soil-related factors. In this study, we introduce a comprehensive crop yield benchmark dataset covering over 70 crops across all California counties from 2008 to 2022. The benchmark integrates diverse data sources, including Landsat satellite imagery, daily climate records, monthly evapotranspiration, and high-resolution soil properties. To effectively learn from these heterogeneous inputs, we develop a multi-modal deep learning model tailored for county-level, crop-specific yield forecasting. The model employs stratified feature extraction and a timeseries encoder to capture spatial and temporal dynamics during the growing season. Static inputs such as soil characteristics and crop identity inform long-term variability. Our approach achieves an overall R2 score of 0.76 across all crops of unseen test dataset, highlighting strong predictive performance across California diverse agricultural regions. This benchmark and modeling framework offer a valuable foundation for advancing agricultural forecasting, climate adaptation, and precision farming. The full dataset and codebase are publicly available at our GitHub repository.</description>

      <title>DySS: Dynamic Queries and State-Space Learning for Efficient 3D Object Detection from Multi-Camera Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Camera-based 3D object detection in Bird's Eye View (BEV) is one of the most important perception tasks in autonomous driving. Earlier methods rely on dense BEV features, which are costly to construct. More recent works explore sparse query-based detection. However, they still require a large number of queries and can become expensive to run when more video frames are used. In this paper, we propose DySS, a novel method that employs state-space learning and dynamic queries. More specifically, DySS leverages a state-space model (SSM) to sequentially process the sampled features over time steps. In order to encourage the model to better capture the underlying motion and correspondence information, we introduce auxiliary tasks of future prediction and masked reconstruction to better train the SSM. The state of the SSM then provides an informative yet efficient summarization of the scene. Based on the state-space learned features, we dynamically update the queries via merge, remove, and split operations, which help maintain a useful, lean set of detection queries throughout the network. Our proposed DySS achieves both superior detection performance and efficient inference. Specifically, on the nuScenes test split, DySS achieves 65.31 NDS and 57.4 mAP, outperforming the latest state of the art. On the val split, DySS achieves 56.2 NDS and 46.2 mAP, as well as a real-time inference speed of 33 FPS.</description>

      <title>HalLoc: Token-level Localization of Hallucinations for Vision Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hallucinations pose a significant challenge to the reliability of large vision-language models, making their detection essential for ensuring accuracy in critical applications. Current detection methods often rely on computationally intensive models, leading to high latency and resource demands. Their definitive outcomes also fail to account for real-world scenarios where the line between hallucinated and truthful information is unclear. To address these issues, we propose HalLoc, a dataset designed for efficient, probabilistic hallucination detection. It features 150K token-level annotated samples, including hallucination types, across Visual Question Answering (VQA), instruction-following, and image captioning tasks. This dataset facilitates the development of models that detect hallucinations with graded confidence, enabling more informed user interactions. Additionally, we introduce a baseline model trained on HalLoc, offering low-overhead, concurrent hallucination detection during generation. The model can be seamlessly integrated into existing VLMs, improving reliability while preserving efficiency. The prospect of a robust plug-and-play hallucination detection module opens new avenues for enhancing the trustworthiness of vision-language models in real-world applications. The HalLoc dataset and code are publicly available at: https://github.com/dbsltm/cvpr25_halloc.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty-Aware Deep Learning for Automated Skin Cancer Classification: A Comprehensive Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate and reliable skin cancer diagnosis is critical for early treatment and improved patient outcomes. Deep learning (DL) models have shown promise in automating skin cancer classification, but their performance can be limited by data scarcity and a lack of uncertainty awareness. In this study, we present a comprehensive evaluation of DL-based skin lesion classification using transfer learning and uncertainty quantification (UQ) on the HAM10000 dataset. In the first phase, we benchmarked several pre-trained feature extractors-including Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) variants, Residual Network-50 (ResNet50), Densely Connected Convolutional Network (DenseNet121), Visual Geometry Group network (VGG16), and EfficientNet-V2-Large-combined with a range of traditional classifiers such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and logistic regression. Our results show that CLIP-based vision transformers, particularly LAION CLIP ViT-H/14 with SVM, deliver the highest classification performance. In the second phase, we incorporated UQ using Monte Carlo Dropout (MCD), Ensemble, and Ensemble Monte Carlo Dropout (EMCD) to assess not only prediction accuracy but also the reliability of model outputs. We evaluated these models using uncertainty-aware metrics such as uncertainty accuracy(UAcc), uncertainty sensitivity(USen), uncertainty specificity(USpe), and uncertainty precision(UPre). The results demonstrate that ensemble methods offer a good trade-off between accuracy and uncertainty handling, while EMCD is more sensitive to uncertain predictions. This study highlights the importance of integrating UQ into DL-based medical diagnosis to enhance both performance and trustworthiness in real-world clinical applications.</description>

      <title>Towards Scalable SOAP Note Generation: A Weakly Supervised Multimodal Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Skin carcinoma is the most prevalent form of cancer globally, accounting for over $8 billion in annual healthcare expenditures. In clinical settings, physicians document patient visits using detailed SOAP (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan) notes. However, manually generating these notes is labor-intensive and contributes to clinician burnout. In this work, we propose a weakly supervised multimodal framework to generate clinically structured SOAP notes from limited inputs, including lesion images and sparse clinical text. Our approach reduces reliance on manual annotations, enabling scalable, clinically grounded documentation while alleviating clinician burden and reducing the need for large annotated data. Our method achieves performance comparable to GPT-4o, Claude, and DeepSeek Janus Pro across key clinical relevance metrics. To evaluate clinical quality, we introduce two novel metrics MedConceptEval and Clinical Coherence Score (CCS) which assess semantic alignment with expert medical concepts and input features, respectively.</description>

      <title>Research on Audio-Visual Quality Assessment Dataset and Method for User-Generated Omnidirectional Video</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In response to the rising prominence of the Metaverse, omnidirectional videos (ODVs) have garnered notable interest, gradually shifting from professional-generated content (PGC) to user-generated content (UGC). However, the study of audio-visual quality assessment (AVQA) within ODVs remains limited. To address this, we construct a dataset of UGC omnidirectional audio and video (A/V) content. The videos are captured by five individuals using two different types of omnidirectional cameras, shooting 300 videos covering 10 different scene types. A subjective AVQA experiment is conducted on the dataset to obtain the Mean Opinion Scores (MOSs) of the A/V sequences. After that, to facilitate the development of UGC-ODV AVQA fields, we construct an effective AVQA baseline model on the proposed dataset, of which the baseline model consists of video feature extraction module, audio feature extraction and audio-visual fusion module. The experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves optimal performance on the proposed dataset.</description>

      <title>Using Vision Language Models to Detect Students' Academic Emotion through Facial Expressions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Students' academic emotions significantly influence their social behavior and learning performance. Traditional approaches to automatically and accurately analyze these emotions have predominantly relied on supervised machine learning algorithms. However, these models often struggle to generalize across different contexts, necessitating repeated cycles of data collection, annotation, and training. The emergence of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offers a promising alternative, enabling generalization across visual recognition tasks through zero-shot prompting without requiring fine-tuning. This study investigates the potential of VLMs to analyze students' academic emotions via facial expressions in an online learning environment. We employed two VLMs, Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct and Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, to analyze 5,000 images depicting confused, distracted, happy, neutral, and tired expressions using zero-shot prompting. Preliminary results indicate that both models demonstrate moderate performance in academic facial expression recognition, with Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct outperforming Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct. Notably, both models excel in identifying students' happy emotions but fail to detect distracted behavior. Additionally, Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct exhibits relatively high performance in recognizing students' confused expressions, highlighting its potential for practical applications in identifying content that causes student confusion.</description>

      <title>PointGS: Point Attention-Aware Sparse View Synthesis with Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) is an innovative rendering technique that surpasses the neural radiance field (NeRF) in both rendering speed and visual quality by leveraging an explicit 3D scene representation. Existing 3DGS approaches require a large number of calibrated views to generate a consistent and complete scene representation. When input views are limited, 3DGS tends to overfit the training views, leading to noticeable degradation in rendering quality. To address this limitation, we propose a Point-wise Feature-Aware Gaussian Splatting framework that enables real-time, high-quality rendering from sparse training views. Specifically, we first employ the latest stereo foundation model to estimate accurate camera poses and reconstruct a dense point cloud for Gaussian initialization. We then encode the colour attributes of each 3D Gaussian by sampling and aggregating multiscale 2D appearance features from sparse inputs. To enhance point-wise appearance representation, we design a point interaction network based on a self-attention mechanism, allowing each Gaussian point to interact with its nearest neighbors. These enriched features are subsequently decoded into Gaussian parameters through two lightweight multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) for final rendering. Extensive experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms NeRF-based approaches and achieves competitive performance under few-shot settings compared to the state-of-the-art 3DGS methods.</description>

      <title>GeoCAD: Local Geometry-Controllable CAD Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Local geometry-controllable computer-aided design (CAD) generation aims to modify local parts of CAD models automatically, enhancing design efficiency. It also ensures that the shapes of newly generated local parts follow user-specific geometric instructions (e.g., an isosceles right triangle or a rectangle with one corner cut off). However, existing methods encounter challenges in achieving this goal. Specifically, they either lack the ability to follow textual instructions or are unable to focus on the local parts. To address this limitation, we introduce GeoCAD, a user-friendly and local geometry-controllable CAD generation method. Specifically, we first propose a complementary captioning strategy to generate geometric instructions for local parts. This strategy involves vertex-based and VLLM-based captioning for systematically annotating simple and complex parts, respectively. In this way, we caption $\sim$221k different local parts in total. In the training stage, given a CAD model, we randomly mask a local part. Then, using its geometric instruction and the remaining parts as input, we prompt large language models (LLMs) to predict the masked part. During inference, users can specify any local part for modification while adhering to a variety of predefined geometric instructions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of GeoCAD in generation quality, validity and text-to-CAD consistency. Code will be available at https://github.com/Zhanwei-Z/GeoCAD.</description>

      <title>UrbanSense:AFramework for Quantitative Analysis of Urban Streetscapes leveraging Vision Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Urban cultures and architectural styles vary significantly across cities due to geographical, chronological, historical, and socio-political factors. Understanding these differences is essential for anticipating how cities may evolve in the future. As representative cases of historical continuity and modern innovation in China, Beijing and Shenzhen offer valuable perspectives for exploring the transformation of urban streetscapes. However, conventional approaches to urban cultural studies often rely on expert interpretation and historical documentation, which are difficult to standardize across different contexts. To address this, we propose a multimodal research framework based on vision-language models, enabling automated and scalable analysis of urban streetscape style differences. This approach enhances the objectivity and data-driven nature of urban form research. The contributions of this study are as follows: First, we construct UrbanDiffBench, a curated dataset of urban streetscapes containing architectural images from different periods and regions. Second, we develop UrbanSense, the first vision-language-model-based framework for urban streetscape analysis, enabling the quantitative generation and comparison of urban style representations. Third, experimental results show that Over 80% of generated descriptions pass the t-test (p less than 0.05). High Phi scores (0.912 for cities, 0.833 for periods) from subjective evaluations confirm the method's ability to capture subtle stylistic differences. These results highlight the method's potential to quantify and interpret urban style evolution, offering a scientifically grounded lens for future design.</description>

      <title>RealKeyMorph: Keypoints in Real-world Coordinates for Resolution-agnostic Image Registration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many real-world settings require registration of a pair of medical images that differ in spatial resolution, which may arise from differences in image acquisition parameters like pixel spacing, slice thickness, and field-of-view. However, all previous machine learning-based registration techniques resample images onto a fixed resolution. This is suboptimal because resampling can introduce artifacts due to interpolation. To address this, we present RealKeyMorph (RKM), a resolution-agnostic method for image registration. RKM is an extension of KeyMorph, a registration framework which works by training a network to learn corresponding keypoints for a given pair of images, after which a closed-form keypoint matching step is used to derive the transformation that aligns them. To avoid resampling and enable operating on the raw data, RKM outputs keypoints in real-world coordinates of the scanner. To do this, we leverage the affine matrix produced by the scanner (e.g., MRI machine) that encodes the mapping from voxel coordinates to real world coordinates. By transforming keypoints into real-world space and integrating this into the training process, RKM effectively enables the extracted keypoints to be resolution-agnostic. In our experiments, we demonstrate the advantages of RKM on the registration task for orthogonal 2D stacks of abdominal MRIs, as well as 3D volumes with varying resolutions in brain datasets.</description>

      <title>Motion-R1: Chain-of-Thought Reasoning and Reinforcement Learning for Human Motion Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models, especially in natural language understanding and reasoning, have opened new possibilities for text-to-motion generation. Although existing approaches have made notable progress in semantic alignment and motion synthesis, they often rely on end-to-end mapping strategies that fail to capture deep linguistic structures and logical reasoning. Consequently, generated motions tend to lack controllability, consistency, and diversity. To address these limitations, we propose Motion-R1, a unified motion-language modeling framework that integrates a Chain-of-Thought mechanism. By explicitly decomposing complex textual instructions into logically structured action paths, Motion-R1 provides high-level semantic guidance for motion generation, significantly enhancing the model's ability to interpret and execute multi-step, long-horizon, and compositionally rich commands. To train our model, we adopt Group Relative Policy Optimization, a reinforcement learning algorithm designed for large models, which leverages motion quality feedback to optimize reasoning chains and motion synthesis jointly. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that Motion-R1 achieves competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, particularly in scenarios requiring nuanced semantic understanding and long-term temporal coherence. The code, model and data will be publicly available.</description>

      <title>FaceLiVT: Face Recognition using Linear Vision Transformer with Structural Reparameterization For Mobile Device</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces FaceLiVT, a lightweight yet powerful face recognition model that integrates a hybrid Convolution Neural Network (CNN)-Transformer architecture with an innovative and lightweight Multi-Head Linear Attention (MHLA) mechanism. By combining MHLA alongside a reparameterized token mixer, FaceLiVT effectively reduces computational complexity while preserving competitive accuracy. Extensive evaluations on challenging benchmarks; including LFW, CFP-FP, AgeDB-30, IJB-B, and IJB-C; highlight its superior performance compared to state-of-the-art lightweight models. MHLA notably improves inference speed, allowing FaceLiVT to deliver high accuracy with lower latency on mobile devices. Specifically, FaceLiVT is 8.6 faster than EdgeFace, a recent hybrid CNN-Transformer model optimized for edge devices, and 21.2 faster than a pure ViT-Based model. With its balanced design, FaceLiVT offers an efficient and practical solution for real-time face recognition on resource-constrained platforms.</description>

      <title>FSATFusion: Frequency-Spatial Attention Transformer for Infrared and Visible Image Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The infrared and visible images fusion (IVIF) is receiving increasing attention from both the research community and industry due to its excellent results in downstream applications. Existing deep learning approaches often utilize convolutional neural networks to extract image features. However, the inherently capacity of convolution operations to capture global context can lead to information loss, thereby restricting fusion performance. To address this limitation, we propose an end-to-end fusion network named the Frequency-Spatial Attention Transformer Fusion Network (FSATFusion). The FSATFusion contains a frequency-spatial attention Transformer (FSAT) module designed to effectively capture discriminate features from source images. This FSAT module includes a frequency-spatial attention mechanism (FSAM) capable of extracting significant features from feature maps. Additionally, we propose an improved Transformer module (ITM) to enhance the ability to extract global context information of vanilla Transformer. We conducted both qualitative and quantitative comparative experiments, demonstrating the superior fusion quality and efficiency of FSATFusion compared to other state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, our network was tested on two additional tasks without any modifications, to verify the excellent generalization capability of FSATFusion. Finally, the object detection experiment demonstrated the superiority of FSATFusion in downstream visual tasks. Our code is available at https://github.com/Lmmh058/FSATFusion.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Transformers with Insights from Image Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The self-attention mechanism, a cornerstone of Transformer-based state-of-the-art deep learning architectures, is largely heuristic-driven and fundamentally challenging to interpret. Establishing a robust theoretical foundation to explain its remarkable success and limitations has therefore become an increasingly prominent focus in recent research. Some notable directions have explored understanding self-attention through the lens of image denoising and nonparametric regression. While promising, existing frameworks still lack a deeper mechanistic interpretation of various architectural components that enhance self-attention, both in its original formulation and subsequent variants. In this work, we aim to advance this understanding by developing a unifying image processing framework, capable of explaining not only the self-attention computation itself but also the role of components such as positional encoding and residual connections, including numerous later variants. We also pinpoint potential distinctions between the two concepts building upon our framework, and make effort to close this gap. We introduce two independent architectural modifications within transformers. While our primary objective is interpretability, we empirically observe that image processing-inspired modifications can also lead to notably improved accuracy and robustness against data contamination and adversaries across language and vision tasks as well as better long sequence understanding.</description>

      <title>Leveraging 6DoF Pose Foundation Models For Mapping Marine Sediment Burial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The burial state of anthropogenic objects on the seafloor provides insight into localized sedimentation dynamics and is also critical for assessing ecological risks, potential pollutant transport, and the viability of recovery or mitigation strategies for hazardous materials such as munitions. Accurate burial depth estimation from remote imagery remains difficult due to partial occlusion, poor visibility, and object degradation. This work introduces a computer vision pipeline, called PoseIDON, which combines deep foundation model features with multiview photogrammetry to estimate six degrees of freedom object pose and the orientation of the surrounding seafloor from ROV video. Burial depth is inferred by aligning CAD models of the objects with observed imagery and fitting a local planar approximation of the seafloor. The method is validated using footage of 54 objects, including barrels and munitions, recorded at a historic ocean dumpsite in the San Pedro Basin. The model achieves a mean burial depth error of approximately 10 centimeters and resolves spatial burial patterns that reflect underlying sediment transport processes. This approach enables scalable, non-invasive mapping of seafloor burial and supports environmental assessment at contaminated sites.</description>

      <title>DART: Differentiable Dynamic Adaptive Region Tokenizer for Vision Transformer and Mamba</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, non-convolutional models such as the Vision Transformer (ViT) and Vision Mamba (Vim) have achieved remarkable performance in computer vision tasks. However, their reliance on fixed-size patches often results in excessive encoding of background regions and omission of critical local details, especially when informative objects are sparsely distributed. To address this, we introduce a fully differentiable Dynamic Adaptive Region Tokenizer (DART), which adaptively partitions images into content-dependent patches of varying sizes. DART combines learnable region scores with piecewise differentiable quantile operations to allocate denser tokens to information-rich areas. Despite introducing only approximately 1 million (1M) additional parameters, DART improves accuracy by 2.1% on DeiT (ImageNet-1K). Unlike methods that uniformly increase token density to capture fine-grained details, DART offers a more efficient alternative, achieving 45% FLOPs reduction with superior performance. Extensive experiments on DeiT, Vim, and VideoMamba confirm that DART consistently enhances accuracy while incurring minimal or even reduced computational overhead.

      <title>ReconMOST: Multi-Layer Sea Temperature Reconstruction with Observations-Guided Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate reconstruction of ocean is essential for reflecting global climate dynamics and supporting marine meteorological research. Conventional methods face challenges due to sparse data, algorithmic complexity, and high computational costs, while increasing usage of machine learning (ML) method remains limited to reconstruction problems at the sea surface and local regions, struggling with issues like cloud occlusion. To address these limitations, this paper proposes ReconMOST, a data-driven guided diffusion model framework for multi-layer sea temperature reconstruction. Specifically, we first pre-train an unconditional diffusion model using a large collection of historical numerical simulation data, enabling the model to attain physically consistent distribution patterns of ocean temperature fields. During the generation phase, sparse yet high-accuracy in-situ observational data are utilized as guidance points for the reverse diffusion process, generating accurate reconstruction results. Importantly, in regions lacking direct observational data, the physically consistent spatial distribution patterns learned during pre-training enable implicitly guided and physically plausible reconstructions. Our method extends ML-based SST reconstruction to a global, multi-layer setting, handling over 92.5% missing data while maintaining reconstruction accuracy, spatial resolution, and superior generalization capability. We pre-train our model on CMIP6 numerical simulation data and conduct guided reconstruction experiments on CMIP6 and EN4 analysis data. The results of mean squared error (MSE) values achieve 0.049 on guidance, 0.680 on reconstruction, and 0.633 on total, respectively, demonstrating the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed framework.

      <title>Pisces: An Auto-regressive Foundation Model for Image Understanding and Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled multimodal foundation models to tackle both image understanding and generation within a unified framework. Despite these gains, unified models often underperform compared to specialized models in either task. A key challenge in developing unified models lies in the inherent differences between the visual features needed for image understanding versus generation, as well as the distinct training processes required for each modality. In this work, we introduce Pisces, an auto-regressive multimodal foundation model that addresses this challenge through a novel decoupled visual encoding architecture and tailored training techniques optimized for multimodal generation. Combined with meticulous data curation, pretraining, and finetuning, Pisces achieves competitive performance in both image understanding and image generation. We evaluate Pisces on over 20 public benchmarks for image understanding, where it demonstrates strong performance across a wide range of tasks. Additionally, on GenEval, a widely adopted benchmark for image generation, Pisces exhibits robust generative capabilities. Our extensive analysis reveals the synergistic relationship between image understanding and generation, and the benefits of using separate visual encoders, advancing the field of unified multimodal models.</description>

      <title>It's Not the Target, It's the Background: Rethinking Infrared Small Target Detection via Deep Patch-Free Low-Rank Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Infrared small target detection (IRSTD) remains a long-standing challenge in complex backgrounds due to low signal-to-clutter ratios (SCR), diverse target morphologies, and the absence of distinctive visual cues. While recent deep learning approaches aim to learn discriminative representations, the intrinsic variability and weak priors of small targets often lead to unstable performance. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end IRSTD framework, termed LRRNet, which leverages the low-rank property of infrared image backgrounds. Inspired by the physical compressibility of cluttered scenes, our approach adopts a compression--reconstruction--subtraction (CRS) paradigm to directly model structure-aware low-rank background representations in the image domain, without relying on patch-based processing or explicit matrix decomposition. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to directly learn low-rank background structures using deep neural networks in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets demonstrate that LRRNet outperforms 38 state-of-the-art methods in terms of detection accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency. Remarkably, it achieves real-time performance with an average speed of 82.34 FPS. Evaluations on the challenging NoisySIRST dataset further confirm the model's resilience to sensor noise. The source code will be made publicly available upon acceptance.</description>

      <title>MF2Summ: Multimodal Fusion for Video Summarization with Temporal Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid proliferation of online video content necessitates effective video summarization techniques. Traditional methods, often relying on a single modality (typically visual), struggle to capture the full semantic richness of videos. This paper introduces MF2Summ, a novel video summarization model based on multimodal content understanding, integrating both visual and auditory information. MF2Summ employs a five-stage process: feature extraction, cross-modal attention interaction, feature fusion, segment prediction, and key shot selection. Visual features are extracted using a pre-trained GoogLeNet model, while auditory features are derived using SoundNet. The core of our fusion mechanism involves a cross-modal Transformer and an alignment-guided self-attention Transformer, designed to effectively model inter-modal dependencies and temporal correspondences. Segment importance, location, and center-ness are predicted, followed by key shot selection using Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) and the Kernel Temporal Segmentation (KTS) algorithm. Experimental results on the SumMe and TVSum datasets demonstrate that MF2Summ achieves competitive performance, notably improving F1-scores by 1.9\% and 0.6\% respectively over the DSNet model, and performing favorably against other state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Towards Robust Multimodal Emotion Recognition under Missing Modalities and Distribution Shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Multimodal Emotion Recognition (MER) face challenges in addressing both modality missing and Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) data simultaneously. Existing methods often rely on specific models or introduce excessive parameters, which limits their practicality. To address these issues, we propose a novel robust MER framework, Causal Inference Distiller (CIDer), and introduce a new task, Random Modality Feature Missing (RMFM), to generalize the definition of modality missing. CIDer integrates two key components: a Model-Specific Self-Distillation (MSSD) module and a Model-Agnostic Causal Inference (MACI) module. MSSD enhances robustness under the RMFM task through a weight-sharing self-distillation approach applied across low-level features, attention maps, and high-level representations. Additionally, a Word-level Self-aligned Attention Module (WSAM) reduces computational complexity, while a Multimodal Composite Transformer (MCT) facilitates efficient multimodal fusion. To tackle OOD challenges, MACI employs a tailored causal graph to mitigate label and language biases using a Multimodal Causal Module (MCM) and fine-grained counterfactual texts. Notably, MACI can independently enhance OOD generalization with minimal additional parameters. Furthermore, we also introduce the new repartitioned MER OOD datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that CIDer achieves robust performance in both RMFM and OOD scenarios, with fewer parameters and faster training compared to state-of-the-art methods. The implementation of this work is publicly accessible at https://github.com/gw-zhong/CIDer.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Generative Human Video Coding with Implicit Motion Transformation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Beyond traditional hybrid-based video codec, generative video codec could achieve promising compression performance by evolving high-dimensional signals into compact feature representations for bitstream compactness at the encoder side and developing explicit motion fields as intermediate supervision for high-quality reconstruction at the decoder side. This paradigm has achieved significant success in face video compression. However, compared to facial videos, human body videos pose greater challenges due to their more complex and diverse motion patterns, i.e., when using explicit motion guidance for Generative Human Video Coding (GHVC), the reconstruction results could suffer severe distortions and inaccurate motion. As such, this paper highlights the limitations of explicit motion-based approaches for human body video compression and investigates the GHVC performance improvement with the aid of Implicit Motion Transformation, namely IMT. In particular, we propose to characterize complex human body signal into compact visual features and transform these features into implicit motion guidance for signal reconstruction. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed IMT paradigm, which can facilitate GHVC to achieve high-efficiency compression and high-fidelity synthesis.</description>

      <title>Boosting Adversarial Transferability for Hyperspectral Image Classification Using 3D Structure-invariant Transformation and Intermediate Feature Distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which pose security challenges to hyperspectral image (HSI) classification technologies based on DNNs. In the domain of natural images, numerous transfer-based adversarial attack methods have been studied. However, HSIs differ from natural images due to their high-dimensional and rich spectral information. Current research on HSI adversarial examples remains limited and faces challenges in fully utilizing the structural and feature information of images. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel method to enhance the transferability of the adversarial examples for HSI classification models. First, while keeping the image structure unchanged, the proposed method randomly divides the image into blocks in both spatial and spectral dimensions. Then, various transformations are applied on a block by block basis to increase input diversity and mitigate overfitting. Second, a feature distancing loss targeting intermediate layers is designed, which measures the distance between the amplified features of the original examples and the features of the adversarial examples as the primary loss, while the output layer prediction serves as the auxiliary loss. This guides the perturbation to disrupt the features of the true class in adversarial examples, effectively enhancing transferability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the adversarial examples generated by the proposed method achieve effective transferability to black-box models on two public HSI datasets. Furthermore, the method maintains robust attack performance even under defense strategies.</description>

      <title>Starting Positions Matter: A Study on Better Weight Initialization for Neural Network Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep neural network (DNN) quantization for fast, efficient inference has been an important tool in limiting the cost of machine learning (ML) model inference. Quantization-specific model development techniques such as regularization, quantization-aware training, and quantization-robustness penalties have served to greatly boost the accuracy and robustness of modern DNNs. However, very little exploration has been done on improving the initial conditions of DNN training for quantization. Just as random weight initialization has been shown to significantly impact test accuracy of floating point models, it would make sense that different weight initialization methods impact quantization robustness of trained models. We present an extensive study examining the effects of different weight initializations on a variety of CNN building blocks commonly used in efficient CNNs. This analysis reveals that even with varying CNN architectures, the choice of random weight initializer can significantly affect final quantization robustness. Next, we explore a new method for quantization-robust CNN initialization -- using Graph Hypernetworks (GHN) to predict parameters of quantized DNNs. Besides showing that GHN-predicted parameters are quantization-robust after regular float32 pretraining (of the GHN), we find that finetuning GHNs to predict parameters for quantized graphs (which we call GHN-QAT) can further improve quantized accuracy of CNNs. Notably, GHN-QAT shows significant accuracy improvements for even 4-bit quantization and better-than-random accuracy for 2-bits. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first in-depth study on quantization-aware DNN weight initialization. GHN-QAT offers a novel approach to quantized DNN model design. Future investigations, such as using GHN-QAT-initialized parameters for quantization-aware training, can further streamline the DNN quantization process.</description>

      <title>MedSeg-R: Reasoning Segmentation in Medical Images with Multimodal Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medical image segmentation is crucial for clinical diagnosis, yet existing models are limited by their reliance on explicit human instructions and lack the active reasoning capabilities to understand complex clinical questions. While recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have improved medical question-answering (QA) tasks, most methods struggle to generate precise segmentation masks, limiting their application in automatic medical diagnosis. In this paper, we introduce medical image reasoning segmentation, a novel task that aims to generate segmentation masks based on complex and implicit medical instructions. To address this, we propose MedSeg-R, an end-to-end framework that leverages the reasoning abilities of MLLMs to interpret clinical questions while also capable of producing corresponding precise segmentation masks for medical images. It is built on two core components: 1) a global context understanding module that interprets images and comprehends complex medical instructions to generate multi-modal intermediate tokens, and 2) a pixel-level grounding module that decodes these tokens to produce precise segmentation masks and textual responses. Furthermore, we introduce MedSeg-QA, a large-scale dataset tailored for the medical image reasoning segmentation task. It includes over 10,000 image-mask pairs and multi-turn conversations, automatically annotated using large language models and refined through physician reviews. Experiments show MedSeg-R's superior performance across several benchmarks, achieving high segmentation accuracy and enabling interpretable textual analysis of medical images.</description>

      <title>LLMs Are Not Yet Ready for Deepfake Image Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing sophistication of deepfakes presents substantial challenges to the integrity of media and the preservation of public trust. Concurrently, vision-language models (VLMs), large language models enhanced with visual reasoning capabilities, have emerged as promising tools across various domains, sparking interest in their applicability to deepfake detection. This study conducts a structured zero-shot evaluation of four prominent VLMs: ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and Grok, focusing on three primary deepfake types: faceswap, reenactment, and synthetic generation. Leveraging a meticulously assembled benchmark comprising authentic and manipulated images from diverse sources, we evaluate each model's classification accuracy and reasoning depth. Our analysis indicates that while VLMs can produce coherent explanations and detect surface-level anomalies, they are not yet dependable as standalone detection systems. We highlight critical failure modes, such as an overemphasis on stylistic elements and vulnerability to misleading visual patterns like vintage aesthetics. Nevertheless, VLMs exhibit strengths in interpretability and contextual analysis, suggesting their potential to augment human expertise in forensic workflows. These insights imply that although general-purpose models currently lack the reliability needed for autonomous deepfake detection, they hold promise as integral components in hybrid or human-in-the-loop detection frameworks.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we introduce the Sheet Music Benchmark (SMB), a dataset of six hundred and eighty-five pages specifically designed to benchmark Optical Music Recognition (OMR) research. SMB encompasses a diverse array of musical textures, including monophony, pianoform, quartet, and others, all encoded in Common Western Modern Notation using the Humdrum **kern format. Alongside SMB, we introduce the OMR Normalized Edit Distance (OMR-NED), a new metric tailored explicitly for evaluating OMR performance. OMR-NED builds upon the widely-used Symbol Error Rate (SER), offering a fine-grained and detailed error analysis that covers individual musical elements such as note heads, beams, pitches, accidentals, and other critical notation features. The resulting numeric score provided by OMR-NED facilitates clear comparisons, enabling researchers and end-users alike to identify optimal OMR approaches. Our work thus addresses a long-standing gap in OMR evaluation, and we support our contributions with baseline experiments using standardized SMB dataset splits for training and assessing state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Class-Incremental Learning for Honey Botanical Origin Classification with Hyperspectral Images: A Study with Continual Backpropagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Honey is an important commodity in the global market. Honey types of different botanical origins provide diversified flavors and health benefits, thus having different market values. Developing accurate and effective botanical origin-distinguishing techniques is crucial to protect consumers' interests. However, it is impractical to collect all the varieties of honey products at once to train a model for botanical origin differentiation. Therefore, researchers developed class-incremental learning (CIL) techniques to address this challenge. This study examined and compared multiple CIL algorithms on a real-world honey hyperspectral imaging dataset. A novel technique is also proposed to improve the performance of class-incremental learning algorithms by combining with a continual backpropagation (CB) algorithm. The CB method addresses the issue of loss-of-plasticity by reinitializing a proportion of less-used hidden neurons to inject variability into neural networks. Experiments showed that CB improved the performance of most CIL methods by 1-7\%.</description>

      <title>Semantic Localization Guiding Segment Anything Model For Reference Remote Sensing Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Reference Remote Sensing Image Segmentation (RRSIS) task generates segmentation masks for specified objects in images based on textual descriptions, which has attracted widespread attention and research interest. Current RRSIS methods rely on multi-modal fusion backbones and semantic segmentation heads but face challenges like dense annotation requirements and complex scene interpretation. To address these issues, we propose a framework named \textit{prompt-generated semantic localization guiding Segment Anything Model}(PSLG-SAM), which decomposes the RRSIS task into two stages: coarse localization and fine segmentation. In coarse localization stage, a visual grounding network roughly locates the text-described object. In fine segmentation stage, the coordinates from the first stage guide the Segment Anything Model (SAM), enhanced by a clustering-based foreground point generator and a mask boundary iterative optimization strategy for precise segmentation. Notably, the second stage can be train-free, significantly reducing the annotation data burden for the RRSIS task. Additionally, decomposing the RRSIS task into two stages allows for focusing on specific region segmentation, avoiding interference from complex scenes.We further contribute a high-quality, multi-category manually annotated dataset. Experimental validation on two datasets (RRSIS-D and RRSIS-M) demonstrates that PSLG-SAM achieves significant performance improvements and surpasses existing state-of-the-art models.Our code will be made publicly available.</description>

      <title>J-DDL: Surface Damage Detection and Localization System for Fighter Aircraft</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensuring the safety and extended operational life of fighter aircraft necessitates frequent and exhaustive inspections. While surface defect detection is feasible for human inspectors, manual methods face critical limitations in scalability, efficiency, and consistency due to the vast surface area, structural complexity, and operational demands of aircraft maintenance. We propose a smart surface damage detection and localization system for fighter aircraft, termed J-DDL. J-DDL integrates 2D images and 3D point clouds of the entire aircraft surface, captured using a combined system of laser scanners and cameras, to achieve precise damage detection and localization. Central to our system is a novel damage detection network built on the YOLO architecture, specifically optimized for identifying surface defects in 2D aircraft images. Key innovations include lightweight Fasternet blocks for efficient feature extraction, an optimized neck architecture incorporating Efficient Multiscale Attention (EMA) modules for superior feature aggregation, and the introduction of a novel loss function, Inner-CIOU, to enhance detection accuracy. After detecting damage in 2D images, the system maps the identified anomalies onto corresponding 3D point clouds, enabling accurate 3D localization of defects across the aircraft surface. Our J-DDL not only streamlines the inspection process but also ensures more comprehensive and detailed coverage of large and complex aircraft exteriors. To facilitate further advancements in this domain, we have developed the first publicly available dataset specifically focused on aircraft damage. Experimental evaluations validate the effectiveness of our framework, underscoring its potential to significantly advance automated aircraft inspection technologies.</description>

      <title>CogStream: Context-guided Streaming Video Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite advancements in Video Large Language Models (Vid-LLMs) improving multimodal understanding, challenges persist in streaming video reasoning due to its reliance on contextual information. Existing paradigms feed all available historical contextual information into Vid-LLMs, resulting in a significant computational burden for visual data processing. Furthermore, the inclusion of irrelevant context distracts models from key details. This paper introduces a challenging task called Context-guided Streaming Video Reasoning (CogStream), which simulates real-world streaming video scenarios, requiring models to identify the most relevant historical contextual information to deduce answers for questions about the current stream. To support CogStream, we present a densely annotated dataset featuring extensive and hierarchical question-answer pairs, generated by a semi-automatic pipeline. Additionally, we present CogReasoner as a baseline model. It efficiently tackles this task by leveraging visual stream compression and historical dialogue retrieval. Extensive experiments prove the effectiveness of this method. Code will be released soon.</description>

Abstract: This paper introduces ALBERT, an instance segmentation model specifically designed for comprehensive car damage and part segmentation. Leveraging the power of Bidirectional Encoder Representations, ALBERT incorporates advanced localization mechanisms to accurately identify and differentiate between real and fake damages, as well as segment individual car parts.

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present SLICK, a novel framework for precise and robust car damage segmentation that leverages structural priors and domain knowledge to tackle real-world automotive inspection challenges. SLICK introduces five key components: (1) Selective Part Segmentation using a high-resolution semantic backbone guided by structural priors to achieve surgical accuracy in segmenting vehicle parts even under occlusion, deformation, or paint loss; (2) Localization-Aware Attention blocks that dynamically focus on damaged regions, enhancing fine-grained damage detection in cluttered and complex street scenes; (3) an Instance-Sensitive Refinement head that leverages panoptic cues and shape priors to disentangle overlapping or adjacent parts, enabling precise boundary alignment; (4) Cross-Channel Calibration through multi-scale channel attention that amplifies subtle damage signals such as scratches and dents while suppressing noise like reflections and decals; and (5) a Knowledge Fusion Module that integrates synthetic crash data, part geometry, and real-world insurance datasets to improve generalization and handle rare cases effectively. Experiments on large-scale automotive datasets demonstrate SLICK's superior segmentation performance, robustness, and practical applicability for insurance and automotive inspection workflows.</description>

      <title>ContextRefine-CLIP for EPIC-KITCHENS-100 Multi-Instance Retrieval Challenge 2025</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This report presents ContextRefine-CLIP (CR-CLIP), an efficient model for visual-textual multi-instance retrieval tasks. The approach is based on the dual-encoder AVION, on which we introduce a cross-modal attention flow module to achieve bidirectional dynamic interaction and refinement between visual and textual features to generate more context-aware joint representations. For soft-label relevance matrices provided in tasks such as EPIC-KITCHENS-100, CR-CLIP can work with Symmetric Multi-Similarity Loss to achieve more accurate semantic alignment and optimization using the refined features. Without using ensemble learning, the CR-CLIP model achieves 66.78mAP and 82.08nDCG on the EPIC-KITCHENS-100 public leaderboard, which significantly outperforms the baseline model and fully validates its effectiveness in cross-modal retrieval. The code will be released open-source on https://github.com/delCayr/ContextRefine-Clip</description>

      <title>From Images to Insights: Explainable Biodiversity Monitoring with Plain Language Habitat Explanations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Explaining why the species lives at a particular location is important for understanding ecological systems and conserving biodiversity. However, existing ecological workflows are fragmented and often inaccessible to non-specialists. We propose an end-to-end visual-to-causal framework that transforms a species image into interpretable causal insights about its habitat preference. The system integrates species recognition, global occurrence retrieval, pseudo-absence sampling, and climate data extraction. We then discover causal structures among environmental features and estimate their influence on species occurrence using modern causal inference methods. Finally, we generate statistically grounded, human-readable causal explanations from structured templates and large language models. We demonstrate the framework on a bee and a flower species and report early results as part of an ongoing project, showing the potential of the multimodal AI assistant backed up by a recommended ecological modeling practice for describing species habitat in human-understandable language.</description>

      <title>Balancing Tails when Comparing Distributions: Comprehensive Equity Index (CEI) with Application to Bias Evaluation in Operational Face Biometrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Demographic bias in high-performance face recognition (FR) systems often eludes detection by existing metrics, especially with respect to subtle disparities in the tails of the score distribution. We introduce the Comprehensive Equity Index (CEI), a novel metric designed to address this limitation. CEI uniquely analyzes genuine and impostor score distributions separately, enabling a configurable focus on tail probabilities while also considering overall distribution shapes. Our extensive experiments (evaluating state-of-the-art FR systems, intentionally biased models, and diverse datasets) confirm CEI's superior ability to detect nuanced biases where previous methods fall short. Furthermore, we present CEI^A, an automated version of the metric that enhances objectivity and simplifies practical application. CEI provides a robust and sensitive tool for operational FR fairness assessment. The proposed methods have been developed particularly for bias evaluation in face biometrics but, in general, they are applicable for comparing statistical distributions in any problem where one is interested in analyzing the distribution tails.</description>

      <title>LRSLAM: Low-rank Representation of Signed Distance Fields in Dense Visual SLAM System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) has been crucial across various domains, including autonomous driving, mobile robotics, and mixed reality. Dense visual SLAM, leveraging RGB-D camera systems, offers advantages but faces challenges in achieving real-time performance, robustness, and scalability for large-scale scenes. Recent approaches utilizing neural implicit scene representations show promise but suffer from high computational costs and memory requirements. ESLAM introduced a plane-based tensor decomposition but still struggled with memory growth. Addressing these challenges, we propose a more efficient visual SLAM model, called LRSLAM, utilizing low-rank tensor decomposition methods. Our approach, leveraging the Six-axis and CP decompositions, achieves better convergence rates, memory efficiency, and reconstruction/localization quality than existing state-of-the-art approaches. Evaluation across diverse indoor RGB-D datasets demonstrates LRSLAM's superior performance in terms of parameter efficiency, processing time, and accuracy, retaining reconstruction and localization quality. Our code will be publicly available upon publication.</description>

      <title>DreamActor-H1: High-Fidelity Human-Product Demonstration Video Generation via Motion-designed Diffusion Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In e-commerce and digital marketing, generating high-fidelity human-product demonstration videos is important for effective product presentation. However, most existing frameworks either fail to preserve the identities of both humans and products or lack an understanding of human-product spatial relationships, leading to unrealistic representations and unnatural interactions. To address these challenges, we propose a Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based framework. Our method simultaneously preserves human identities and product-specific details, such as logos and textures, by injecting paired human-product reference information and utilizing an additional masked cross-attention mechanism. We employ a 3D body mesh template and product bounding boxes to provide precise motion guidance, enabling intuitive alignment of hand gestures with product placements. Additionally, structured text encoding is used to incorporate category-level semantics, enhancing 3D consistency during small rotational changes across frames. Trained on a hybrid dataset with extensive data augmentation strategies, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in maintaining the identity integrity of both humans and products and generating realistic demonstration motions.

      <title>Improving Medical Visual Representation Learning with Pathological-level Cross-Modal Alignment and Correlation Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning medical visual representations from image-report pairs through joint learning has garnered increasing research attention due to its potential to alleviate the data scarcity problem in the medical domain. The primary challenges stem from the lengthy reports that feature complex discourse relations and semantic pathologies. Previous works have predominantly focused on instance-wise or token-wise cross-modal alignment, often neglecting the importance of pathological-level consistency. This paper presents a novel framework PLACE that promotes the Pathological-Level Alignment and enriches the fine-grained details via Correlation Exploration without additional human annotations. Specifically, we propose a novel pathological-level cross-modal alignment (PCMA) approach to maximize the consistency of pathology observations from both images and reports. To facilitate this, a Visual Pathology Observation Extractor is introduced to extract visual pathological observation representations from localized tokens. The PCMA module operates independently of any external disease annotations, enhancing the generalizability and robustness of our methods. Furthermore, we design a proxy task that enforces the model to identify correlations among image patches, thereby enriching the fine-grained details crucial for various downstream tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework achieves new state-of-the-art performance on multiple downstream tasks, including classification, image-to-text retrieval, semantic segmentation, object detection and report generation.</description>

      <title>DanceChat: Large Language Model-Guided Music-to-Dance Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Music-to-dance generation aims to synthesize human dance motion conditioned on musical input. Despite recent progress, significant challenges remain due to the semantic gap between music and dance motion, as music offers only abstract cues, such as melody, groove, and emotion, without explicitly specifying the physical movements. Moreover, a single piece of music can produce multiple plausible dance interpretations. This one-to-many mapping demands additional guidance, as music alone provides limited information for generating diverse dance movements. The challenge is further amplified by the scarcity of paired music and dance data, which restricts the model\^a\u{A}\'Zs ability to learn diverse dance patterns. In this paper, we introduce DanceChat, a Large Language Model (LLM)-guided music-to-dance generation approach. We use an LLM as a choreographer that provides textual motion instructions, offering explicit, high-level guidance for dance generation. This approach goes beyond implicit learning from music alone, enabling the model to generate dance that is both more diverse and better aligned with musical styles. Our approach consists of three components: (1) an LLM-based pseudo instruction generation module that produces textual dance guidance based on music style and structure, (2) a multi-modal feature extraction and fusion module that integrates music, rhythm, and textual guidance into a shared representation, and (3) a diffusion-based motion synthesis module together with a multi-modal alignment loss, which ensures that the generated dance is aligned with both musical and textual cues. Extensive experiments on AIST++ and human evaluations show that DanceChat outperforms state-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.</description>

      <title>Text to Image for Multi-Label Image Recognition with Joint Prompt-Adapter Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Benefited from image-text contrastive learning, pre-trained vision-language models, e.g., CLIP, allow to direct leverage texts as images (TaI) for parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). While CLIP is capable of making image features to be similar to the corresponding text features, the modality gap remains a nontrivial issue and limits image recognition performance of TaI. Using multi-label image recognition (MLR) as an example, we present a novel method, called T2I-PAL to tackle the modality gap issue when using only text captions for PEFT. The core design of T2I-PAL is to leverage pre-trained text-to-image generation models to generate photo-realistic and diverse images from text captions, thereby reducing the modality gap. To further enhance MLR, T2I-PAL incorporates a class-wise heatmap and learnable prototypes. This aggregates local similarities, making the representation of local visual features more robust and informative for multi-label recognition. For better PEFT, we further combine both prompt tuning and adapter learning to enhance classification performance. T2I-PAL offers significant advantages: it eliminates the need for fully semantically annotated training images, thereby reducing the manual annotation workload, and it preserves the intrinsic mode of the CLIP model, allowing for seamless integration with any existing CLIP framework. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks, including MS-COCO, VOC2007, and NUS-WIDE, show that our T2I-PAL can boost recognition performance by 3.47% in average above the top-ranked state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Harmonizing Geometry and Uncertainty: Diffusion with Hyperspheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Do contemporary diffusion models preserve the class geometry of hyperspherical data? Standard diffusion models rely on isotropic Gaussian noise in the forward process, inherently favoring Euclidean spaces. However, many real-world problems involve non-Euclidean distributions, such as hyperspherical manifolds, where class-specific patterns are governed by angular geometry within hypercones. When modeled in Euclidean space, these angular subtleties are lost, leading to suboptimal generative performance. To address this limitation, we introduce HyperSphereDiff to align hyperspherical structures with directional noise, preserving class geometry and effectively capturing angular uncertainty. We demonstrate both theoretically and empirically that this approach aligns the generative process with the intrinsic geometry of hyperspherical data, resulting in more accurate and geometry-aware generative models. We evaluate our framework on four object datasets and two face datasets, showing that incorporating angular uncertainty better preserves the underlying hyperspherical manifold.

      <title>Rethinking Random Masking in Self Distillation on ViT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across a wide range of vision tasks. In particular, self-distillation frameworks such as DINO have contributed significantly to these advances. Within such frameworks, random masking is often utilized to improve training efficiency and introduce regularization. However, recent studies have raised concerns that indiscriminate random masking may inadvertently eliminate critical semantic information, motivating the development of more informed masking strategies. In this study, we explore the role of random masking in the self-distillation setting, focusing on the DINO framework. Specifically, we apply random masking exclusively to the student's global view, while preserving the student's local views and the teacher's global view in their original, unmasked forms. This design leverages DINO's multi-view augmentation scheme to retain clean supervision while inducing robustness through masked inputs. We evaluate our approach using DINO-Tiny on the mini-ImageNet dataset and show that random masking under this asymmetric setup yields more robust and fine-grained attention maps, ultimately enhancing downstream performance.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Error Assessment of CAD Models for Aircraft Manufacturing-and-Measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The most essential feature of aviation equipment is high quality, including high performance, high stability and high reliability. In this paper, we propose a novel hierarchical error assessment framework for aircraft CAD models within a manufacturing-and-measurement platform, termed HEA-MM. HEA-MM employs structured light scanners to obtain comprehensive 3D measurements of manufactured workpieces. The measured point cloud is registered with the reference CAD model, followed by an error analysis conducted at three hierarchical levels: global, part, and feature. At the global level, the error analysis evaluates the overall deviation of the scanned point cloud from the reference CAD model. At the part level, error analysis is performed on these patches underlying the point clouds. We propose a novel optimization-based primitive refinement method to obtain a set of meaningful patches of point clouds. Two basic operations, splitting and merging, are introduced to refine the coarse primitives. At the feature level, error analysis is performed on circular holes, which are commonly found in CAD models. To facilitate it, a two-stage algorithm is introduced for the detection of circular holes. First, edge points are identified using a tensor-voting algorithm. Then, multiple circles are fitted through a hypothesize-and-clusterize framework, ensuring accurate detection and analysis of the circular features. Experimental results on various aircraft CAD models demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.</description>

      <title>Semantic-decoupled Spatial Partition Guided Point-supervised Oriented Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent remote sensing tech advancements drive imagery growth, making oriented object detection rapid development, yet hindered by labor-intensive annotation for high-density scenes. Oriented object detection with point supervision offers a cost-effective solution for densely packed scenes in remote sensing, yet existing methods suffer from inadequate sample assignment and instance confusion due to rigid rule-based designs. To address this, we propose SSP (Semantic-decoupled Spatial Partition), a unified framework that synergizes rule-driven prior injection and data-driven label purification. Specifically, SSP introduces two core innovations: 1) Pixel-level Spatial Partition-based Sample Assignment, which compactly estimates the upper and lower bounds of object scales and mines high-quality positive samples and hard negative samples through spatial partitioning of pixel maps. 2) Semantic Spatial Partition-based Box Extraction, which derives instances from spatial partitions modulated by semantic maps and reliably converts them into bounding boxes to form pseudo-labels for supervising the learning of downstream detectors. Experiments on DOTA-v1.0 and others demonstrate SSP\' s superiority: it achieves 45.78% mAP under point supervision, outperforming SOTA method PointOBB-v2 by 4.10%. Furthermore, when integrated with ORCNN and ReDet architectures, the SSP framework achieves mAP values of 47.86% and 48.50%, respectively.

      <title>High-resolution efficient image generation from WiFi CSI using a pretrained latent diffusion model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present LatentCSI, a novel method for generating images of the physical environment from WiFi CSI measurements that leverages a pretrained latent diffusion model (LDM). Unlike prior approaches that rely on complex and computationally intensive techniques such as GANs, our method employs a lightweight neural network to map CSI amplitudes directly into the latent space of an LDM. We then apply the LDM's denoising diffusion model to the latent representation with text-based guidance before decoding using the LDM's pretrained decoder to obtain a high-resolution image. This design bypasses the challenges of pixel-space image generation and avoids the explicit image encoding stage typically required in conventional image-to-image pipelines, enabling efficient and high-quality image synthesis. We validate our approach on two datasets: a wide-band CSI dataset we collected with off-the-shelf WiFi devices and cameras; and a subset of the publicly available MM-Fi dataset. The results demonstrate that LatentCSI outperforms baselines of comparable complexity trained directly on ground-truth images in both computational efficiency and perceptual quality, while additionally providing practical advantages through its unique capacity for text-guided controllability.</description>

      <title>MSTAR: Box-free Multi-query Scene Text Retrieval with Attention Recycling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scene text retrieval has made significant progress with the assistance of accurate text localization. However, existing approaches typically require costly bounding box annotations for training. Besides, they mostly adopt a customized retrieval strategy but struggle to unify various types of queries to meet diverse retrieval needs. To address these issues, we introduce Muti-query Scene Text retrieval with Attention Recycling (MSTAR), a box-free approach for scene text retrieval. It incorporates progressive vision embedding to dynamically capture the multi-grained representation of texts and harmonizes free-style text queries with style-aware instructions. Additionally, a multi-instance matching module is integrated to enhance vision-language alignment. Furthermore, we build the Multi-Query Text Retrieval (MQTR) dataset, the first benchmark designed to evaluate the multi-query scene text retrieval capability of models, comprising four query types and 16k images. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method across seven public datasets and the MQTR dataset. Notably, MSTAR marginally surpasses the previous state-of-the-art model by 6.4% in MAP on Total-Text while eliminating box annotation costs. Moreover, on the MQTR benchmark, MSTAR significantly outperforms the previous models by an average of 8.5%. The code and datasets are available at https://github.com/yingift/MSTAR.</description>

      <title>TexTailor: Customized Text-aligned Texturing via Effective Resampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present TexTailor, a novel method for generating consistent object textures from textual descriptions. Existing text-to-texture synthesis approaches utilize depth-aware diffusion models to progressively generate images and synthesize textures across predefined multiple viewpoints. However, these approaches lead to a gradual shift in texture properties across viewpoints due to (1) insufficient integration of previously synthesized textures at each viewpoint during the diffusion process and (2) the autoregressive nature of the texture synthesis process. Moreover, the predefined selection of camera positions, which does not account for the object's geometry, limits the effective use of texture information synthesized from different viewpoints, ultimately degrading overall texture consistency. In TexTailor, we address these issues by (1) applying a resampling scheme that repeatedly integrates information from previously synthesized textures within the diffusion process, and (2) fine-tuning a depth-aware diffusion model on these resampled textures. During this process, we observed that using only a few training images restricts the model's original ability to generate high-fidelity images aligned with the conditioning, and therefore propose an performance preservation loss to mitigate this issue. Additionally, we improve the synthesis of view-consistent textures by adaptively adjusting camera positions based on the object's geometry. Experiments on a subset of the Objaverse dataset and the ShapeNet car dataset demonstrate that TexTailor outperforms state-of-the-art methods in synthesizing view-consistent textures.

      <title>Anatomy-Grounded Weakly Supervised Prompt Tuning for Chest X-ray Latent Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Latent Diffusion Models have shown remarkable results in text-guided image synthesis in recent years. In the domain of natural (RGB) images, recent works have shown that such models can be adapted to various vision-language downstream tasks with little to no supervision involved. On the contrary, text-to-image Latent Diffusion Models remain relatively underexplored in the field of medical imaging, primarily due to limited data availability (e.g., due to privacy concerns). In this work, focusing on the chest X-ray modality, we first demonstrate that a standard text-conditioned Latent Diffusion Model has not learned to align clinically relevant information in free-text radiology reports with the corresponding areas of the given scan. Then, to alleviate this issue, we propose a fine-tuning framework to improve multi-modal alignment in a pre-trained model such that it can be efficiently repurposed for downstream tasks such as phrase grounding. Our method sets a new state-of-the-art on a standard benchmark dataset (MS-CXR), while also exhibiting robust performance on out-of-distribution data (VinDr-CXR). Our code will be made publicly available.</description>

      <title>Symmetrical Flow Matching: Unified Image Generation, Segmentation, and Classification with Score-Based Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flow Matching has emerged as a powerful framework for learning continuous transformations between distributions, enabling high-fidelity generative modeling. This work introduces Symmetrical Flow Matching (SymmFlow), a new formulation that unifies semantic segmentation, classification, and image generation within a single model. Using a symmetric learning objective, SymmFlow models forward and reverse transformations jointly, ensuring bi-directional consistency, while preserving sufficient entropy for generative diversity. A new training objective is introduced to explicitly retain semantic information across flows, featuring efficient sampling while preserving semantic structure, allowing for one-step segmentation and classification without iterative refinement. Unlike previous approaches that impose strict one-to-one mapping between masks and images, SymmFlow generalizes to flexible conditioning, supporting both pixel-level and image-level class labels. Experimental results on various benchmarks demonstrate that SymmFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance on semantic image synthesis, obtaining FID scores of 11.9 on CelebAMask-HQ and 7.0 on COCO-Stuff with only 25 inference steps. Additionally, it delivers competitive results on semantic segmentation and shows promising capabilities in classification tasks. The code will be publicly available.</description>

      <title>GigaVideo-1: Advancing Video Generation via Automatic Feedback with 4 GPU-Hours Fine-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent progress in diffusion models has greatly enhanced video generation quality, yet these models still require fine-tuning to improve specific dimensions like instance preservation, motion rationality, composition, and physical plausibility. Existing fine-tuning approaches often rely on human annotations and large-scale computational resources, limiting their practicality. In this work, we propose GigaVideo-1, an efficient fine-tuning framework that advances video generation without additional human supervision. Rather than injecting large volumes of high-quality data from external sources, GigaVideo-1 unlocks the latent potential of pre-trained video diffusion models through automatic feedback. Specifically, we focus on two key aspects of the fine-tuning process: data and optimization. To improve fine-tuning data, we design a prompt-driven data engine that constructs diverse, weakness-oriented training samples. On the optimization side, we introduce a reward-guided training strategy, which adaptively weights samples using feedback from pre-trained vision-language models with a realism constraint. We evaluate GigaVideo-1 on the VBench-2.0 benchmark using Wan2.1 as the baseline across 17 evaluation dimensions. Experiments show that GigaVideo-1 consistently improves performance on almost all the dimensions with an average gain of about 4% using only 4 GPU-hours. Requiring no manual annotations and minimal real data, GigaVideo-1 demonstrates both effectiveness and efficiency. Code, model, and data will be publicly available.</description>

      <title>PiPViT: Patch-based Visual Interpretable Prototypes for Retinal Image Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background and Objective: Prototype-based methods improve interpretability by learning fine-grained part-prototypes; however, their visualization in the input pixel space is not always consistent with human-understandable biomarkers. In addition, well-known prototype-based approaches typically learn extremely granular prototypes that are less interpretable in medical imaging, where both the presence and extent of biomarkers and lesions are critical.
  Methods: To address these challenges, we propose PiPViT (Patch-based Visual Interpretable Prototypes), an inherently interpretable prototypical model for image recognition. Leveraging a vision transformer (ViT), PiPViT captures long-range dependencies among patches to learn robust, human-interpretable prototypes that approximate lesion extent only using image-level labels. Additionally, PiPViT benefits from contrastive learning and multi-resolution input processing, which enables effective localization of biomarkers across scales.
  Results: We evaluated PiPViT on retinal OCT image classification across four datasets, where it achieved competitive quantitative performance compared to state-of-the-art methods while delivering more meaningful explanations. Moreover, quantitative evaluation on a hold-out test set confirms that the learned prototypes are semantically and clinically relevant. We believe PiPViT can transparently explain its decisions and assist clinicians in understanding diagnostic outcomes. Github page: https://github.com/marziehoghbaie/PiPViT</description>

      <title>Enhancing Deepfake Detection using SE Block Attention with CNN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the digital age, Deepfake present a formidable challenge by using advanced artificial intelligence to create highly convincing manipulated content, undermining information authenticity and security. These sophisticated fabrications surpass traditional detection methods in complexity and realism. To address this issue, we aim to harness cutting-edge deep learning methodologies to engineer an innovative deepfake detection model. However, most of the models designed for deepfake detection are large, causing heavy storage and memory consumption. In this research, we propose a lightweight convolution neural network (CNN) with squeeze and excitation block attention (SE) for Deepfake detection. The SE block module is designed to perform dynamic channel-wise feature recalibration. The SE block allows the network to emphasize informative features and suppress less useful ones, which leads to a more efficient and effective learning module. This module is integrated with a simple sequential model to perform Deepfake detection. The model is smaller in size and it achieves competing accuracy with the existing models for deepfake detection tasks. The model achieved an overall classification accuracy of 94.14% and AUC-ROC score of 0.985 on the Style GAN dataset from the Diverse Fake Face Dataset. Our proposed approach presents a promising avenue for combating the Deepfake challenge with minimal computational resources, developing efficient and scalable solutions for digital content verification.</description>

      <title>Unsourced Adversarial CAPTCHA: A Bi-Phase Adversarial CAPTCHA Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid advancements in deep learning, traditional CAPTCHA schemes are increasingly vulnerable to automated attacks powered by deep neural networks (DNNs). Existing adversarial attack methods often rely on original image characteristics, resulting in distortions that hinder human interpretation and limit applicability in scenarios lacking initial input images. To address these challenges, we propose the Unsourced Adversarial CAPTCHA (UAC), a novel framework generating high-fidelity adversarial examples guided by attacker-specified text prompts. Leveraging a Large Language Model (LLM), UAC enhances CAPTCHA diversity and supports both targeted and untargeted attacks. For targeted attacks, the EDICT method optimizes dual latent variables in a diffusion model for superior image quality. In untargeted attacks, especially for black-box scenarios, we introduce bi-path unsourced adversarial CAPTCHA (BP-UAC), a two-step optimization strategy employing multimodal gradients and bi-path optimization for efficient misclassification. Experiments show BP-UAC achieves high attack success rates across diverse systems, generating natural CAPTCHAs indistinguishable to humans and DNNs.</description>

      <title>Underage Detection through a Multi-Task and MultiAge Approach for Screening Minors in Unconstrained Imagery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate automatic screening of minors in unconstrained images demands models that are robust to distribution shift and resilient to the children under-representation in publicly available data. To overcome these issues, we propose a multi-task architecture with dedicated under/over-age discrimination tasks based on a frozen FaRL vision-language backbone joined with a compact two-layer MLP that shares features across one age-regression head and four binary under-age heads for age thresholds of 12, 15, 18, and 21 years, focusing on the legally critical age range. To address the severe class imbalance, we introduce an $\alpha$-reweighted focal-style loss and age-balanced mini-batch sampling, which equalizes twelve age bins during stochastic optimization. Further improvement is achieved with an age gap that removes edge cases from the loss.
  Moreover, we set a rigorous evaluation by proposing the Overall Under-Age Benchmark, with 303k cleaned training images and 110k test images, defining both the "ASORES-39k" restricted overall test, which removes the noisiest domains, and the age estimation wild shifts test "ASWIFT-20k" of 20k-images, stressing extreme pose ($&gt;$45{\deg}), expression, and low image quality to emulate real-world shifts.
  Trained on the cleaned overall set with resampling and age gap, our multiage model "F" lowers the root-mean-square-error on the ASORES-39k restricted test from 5.733 (age-only baseline) to 5.656 years and lifts under-18 detection from F2 score of 0.801 to 0.857 at 1% false-adult rate. Under the domain shift to the wild data of ASWIFT-20k, the same configuration nearly sustains 0.99 recall while boosting F2 from 0.742 to 0.833 with respect to the age-only baseline, demonstrating strong generalization under distribution shift. For the under-12 and under-15 tasks, the respective boosts in F2 are from 0.666 to 0.955 and from 0.689 to 0.916, respectively.</description>

      <title>Continual Hyperbolic Learning of Instances and Classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continual learning has traditionally focused on classifying either instances or classes, but real-world applications, such as robotics and self-driving cars, require models to handle both simultaneously. To mirror real-life scenarios, we introduce the task of continual learning of instances and classes, at the same time. This task challenges models to adapt to multiple levels of granularity over time, which requires balancing fine-grained instance recognition with coarse-grained class generalization. In this paper, we identify that classes and instances naturally form a hierarchical structure. To model these hierarchical relationships, we propose HyperCLIC, a continual learning algorithm that leverages hyperbolic space, which is uniquely suited for hierarchical data due to its ability to represent tree-like structures with low distortion and compact embeddings. Our framework incorporates hyperbolic classification and distillation objectives, enabling the continual embedding of hierarchical relations. To evaluate performance across multiple granularities, we introduce continual hierarchical metrics. We validate our approach on EgoObjects, the only dataset that captures the complexity of hierarchical object recognition in dynamic real-world environments. Empirical results show that HyperCLIC operates effectively at multiple granularities with improved hierarchical generalization.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty-Masked Bernoulli Diffusion for Camouflaged Object Detection Refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Camouflaged Object Detection (COD) presents inherent challenges due to the subtle visual differences between targets and their backgrounds. While existing methods have made notable progress, there remains significant potential for post-processing refinement that has yet to be fully explored. To address this limitation, we propose the Uncertainty-Masked Bernoulli Diffusion (UMBD) model, the first generative refinement framework specifically designed for COD. UMBD introduces an uncertainty-guided masking mechanism that selectively applies Bernoulli diffusion to residual regions with poor segmentation quality, enabling targeted refinement while preserving correctly segmented areas. To support this process, we design the Hybrid Uncertainty Quantification Network (HUQNet), which employs a multi-branch architecture and fuses uncertainty from multiple sources to improve estimation accuracy. This enables adaptive guidance during the generative sampling process. The proposed UMBD framework can be seamlessly integrated with a wide range of existing Encoder-Decoder-based COD models, combining their discriminative capabilities with the generative advantages of diffusion-based refinement. Extensive experiments across multiple COD benchmarks demonstrate consistent performance improvements, achieving average gains of 5.5% in MAE and 3.2% in weighted F-measure with only modest computational overhead. Code will be released.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning-based Multi Project InP Wafer Simulation for Unsupervised Surface Defect Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quality management in semiconductor manufacturing often relies on template matching with known golden standards. For Indium-Phosphide (InP) multi-project wafer manufacturing, low production scale and high design variability lead to such golden standards being typically unavailable. Defect detection, in turn, is manual and labor-intensive. This work addresses this challenge by proposing a methodology to generate a synthetic golden standard using Deep Neural Networks, trained to simulate photo-realistic InP wafer images from CAD data. We evaluate various training objectives and assess the quality of the simulated images on both synthetic data and InP wafer photographs. Our deep-learning-based method outperforms a baseline decision-tree-based approach, enabling the use of a 'simulated golden die' from CAD plans in any user-defined region of a wafer for more efficient defect detection. We apply our method to a template matching procedure, to demonstrate its practical utility in surface defect detection.</description>

      <title>IQE-CLIP: Instance-aware Query Embedding for Zero-/Few-shot Anomaly Detection in Medical Domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models, such as CLIP, have significantly improved performance in zero- and few-shot anomaly detection (ZFSAD) tasks. However, most existing CLIP-based methods assume prior knowledge of categories and rely on carefully designed prompts tailored to specific scenarios. While these text prompts capture semantic information in the textual space, they often fail to distinguish normal and anomalous instances in the joint embedding space. Moreover, most ZFSAD approaches focus on industrial domains, with limited exploration in medical tasks. To address these limitations, we propose IQE-CLIP, a novel framework for ZFSAD in the medical domain. We show that query embeddings integrating both textual and instance-aware visual information serve as more effective indicators of anomalies. Specifically, we introduce class-based and learnable prompting tokens to better adapt CLIP to the medical setting. Furthermore, we design an instance-aware query module that extracts region-level contextual information from both modalities, enabling the generation of anomaly-sensitive embeddings. Extensive experiments on six medical datasets demonstrate that IQE-CLIP achieves state-of-the-art performance in both zero-shot and few-shot settings. Code and data are available at \href{https://github.com/hongh0/IQE-CLIP/}{this https URL}.</description>

      <title>PosterCraft: Rethinking High-Quality Aesthetic Poster Generation in a Unified Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating aesthetic posters is more challenging than simple design images: it requires not only precise text rendering but also the seamless integration of abstract artistic content, striking layouts, and overall stylistic harmony. To address this, we propose PosterCraft, a unified framework that abandons prior modular pipelines and rigid, predefined layouts, allowing the model to freely explore coherent, visually compelling compositions. PosterCraft employs a carefully designed, cascaded workflow to optimize the generation of high-aesthetic posters: (i) large-scale text-rendering optimization on our newly introduced Text-Render-2M dataset; (ii) region-aware supervised fine-tuning on HQ-Poster100K; (iii) aesthetic-text-reinforcement learning via best-of-n preference optimization; and (iv) joint vision-language feedback refinement. Each stage is supported by a fully automated data-construction pipeline tailored to its specific needs, enabling robust training without complex architectural modifications. Evaluated on multiple experiments, PosterCraft significantly outperforms open-source baselines in rendering accuracy, layout coherence, and overall visual appeal-approaching the quality of SOTA commercial systems. Our code, models, and datasets can be found in the Project page: https://ephemeral182.github.io/PosterCraft</description>

      <title>Stroke-based Cyclic Amplifier: Image Super-Resolution at Arbitrary Ultra-Large Scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prior Arbitrary-Scale Image Super-Resolution (ASISR) methods often experience a significant performance decline when the upsampling factor exceeds the range covered by the training data, introducing substantial blurring. To address this issue, we propose a unified model, Stroke-based Cyclic Amplifier (SbCA), for ultra-large upsampling tasks. The key of SbCA is the stroke vector amplifier, which decomposes the image into a series of strokes represented as vector graphics for magnification. Then, the detail completion module also restores missing details, ensuring high-fidelity image reconstruction. Our cyclic strategy achieves ultra-large upsampling by iteratively refining details with this unified SbCA model, trained only once for all, while keeping sub-scales within the training range. Our approach effectively addresses the distribution drift issue and eliminates artifacts, noise and blurring, producing high-quality, high-resolution super-resolved images. Experimental validations on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods in ultra-large upsampling tasks (e.g. $\times100$), delivering visual quality far superior to state-of-the-art techniques.</description>

      <title>SlotPi: Physics-informed Object-centric Reasoning Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding and reasoning about dynamics governed by physical laws through visual observation, akin to human capabilities in the real world, poses significant challenges. Currently, object-centric dynamic simulation methods, which emulate human behavior, have achieved notable progress but overlook two critical aspects: 1) the integration of physical knowledge into models. Humans gain physical insights by observing the world and apply this knowledge to accurately reason about various dynamic scenarios; 2) the validation of model adaptability across diverse scenarios. Real-world dynamics, especially those involving fluids and objects, demand models that not only capture object interactions but also simulate fluid flow characteristics. To address these gaps, we introduce SlotPi, a slot-based physics-informed object-centric reasoning model. SlotPi integrates a physical module based on Hamiltonian principles with a spatio-temporal prediction module for dynamic forecasting. Our experiments highlight the model's strengths in tasks such as prediction and Visual Question Answering (VQA) on benchmark and fluid datasets. Furthermore, we have created a real-world dataset encompassing object interactions, fluid dynamics, and fluid-object interactions, on which we validated our model's capabilities. The model's robust performance across all datasets underscores its strong adaptability, laying a foundation for developing more advanced world models.</description>

      <title>Human-Robot Navigation using Event-based Cameras and Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces a robot navigation controller that combines event cameras and other sensors with reinforcement learning to enable real-time human-centered navigation and obstacle avoidance. Unlike conventional image-based controllers, which operate at fixed rates and suffer from motion blur and latency, this approach leverages the asynchronous nature of event cameras to process visual information over flexible time intervals, enabling adaptive inference and control. The framework integrates event-based perception, additional range sensing, and policy optimization via Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient, with an initial imitation learning phase to improve sample efficiency. Promising results are achieved in simulated environments, demonstrating robust navigation, pedestrian following, and obstacle avoidance. A demo video is available at the project website.</description>

      <title>Prompts to Summaries: Zero-Shot Language-Guided Video Summarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The explosive growth of video data intensified the need for flexible user-controllable summarization tools that can operate without domain-specific training data. Existing methods either rely on datasets, limiting generalization, or cannot incorporate user intent expressed in natural language. We introduce Prompts-to-Summaries: the first zero-shot, text-queryable video summarizer that converts off-the-shelf video-language models (VidLMs) captions into user-guided skims via large language models (LLMs) judging, without the use of training data at all, beating all unsupervised and matching supervised methods. Our pipeline (i) segments raw video footage into coherent scenes, (ii) generates rich scene-level descriptions through a memory-efficient, batch-style VidLM prompting scheme that scales to hours-long videos on a single GPU, (iii) leverages an LLM as a judge to assign scene-level importance scores under a carefully crafted prompt, and finally, (iv) propagates those scores to short segments level via two new metrics: consistency (temporal coherency) and uniqueness (novelty), yielding fine-grained frame importance. On SumMe and TVSum, our data-free approach surpasses all prior data-hungry unsupervised methods. It also performs competitively on the Query-Focused Video Summarization (QFVS) benchmark, despite using no training data and the competing methods requiring supervised frame-level importance. To spur further research, we release VidSum-Reason, a new query-driven dataset featuring long-tailed concepts and multi-step reasoning; our framework attains robust F1 scores and serves as the first challenging baseline. Overall, our results demonstrate that pretrained multimodal models, when orchestrated with principled prompting and score propagation, already provide a powerful foundation for universal, text-queryable video summarization.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Deformable Image Registration with Structural Nonparametric Smoothing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning-based deformable image registration (DIR) accelerates alignment by amortizing traditional optimization via neural networks. Label supervision further enhances accuracy, enabling efficient and precise nonlinear alignment of unseen scans. However, images with sparse features amid large smooth regions, such as retinal vessels, introduce aperture and large-displacement challenges that unsupervised DIR methods struggle to address. This limitation occurs because neural networks predict deformation fields in a single forward pass, leaving fields unconstrained post-training and shifting the regularization burden entirely to network weights. To address these issues, we introduce SmoothProper, a plug-and-play neural module enforcing smoothness and promoting message passing within the network's forward pass. By integrating a duality-based optimization layer with tailored interaction terms, SmoothProper efficiently propagates flow signals across spatial locations, enforces smoothness, and preserves structural consistency. It is model-agnostic, seamlessly integrates into existing registration frameworks with minimal parameter overhead, and eliminates regularizer hyperparameter tuning. Preliminary results on a retinal vessel dataset exhibiting aperture and large-displacement challenges demonstrate our method reduces registration error to 1.88 pixels on 2912x2912 images, marking the first unsupervised DIR approach to effectively address both challenges. The source code will be available at https://github.com/tinymilky/SmoothProper.</description>

      <title>Occlusion-Aware 3D Hand-Object Pose Estimation with Masked AutoEncoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hand-object pose estimation from monocular RGB images remains a significant challenge mainly due to the severe occlusions inherent in hand-object interactions. Existing methods do not sufficiently explore global structural perception and reasoning, which limits their effectiveness in handling occluded hand-object interactions. To address this challenge, we propose an occlusion-aware hand-object pose estimation method based on masked autoencoders, termed as HOMAE. Specifically, we propose a target-focused masking strategy that imposes structured occlusion on regions of hand-object interaction, encouraging the model to learn context-aware features and reason about the occluded structures. We further integrate multi-scale features extracted from the decoder to predict a signed distance field (SDF), capturing both global context and fine-grained geometry. To enhance geometric perception, we combine the implicit SDF with an explicit point cloud derived from the SDF, leveraging the complementary strengths of both representations. This fusion enables more robust handling of occluded regions by combining the global context from the SDF with the precise local geometry provided by the point cloud. Extensive experiments on challenging DexYCB and HO3Dv2 benchmarks demonstrate that HOMAE achieves state-of-the-art performance in hand-object pose estimation. We will release our code and model.</description>

      <title>VideoDeepResearch: Long Video Understanding With Agentic Tool Using</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long video understanding (LVU) presents a significant challenge for current multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) due to the task's inherent complexity and context window constraint. It is widely assumed that addressing LVU tasks requires foundation MLLMs with extended context windows, strong visual perception capabilities, and proficient domain expertise. In this work, we challenge this common belief by introducing VideoDeepResearch, a novel agentic framework for long video understanding. Our approach relies solely on a text-only large reasoning model (LRM) combined with a modular multi-modal toolkit, including multimodal retrievers and visual perceivers, all of which are readily available in practice. For each LVU task, the system formulates a problem-solving strategy through reasoning, while selectively accessing and utilizing essential video content via tool using. We conduct extensive experiments on popular LVU benchmarks, including MLVU, Video-MME, and LVBench. Our results demonstrate that VideoDeepResearch achieves substantial improvements over existing MLLM baselines, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art by 9.6%, 6.6%, and 3.9% on MLVU (test), LVBench, and LongVideoBench, respectively. These findings highlight the promise of agentic systems in overcoming key challenges in LVU problems.</description>

      <title>Post-Training Quantization for Video Matting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video matting is crucial for applications such as film production and virtual reality, yet deploying its computationally intensive models on resource-constrained devices presents challenges. Quantization is a key technique for model compression and acceleration. As an efficient approach, Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) is still in its nascent stages for video matting, facing significant hurdles in maintaining accuracy and temporal coherence. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel and general PTQ framework specifically designed for video matting models, marking, to the best of our knowledge, the first systematic attempt in this domain. Our contributions include: (1) A two-stage PTQ strategy that combines block-reconstruction-based optimization for fast, stable initial quantization and local dependency capture, followed by a global calibration of quantization parameters to minimize accuracy loss. (2) A Statistically-Driven Global Affine Calibration (GAC) method that enables the network to compensate for cumulative statistical distortions arising from factors such as neglected BN layer effects, even reducing the error of existing PTQ methods on video matting tasks up to 20%. (3) An Optical Flow Assistance (OFA) component that leverages temporal and semantic priors from frames to guide the PTQ process, enhancing the model's ability to distinguish moving foregrounds in complex scenes and ultimately achieving near full-precision performance even under ultra-low-bit quantization. Comprehensive quantitative and visual results show that our PTQ4VM achieves the state-of-the-art accuracy performance across different bit-widths compared to the existing quantization methods. We highlight that the 4-bit PTQ4VM even achieves performance close to the full-precision counterpart while enjoying 8x FLOP savings.</description>

      <title>VRBench: A Benchmark for Multi-Step Reasoning in Long Narrative Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present VRBench, the first long narrative video benchmark crafted for evaluating large models' multi-step reasoning capabilities, addressing limitations in existing evaluations that overlook temporal reasoning and procedural validity. It comprises 1,010 long videos (with an average duration of 1.6 hours), along with 9,468 human-labeled multi-step question-answering pairs and 30,292 reasoning steps with timestamps. These videos are curated via a multi-stage filtering process including expert inter-rater reviewing to prioritize plot coherence. We develop a human-AI collaborative framework that generates coherent reasoning chains, each requiring multiple temporally grounded steps, spanning seven types (e.g., event attribution, implicit inference). VRBench designs a multi-phase evaluation pipeline that assesses models at both the outcome and process levels. Apart from the MCQs for the final results, we propose a progress-level LLM-guided scoring metric to evaluate the quality of the reasoning chain from multiple dimensions comprehensively. Through extensive evaluations of 12 LLMs and 16 VLMs on VRBench, we undertake a thorough analysis and provide valuable insights that advance the field of multi-step reasoning.</description>

      <title>CreatiPoster: Towards Editable and Controllable Multi-Layer Graphic Design Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graphic design plays a crucial role in both commercial and personal contexts, yet creating high-quality, editable, and aesthetically pleasing graphic compositions remains a time-consuming and skill-intensive task, especially for beginners. Current AI tools automate parts of the workflow, but struggle to accurately incorporate user-supplied assets, maintain editability, and achieve professional visual appeal. Commercial systems, like Canva Magic Design, rely on vast template libraries, which are impractical for replicate. In this paper, we introduce CreatiPoster, a framework that generates editable, multi-layer compositions from optional natural-language instructions or assets. A protocol model, an RGBA large multimodal model, first produces a JSON specification detailing every layer (text or asset) with precise layout, hierarchy, content and style, plus a concise background prompt. A conditional background model then synthesizes a coherent background conditioned on this rendered foreground layers. We construct a benchmark with automated metrics for graphic-design generation and show that CreatiPoster surpasses leading open-source approaches and proprietary commercial systems. To catalyze further research, we release a copyright-free corpus of 100,000 multi-layer designs. CreatiPoster supports diverse applications such as canvas editing, text overlay, responsive resizing, multilingual adaptation, and animated posters, advancing the democratization of AI-assisted graphic design.

      <title>AIR: Zero-shot Generative Model Adaptation with Iterative Refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zero-shot generative model adaptation (ZSGM) aims to adapt a pre-trained generator to a target domain using only text guidance and without any samples from the target domain. Central to recent ZSGM approaches are directional loss which use the text guidance in the form of aligning the image offset with text offset in the embedding space of a vision-language model like CLIP. This is similar to the analogical reasoning in NLP where the offset between one pair of words is used to identify a missing element in another pair by aligning the offset between these two pairs. However, a major limitation of existing ZSGM methods is that the learning objective assumes the complete alignment between image offset and text offset in the CLIP embedding space, resulting in quality degrade in generated images. Our work makes two main contributions. Inspired by the offset misalignment studies in NLP, as our first contribution, we perform an empirical study to analyze the misalignment between text offset and image offset in CLIP embedding space for various large publicly available datasets. Our important finding is that offset misalignment in CLIP embedding space is correlated with concept distance, i.e., close concepts have a less offset misalignment. To address the limitations of the current approaches, as our second contribution, we propose Adaptation with Iterative Refinement (AIR) which is the first ZSGM approach to focus on improving target domain image quality based on our new insight on offset misalignment.Qualitative, quantitative, and user study in 26 experiment setups consistently demonstrate the proposed AIR approach achieves SOTA performance. Additional experiments are in Supp.</description>

      <title>M4V: Multi-Modal Mamba for Text-to-Video Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text-to-video generation has significantly enriched content creation and holds the potential to evolve into powerful world simulators. However, modeling the vast spatiotemporal space remains computationally demanding, particularly when employing Transformers, which incur quadratic complexity in sequence processing and thus limit practical applications. Recent advancements in linear-time sequence modeling, particularly the Mamba architecture, offer a more efficient alternative. Nevertheless, its plain design limits its direct applicability to multi-modal and spatiotemporal video generation tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce M4V, a Multi-Modal Mamba framework for text-to-video generation. Specifically, we propose a multi-modal diffusion Mamba (MM-DiM) block that enables seamless integration of multi-modal information and spatiotemporal modeling through a multi-modal token re-composition design. As a result, the Mamba blocks in M4V reduce FLOPs by 45% compared to the attention-based alternative when generating videos at 768$\times$1280 resolution. Additionally, to mitigate the visual quality degradation in long-context autoregressive generation processes, we introduce a reward learning strategy that further enhances per-frame visual realism. Extensive experiments on text-to-video benchmarks demonstrate M4V's ability to produce high-quality videos while significantly lowering computational costs. Code and models will be publicly available at https://huangjch526.github.io/M4V_project.</description>

      <title>VINCIE: Unlocking In-context Image Editing from Video</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In-context image editing aims to modify images based on a contextual sequence comprising text and previously generated images. Existing methods typically depend on task-specific pipelines and expert models (e.g., segmentation and inpainting) to curate training data. In this work, we explore whether an in-context image editing model can be learned directly from videos. We introduce a scalable approach to annotate videos as interleaved multimodal sequences. To effectively learn from this data, we design a block-causal diffusion transformer trained on three proxy tasks: next-image prediction, current segmentation prediction, and next-segmentation prediction. Additionally, we propose a novel multi-turn image editing benchmark to advance research in this area. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model exhibits strong in-context image editing capabilities and achieves state-of-the-art results on two multi-turn image editing benchmarks. Despite being trained exclusively on videos, our model also shows promising abilities in multi-concept composition, story generation, and chain-of-editing applications.</description>

      <title>SpectralAR: Spectral Autoregressive Visual Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autoregressive visual generation has garnered increasing attention due to its scalability and compatibility with other modalities compared with diffusion models. Most existing methods construct visual sequences as spatial patches for autoregressive generation. However, image patches are inherently parallel, contradicting the causal nature of autoregressive modeling. To address this, we propose a Spectral AutoRegressive (SpectralAR) visual generation framework, which realizes causality for visual sequences from the spectral perspective. Specifically, we first transform an image into ordered spectral tokens with Nested Spectral Tokenization, representing lower to higher frequency components. We then perform autoregressive generation in a coarse-to-fine manner with the sequences of spectral tokens. By considering different levels of detail in images, our SpectralAR achieves both sequence causality and token efficiency without bells and whistles. We conduct extensive experiments on ImageNet-1K for image reconstruction and autoregressive generation, and SpectralAR achieves 3.02 gFID with only 64 tokens and 310M parameters.

      <title>MMMG: A Massive, Multidisciplinary, Multi-Tier Generation Benchmark for Text-to-Image Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce knowledge image generation as a new task, alongside the Massive Multi-Discipline Multi-Tier Knowledge-Image Generation Benchmark (MMMG) to probe the reasoning capability of image generation models. Knowledge images have been central to human civilization and to the mechanisms of human learning--a fact underscored by dual-coding theory and the picture-superiority effect. Generating such images is challenging, demanding multimodal reasoning that fuses world knowledge with pixel-level grounding into clear explanatory visuals. To enable comprehensive evaluation, MMMG offers 4,456 expert-validated (knowledge) image-prompt pairs spanning 10 disciplines, 6 educational levels, and diverse knowledge formats such as charts, diagrams, and mind maps. To eliminate confounding complexity during evaluation, we adopt a unified Knowledge Graph (KG) representation. Each KG explicitly delineates a target image's core entities and their dependencies. We further introduce MMMG-Score to evaluate generated knowledge images. This metric combines factual fidelity, measured by graph-edit distance between KGs, with visual clarity assessment. Comprehensive evaluations of 16 state-of-the-art text-to-image generation models expose serious reasoning deficits--low entity fidelity, weak relations, and clutter--with GPT-4o achieving an MMMG-Score of only 50.20, underscoring the benchmark's difficulty. To spur further progress, we release FLUX-Reason (MMMG-Score of 34.45), an effective and open baseline that combines a reasoning LLM with diffusion models and is trained on 16,000 curated knowledge image-prompt pairs.</description>

      <title>Beyond Attention or Similarity: Maximizing Conditional Diversity for Token Pruning in MLLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In multimodal large language models (MLLMs), the length of input visual tokens is often significantly greater than that of their textual counterparts, leading to a high inference cost. Many works aim to address this issue by removing redundant visual tokens. However, current approaches either rely on attention-based pruning, which retains numerous duplicate tokens, or use similarity-based pruning, overlooking the instruction relevance, consequently causing suboptimal performance. In this paper, we go beyond attention or similarity by proposing a novel visual token pruning method named CDPruner, which maximizes the conditional diversity of retained tokens. We first define the conditional similarity between visual tokens conditioned on the instruction, and then reformulate the token pruning problem with determinantal point process (DPP) to maximize the conditional diversity of the selected subset. The proposed CDPruner is training-free and model-agnostic, allowing easy application to various MLLMs. Extensive experiments across diverse MLLMs show that CDPruner establishes new state-of-the-art on various vision-language benchmarks. By maximizing conditional diversity through DPP, the selected subset better represents the input images while closely adhering to user instructions, thereby preserving strong performance even with high reduction ratios. When applied to LLaVA, CDPruner reduces FLOPs by 95\% and CUDA latency by 78\%, while maintaining 94\% of the original accuracy. Our code is available at https://github.com/Theia-4869/CDPruner.</description>

      <title>GenWorld: Towards Detecting AI-generated Real-world Simulation Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The flourishing of video generation technologies has endangered the credibility of real-world information and intensified the demand for AI-generated video detectors. Despite some progress, the lack of high-quality real-world datasets hinders the development of trustworthy detectors. In this paper, we propose GenWorld, a large-scale, high-quality, and real-world simulation dataset for AI-generated video detection. GenWorld features the following characteristics: (1) Real-world Simulation: GenWorld focuses on videos that replicate real-world scenarios, which have a significant impact due to their realism and potential influence; (2) High Quality: GenWorld employs multiple state-of-the-art video generation models to provide realistic and high-quality forged videos; (3) Cross-prompt Diversity: GenWorld includes videos generated from diverse generators and various prompt modalities (e.g., text, image, video), offering the potential to learn more generalizable forensic features. We analyze existing methods and find they fail to detect high-quality videos generated by world models (i.e., Cosmos), revealing potential drawbacks of ignoring real-world clues. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective model, SpannDetector, to leverage multi-view consistency as a strong criterion for real-world AI-generated video detection. Experiments show that our method achieves superior results, highlighting a promising direction for explainable AI-generated video detection based on physical plausibility. We believe that GenWorld will advance the field of AI-generated video detection. Project Page: https://chen-wl20.github.io/GenWorld</description>

      <title>QuadricFormer: Scene as Superquadrics for 3D Semantic Occupancy Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D occupancy prediction is crucial for robust autonomous driving systems as it enables comprehensive perception of environmental structures and semantics. Most existing methods employ dense voxel-based scene representations, ignoring the sparsity of driving scenes and resulting in inefficiency. Recent works explore object-centric representations based on sparse Gaussians, but their ellipsoidal shape prior limits the modeling of diverse structures. In real-world driving scenes, objects exhibit rich geometries (e.g., cuboids, cylinders, and irregular shapes), necessitating excessive ellipsoidal Gaussians densely packed for accurate modeling, which leads to inefficient representations. To address this, we propose to use geometrically expressive superquadrics as scene primitives, enabling efficient representation of complex structures with fewer primitives through their inherent shape diversity. We develop a probabilistic superquadric mixture model, which interprets each superquadric as an occupancy probability distribution with a corresponding geometry prior, and calculates semantics through probabilistic mixture. Building on this, we present QuadricFormer, a superquadric-based model for efficient 3D occupancy prediction, and introduce a pruning-and-splitting module to further enhance modeling efficiency by concentrating superquadrics in occupied regions. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that QuadricFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining superior efficiency.</description>

      <title>Fine-Grained Perturbation Guidance via Attention Head Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent guidance methods in diffusion models steer reverse sampling by perturbing the model to construct an implicit weak model and guide generation away from it. Among these approaches, attention perturbation has demonstrated strong empirical performance in unconditional scenarios where classifier-free guidance is not applicable. However, existing attention perturbation methods lack principled approaches for determining where perturbations should be applied, particularly in Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architectures where quality-relevant computations are distributed across layers. In this paper, we investigate the granularity of attention perturbations, ranging from the layer level down to individual attention heads, and discover that specific heads govern distinct visual concepts such as structure, style, and texture quality. Building on this insight, we propose "HeadHunter", a systematic framework for iteratively selecting attention heads that align with user-centric objectives, enabling fine-grained control over generation quality and visual attributes. In addition, we introduce SoftPAG, which linearly interpolates each selected head's attention map toward an identity matrix, providing a continuous knob to tune perturbation strength and suppress artifacts. Our approach not only mitigates the oversmoothing issues of existing layer-level perturbation but also enables targeted manipulation of specific visual styles through compositional head selection. We validate our method on modern large-scale DiT-based text-to-image models including Stable Diffusion 3 and FLUX.1, demonstrating superior performance in both general quality enhancement and style-specific guidance. Our work provides the first head-level analysis of attention perturbation in diffusion models, uncovering interpretable specialization within attention layers and enabling practical design of effective perturbation strategies.</description>

      <title>InstaInpaint: Instant 3D-Scene Inpainting with Masked Large Reconstruction Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in 3D scene reconstruction enable real-time viewing in virtual and augmented reality. To support interactive operations for better immersiveness, such as moving or editing objects, 3D scene inpainting methods are proposed to repair or complete the altered geometry. However, current approaches rely on lengthy and computationally intensive optimization, making them impractical for real-time or online applications. We propose InstaInpaint, a reference-based feed-forward framework that produces 3D-scene inpainting from a 2D inpainting proposal within 0.4 seconds. We develop a self-supervised masked-finetuning strategy to enable training of our custom large reconstruction model (LRM) on the large-scale dataset. Through extensive experiments, we analyze and identify several key designs that improve generalization, textural consistency, and geometric correctness. InstaInpaint achieves a 1000x speed-up from prior methods while maintaining a state-of-the-art performance across two standard benchmarks. Moreover, we show that InstaInpaint generalizes well to flexible downstream applications such as object insertion and multi-region inpainting. More video results are available at our project page: https://dhmbb2.github.io/InstaInpaint_page/.</description>

      <title>SceneCompleter: Dense 3D Scene Completion for Generative Novel View Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative models have gained significant attention in novel view synthesis (NVS) by alleviating the reliance on dense multi-view captures. However, existing methods typically fall into a conventional paradigm, where generative models first complete missing areas in 2D, followed by 3D recovery techniques to reconstruct the scene, which often results in overly smooth surfaces and distorted geometry, as generative models struggle to infer 3D structure solely from RGB data. In this paper, we propose SceneCompleter, a novel framework that achieves 3D-consistent generative novel view synthesis through dense 3D scene completion. SceneCompleter achieves both visual coherence and 3D-consistent generative scene completion through two key components: (1) a geometry-appearance dual-stream diffusion model that jointly synthesizes novel views in RGBD space; (2) a scene embedder that encodes a more holistic scene understanding from the reference image. By effectively fusing structural and textural information, our method demonstrates superior coherence and plausibility in generative novel view synthesis across diverse datasets.

Abstract: Traffic Accident Anticipation (TAA) in traffic scenes is a challenging problem for achieving zero fatalities in the future. Current approaches typically treat TAA as a supervised learning task needing the laborious annotation of accident occurrence duration. However, the inherent long-tailed, uncertain, and fast-evolving nature of traffic scenes has the problem that real causal parts of accidents are difficult to identify and are easily dominated by data bias, resulting in a background confounding issue. Thus, we propose an Attentive Video Diffusion (AVD) model that synthesizes additional accident video clips by generating the causal part in dashcam videos, i.e., from normal clips to accident clips. AVD aims to generate causal video frames based on accident or accident-free text prompts while preserving the style and content of frames for TAA after video generation. This approach can be trained using datasets collected from various driving scenes without any extra annotations. Additionally, AVD facilitates an Equivariant TAA (EQ-TAA) with an equivariant triple loss for an anchor accident-free video clip, along with the generated pair of contrastive pseudo-normal and pseudo-accident clips. Extensive experiments have been conducted to evaluate the performance of AVD and EQ-TAA, and competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods has been obtained.</description>

      <title>HER2 Expression Prediction with Flexible Multi-Modal Inputs via Dynamic Bidirectional Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current HER2 assessment models for breast cancer predominantly analyze H&amp;E or IHC images in isolation,despite clinical reliance on their synergistic interpretation. However, concurrent acquisition of both modalities is often hindered by workflow complexity and cost constraints. We propose an adaptive bimodal framework enabling flexible single-/dual-modality HER2 prediction through three innovations: 1) A dynamic branch selector that activates either single-modality reconstruction or dual-modality joint inference based on input completeness; 2) A bidirectional cross-modal GAN performing context-aware feature-space reconstruction of missing modalities; 3) A hybrid training protocol integrating adversarial learning and multi-task optimization. This architecture elevates single-modality H&amp;E prediction accuracy from 71.44% to 94.25% while achieving 95.09% dual-modality accuracy, maintaining 90.28% reliability with sole IHC inputs. The framework's "dual-preferred, single-compatible" design delivers near-bimodal performance without requiring synchronized acquisition, particularly benefiting resource-limited settings through IHC infrastructure cost reduction. Experimental validation confirms 22.81%/12.90% accuracy improvements over H&amp;E/IHC baselines respectively, with cross-modal reconstruction enhancing F1-scores to 0.9609 (HE to IHC) and 0.9251 (IHC to HE). By dynamically routing inputs through reconstruction-enhanced or native fusion pathways, the system mitigates performance degradation from missing data while preserving computational efficiency (78.55% parameter reduction in lightweight variant). This elastic architecture demonstrates significant potential for democratizing precise HER2 assessment across diverse healthcare settings.</description>

      <title>Controllable Expressive 3D Facial Animation via Diffusion in a Unified Multimodal Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10007v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Audio-driven emotional 3D facial animation encounters two significant challenges: (1) reliance on single-modal control signals (videos, text, or emotion labels) without leveraging their complementary strengths for comprehensive emotion manipulation, and (2) deterministic regression-based mapping that constrains the stochastic nature of emotional expressions and non-verbal behaviors, limiting the expressiveness of synthesized animations. To address these challenges, we present a diffusion-based framework for controllable expressive 3D facial animation. Our approach introduces two key innovations: (1) a FLAME-centered multimodal emotion binding strategy that aligns diverse modalities (text, audio, and emotion labels) through contrastive learning, enabling flexible emotion control from multiple signal sources, and (2) an attention-based latent diffusion model with content-aware attention and emotion-guided layers, which enriches motion diversity while maintaining temporal coherence and natural facial dynamics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches across most metrics, achieving a 21.6\% improvement in emotion similarity while preserving physiologically plausible facial dynamics.

      <title>Structured Graph Representations for Visual Narrative Reasoning: A Hierarchical Framework for Comics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10008v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a hierarchical knowledge graph framework for the structured understanding of visual narratives, focusing on multimodal media such as comics. The proposed method decomposes narrative content into multiple levels, from macro-level story arcs to fine-grained event segments. It represents them through integrated knowledge graphs that capture semantic, spatial, and temporal relationships. At the panel level, we construct multimodal graphs that link visual elements such as characters, objects, and actions with corresponding textual components, including dialogue and captions. These graphs are integrated across narrative levels to support reasoning over story structure, character continuity, and event progression.
  We apply our approach to a manually annotated subset of the Manga109 dataset and demonstrate its ability to support symbolic reasoning across diverse narrative tasks, including action retrieval, dialogue tracing, character appearance mapping, and panel timeline reconstruction. Evaluation results show high precision and recall across tasks, validating the coherence and interpretability of the framework. This work contributes a scalable foundation for narrative-based content analysis, interactive storytelling, and multimodal reasoning in visual media.</description>

      <title>WDMIR: Wavelet-Driven Multimodal Intent Recognition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal intent recognition (MIR) seeks to accurately interpret user intentions by integrating verbal and non-verbal information across video, audio and text modalities. While existing approaches prioritize text analysis, they often overlook the rich semantic content embedded in non-verbal cues. This paper presents a novel Wavelet-Driven Multimodal Intent Recognition(WDMIR) framework that enhances intent understanding through frequency-domain analysis of non-verbal information. To be more specific, we propose: (1) a wavelet-driven fusion module that performs synchronized decomposition and integration of video-audio features in the frequency domain, enabling fine-grained analysis of temporal dynamics; (2) a cross-modal interaction mechanism that facilitates progressive feature enhancement from bimodal to trimodal integration, effectively bridging the semantic gap between verbal and non-verbal information. Extensive experiments on MIntRec demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing previous methods by 1.13% on accuracy. Ablation studies further verify that the wavelet-driven fusion module significantly improves the extraction of semantic information from non-verbal sources, with a 0.41% increase in recognition accuracy when analyzing subtle emotional cues.</description>

      <title>A Survey of Automatic Evaluation Methods on Text, Visual and Speech Generations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have significantly enhanced generative AI capabilities across text, images, and audio. However, automatically evaluating the quality of these generated outputs presents ongoing challenges. Although numerous automatic evaluation methods exist, current research lacks a systematic framework that comprehensively organizes these methods across text, visual, and audio modalities. To address this issue, we present a comprehensive review and a unified taxonomy of automatic evaluation methods for generated content across all three modalities; We identify five fundamental paradigms that characterize existing evaluation approaches across these domains. Our analysis begins by examining evaluation methods for text generation, where techniques are most mature. We then extend this framework to image and audio generation, demonstrating its broad applicability. Finally, we discuss promising directions for future research in cross-modal evaluation methodologies.</description>

      <title>Learning-based density-equalizing map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10027v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Density-equalizing map (DEM) serves as a powerful technique for creating shape deformations with the area changes reflecting an underlying density function. In recent decades, DEM has found widespread applications in fields such as data visualization, geometry processing, and medical imaging. Traditional approaches to DEM primarily rely on iterative numerical solvers for diffusion equations or optimization-based methods that minimize handcrafted energy functionals. However, these conventional techniques often face several challenges: they may suffer from limited accuracy, produce overlapping artifacts in extreme cases, and require substantial algorithmic redesign when extended from 2D to 3D, due to the derivative-dependent nature of their energy formulations. In this work, we propose a novel learning-based density-equalizing mapping framework (LDEM) using deep neural networks. Specifically, we introduce a loss function that enforces density uniformity and geometric regularity, and utilize a hierarchical approach to predict the transformations at both the coarse and dense levels. Our method demonstrates superior density-equalizing and bijectivity properties compared to prior methods for a wide range of simple and complex density distributions, and can be easily applied to surface remeshing with different effects. Also, it generalizes seamlessly from 2D to 3D domains without structural changes to the model architecture or loss formulation. Altogether, our work opens up new possibilities for scalable and robust computation of density-equalizing maps for practical applications.</description>

      <title>Secure Data Access in Cloud Environments Using Quantum Cryptography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cloud computing has made storing and accessing data easier but keeping it secure is a big challenge nowadays. Traditional methods of ensuring data may not be strong enough in the future when powerful quantum computers become available. To solve this problem, this study uses quantum cryptography to protect data in the cloud environment. Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) creates secure keys by sending information using quantum particles like photons. Specifically, we use the BB84 protocol, a simple and reliable way to make secure keys that cannot be stolen without detection. To protect the data, we use the Quantum One Time pad (QOTP) for encryption and decryption, ensuring the data stays completely private. This study shows how these Quantum methods can be applied in cloud systems to provide a strong defense against hackers, even if they have access to quantum computers. The combination of QKD, BB84, and QOTP creates a safe and reliable way to keep data secure when it is stored or shared in the cloud. Using quantum cryptography, this paper provides a way to ensure data security now and in the future, making cloud computing safer for everyone to store their data securely and safely.</description>

      <title>Omni-DPO: A Dual-Perspective Paradigm for Dynamic Preference Learning of LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has become a cornerstone of reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) due to its simplicity and efficiency. However, existing DPO-based approaches typically treat all preference pairs uniformly, ignoring critical variations in their inherent quality and learning utility, leading to suboptimal data utilization and performance. To address this challenge, we propose Omni-DPO, a dual-perspective optimization framework that jointly accounts for (1) the inherent quality of each preference pair and (2) the model's evolving performance on those pairs. By adaptively weighting samples according to both data quality and the model's learning dynamics during training, Omni-DPO enables more effective training data utilization and achieves better performance. Experimental results on various models and benchmarks demonstrate the superiority and generalization capabilities of Omni-DPO. On textual understanding tasks, Gemma-2-9b-it finetuned with Omni-DPO beats the leading LLM, Claude 3 Opus, by a significant margin of 6.7 points on the Arena-Hard benchmark. On mathematical reasoning tasks, Omni-DPO consistently outperforms the baseline methods across all benchmarks, providing strong empirical evidence for the effectiveness and robustness of our approach. Code and models will be available at https://github.com/pspdada/Omni-DPO.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Brain Tumor Segmentation from the Frequency Domain Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precise segmentation of brain tumors, particularly contrast-enhancing regions visible in post-contrast MRI (areas highlighted by contrast agent injection), is crucial for accurate clinical diagnosis and treatment planning but remains challenging. However, current methods exhibit notable performance degradation in segmenting these enhancing brain tumor areas, largely due to insufficient consideration of MRI-specific tumor features such as complex textures and directional variations. To address this, we propose the Harmonized Frequency Fusion Network (HFF-Net), which rethinks brain tumor segmentation from a frequency-domain perspective. To comprehensively characterize tumor regions, we develop a Frequency Domain Decomposition (FDD) module that separates MRI images into low-frequency components, capturing smooth tumor contours and high-frequency components, highlighting detailed textures and directional edges. To further enhance sensitivity to tumor boundaries, we introduce an Adaptive Laplacian Convolution (ALC) module that adaptively emphasizes critical high-frequency details using dynamically updated convolution kernels. To effectively fuse tumor features across multiple scales, we design a Frequency Domain Cross-Attention (FDCA) integrating semantic, positional, and slice-specific information. We further validate and interpret frequency-domain improvements through visualization, theoretical reasoning, and experimental analyses. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate that HFF-Net achieves an average relative improvement of 4.48\% (ranging from 2.39\% to 7.72\%) in the mean Dice scores across the three major subregions, and an average relative improvement of 7.33% (ranging from 5.96% to 8.64%) in the segmentation of contrast-enhancing tumor regions, while maintaining favorable computational efficiency and clinical applicability.

      <title>Balanced Hyperbolic Embeddings Are Natural Out-of-Distribution Detectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Out-of-distribution recognition forms an important and well-studied problem in deep learning, with the goal to filter out samples that do not belong to the distribution on which a network has been trained. The conclusion of this paper is simple: a good hierarchical hyperbolic embedding is preferred for discriminating in- and out-of-distribution samples. We introduce Balanced Hyperbolic Learning. We outline a hyperbolic class embedding algorithm that jointly optimizes for hierarchical distortion and balancing between shallow and wide subhierarchies. We then use the class embeddings as hyperbolic prototypes for classification on in-distribution data. We outline how to generalize existing out-of-distribution scoring functions to operate with hyperbolic prototypes. Empirical evaluations across 13 datasets and 13 scoring functions show that our hyperbolic embeddings outperform existing out-of-distribution approaches when trained on the same data with the same backbones. We also show that our hyperbolic embeddings outperform other hyperbolic approaches, beat state-of-the-art contrastive methods, and natively enable hierarchical out-of-distribution generalization.</description>

      <title>A Navigation Framework Utilizing Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) presents a complex challenge in embodied AI, requiring agents to interpret natural language instructions and navigate through visually rich, unfamiliar environments. Recent advances in large vision-language models (LVLMs), such as CLIP and Flamingo, have significantly improved multimodal understanding but introduced new challenges related to computational cost and real-time deployment. In this project, we propose a modular, plug-and-play navigation framework that decouples vision-language understanding from action planning. By integrating a frozen vision-language model, Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, with lightweight planning logic, we aim to achieve flexible, fast, and adaptable navigation without extensive model fine-tuning. Our framework leverages prompt engineering, structured history management, and a two-frame visual input strategy to enhance decision-making continuity across navigation steps. We evaluate our system on the Room-to-Room benchmark within the VLN-CE setting using the Matterport3D dataset and Habitat-Lab simulation environment. Although our initial results reveal challenges in generalizing to unseen environments under strict evaluation settings, our modular approach lays a foundation for scalable and efficient navigation systems, highlighting promising directions for future improvement through enhanced environmental priors and expanded multimodal input integration.</description>

      <title>Geometric Regularity in Deterministic Sampling of Diffusion-based Generative Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion-based generative models employ stochastic differential equations (SDEs) and their equivalent probability flow ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to establish a smooth transformation between complex high-dimensional data distributions and tractable prior distributions. In this paper, we reveal a striking geometric regularity in the deterministic sampling dynamics: each simulated sampling trajectory lies within an extremely low-dimensional subspace, and all trajectories exhibit an almost identical ''boomerang'' shape, regardless of the model architecture, applied conditions, or generated content. We characterize several intriguing properties of these trajectories, particularly under closed-form solutions based on kernel-estimated data modeling. We also demonstrate a practical application of the discovered trajectory regularity by proposing a dynamic programming-based scheme to better align the sampling time schedule with the underlying trajectory structure. This simple strategy requires minimal modification to existing ODE-based numerical solvers, incurs negligible computational overhead, and achieves superior image generation performance, especially in regions with only $5 \sim 10$ function evaluations.</description>

      <title>Prompt-Guided Latent Diffusion with Predictive Class Conditioning for 3D Prostate MRI Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Latent diffusion models (LDM) could alleviate data scarcity challenges affecting machine learning development for medical imaging. However, medical LDM training typically relies on performance- or scientific accessibility-limiting strategies including a reliance on short-prompt text encoders, the reuse of non-medical LDMs, or a requirement for fine-tuning with large data volumes. We propose a Class-Conditioned Efficient Large Language model Adapter (CCELLA) to address these limitations. CCELLA is a novel dual-head conditioning approach that simultaneously conditions the LDM U-Net with non-medical large language model-encoded text features through cross-attention and with pathology classification through the timestep embedding. We also propose a joint loss function and a data-efficient LDM training framework. In combination, these strategies enable pathology-conditioned LDM training for high-quality medical image synthesis given limited data volume and human data annotation, improving LDM performance and scientific accessibility. Our method achieves a 3D FID score of 0.025 on a size-limited prostate MRI dataset, significantly outperforming a recent foundation model with FID 0.071. When training a classifier for prostate cancer prediction, adding synthetic images generated by our method to the training dataset improves classifier accuracy from 69% to 74%. Training a classifier solely on our method's synthetic images achieved comparable performance to training on real images alone.</description>

      <title>Conditional diffusion models for guided anomaly detection in brain images using fluid-driven anomaly randomization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supervised machine learning has enabled accurate pathology detection in brain MRI, but requires training data from diseased subjects that may not be readily available in some scenarios, for example, in the case of rare diseases. Reconstruction-based unsupervised anomaly detection, in particular using diffusion models, has gained popularity in the medical field as it allows for training on healthy images alone, eliminating the need for large disease-specific cohorts. These methods assume that a model trained on normal data cannot accurately represent or reconstruct anomalies. However, this assumption often fails with models failing to reconstruct healthy tissue or accurately reconstruct abnormal regions i.e., failing to remove anomalies. In this work, we introduce a novel conditional diffusion model framework for anomaly detection and healthy image reconstruction in brain MRI. Our weakly supervised approach integrates synthetically generated pseudo-pathology images into the modeling process to better guide the reconstruction of healthy images. To generate these pseudo-pathologies, we apply fluid-driven anomaly randomization to augment real pathology segmentation maps from an auxiliary dataset, ensuring that the synthetic anomalies are both realistic and anatomically coherent. We evaluate our model's ability to detect pathology, using both synthetic anomaly datasets and real pathology from the ATLAS dataset. In our extensive experiments, our model: (i) consistently outperforms variational autoencoders, and conditional and unconditional latent diffusion; and (ii) surpasses on most datasets, the performance of supervised inpainting methods with access to paired diseased/healthy images.</description>

      <title>Energy Aware Camera Location Search Algorithm for Increasing Precision of Observation in Automated Manufacturing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Visual servoing technology has been well developed and applied in many automated manufacturing tasks, especially in tools' pose alignment. To access a full global view of tools, most applications adopt eye-to-hand configuration or eye-to-hand/eye-in-hand cooperation configuration in an automated manufacturing environment. Most research papers mainly put efforts into developing control and observation architectures in various scenarios, but few of them have discussed the importance of the camera's location in eye-to-hand configuration. In a manufacturing environment, the quality of camera estimations may vary significantly from one observation location to another, as the combined effects of environmental conditions result in different noise levels of a single image shot at different locations. In this paper, we propose an algorithm for the camera's moving policy so that it explores the camera workspace and searches for the optimal location where the images' noise level is minimized. Also, this algorithm ensures the camera ends up at a suboptimal (if the optimal one is unreachable) location among the locations already searched, with limited energy available for moving the camera. Unlike a simple brute force approach, the algorithm enables the camera to explore space more efficiently by adapting the search policy from learning the environment. With the aid of an image averaging technique, this algorithm, in use of a solo camera, achieves the observation accuracy in eye-to-hand configurations to a desirable extent without filtering out high-frequency information in the original image. An automated manufacturing application has been simulated and the results show the success of this algorithm's improvement of observation precision with limited energy.</description>

      <title>Ground Reaction Force Estimation via Time-aware Knowledge Distillation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human gait analysis with wearable sensors has been widely used in various applications, such as daily life healthcare, rehabilitation, physical therapy, and clinical diagnostics and monitoring. In particular, ground reaction force (GRF) provides critical information about how the body interacts with the ground during locomotion. Although instrumented treadmills have been widely used as the gold standard for measuring GRF during walking, their lack of portability and high cost make them impractical for many applications. As an alternative, low-cost, portable, wearable insole sensors have been utilized to measure GRF; however, these sensors are susceptible to noise and disturbance and are less accurate than treadmill measurements. To address these challenges, we propose a Time-aware Knowledge Distillation framework for GRF estimation from insole sensor data. This framework leverages similarity and temporal features within a mini-batch during the knowledge distillation process, effectively capturing the complementary relationships between features and the sequential properties of the target and input data. The performance of the lightweight models distilled through this framework was evaluated by comparing GRF estimations from insole sensor data against measurements from an instrumented treadmill. Empirical results demonstrated that Time-aware Knowledge Distillation outperforms current baselines in GRF estimation from wearable sensor data.</description>

      <title>DUN-SRE: Deep Unrolling Network with Spatiotemporal Rotation Equivariance for Dynamic MRI Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamic Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) exhibits transformation symmetries, including spatial rotation symmetry within individual frames and temporal symmetry along the time dimension. Explicit incorporation of these symmetry priors in the reconstruction model can significantly improve image quality, especially under aggressive undersampling scenarios. Recently, Equivariant convolutional neural network (ECNN) has shown great promise in exploiting spatial symmetry priors. However, existing ECNNs critically fail to model temporal symmetry, arguably the most universal and informative structural prior in dynamic MRI reconstruction. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel Deep Unrolling Network with Spatiotemporal Rotation Equivariance (DUN-SRE) for Dynamic MRI Reconstruction. The DUN-SRE establishes spatiotemporal equivariance through a (2+1)D equivariant convolutional architecture. In particular, it integrates both the data consistency and proximal mapping module into a unified deep unrolling framework. This architecture ensures rigorous propagation of spatiotemporal rotation symmetry constraints throughout the reconstruction process, enabling more physically accurate modeling of cardiac motion dynamics in cine MRI. In addition, a high-fidelity group filter parameterization mechanism is developed to maintain representation precision while enforcing symmetry constraints. Comprehensive experiments on Cardiac CINE MRI datasets demonstrate that DUN-SRE achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly in preserving rotation-symmetric structures, offering strong generalization capability to a broad range of dynamic MRI reconstruction tasks.</description>

      <title>SWDL: Stratum-Wise Difference Learning with Deep Laplacian Pyramid for Semi-Supervised 3D Intracranial Hemorrhage Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in medical imaging have established deep learning-based segmentation as the predominant approach, though it typically requires large amounts of manually annotated data. However, obtaining annotations for intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) remains particularly challenging due to the tedious and costly labeling process. Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a promising solution to address the scarcity of labeled data, especially in volumetric medical image segmentation. Unlike conventional SSL methods that primarily focus on high-confidence pseudo-labels or consistency regularization, we propose SWDL-Net, a novel SSL framework that exploits the complementary advantages of Laplacian pyramid and deep convolutional upsampling. The Laplacian pyramid excels at edge sharpening, while deep convolutions enhance detail precision through flexible feature mapping. Our framework achieves superior segmentation of lesion details and boundaries through a difference learning mechanism that effectively integrates these complementary approaches. Extensive experiments on a 271-case ICH dataset and public benchmarks demonstrate that SWDL-Net outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in scenarios with only 2% labeled data. Additional evaluations on the publicly available Brain Hemorrhage Segmentation Dataset (BHSD) with 5% labeled data further confirm the superiority of our approach. Code and data have been released at https://github.com/SIAT-CT-LAB/SWDL.</description>

Abstract: The semi-tensor product (STP) of vectors is a generalization of conventional inner product of vectors, which allows the factor vectors to of different dimensions. This paper proposes a domain-based convolutional product (CP). Combining domain-based CP with STP of vectors, a new CP is proposed. Since there is no zero or any other padding, it can avoid the junk information caused by padding. Using it, the STP-based convolutional neural network (CNN) is developed. Its application to image and third order signal identifications is considered.</description>

      <title>Burn After Reading: Do Multimodal Large Language Models Truly Capture Order of Events in Image Sequences?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces the TempVS benchmark, which focuses on temporal grounding and reasoning capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in image sequences. TempVS consists of three main tests (i.e., event relation inference, sentence ordering and image ordering), each accompanied with a basic grounding test. TempVS requires MLLMs to rely on both visual and linguistic modalities to understand the temporal order of events. We evaluate 38 state-of-the-art MLLMs, demonstrating that models struggle to solve TempVS, with a substantial performance gap compared to human capabilities. We also provide fine-grained insights that suggest promising directions for future research. Our TempVS benchmark data and code are available at https://github.com/yjsong22/TempVS.</description>

      <title>Low-Barrier Dataset Collection with Real Human Body for Interactive Per-Garment Virtual Try-On</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing image-based virtual try-on methods are often limited to the front view and lack real-time performance. While per-garment virtual try-on methods have tackled these issues by capturing per-garment datasets and training per-garment neural networks, they still encounter practical limitations: (1) the robotic mannequin used to capture per-garment datasets is prohibitively expensive for widespread adoption and fails to accurately replicate natural human body deformation; (2) the synthesized garments often misalign with the human body. To address these challenges, we propose a low-barrier approach for collecting per-garment datasets using real human bodies, eliminating the necessity for a customized robotic mannequin. We also introduce a hybrid person representation that enhances the existing intermediate representation with a simplified DensePose map. This ensures accurate alignment of synthesized garment images with the human body and enables human-garment interaction without the need for customized wearable devices. We performed qualitative and quantitative evaluations against other state-of-the-art image-based virtual try-on methods and conducted ablation studies to demonstrate the superiority of our method regarding image quality and temporal consistency. Finally, our user study results indicated that most participants found our virtual try-on system helpful for making garment purchasing decisions.</description>

      <title>Edit360: 2D Image Edits to 3D Assets from Any Angle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have significantly improved image generation and editing, but extending these capabilities to 3D assets remains challenging, especially for fine-grained edits that require multi-view consistency. Existing methods typically restrict editing to predetermined viewing angles, severely limiting their flexibility and practical applications. We introduce Edit360, a tuning-free framework that extends 2D modifications to multi-view consistent 3D editing. Built upon video diffusion models, Edit360 enables user-specific editing from arbitrary viewpoints while ensuring structural coherence across all views. The framework selects anchor views for 2D modifications and propagates edits across the entire 360-degree range. To achieve this, Edit360 introduces a novel Anchor-View Editing Propagation mechanism, which effectively aligns and merges multi-view information within the latent and attention spaces of diffusion models. The resulting edited multi-view sequences facilitate the reconstruction of high-quality 3D assets, enabling customizable 3D content creation.</description>

      <title>AniMaker: Automated Multi-Agent Animated Storytelling with MCTS-Driven Clip Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite rapid advancements in video generation models, generating coherent storytelling videos that span multiple scenes and characters remains challenging. Current methods often rigidly convert pre-generated keyframes into fixed-length clips, resulting in disjointed narratives and pacing issues. Furthermore, the inherent instability of video generation models means that even a single low-quality clip can significantly degrade the entire output animation's logical coherence and visual continuity. To overcome these obstacles, we introduce AniMaker, a multi-agent framework enabling efficient multi-candidate clip generation and storytelling-aware clip selection, thus creating globally consistent and story-coherent animation solely from text input. The framework is structured around specialized agents, including the Director Agent for storyboard generation, the Photography Agent for video clip generation, the Reviewer Agent for evaluation, and the Post-Production Agent for editing and voiceover. Central to AniMaker's approach are two key technical components: MCTS-Gen in Photography Agent, an efficient Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)-inspired strategy that intelligently navigates the candidate space to generate high-potential clips while optimizing resource usage; and AniEval in Reviewer Agent, the first framework specifically designed for multi-shot animation evaluation, which assesses critical aspects such as story-level consistency, action completion, and animation-specific features by considering each clip in the context of its preceding and succeeding clips. Experiments demonstrate that AniMaker achieves superior quality as measured by popular metrics including VBench and our proposed AniEval framework, while significantly improving the efficiency of multi-candidate generation, pushing AI-generated storytelling animation closer to production standards.</description>

      <title>Transformer IMU Calibrator: Dynamic On-body IMU Calibration for Inertial Motion Capture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel dynamic calibration method for sparse inertial motion capture systems, which is the first to break the restrictive absolute static assumption in IMU calibration, i.e., the coordinate drift RG'G and measurement offset RBS remain constant during the entire motion, thereby significantly expanding their application scenarios. Specifically, we achieve real-time estimation of RG'G and RBS under two relaxed assumptions: i) the matrices change negligibly in a short time window; ii) the human movements/IMU readings are diverse in such a time window. Intuitively, the first assumption reduces the number of candidate matrices, and the second assumption provides diverse constraints, which greatly reduces the solution space and allows for accurate estimation of RG'G and RBS from a short history of IMU readings in real time. To achieve this, we created synthetic datasets of paired RG'G, RBS matrices and IMU readings, and learned their mappings using a Transformer-based model. We also designed a calibration trigger based on the diversity of IMU readings to ensure that assumption ii) is met before applying our method. To our knowledge, we are the first to achieve implicit IMU calibration (i.e., seamlessly putting IMUs into use without the need for an explicit calibration process), as well as the first to enable long-term and accurate motion capture using sparse IMUs. The code and dataset are available at https://github.com/ZuoCX1996/TIC.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Constructing a physically realistic and accurately scaled simulated 3D world is crucial for the training and evaluation of embodied intelligence tasks. The diversity, realism, low cost accessibility and affordability of 3D data assets are critical for achieving generalization and scalability in embodied AI. However, most current embodied intelligence tasks still rely heavily on traditional 3D computer graphics assets manually created and annotated, which suffer from high production costs and limited realism. These limitations significantly hinder the scalability of data driven approaches. We present EmbodiedGen, a foundational platform for interactive 3D world generation. It enables the scalable generation of high-quality, controllable and photorealistic 3D assets with accurate physical properties and real-world scale in the Unified Robotics Description Format (URDF) at low cost. These assets can be directly imported into various physics simulation engines for fine-grained physical control, supporting downstream tasks in training and evaluation. EmbodiedGen is an easy-to-use, full-featured toolkit composed of six key modules: Image-to-3D, Text-to-3D, Texture Generation, Articulated Object Generation, Scene Generation and Layout Generation. EmbodiedGen generates diverse and interactive 3D worlds composed of generative 3D assets, leveraging generative AI to address the challenges of generalization and evaluation to the needs of embodied intelligence related research.

      <title>Deep Learning-Based Digitization of Overlapping ECG Images with Open-Source Python Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the persistent challenge of accurately digitizing paper-based electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings, with a particular focus on robustly handling single leads compromised by signal overlaps-a common yet under-addressed issue in existing methodologies. We propose a two-stage pipeline designed to overcome this limitation. The first stage employs a U-Net based segmentation network, trained on a dataset enriched with overlapping signals and fortified with custom data augmentations, to accurately isolate the primary ECG trace. The subsequent stage converts this refined binary mask into a time-series signal using established digitization techniques, enhanced by an adaptive grid detection module for improved versatility across different ECG formats and scales. Our experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our approach. The U-Net architecture achieves an IoU of 0.87 for the fine-grained segmentation task. Crucially, our proposed digitization method yields superior performance compared to a well-established baseline technique across both non-overlapping and challenging overlapping ECG samples. For non-overlapping signals, our method achieved a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.0010 and a Pearson Correlation Coefficient (rho) of 0.9644, compared to 0.0015 and 0.9366, respectively, for the baseline. On samples with signal overlap, our method achieved an MSE of 0.0029 and a rho of 0.9641, significantly improving upon the baseline's 0.0178 and 0.8676. This work demonstrates an effective strategy to significantly enhance digitization accuracy, especially in the presence of signal overlaps, thereby laying a strong foundation for the reliable conversion of analog ECG records into analyzable digital data for contemporary research and clinical applications. The implementation is publicly available at this GitHub repository: https://github.com/masoudrahimi39/ECG-code.</description>

      <title>Hessian Geometry of Latent Space in Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel method for analyzing the latent space geometry of generative models, including statistical physics models and diffusion models, by reconstructing the Fisher information metric. The method approximates the posterior distribution of latent variables given generated samples and uses this to learn the log-partition function, which defines the Fisher metric for exponential families. Theoretical convergence guarantees are provided, and the method is validated on the Ising and TASEP models, outperforming existing baselines in reconstructing thermodynamic quantities. Applied to diffusion models, the method reveals a fractal structure of phase transitions in the latent space, characterized by abrupt changes in the Fisher metric. We demonstrate that while geodesic interpolations are approximately linear within individual phases, this linearity breaks down at phase boundaries, where the diffusion model exhibits a divergent Lipschitz constant with respect to the latent space. These findings provide new insights into the complex structure of diffusion model latent spaces and their connection to phenomena like phase transitions.

      <title>ConStyX: Content Style Augmentation for Generalizable Medical Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Medical images are usually collected from multiple domains, leading to domain shifts that impair the performance of medical image segmentation models. Domain Generalization (DG) aims to address this issue by training a robust model with strong generalizability. Recently, numerous domain randomization-based DG methods have been proposed. However, these methods suffer from the following limitations: 1) constrained efficiency of domain randomization due to their exclusive dependence on image style perturbation, and 2) neglect of the adverse effects of over-augmented images on model training. To address these issues, we propose a novel domain randomization-based DG method, called content style augmentation (ConStyX), for generalizable medical image segmentation. Specifically, ConStyX 1) augments the content and style of training data, allowing the augmented training data to better cover a wider range of data domains, and 2) leverages well-augmented features while mitigating the negative effects of over-augmented features during model training. Extensive experiments across multiple domains demonstrate that our ConStyX achieves superior generalization performance. The code is available at https://github.com/jwxsp1/ConStyX.</description>

      <title>Modality-AGnostic Image Cascade (MAGIC) for Multi-Modality Cardiac Substructure Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cardiac substructures are essential in thoracic radiation therapy planning to minimize risk of radiation-induced heart disease. Deep learning (DL) offers efficient methods to reduce contouring burden but lacks generalizability across different modalities and overlapping structures. This work introduces and validates a Modality-AGnostic Image Cascade (MAGIC) for comprehensive and multi-modal cardiac substructure segmentation. MAGIC is implemented through replicated encoding and decoding branches of an nnU-Net-based, U-shaped backbone conserving the function of a single model. Twenty cardiac substructures (heart, chambers, great vessels (GVs), valves, coronary arteries (CAs), and conduction nodes) from simulation CT (Sim-CT), low-field MR-Linac, and cardiac CT angiography (CCTA) modalities were manually delineated and used to train (n=76), validate (n=15), and test (n=30) MAGIC. Twelve comparison models (four segmentation subgroups across three modalities) were equivalently trained. All methods were compared for training efficiency and against reference contours using the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and two-tailed Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test (threshold, p&lt;0.05). Average DSC scores were 0.75(0.16) for Sim-CT, 0.68(0.21) for MR-Linac, and 0.80(0.16) for CCTA. MAGIC outperforms the comparison in 57% of cases, with limited statistical differences. MAGIC offers an effective and accurate segmentation solution that is lightweight and capable of segmenting multiple modalities and overlapping structures in a single model. MAGIC further enables clinical implementation by simplifying the computational requirements and offering unparalleled flexibility for clinical settings.</description>

      <title>Generalist Models in Medical Image Segmentation: A Survey and Performance Comparison with Task-Specific Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Following the successful paradigm shift of large language models, leveraging pre-training on a massive corpus of data and fine-tuning on different downstream tasks, generalist models have made their foray into computer vision. The introduction of Segment Anything Model (SAM) set a milestone on segmentation of natural images, inspiring the design of a multitude of architectures for medical image segmentation. In this survey we offer a comprehensive and in-depth investigation on generalist models for medical image segmentation. We start with an introduction on the fundamentals concepts underpinning their development. Then, we provide a taxonomy on the different declinations of SAM in terms of zero-shot, few-shot, fine-tuning, adapters, on the recent SAM 2, on other innovative models trained on images alone, and others trained on both text and images. We thoroughly analyze their performances at the level of both primary research and best-in-literature, followed by a rigorous comparison with the state-of-the-art task-specific models. We emphasize the need to address challenges in terms of compliance with regulatory frameworks, privacy and security laws, budget, and trustworthy artificial intelligence (AI). Finally, we share our perspective on future directions concerning synthetic data, early fusion, lessons learnt from generalist models in natural language processing, agentic AI and physical AI, and clinical translation.</description>

      <title>Med-URWKV: Pure RWKV With ImageNet Pre-training For Medical Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Medical image segmentation is a fundamental and key technology in computer-aided diagnosis and treatment. Previous methods can be broadly classified into three categories: convolutional neural network (CNN) based, Transformer based, and hybrid architectures that combine both. However, each of them has its own limitations, such as restricted receptive fields in CNNs or the computational overhead caused by the quadratic complexity of Transformers. Recently, the Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV) model has emerged as a promising alternative for various vision tasks, offering strong long-range modeling capabilities with linear computational complexity. Some studies have also adapted RWKV to medical image segmentation tasks, achieving competitive performance. However, most of these studies focus on modifications to the Vision-RWKV (VRWKV) mechanism and train models from scratch, without exploring the potential advantages of leveraging pre-trained VRWKV models for medical image segmentation tasks. In this paper, we propose Med-URWKV, a pure RWKV-based architecture built upon the U-Net framework, which incorporates ImageNet-based pretraining to further explore the potential of RWKV in medical image segmentation tasks. To the best of our knowledge, Med-URWKV is the first pure RWKV segmentation model in the medical field that can directly reuse a large-scale pre-trained VRWKV encoder. Experimental results on seven datasets demonstrate that Med-URWKV achieves comparable or even superior segmentation performance compared to other carefully optimized RWKV models trained from scratch. This validates the effectiveness of using a pretrained VRWKV encoder in enhancing model performance. The codes will be released.</description>

      <title>Semi-Automated Quality Assurance in Digital Pathology: Tile Classification Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quality assurance is a critical but underexplored area in digital pathology, where even minor artifacts can have significant effects. Artifacts have been shown to negatively impact the performance of AI diagnostic models. In current practice, trained staff manually review digitized images prior to release of these slides to pathologists which are then used to render a diagnosis. Conventional image processing approaches, provide a foundation for detecting artifacts on digital pathology slides. However, current tools do not leverage deep learning, which has the potential to improve detection accuracy and scalability. Despite these advancements, methods for quality assurance in digital pathology remain limited, presenting a gap for innovation.
  We propose an AI algorithm designed to screen digital pathology slides by analyzing tiles and categorizing them into one of 10 predefined artifact types or as background. This algorithm identifies and localizes artifacts, creating a map that highlights regions of interest. By directing human operators to specific tiles affected by artifacts, the algorithm minimizes the time and effort required to manually review entire slides for quality issues.
  From internal archives and The Cancer Genome Atlas, 133 whole slide images were selected and 10 artifacts were annotated using an internally developed software ZAPP (Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL). Ablation study of multiple models at different tile sizes and magnification was performed. InceptionResNet was selected. Single artifact models were trained and tested, followed by a limited multiple instance model with artifacts that performed well together (chatter, fold, and pen). From the results of this study we suggest a hybrid design for artifact screening composed of both single artifact binary models as well as multiple instance models to optimize detection of each artifact.</description>

      <title>ReGuidance: A Simple Diffusion Wrapper for Boosting Sample Quality on Hard Inverse Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There has been a flurry of activity around using pretrained diffusion models as informed data priors for solving inverse problems, and more generally around steering these models using reward models. Training-free methods like diffusion posterior sampling (DPS) and its many variants have offered flexible heuristic algorithms for these tasks, but when the reward is not informative enough, e.g., in hard inverse problems with low signal-to-noise ratio, these techniques veer off the data manifold, failing to produce realistic outputs. In this work, we devise a simple wrapper, ReGuidance, for boosting both the sample realism and reward achieved by these methods. Given a candidate solution $\hat{x}$ produced by an algorithm of the user's choice, we propose inverting the solution by running the unconditional probability flow ODE in reverse starting from $\hat{x}$, and then using the resulting latent as an initialization for DPS. We evaluate our wrapper on hard inverse problems like large box in-painting and super-resolution with high upscaling. Whereas state-of-the-art baselines visibly fail, we find that applying our wrapper on top of these baselines significantly boosts sample quality and measurement consistency. We complement these findings with theory proving that on certain multimodal data distributions, ReGuidance simultaneously boosts the reward and brings the candidate solution closer to the data manifold. To our knowledge, this constitutes the first rigorous algorithmic guarantee for DPS.</description>

      <title>Eye, Robot: Learning to Look to Act with a BC-RL Perception-Action Loop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Humans do not passively observe the visual world -- we actively look in order to act. Motivated by this principle, we introduce EyeRobot, a robotic system with gaze behavior that emerges from the need to complete real-world tasks. We develop a mechanical eyeball that can freely rotate to observe its surroundings and train a gaze policy to control it using reinforcement learning. We accomplish this by first collecting teleoperated demonstrations paired with a 360 camera. This data is imported into a simulation environment that supports rendering arbitrary eyeball viewpoints, allowing episode rollouts of eye gaze on top of robot demonstrations. We then introduce a BC-RL loop to train the hand and eye jointly: the hand (BC) agent is trained from rendered eye observations, and the eye (RL) agent is rewarded when the hand produces correct action predictions. In this way, hand-eye coordination emerges as the eye looks towards regions which allow the hand to complete the task. EyeRobot implements a foveal-inspired policy architecture allowing high resolution with a small compute budget, which we find also leads to the emergence of more stable fixation as well as improved ability to track objects and ignore distractors. We evaluate EyeRobot on five panoramic workspace manipulation tasks requiring manipulation in an arc surrounding the robot arm. Our experiments suggest EyeRobot exhibits hand-eye coordination behaviors which effectively facilitate manipulation over large workspaces with a single camera.

      <title>Federated Unsupervised Visual Representation Learning via Exploiting General Content and Personal Style</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.06470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.06470v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Discriminative unsupervised learning methods such as contrastive learning have demonstrated the ability to learn generalized visual representations on centralized data. It is nonetheless challenging to adapt such methods to a distributed system with unlabeled, private, and heterogeneous client data due to user styles and preferences. Federated learning enables multiple clients to collectively learn a global model without provoking any privacy breach between local clients. On the other hand, another direction of federated learning studies personalized methods to address the local heterogeneity. However, work on solving both generalization and personalization without labels in a decentralized setting remains unfamiliar. In this work, we propose a novel method, FedStyle, to learn a more generalized global model by infusing local style information with local content information for contrastive learning, and to learn more personalized local models by inducing local style information for downstream tasks. The style information is extracted by contrasting original local data with strongly augmented local data (Sobel filtered images). Through extensive experiments with linear evaluations in both IID and non-IID settings, we demonstrate that FedStyle outperforms both the generalization baseline methods and personalization baseline methods in a stylized decentralized setting. Through comprehensive ablations, we demonstrate our design of style infusion and stylized personalization improve performance significantly.</description>

      <title>GPT4RoI: Instruction Tuning Large Language Model on Region-of-Interest</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.03601v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Visual instruction tuning large language model(LLM) on image-text pairs has achieved general-purpose vision-language abilities. However, the lack of region-text pairs limits their advancements to fine-grained multimodal understanding. In this paper, we propose spatial instruction tuning, which introduces the reference to the region-of-interest(RoI) in the instruction. Before sending to LLM, the reference is replaced by RoI features and interleaved with language embeddings as a sequence. Our model GPT4RoI, trained on 7 region-text pair datasets, brings an unprecedented interactive and conversational experience compared to previous image-level models. (1) Interaction beyond language: Users can interact with our model by both language and drawing bounding boxes to flexibly adjust the referring granularity. (2) Versatile multimodal abilities: A variety of attribute information within each RoI can be mined by GPT4RoI, e.g., color, shape, material, action, etc. Furthermore, it can reason about multiple RoIs based on common sense. On the Visual Commonsense Reasoning(VCR) dataset, GPT4RoI achieves a remarkable accuracy of 81.6%, surpassing all existing models by a significant margin (the second place is 75.6%) and almost reaching human-level performance of 85.0%. The code and model can be found at https://github.com/jshilong/GPT4RoI.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.10015v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Automatic fingerprint recognition systems suffer from the threat of presentation attacks due to their wide range of deployment in areas including national borders and commercial applications. A presentation attack can be performed by creating a spoof of a user's fingerprint with or without their consent. This paper presents a dynamic ensemble of deep CNN and handcrafted features to detect presentation attacks in known-material and unknown-material protocols of the liveness detection competition. The proposed presentation attack detection model, in this way, utilizes the capabilities of both deep CNN and handcrafted features techniques and exhibits better performance than their individual performances. We have validated our proposed method on benchmark databases from the Liveness Detection Competition in 2015, 2017, and 2019, yielding overall accuracy of 96.10%, 96.49%, and 94.99% on them, respectively. The proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of classification accuracy.</description>

      <title>Tile Classification Based Viewport Prediction with Multi-modal Fusion Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.14704v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Viewport prediction is a crucial aspect of tile-based 360 video streaming system. However, existing trajectory based methods lack of robustness, also oversimplify the process of information construction and fusion between different modality inputs, leading to the error accumulation problem. In this paper, we propose a tile classification based viewport prediction method with Multi-modal Fusion Transformer, namely MFTR. Specifically, MFTR utilizes transformer-based networks to extract the long-range dependencies within each modality, then mine intra- and inter-modality relations to capture the combined impact of user historical inputs and video contents on future viewport selection. In addition, MFTR categorizes future tiles into two categories: user interested or not, and selects future viewport as the region that contains most user interested tiles. Comparing with predicting head trajectories, choosing future viewport based on tile's binary classification results exhibits better robustness and interpretability. To evaluate our proposed MFTR, we conduct extensive experiments on two widely used PVS-HM and Xu-Gaze dataset. MFTR shows superior performance over state-of-the-art methods in terms of average prediction accuracy and overlap ratio, also presents competitive computation efficiency.</description>

      <title>CapST: Leveraging Capsule Networks and Temporal Attention for Accurate Model Attribution in Deep-fake Videos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.03782v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep-fake videos, generated through AI face-swapping techniques, have gained significant attention due to their potential for impactful impersonation attacks. While most research focuses on real vs. fake detection, attributing a deep-fake to its specific generation model or encoder is vital for forensic analysis, enabling source tracing and tailored countermeasures. This enhances detection by leveraging model-specific artifacts and supports proactive defenses. We investigate the model attribution problem for deep-fake videos using two datasets: Deepfakes from Different Models (DFDM) and GANGen-Detection, both comprising deep-fake videos and GAN-generated images. We use only fake images from GANGen-Detection to align with DFDM's focus on attribution rather than binary classification. We formulate the task as a multiclass classification problem and introduce a novel Capsule-Spatial-Temporal (CapST) model that integrates a truncated VGG19 network for feature extraction, capsule networks for hierarchical encoding, and a spatio-temporal attention mechanism. Video-level fusion captures temporal dependencies across frames. Experiments on DFDM and GANGen-Detection show CapST outperforms baseline models in attribution accuracy while reducing computational cost.</description>

A common approach is to feed the result of a simple inversion, for example the backprojection, to a multiscale convolutional neural network (CNN) which computes the final reconstruction. Despite good results on in-distribution test data, this often results in overfitting certain large-scale structures and poor generalization on out-of-distribution (OOD) samples. Moreover, the memory and computational complexity of multiscale CNNs scale unfavorably with image resolution, making them impractical for application at realistic clinical resolutions. In this paper, we introduce Glimpse, a local coordinate-based neural network for computed tomography which reconstructs a pixel value by processing only the measurements associated with the neighborhood of the pixel. Glimpse significantly outperforms successful CNNs on OOD samples, while achieving comparable or better performance on in-distribution test data and maintaining a memory footprint almost independent of image resolution; 5GB memory suffices to train on 1024x1024 images which is orders of magnitude less than CNNs. Glimpse is fully differentiable and can be used plug-and-play in arbitrary deep learning architectures, enabling feats such as correcting miscalibrated projection orientations. Our implementation and Google Colab demo can be accessed at https://github.com/swing-research/Glimpse.</description>

      <title>Vastextures: Vast repository of textures and PBR materials extracted from real-world images using unsupervised methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17146v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vastextures is a vast repository of 500,000 textures and PBR materials extracted from real-world images using an unsupervised process. The extracted materials and textures are extremely diverse and cover a vast range of real-world patterns, but at the same time less refined compared to existing repositories. The repository is composed of 2D textures cropped from natural images and SVBRDF/PBR materials generated from these textures. Textures and PBR materials are essential for CGI. Existing materials repositories focus on games, animation, and arts, that demand a limited amount of high-quality assets. However, virtual worlds and synthetic data are becoming increasingly important for training A.I systems for computer vision. This application demands a huge amount of diverse assets but at the same time less affected by noisy and unrefined assets. Vastexture aims to address this need by creating a free, huge, and diverse assets repository that covers as many real-world materials as possible. The materials are automatically extracted from natural images in two steps: 1) Automatically scanning a giant amount of images to identify and crop regions with uniform textures. This is done by splitting the image into a grid of cells and identifying regions in which all of the cells share a similar statistical distribution. 2) Extracting the properties of the PBR material from the cropped texture. This is done by randomly guessing every correlation between the properties of the texture image and the properties of the PBR material. The resulting PBR materials exhibit a vast amount of real-world patterns as well as unexpected emergent properties. Neutral nets trained on this repository outperformed nets trained using handcrafted assets.</description>

      <title>Learning Geometric Invariant Features for Classification of Vector Polygons with Graph Message-passing Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04334v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Geometric shape classification of vector polygons remains a challenging task in spatial analysis. Previous studies have primarily focused on deep learning approaches for rasterized vector polygons, while the study of discrete polygon representations and corresponding learning methods remains underexplored. In this study, we investigate a graph-based representation of vector polygons and propose a simple graph message-passing framework, PolyMP, along with its densely self-connected variant, PolyMP-DSC, to learn more expressive and robust latent representations of polygons. This framework hierarchically captures self-looped graph information and learns geometric-invariant features for polygon shape classification. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that combining a permutation-invariant graph message-passing neural network with a densely self-connected mechanism achieves robust performance on benchmark datasets, including synthetic glyphs and real-world building footprints, outperforming several baseline methods. Our findings indicate that PolyMP and PolyMP-DSC effectively capture expressive geometric features that remain invariant under common transformations, such as translation, rotation, scaling, and shearing, while also being robust to trivial vertex removals. Furthermore, we highlight the strong generalization ability of the proposed approach, enabling the transfer of learned geometric features from synthetic glyph polygons to real-world building footprints.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17521v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ever-increasing use of artificial intelligence in autonomous systems has significantly contributed to advance the research on multi-object tracking, adopted in several real-time applications (e.g., autonomous driving, surveillance drones, robotics) to localize and follow the trajectory of multiple objects moving in front of a camera. Current tracking algorithms can be divided into two main categories: some approaches introduce complex heuristics and re-identification models to improve the tracking accuracy and reduce the number of identification switches, without particular attention to the timing performance, whereas other approaches are aimed at reducing response times by removing the re-identification phase, thus penalizing the tracking accuracy. This work proposes a new approach to multi-class object tracking that allows achieving smaller and more predictable execution times, without penalizing the tracking performance. The idea is to reduce the problem of matching predictions with detections into smaller sub-problems by splitting the Hungarian matrix by class and invoking the second re-identification stage only when strictly necessary for a smaller number of elements. The proposed solution was evaluated in complex urban scenarios with several objects of different types (as cars, trucks, bikes, and pedestrians), showing the effectiveness of the multi-class approach with respect to state of the art trackers.</description>

      <title>TDS-CLIP: Temporal Difference Side Network for Efficient VideoAction Recognition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10688v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, large-scale pre-trained vision-language models (e.g., CLIP), have garnered significant attention thanks to their powerful representative capabilities. This inspires researchers in transferring the knowledge from these large pre-trained models to other task-specific models, e.g., Video Action Recognition (VAR) models, via particularly leveraging side networks to enhance the efficiency of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). However, current transferring approaches in VAR tend to directly transfer the frozen knowledge from large pre-trained models to action recognition networks with minimal cost, instead of exploiting the temporal modeling capabilities of the action recognition models themselves. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel memory-efficient Temporal Difference Side Network (TDS-CLIP) to balance knowledge transferring and temporal modeling, avoiding backpropagation in frozen parameter models. Specifically, we introduce a Temporal Difference Adapter (TD-Adapter), which can effectively capture local temporal differences in motion features to strengthen the model's global temporal modeling capabilities. Furthermore, we designed a Side Motion Enhancement Adapter (SME-Adapter) to guide the proposed side network in efficiently learning the rich motion information in videos, thereby improving the side network's ability to capture and learn motion information. Extensive experiments are conducted on three benchmark datasets, including Something-Something V1&amp;V2, and Kinetics-400. Experimental results show that our method achieves competitive performance in video action recognition tasks.</description>

      <title>PointNet with KAN versus PointNet with MLP for 3D Classification and Segmentation of Point Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10084v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have recently gained attention as an alternative to traditional Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) in deep learning frameworks. KANs have been integrated into various deep learning architectures such as convolutional neural networks, graph neural networks, and transformers, with their performance evaluated. However, their effectiveness within point-cloud-based neural networks remains unexplored. To address this gap, we incorporate KANs into PointNet for the first time to evaluate their performance on 3D point cloud classification and segmentation tasks. Specifically, we introduce PointNet-KAN, built upon two key components. First, it employs KANs instead of traditional MLPs. Second, it retains the core principle of PointNet by using shared KAN layers and applying symmetric functions for global feature extraction, ensuring permutation invariance with respect to the input features. In traditional MLPs, the goal is to train the weights and biases with fixed activation functions; however, in KANs, the goal is to train the activation functions themselves. We use Jacobi polynomials to construct the KAN layers. We extensively and systematically evaluate PointNet-KAN across various polynomial degrees and special types such as the Lagrange, Chebyshev, and Gegenbauer polynomials. Our results show that PointNet-KAN achieves competitive performance compared to PointNet with MLPs on benchmark datasets for 3D object classification and part and semantic segmentation, despite employing a shallower and simpler network architecture. We also study a hybrid PointNet model incorporating both KAN and MLP layers. We hope this work serves as a foundation and provides guidance for integrating KANs, as an alternative to MLPs, into more advanced point cloud processing architectures.</description>

      <title>A Survey on All-in-One Image Restoration: Taxonomy, Evaluation and Future Trends</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15067v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Image restoration (IR) aims to recover high-quality images from inputs degraded by various factors such as noise, blur, compression, and adverse weather. Traditional IR methods typically focus on specific types of degradation, which limits their effectiveness in real-world scenarios with complex distortions. In response to this challenge, the all-in-one image restoration (AiOIR) paradigm has recently emerged, offering a unified framework that adeptly addresses multiple degradation types. These innovative models enhance convenience and versatility by adaptively learning degradation-specific features while simultaneously leveraging shared knowledge across diverse corruptions. In this survey, we present the first comprehensive overview of AiOIR, offering a taxonomy that organizes existing methods by architecture innovations, learning strategies, and key improvements. We systematically categorize prevailing approaches and critically assess the challenges these models encounter, proposing future research directions to propel this rapidly evolving field. Our survey begins with an introduction to the foundational concepts of AiOIR models, followed by a categorization of typical scenarios. We then highlight key architectural and algorithmic advances in AiOIR, aiming to inspire continued innovation. To facilitate rigorous evaluation of existing methods, we collate and summarize established datasets, evaluation metrics, and common experimental settings. Finally, we present an objective comparison of open-sourced methods, providing valuable insights for researchers and practitioners. This paper stands as the first comprehensive and insightful review of all-in-one image restoration.

      <title>Factorized Video Autoencoders for Efficient Generative Modelling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04452v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Latent variable generative models have emerged as powerful tools for generative tasks including image and video synthesis. These models are enabled by pretrained autoencoders that map high resolution data into a compressed lower dimensional latent space, where the generative models can subsequently be developed while requiring fewer computational resources. Despite their effectiveness, the direct application of latent variable models to higher dimensional domains such as videos continues to pose challenges for efficient training and inference. In this paper, we propose an autoencoder that projects volumetric data onto a four-plane factorized latent space that grows sublinearly with the input size, making it ideal for higher dimensional data like videos. The design of our factorized model supports straightforward adoption in a number of conditional generation tasks with latent diffusion models (LDMs), such as class-conditional generation, frame prediction, and video interpolation. Our results show that the proposed four-plane latent space retains a rich representation needed for high-fidelity reconstructions despite the heavy compression, while simultaneously enabling LDMs to operate with significant improvements in speed and memory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08763v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current fake image detectors trained on large synthetic image datasets perform satisfactorily on limited studied generative models. However, these detectors suffer a notable performance decline over unseen models. Besides, collecting adequate training data from online generative models is often expensive or infeasible. To overcome these issues, we propose Few-Shot Detector (FSD), a novel AI-generated image detector which learns a specialized metric space for effectively distinguishing unseen fake images using very few samples. Experiments show that FSD achieves state-of-the-art performance by $+11.6\%$ average accuracy on the GenImage dataset with only $10$ additional samples. More importantly, our method is better capable of capturing the intra-category commonality in unseen images without further training. Our code is available at https://github.com/teheperinko541/Few-Shot-AIGI-Detector.</description>

      <title>Latent Action Learning Requires Supervision in the Presence of Distractors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00379v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, latent action learning, pioneered by Latent Action Policies (LAPO), have shown remarkable pre-training efficiency on observation-only data, offering potential for leveraging vast amounts of video available on the web for embodied AI. However, prior work has focused on distractor-free data, where changes between observations are primarily explained by ground-truth actions. Unfortunately, real-world videos contain action-correlated distractors that may hinder latent action learning. Using Distracting Control Suite (DCS) we empirically investigate the effect of distractors on latent action learning and demonstrate that LAPO struggle in such scenario. We propose LAOM, a simple LAPO modification that improves the quality of latent actions by 8x, as measured by linear probing. Importantly, we show that providing supervision with ground-truth actions, as few as 2.5% of the full dataset, during latent action learning improves downstream performance by 4.2x on average. Our findings suggest that integrating supervision during Latent Action Models (LAM) training is critical in the presence of distractors, challenging the conventional pipeline of first learning LAM and only then decoding from latent to ground-truth actions.</description>

      <title>Object-Centric Latent Action Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09680v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Leveraging vast amounts of unlabeled internet video data for embodied AI is currently bottlenecked by the lack of action labels and the presence of action-correlated visual distractors. Although recent latent action policy optimization (LAPO) has shown promise in inferring proxy-action labels from visual observations, its performance degrades significantly when distractors are present. To address this limitation, we propose a novel object-centric latent action learning framework that centers on objects rather than pixels. We leverage self-supervised object-centric pretraining to disentangle action-related and distracting dynamics. This allows LAPO to focus on task-relevant interactions, resulting in more robust proxy-action labels, enabling better imitation learning and efficient adaptation of the agent with just a few action-labeled trajectories. We evaluated our method in eight visually complex tasks across the Distracting Control Suite (DCS) and Distracting MetaWorld (DMW). Our results show that object-centric pretraining mitigates the negative effects of distractors by 50%, as measured by downstream task performance: average return (DCS) and success rate (DMW).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20490v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Human activity is moderated by norms; however, supervision for normative reasoning is sparse, particularly where norms are physically- or socially-grounded. We thus present EGONORMIA $\|\epsilon\|$, comprising 1,853 (200 for EGONORMIA-verified) multiple choice questions (MCQs) grounded within egocentric videos of human interactions, enabling the evaluation and improvement of normative reasoning in vision-language models (VLMs). EGONORMIA spans seven norm categories: safety, privacy, proxemics, politeness, cooperation, coordination/proactivity, and communication/legibility. To compile this dataset at scale, we propose a novel pipeline to generate grounded MCQs from raw egocentric video. Our work demonstrates that current state-of-the-art VLMs lack robust grounded norm understanding, scoring a maximum of 54% on EGONORMIA and 65% on EGONORMIA-verified, with performance across norm categories indicating significant risks of safety and privacy when VLMs are used in real-world agents. We additionally explore methods for improving normative understanding, demonstrating that a naive retrieval-based generation (RAG) method using EGONORMIA can enhance normative reasoning in VLMs.</description>

      <title>CompMarkGS: Robust Watermarking for Compressed 3D Gaussian Splatting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12836v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is increasingly adopted in various academic and commercial applications due to its real-time and high-quality rendering capabilities, emphasizing the growing need for copyright protection technologies for 3DGS. However, the large model size of 3DGS requires developing efficient compression techniques. This highlights the necessity of an integrated framework that addresses copyright protection and data compression for 3D content. Nevertheless, existing 3DGS watermarking methods significantly degrade watermark performance under 3DGS compression methods, particularly quantization-based approaches that achieve superior compression performance. To ensure reliable watermark detection under compression, we propose a compression-tolerant anchor-based 3DGS watermarking, which preserves watermark integrity and rendering quality. This is achieved by introducing anchor-based 3DGS watermarking. We embed the watermark into the anchor attributes, particularly the anchor feature, to enhance security and rendering quality. We also propose a quantization distortion layer that injects quantization noise during training, preserving the watermark after quantization-based compression. Moreover, we employ a frequency-aware anchor growing strategy that improves rendering quality and watermark performance by effectively identifying Gaussians in high-frequency regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method preserves the watermark even under compression and maintains high rendering quality.</description>

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as mainstream framework in visual generation. Building upon this success, the integration of Mixture of Experts (MoE) methods has shown promise in enhancing model scalability and performance. In this paper, we introduce Race-DiT, a novel MoE model for diffusion transformers with a flexible routing strategy, Expert Race. By allowing tokens and experts to compete together and select the top candidates, the model learns to dynamically assign experts to critical tokens. Additionally, we propose per-layer regularization to address challenges in shallow layer learning, and router similarity loss to prevent mode collapse, ensuring better expert utilization. Extensive experiments on ImageNet validate the effectiveness of our approach, showcasing significant performance gains while promising scaling properties.</description>

      <title>What Changed and What Could Have Changed? State-Change Counterfactuals for Procedure-Aware Video Representation Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21055v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding a procedural activity requires modeling both how action steps transform the scene and how evolving scene transformations can influence the sequence of action steps, even those that are accidental or erroneous. Existing work has studied procedure-aware video representations by proposing novel approaches such as modeling the temporal order of actions, and has not explicitly learned the state changes (scene transformations). In this work, we study procedure-aware video representation learning by incorporating state-change descriptions generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) as supervision signals for video encoders. Moreover, we generate state-change counterfactuals that simulate hypothesized failure outcomes, allowing models to learn by imagining the unseen ``What if'' scenarios. This counterfactual reasoning facilitates the model's ability to understand the cause and effect of each step in an activity. To verify the procedure awareness of our model, we conduct extensive experiments on procedure-aware tasks, including temporal action segmentation, error detection, action phase classification, frame retrieval, multi-instance retrieval, and action recognition. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed state-change descriptions and their counterfactuals, and achieve significant improvements on multiple tasks. We will make our source code and data publicly available soon.</description>

      <title>CAT: A Conditional Adaptation Tailor for Efficient and Effective Instance-Specific Pansharpening on Real-World Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10242v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pansharpening is a crucial remote sensing technique that fuses low-resolution multispectral (LRMS) images with high-resolution panchromatic (PAN) images to generate high-resolution multispectral (HRMS) imagery. Although deep learning techniques have significantly advanced pansharpening, many existing methods suffer from limited cross-sensor generalization and high computational overhead, restricting their real-time applications. To address these challenges, we propose an efficient framework that quickly adapts to a specific input instance, completing both training and inference in a short time. Our framework splits the input image into multiple patches, selects a subset for unsupervised CAT training, and then performs inference on all patches, stitching them into the final output. The CAT module, integrated between the feature extraction and channel transformation stages of a pre-trained network, tailors the fused features and fixes the parameters for efficient inference, generating improved results. Our approach offers two key advantages: (1) $\textit{Improved Generalization Ability}$: by mitigating cross-sensor degradation, our model--although pre-trained on a specific dataset--achieves superior performance on datasets captured by other sensors; (2) $\textit{Enhanced Computational Efficiency}$: the CAT-enhanced network can swiftly adapt to the test sample using the single LRMS-PAN pair input, without requiring extensive large-scale data retraining. Experiments on the real-world data from WorldView-3 and WorldView-2 datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on cross-sensor real-world data, while achieving both training and inference of $512\times512$ image within $\textit{0.4 seconds}$ and $4000\times4000$ image within $\textit{3 seconds}$ at the fastest setting on a commonly used RTX 3090 GPU.</description>

      <title>PhysNav-DG: A Novel Adaptive Framework for Robust VLM-Sensor Fusion in Navigation Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01881v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Robust navigation in diverse environments and domains requires both accurate state estimation and transparent decision making. We present PhysNav-DG, a novel framework that integrates classical sensor fusion with the semantic power of vision-language models. Our dual-branch architecture predicts navigation actions from multi-sensor inputs while simultaneously generating detailed chain-of-thought explanations. A modified Adaptive Kalman Filter dynamically adjusts its noise parameters based on environmental context. It leverages several streams of raw sensor data along with semantic insights from models such as LLaMA 3.2 11B and BLIP-2. To evaluate our approach, we introduce the MD-NEX Benchmark, a novel multi-domain dataset that unifies indoor navigation, autonomous driving, and social navigation tasks with ground-truth actions and human-validated explanations. Extensive experiments and ablations show that PhysNav-DG improves navigation success rates by over 20% and achieves high efficiency, with explanations that are both highly grounded and clear. This work connects high-level semantic reasoning and geometric planning for safer and more trustworthy autonomous systems.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Glass Defect Detection with Diffusion Models: Addressing Imbalanced Datasets in Manufacturing Quality Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03134v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Visual defect detection in industrial glass manufacturing remains a critical challenge due to the low frequency of defective products, leading to imbalanced datasets that limit the performance of deep learning models and computer vision systems. This paper presents a novel approach using Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) to generate synthetic defective glass product images for data augmentation, effectively addressing class imbalance issues in manufacturing quality control and automated visual inspection. The methodology significantly enhances image classification performance of standard CNN architectures (ResNet50V2, EfficientNetB0, and MobileNetV2) in detecting anomalies by increasing the minority class representation. Experimental results demonstrate substantial improvements in key machine learning metrics, particularly in recall for defective samples across all tested deep neural network architectures while maintaining perfect precision. The most dramatic improvement was observed in ResNet50V2's overall classification accuracy, which increased from seventy-eight percent to ninety-three percent when trained with the augmented data. This work provides a scalable, cost effective approach to enhancing automated defect detection in glass manufacturing that can potentially be extended to other industrial quality assurance systems and industries with similar class imbalance challenges.</description>

      <title>A Unit Enhancement and Guidance Framework for Audio-Driven Avatar Video Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03603v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Audio-driven human animation technology is widely used in human-computer interaction, and the emergence of diffusion models has further advanced its development. Currently, most methods rely on multi-stage generation and intermediate representations, resulting in long inference time and issues with generation quality in specific foreground regions and audio-motion consistency. These shortcomings are primarily due to the lack of localized fine-grained supervised guidance. To address above challenges, we propose Parts-aware Audio-driven Human Animation, PAHA, a unit enhancement and guidance framework for audio-driven upper-body animation. We introduce two key methods: Parts-Aware Re-weighting (PAR) and Parts Consistency Enhancement (PCE). PAR dynamically adjusts regional training loss weights based on pose confidence scores, effectively improving visual quality. PCE constructs and trains diffusion-based regional audio-visual classifiers to improve the consistency of motion and co-speech audio. Afterwards, we design two novel inference guidance methods for the foregoing classifiers, Sequential Guidance (SG) and Differential Guidance (DG), to balance efficiency and quality respectively. Additionally, we build CNAS, the first public Chinese News Anchor Speech dataset, to advance research and validation in this field. Extensive experimental results and user studies demonstrate that PAHA significantly outperforms existing methods in audio-motion alignment and video-related evaluations. The codes and CNAS dataset will be released upon acceptance.</description>

      <title>Aesthetics Without Semantics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05331v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While it is easy for human observers to judge an image as beautiful or ugly, aesthetic decisions result from a combination of entangled perceptual and cognitive (semantic) factors, making the understanding of aesthetic judgements particularly challenging from a scientific point of view. Furthermore, our research shows a prevailing bias in current databases, which include mostly beautiful images, further complicating the study and prediction of aesthetic responses. We address these limitations by creating a database of images with minimal semantic content and devising, and next exploiting, a method to generate images on the ugly side of aesthetic valuations. The resulting Minimum Semantic Content (MSC) database consists of a large and balanced collection of 10,426 images, each evaluated by 100 observers. We next use established image metrics to demonstrate how augmenting an image set biased towards beautiful images with ugly images can modify, or even invert, an observed relationship between image features and aesthetics valuation. Taken together, our study reveals that works in empirical aesthetics attempting to link image content and aesthetic judgements may magnify, underestimate, or simply miss interesting effects due to a limitation of the range of aesthetic values they consider.</description>

      <title>ViC-Bench: Benchmarking Visual-Interleaved Chain-of-Thought Capability in MLLMs with Free-Style Intermediate State Representations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14404v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Visual-Interleaved Chain-of-Thought (VI-CoT) enables MLLMs to continually update their understanding and decisions based on step-wise intermediate visual states (IVS), much like a human would, which demonstrates impressive success in various tasks, thereby leading to emerged advancements in related benchmarks. Despite promising progress, current benchmarks provide models with relatively fixed IVS, rather than free-style IVS, whch might forcibly distort the original thinking trajectories, failing to evaluate their intrinsic reasoning capabilities. More importantly, existing benchmarks neglect to systematically explore the impact factors that IVS would impart to untamed reasoning performance. To tackle above gaps, we introduce a specialized benchmark termed ViC-Bench, consisting of four representive tasks: maze navigation, jigsaw puzzle, embodied long-horizon planning, and complex counting, where each task has dedicated free-style IVS generation pipeline supporting function calls. To systematically examine VI-CoT capability, we propose a thorough evaluation suite incorporating a progressive three-stage strategy with targeted new metrics. Besides, we establish Incremental Prompting Information Injection (IPII) strategy to ablatively explore the prompting factors for VI-CoT. We extensively conduct evaluations for 18 advanced MLLMs, revealing key insights into their VI-CoT capability. Our proposed benchmark is publicly open at Huggingface.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14521v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-fidelity 3D object synthesis remains significantly more challenging than 2D image generation due to the unstructured nature of mesh data and the cubic complexity of dense volumetric grids. Existing two-stage pipelines-compressing meshes with a VAE (using either 2D or 3D supervision), followed by latent diffusion sampling-often suffer from severe detail loss caused by inefficient representations and modality mismatches introduced in VAE. We introduce Sparc3D, a unified framework that combines a sparse deformable marching cubes representation Sparcubes with a novel encoder Sparconv-VAE. Sparcubes converts raw meshes into high-resolution ($1024^3$) surfaces with arbitrary topology by scattering signed distance and deformation fields onto a sparse cube, allowing differentiable optimization. Sparconv-VAE is the first modality-consistent variational autoencoder built entirely upon sparse convolutional networks, enabling efficient and near-lossless 3D reconstruction suitable for high-resolution generative modeling through latent diffusion. Sparc3D achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction fidelity on challenging inputs, including open surfaces, disconnected components, and intricate geometry. It preserves fine-grained shape details, reduces training and inference cost, and integrates naturally with latent diffusion models for scalable, high-resolution 3D generation.</description>

      <title>VScan: Rethinking Visual Token Reduction for Efficient Large Vision-Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22654v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have advanced multi-modal understanding by incorporating finer-grained visual perception and encoding. However, such methods incur significant computational costs due to longer visual token sequences, posing challenges for real-time deployment. To mitigate this, prior studies have explored pruning unimportant visual tokens either at the output layer of the visual encoder or at the early layers of the language model. In this work, we revisit these design choices and reassess their effectiveness through comprehensive empirical studies of how visual tokens are processed throughout the visual encoding and language decoding stages. Guided by these insights, we propose VScan, a two-stage visual token reduction framework that addresses token redundancy by: (1) integrating complementary global and local scans with token merging during visual encoding, and (2) introducing pruning at intermediate layers of the language model. Extensive experimental results across four LVLMs validate the effectiveness of VScan in accelerating inference and demonstrate its superior performance over current state-of-the-arts on sixteen benchmarks. Notably, when applied to LLaVA-NeXT-7B, VScan achieves a 2.91$\times$ speedup in prefilling and a 10$\times$ reduction in FLOPs, while retaining 95.4\% of the original performance. Code is available at https://github.com/Tencent/SelfEvolvingAgent/tree/main/VScan.</description>

      <title>Incentivizing Reasoning for Advanced Instruction-Following of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01413v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Existing large language models (LLMs) face challenges of following complex instructions, especially when multiple constraints are present and organized in paralleling, chaining, and branching structures. One intuitive solution, namely chain-of-thought (CoT), is expected to universally improve capabilities of LLMs. However, we find that the vanilla CoT exerts a negative impact on performance due to its superficial reasoning pattern of simply paraphrasing the instructions. It fails to peel back the compositions of constraints for identifying their relationship across hierarchies of types and dimensions. To this end, we propose a systematic method to boost LLMs in dealing with complex instructions via incentivizing reasoning for test-time compute scaling. First, we stem from the decomposition of complex instructions under existing taxonomies and propose a reproducible data acquisition method. Second, we exploit reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable rule-centric reward signals to cultivate reasoning specifically for instruction following. We address the shallow, non-essential nature of reasoning under complex instructions via sample-wise contrast for superior CoT enforcement. We also exploit behavior cloning of experts to facilitate steady distribution shift from fast-thinking LLMs to skillful reasoners. Extensive evaluations on seven comprehensive benchmarks confirm the validity of the proposed method, where a 1.5B LLM achieves 11.74% gains with performance comparable to a 8B LLM.

      <title>High Performance Space Debris Tracking in Complex Skylight Backgrounds with a Large-Scale Dataset</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02614v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the rapid development of space exploration, space debris has attracted more attention due to its potential extreme threat, leading to the need for real-time and accurate debris tracking. However, existing methods are mainly based on traditional signal processing, which cannot effectively process the complex background and dense space debris. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based Space Debris Tracking Network~(SDT-Net) to achieve highly accurate debris tracking. SDT-Net effectively represents the feature of debris, enhancing the efficiency and stability of end-to-end model learning. To train and evaluate this model effectively, we also produce a large-scale dataset Space Debris Tracking Dataset (SDTD) by a novel observation-based data simulation scheme. SDTD contains 18,040 video sequences with a total of 62,562 frames and covers 250,000 synthetic space debris. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our model and the challenging of our dataset. Furthermore, we test our model on real data from the Antarctic Station, achieving a MOTA score of 70.6%, which demonstrates its strong transferability to real-world scenarios. Our dataset and code will be released soon.</description>

      <title>Towards Holistic Visual Quality Assessment of AI-Generated Videos: A LLM-Based Multi-Dimensional Evaluation Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04715v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The development of AI-Generated Video (AIGV) technology has been remarkable in recent years, significantly transforming the paradigm of video content production. However, AIGVs still suffer from noticeable visual quality defects, such as noise, blurriness, frame jitter and low dynamic degree, which severely impact the user's viewing experience. Therefore, an effective automatic visual quality assessment is of great importance for AIGV content regulation and generative model improvement. In this work, we decompose the visual quality of AIGVs into three dimensions: technical quality, motion quality, and video semantics. For each dimension, we design corresponding encoder to achieve effective feature representation. Moreover, considering the outstanding performance of large language models (LLMs) in various vision and language tasks, we introduce a LLM as the quality regression module. To better enable the LLM to establish reasoning associations between multi-dimensional features and visual quality, we propose a specially designed multi-modal prompt engineering framework. Additionally, we incorporate LoRA fine-tuning technology during the training phase, allowing the LLM to better adapt to specific tasks. Our proposed method achieved \textbf{second place} in the NTIRE 2025 Quality Assessment of AI-Generated Content Challenge: Track 2 AI Generated video, demonstrating its effectiveness.

      <description>arXiv:2506.04817v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Event cameras offer significant advantages over traditional frame-based sensors, including higher temporal resolution, lower latency and dynamic range. However, efficiently converting event streams into formats compatible with standard computer vision pipelines remains a challenging problem, particularly in the presence of noise. In this paper, we propose Spike-TBR, a novel event-based encoding strategy based on Temporal Binary Representation (TBR), addressing its vulnerability to noise by integrating spiking neurons. Spike-TBR combines the frame-based advantages of TBR with the noise-filtering capabilities of spiking neural networks, creating a more robust representation of event streams. We evaluate four variants of Spike-TBR, each using different spiking neurons, across multiple datasets, demonstrating superior performance in noise-affected scenarios while improving the results on clean data. Our method bridges the gap between spike-based and frame-based processing, offering a simple noise-resilient solution for event-driven vision applications.</description>

      <title>Q-Ponder: A Unified Training Pipeline for Reasoning-based Visual Quality Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05384v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent studies demonstrate that multimodal large language models (MLLMs) can proficiently evaluate visual quality through interpretable assessments. However, existing approaches typically treat quality scoring and reasoning descriptions as separate tasks with disjoint optimization objectives, leading to a trade-off: models adept at quality reasoning descriptions struggle with precise score regression, while score-focused models lack interpretability. This limitation hinders the full potential of MLLMs in visual quality assessment, where accuracy and interpretability should be mutually reinforcing. To address this, we propose a unified two-stage training framework comprising a cold-start stage and a reinforcement learning-based fine-tuning stage. Specifically, in the first stage, we distill high-quality data from a teacher model through expert-designed prompts, initializing reasoning capabilities via cross-entropy loss supervision. In the second stage, we introduce a novel reward with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to jointly optimize scoring accuracy and reasoning consistency. We designate the models derived from these two stages as Q-Ponder-CI and Q-Ponder. Extensive experiments show that Q-Ponder achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on quality score regression benchmarks, delivering up to 6.5% higher SRCC on cross-domain datasets. Furthermore, Q-Ponder significantly outperforms description-based SOTA models, including its teacher model Qwen-2.5-VL-72B, particularly in description accuracy and reasonableness, demonstrating the generalization potential over diverse tasks.</description>

      <title>Towards Reliable Identification of Diffusion-based Image Manipulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05466v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Changing facial expressions, gestures, or background details may dramatically alter the meaning conveyed by an image. Notably, recent advances in diffusion models greatly improve the quality of image manipulation while also opening the door to misuse. Identifying changes made to authentic images, thus, becomes an important task, constantly challenged by new diffusion-based editing tools. To this end, we propose a novel approach for ReliAble iDentification of inpainted AReas (RADAR). RADAR builds on existing foundation models and combines features from different image modalities. It also incorporates an auxiliary contrastive loss that helps to isolate manipulated image patches. We demonstrate these techniques to significantly improve both the accuracy of our method and its generalisation to a large number of diffusion models. To support realistic evaluation, we further introduce BBC-PAIR, a new comprehensive benchmark, with images tampered by 28 diffusion models. Our experiments show that RADAR achieves excellent results, outperforming the state-of-the-art in detecting and localising image edits made by both seen and unseen diffusion models. Our code, data and models will be publicly available at https://alex-costanzino.github.io/radar/.</description>

      <title>AR-RAG: Autoregressive Retrieval Augmentation for Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06962v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce Autoregressive Retrieval Augmentation (AR-RAG), a novel paradigm that enhances image generation by autoregressively incorporating knearest neighbor retrievals at the patch level. Unlike prior methods that perform a single, static retrieval before generation and condition the entire generation on fixed reference images, AR-RAG performs context-aware retrievals at each generation step, using prior-generated patches as queries to retrieve and incorporate the most relevant patch-level visual references, enabling the model to respond to evolving generation needs while avoiding limitations (e.g., over-copying, stylistic bias, etc.) prevalent in existing methods. To realize AR-RAG, we propose two parallel frameworks: (1) Distribution-Augmentation in Decoding (DAiD), a training-free plug-and-use decoding strategy that directly merges the distribution of model-predicted patches with the distribution of retrieved patches, and (2) Feature-Augmentation in Decoding (FAiD), a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that progressively smooths the features of retrieved patches via multi-scale convolution operations and leverages them to augment the image generation process. We validate the effectiveness of AR-RAG on widely adopted benchmarks, including Midjourney-30K, GenEval and DPG-Bench, demonstrating significant performance gains over state-of-the-art image generation models.</description>

      <title>DeepVideo-R1: Video Reinforcement Fine-Tuning via Difficulty-aware Regressive GRPO</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07464v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent works have demonstrated the effectiveness of reinforcement learning (RL)-based post-training in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). In particular, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has shown impressive success by employing a PPO-style reinforcement algorithm with group-based normalized rewards. However, the application of GRPO to Video Large Language Models (Video LLMs) has been less studied. In this paper, we explore GRPO for video LLMs and identify two primary issues that impede its effective learning: (1) reliance on safeguards, and (2) the vanishing advantage problem. To mitigate these challenges, we propose DeepVideo-R1, a video large language model trained with our proposed Reg-GRPO (Regressive GRPO) and difficulty-aware data augmentation strategy. Reg-GRPO reformulates the GRPO objective as a regression task, directly predicting the advantage in GRPO. This design eliminates the need for safeguards like clipping and min functions, thereby facilitating more direct policy guidance by aligning the model with the advantage values. We also design the difficulty-aware data augmentation strategy that dynamically augments training samples at solvable difficulty levels, fostering diverse and informative reward signals. Our comprehensive experiments show that DeepVideo-R1 significantly improves video reasoning performance across multiple video reasoning benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Play to Generalize: Learning to Reason Through Game Play</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08011v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Developing generalizable reasoning capabilities in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) remains challenging. Motivated by cognitive science literature suggesting that gameplay promotes transferable cognitive skills, we propose a novel post-training paradigm, Visual Game Learning, or ViGaL, where MLLMs develop out-of-domain generalization of multimodal reasoning through playing arcade-like games. Specifically, we show that post-training a 7B-parameter MLLM via reinforcement learning (RL) on simple arcade-like games, e.g. Snake, significantly enhances its downstream performance on multimodal math benchmarks like MathVista, and on multi-discipline questions like MMMU, without seeing any worked solutions, equations, or diagrams during RL, suggesting the capture of transferable reasoning skills. Remarkably, our model outperforms specialist models tuned on multimodal reasoning data in multimodal reasoning benchmarks, while preserving the base model's performance on general visual benchmarks, a challenge where specialist models often fall short. Our findings suggest a new post-training paradigm: synthetic, rule-based games can serve as controllable and scalable pre-text tasks that unlock generalizable multimodal reasoning abilities in MLLMs.</description>

      <title>InceptionMamba: An Efficient Hybrid Network with Large Band Convolution and Bottleneck Mamba</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08735v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Within the family of convolutional neural networks, InceptionNeXt has shown excellent competitiveness in image classification and a number of downstream tasks. Built on parallel one-dimensional strip convolutions, however, it suffers from limited ability of capturing spatial dependencies along different dimensions and fails to fully explore spatial modeling in local neighborhood. Besides, inherent locality constraints of convolution operations are detrimental to effective global context modeling. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel backbone architecture termed InceptionMamba in this study. More specifically, the traditional one-dimensional strip convolutions are replaced by orthogonal band convolutions in our InceptionMamba to achieve cohesive spatial modeling. Furthermore, global contextual modeling can be achieved via a bottleneck Mamba module, facilitating enhanced cross-channel information fusion and enlarged receptive field. Extensive evaluations on classification and various downstream tasks demonstrate that the proposed InceptionMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance with superior parameter and computational efficiency. The source code will be available at https://github.com/Wake1021/InceptionMamba.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08817v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Video content comprehension is essential for various applications, ranging from video analysis to interactive systems. Despite advancements in large-scale vision-language models (VLMs), these models often struggle to capture the nuanced, spatiotemporal details essential for thorough video analysis. To address this gap, we introduce Video-CoT, a groundbreaking dataset designed to enhance spatiotemporal understanding using Chain-of-Thought (CoT) methodologies. Video-CoT contains 192,000 fine-grained spa-tiotemporal question-answer pairs and 23,000 high-quality CoT-annotated samples, providing a solid foundation for evaluating spatiotemporal understanding in video comprehension. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive benchmark for assessing these tasks, with each task featuring 750 images and tailored evaluation metrics. Our extensive experiments reveal that current VLMs face significant challenges in achieving satisfactory performance, high-lighting the difficulties of effective spatiotemporal understanding. Overall, the Video-CoT dataset and benchmark open new avenues for research in multimedia understanding and support future innovations in intelligent systems requiring advanced video analysis capabilities. By making these resources publicly available, we aim to encourage further exploration in this critical area. Project website:https://video-cot.github.io/ .</description>

      <title>Cosmos-Drive-Dreams: Scalable Synthetic Driving Data Generation with World Foundation Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09042v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Collecting and annotating real-world data for safety-critical physical AI systems, such as Autonomous Vehicle (AV), is time-consuming and costly. It is especially challenging to capture rare edge cases, which play a critical role in training and testing of an AV system. To address this challenge, we introduce the Cosmos-Drive-Dreams - a synthetic data generation (SDG) pipeline that aims to generate challenging scenarios to facilitate downstream tasks such as perception and driving policy training. Powering this pipeline is Cosmos-Drive, a suite of models specialized from NVIDIA Cosmos world foundation model for the driving domain and are capable of controllable, high-fidelity, multi-view, and spatiotemporally consistent driving video generation. We showcase the utility of these models by applying Cosmos-Drive-Dreams to scale the quantity and diversity of driving datasets with high-fidelity and challenging scenarios. Experimentally, we demonstrate that our generated data helps in mitigating long-tail distribution problems and enhances generalization in downstream tasks such as 3D lane detection, 3D object detection and driving policy learning. We open source our pipeline toolkit, dataset and model weights through the NVIDIA's Cosmos platform.

      <title>ODG: Occupancy Prediction Using Dual Gaussians</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09417v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Occupancy prediction infers fine-grained 3D geometry and semantics from camera images of the surrounding environment, making it a critical perception task for autonomous driving. Existing methods either adopt dense grids as scene representation, which is difficult to scale to high resolution, or learn the entire scene using a single set of sparse queries, which is insufficient to handle the various object characteristics. In this paper, we present ODG, a hierarchical dual sparse Gaussian representation to effectively capture complex scene dynamics. Building upon the observation that driving scenes can be universally decomposed into static and dynamic counterparts, we define dual Gaussian queries to better model the diverse scene objects. We utilize a hierarchical Gaussian transformer to predict the occupied voxel centers and semantic classes along with the Gaussian parameters. Leveraging the real-time rendering capability of 3D Gaussian Splatting, we also impose rendering supervision with available depth and semantic map annotations injecting pixel-level alignment to boost occupancy learning. Extensive experiments on the Occ3D-nuScenes and Occ3D-Waymo benchmarks demonstrate our proposed method sets new state-of-the-art results while maintaining low inference cost.</description>

      <title>Urban1960SatSeg: Unsupervised Semantic Segmentation of Mid-20$^{th}$ century Urban Landscapes with Satellite Imageries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09476v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Historical satellite imagery, such as mid-20$^{th}$ century Keyhole data, offers rare insights into understanding early urban development and long-term transformation. However, severe quality degradation (e.g., distortion, misalignment, and spectral scarcity) and annotation absence have long hindered semantic segmentation on such historical RS imagery. To bridge this gap and enhance understanding of urban development, we introduce $\textbf{Urban1960SatBench}$, an annotated segmentation dataset based on historical satellite imagery with the earliest observation time among all existing segmentation datasets, along with a benchmark framework for unsupervised segmentation tasks, $\textbf{Urban1960SatUSM}$. First, $\textbf{Urban1960SatBench}$ serves as a novel, expertly annotated semantic segmentation dataset built on mid-20$^{th}$ century Keyhole imagery, covering 1,240 km$^2$ and key urban classes (buildings, roads, farmland, water). As the earliest segmentation dataset of its kind, it provides a pioneering benchmark for historical urban understanding. Second, $\textbf{Urban1960SatUSM}$(Unsupervised Segmentation Model) is a novel unsupervised semantic segmentation framework for historical RS imagery. It employs a confidence-aware alignment mechanism and focal-confidence loss based on a self-supervised learning architecture, which generates robust pseudo-labels and adaptively prioritizes prediction difficulty and label reliability to improve unsupervised segmentation on noisy historical data without manual supervision. Experiments show Urban1960SatUSM significantly outperforms existing unsupervised segmentation methods on Urban1960SatSeg for segmenting historical urban scenes, promising in paving the way for quantitative studies of long-term urban change using modern computer vision. Our benchmark and supplementary material are available at https://github.com/Tianxiang-Hao/Urban1960SatSeg.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09612v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Text-to-image generation models have made significant progress in producing high-quality images from textual descriptions, yet they continue to struggle with maintaining subject consistency across multiple images, a fundamental requirement for visual storytelling. Existing methods attempt to address this by either fine-tuning models on large-scale story visualization datasets, which is resource-intensive, or by using training-free techniques that share information across generations, which still yield limited success. In this paper, we introduce a novel training-free sampling strategy called Zigzag Sampling with Asymmetric Prompts and Visual Sharing to enhance subject consistency in visual story generation. Our approach proposes a zigzag sampling mechanism that alternates between asymmetric prompting to retain subject characteristics, while a visual sharing module transfers visual cues across generated images to %further enforce consistency. Experimental results, based on both quantitative metrics and qualitative evaluations, demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms previous approaches in generating coherent and consistent visual stories. The code is available at https://github.com/Mingxiao-Li/Asymmetry-Zigzag-StoryDiffusion.</description>

      <title>MMME: A Spontaneous Multi-Modal Micro-Expression Dataset Enabling Visual-Physiological Fusion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09834v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Micro-expressions (MEs) are subtle, fleeting nonverbal cues that reveal an individual's genuine emotional state. Their analysis has attracted considerable interest due to its promising applications in fields such as healthcare, criminal investigation, and human-computer interaction. However, existing ME research is limited to single visual modality, overlooking the rich emotional information conveyed by other physiological modalities, resulting in ME recognition and spotting performance far below practical application needs. Therefore, exploring the cross-modal association mechanism between ME visual features and physiological signals (PS), and developing a multimodal fusion framework, represents a pivotal step toward advancing ME analysis. This study introduces a novel ME dataset, MMME, which, for the first time, enables synchronized collection of facial action signals (MEs), central nervous system signals (EEG), and peripheral PS (PPG, RSP, SKT, EDA, and ECG). By overcoming the constraints of existing ME corpora, MMME comprises 634 MEs, 2,841 macro-expressions (MaEs), and 2,890 trials of synchronized multimodal PS, establishing a robust foundation for investigating ME neural mechanisms and conducting multimodal fusion-based analyses. Extensive experiments validate the dataset's reliability and provide benchmarks for ME analysis, demonstrating that integrating MEs with PS significantly enhances recognition and spotting performance. To the best of our knowledge, MMME is the most comprehensive ME dataset to date in terms of modality diversity. It provides critical data support for exploring the neural mechanisms of MEs and uncovering the visual-physiological synergistic effects, driving a paradigm shift in ME research from single-modality visual analysis to multimodal fusion. The dataset will be publicly available upon acceptance of this paper.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09196v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Class imbalance severely impacts machine learning performance on minority classes in real-world applications. While various solutions exist, active learning offers a fundamental fix by strategically collecting balanced, informative labeled examples from abundant unlabeled data. We introduce DIRECT, an algorithm that identifies class separation boundaries and selects the most uncertain nearby examples for annotation. By reducing the problem to one-dimensional active learning, DIRECT leverages established theory to handle batch labeling and label noise -- another common challenge in data annotation that particularly affects active learning methods. Our work presents the first comprehensive study of active learning under both class imbalance and label noise. Extensive experiments on imbalanced datasets show DIRECT reduces annotation costs by over 60\% compared to state-of-the-art active learning methods and over 80\% versus random sampling, while maintaining robustness to label noise.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Object Hallucination in Large Vision-Language Models via Image-Grounded Guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08680v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The advancement of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) has increasingly highlighted the critical issue of their tendency to hallucinate non-existing objects in the images. To address this issue, previous works focused on using specially curated datasets or powerful LLMs to rectify the outputs of LVLMs. However, these approaches require either costly training or fine-tuning, or API access to proprietary LLMs for post-generation correction. In response to these limitations, we propose Mitigating hallucinAtion via image-gRounded guIdaNcE (MARINE), a framework that is both training-free and API-free. MARINE effectively and efficiently reduces object hallucinations during inference by introducing image-grounded guidance to LVLMs. This is achieved by leveraging open-source vision models to extract object-level information, thereby enhancing the precision of LVLM-generated content. Our framework's flexibility further allows for the integration of multiple vision models, enabling more reliable and robust object-level guidance. Through comprehensive evaluations across 5 popular LVLMs with diverse evaluation metrics and benchmarks, we demonstrate the effectiveness of MARINE, which even outperforms existing fine-tuning-based methods. Remarkably, it reduces hallucinations consistently in GPT-4V-assisted evaluation while maintaining the detailedness of LVLMs' generations. We release our code at https://github.com/Linxi-ZHAO/MARINE.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06479v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite significant advancements, large multimodal models (LMMs) still struggle to bridge the gap between low-level visual perception -- focusing on shapes, sizes, and layouts -- and high-level language reasoning, such as semantics and logic. This limitation is evident in tasks that require precise visual perception, like comparing geometric properties or solving visual reasoning problems. To study this failure mode, we focus on vector graphics -- images composed of 2D objects and shapes, prevalent in LMM-based tasks in web, design, and OS environments. We identify two key research questions: how can we enable precise visual perception, and how can we facilitate high-level reasoning based on such low-level perceptions? To capture fine visual details, we use Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) for accurate encoding of visual scenes. However, SVGs are not readily interpretable by LMMs in a zero-shot manner. To tackle this, we propose the Visually Descriptive Language Model (VDLM), which introduces a Primal Visual Description (PVD) as an intermediate textual representation. PVD translates SVGs into a text-based abstraction consisting of primitive attributes (e.g., shape, position, measurement) and their corresponding values. PVD can be learned using task-agnostic synthesized data and represents visual primitives that are universal across vector graphics. This abstraction is more structured, allowing for direct interpretation by foundation models for zero-shot generalization. Without human-annotated data, empirical results show that VDLM significantly improves state-of-the-art LMMs like GPT-4o on various multimodal perception and reasoning tasks. Extensive analyses of VDLM show improved interpretability due to its disentangled perception and reasoning. We also demonstrate a positive correlation between PVD quality and task performance.

      <title>Simultaneous Localization and Affordance Prediction of Tasks from Egocentric Video</title>

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown great success as foundational models for downstream vision and natural language applications in a variety of domains. However, these models are limited to reasoning over objects and actions currently visible on the image plane. We present a spatial extension to the VLM, which leverages spatially-localized egocentric video demonstrations to augment VLMs in two ways -- through understanding spatial task-affordances, i.e. where an agent must be for the task to physically take place, and the localization of that task relative to the egocentric viewer. We show our approach outperforms the baseline of using a VLM to map similarity of a task's description over a set of location-tagged images. Our approach has less error both on predicting where a task may take place and on predicting what tasks are likely to happen at the current location. The resulting representation will enable robots to use egocentric sensing to navigate to, or around, physical regions of interest for novel tasks specified in natural language.</description>

      <title>Towards Clinical Practice in CT-Based Pulmonary Disease Screening: An Efficient and Reliable Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01525v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep learning models for pulmonary disease screening from Computed Tomography (CT) scans promise to alleviate the immense workload on radiologists. Still, their high computational cost, stemming from processing entire 3D volumes, remains a major barrier to widespread clinical adoption. Current sub-sampling techniques often compromise diagnostic integrity by introducing artifacts or discarding critical information. To overcome these limitations, we propose an Efficient and Reliable Framework (ERF) that fundamentally improves the practicality of automated CT analysis. Our framework introduces two core innovations: (1) A Cluster-based Sub-Sampling (CSS) method that efficiently selects a compact yet comprehensive subset of CT slices by optimizing for both representativeness and diversity. By integrating an efficient k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) search with an iterative refinement process, CSS bypasses the computational bottlenecks of previous methods while preserving vital diagnostic features. (2) A lightweight Hybrid Uncertainty Quantification (HUQ) mechanism, which uniquely assesses both Aleatoric Uncertainty (AU) and Epistemic Uncertainty (EU) with minimal computational overhead. By maximizing the discrepancy between auxiliary classifiers, HUQ provides a robust reliability score, which is crucial for building trust in automated systems operating on partial data. Validated on two public datasets with 2,654 CT volumes across diagnostic tasks for 3 pulmonary diseases, our proposed ERF achieves diagnostic performance comparable to the full-volume analysis (over 90% accuracy and recall) while reducing processing time by more than 60%. This work represents a significant step towards deploying fast, accurate, and trustworthy AI-powered screening tools in time-sensitive clinical settings.</description>

      <title>Advanced deep architecture pruning using single filter performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12880v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pruning the parameters and structure of neural networks reduces the computational complexity, energy consumption, and latency during inference. Recently, a novel underlying mechanism for successful deep learning (DL) was presented based on a method that quantitatively measures the single filter performance in each layer of a DL architecture, and a new comprehensive mechanism of how deep learning works was presented. This statistical mechanics inspired viewpoint enables to reveal the macroscopic behavior of the entire network from the microscopic performance of each filter and their cooperative behavior. Herein, we demonstrate how this understanding paves the path to high quenched dilution of the convolutional layers of deep architectures without affecting their overall accuracy using applied filter cluster connections (AFCC). AFCC is exemplified on VGG-11 and EfficientNet-B0 architectures trained on CIFAR-100, and its high pruning outperforms other techniques using the same pruning magnitude. Additionally, this technique is broadened to single nodal performance and highly pruning of fully connected layers, suggesting a possible implementation to considerably reduce the complexity of over-parameterized AI tasks.</description>

      <title>M-MRE: Extending the Mutual Reinforcement Effect to Multimodal Information Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17353v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mutual Reinforcement Effect (MRE) is an emerging subfield at the intersection of information extraction and model interpretability. MRE aims to leverage the mutual understanding between tasks of different granularities, enhancing the performance of both coarse-grained and fine-grained tasks through joint modeling. While MRE has been explored and validated in the textual domain, its applicability to visual and multimodal domains remains unexplored. In this work, we extend MRE to the multimodal information extraction domain for the first time. Specifically, we introduce a new task: Multimodal Mutual Reinforcement Effect (M-MRE), and construct a corresponding dataset to support this task. To address the challenges posed by M-MRE, we further propose a Prompt Format Adapter (PFA) that is fully compatible with various Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). Experimental results demonstrate that MRE can also be observed in the M-MRE task, a multimodal text-image understanding scenario. This provides strong evidence that MRE facilitates mutual gains across three interrelated tasks, confirming its generalizability beyond the textual domain.</description>

      <title>DiffUMI: Training-Free Universal Model Inversion via Unconditional Diffusion for Face Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18015v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Face recognition technology presents serious privacy risks due to its reliance on sensitive and immutable biometric data. To address these concerns, such systems typically convert raw facial images into embeddings, which are traditionally viewed as privacy-preserving. However, model inversion attacks challenge this assumption by reconstructing private facial images from embeddings, highlighting a critical vulnerability in face recognition systems. Most existing inversion methods require training a separate generator for each target model, making them computationally intensive. In this work, we introduce DiffUMI, a diffusion-based universal model inversion attack that requires no additional training. DiffUMI is the first approach to successfully leverage unconditional face generation without relying on model-specific generators. It surpasses state-of-the-art attacks by 15.5% and 9.82% in success rate on standard and privacy-preserving face recognition systems, respectively. Furthermore, we propose a novel use of out-of-domain detection (OODD), demonstrating for the first time that model inversion can differentiate between facial and non-facial embeddings using only the embedding space.</description>

      <title>AgentThink: A Unified Framework for Tool-Augmented Chain-of-Thought Reasoning in Vision-Language Models for Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15298v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show promise for autonomous driving, yet their struggle with hallucinations, inefficient reasoning, and limited real-world validation hinders accurate perception and robust step-by-step reasoning. To overcome this, we introduce AgentThink, a pioneering unified framework that, for the first time, integrates Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning with dynamic, agent-style tool invocation for autonomous driving tasks. AgentThink's core innovations include: (i) Structured Data Generation, by establishing an autonomous driving tool library to automatically construct structured, self-verified reasoning data explicitly incorporating tool usage for diverse driving scenarios; (ii) A Two-stage Training Pipeline, employing Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to equip VLMs with the capability for autonomous tool invocation; and (iii) Agent-style Tool-Usage Evaluation, introducing a novel multi-tool assessment protocol to rigorously evaluate the model's tool invocation and utilization. Experiments on the DriveLMM-o1 benchmark demonstrate AgentThink significantly boosts overall reasoning scores by 53.91% and enhances answer accuracy by 33.54%, while markedly improving reasoning quality and consistency. Furthermore, ablation studies and robust zero-shot/few-shot generalization experiments across various benchmarks underscore its powerful capabilities. These findings highlight a promising trajectory for developing trustworthy and tool-aware autonomous driving models.</description>

      <title>Peer-Ranked Precision: Creating a Foundational Dataset for Fine-Tuning Vision Models from DataSeeds' Annotated Imagery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05673v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The development of modern Artificial Intelligence (AI) models, particularly diffusion-based models employed in computer vision and image generation tasks, is undergoing a paradigmatic shift in development methodologies. Traditionally dominated by a "Model Centric" approach, in which performance gains were primarily pursued through increasingly complex model architectures and hyperparameter optimization, the field is now recognizing a more nuanced "Data-Centric" approach. This emergent framework foregrounds the quality, structure, and relevance of training data as the principal driver of model performance. To operationalize this paradigm shift, we introduce the DataSeeds.AI sample dataset (the "DSD"), initially comprised of approximately 10,610 high-quality human peer-ranked photography images accompanied by extensive multi-tier annotations. The DSD is a foundational computer vision dataset designed to usher in a new standard for commercial image datasets. Representing a small fraction of DataSeeds.AI's 100 million-plus image catalog, the DSD provides a scalable foundation necessary for robust commercial and multimodal AI development. Through this in-depth exploratory analysis, we document the quantitative improvements generated by the DSD on specific models against known benchmarks and make the code and the trained models used in our evaluation publicly available.</description>

      <title>Reinforcing Multimodal Understanding and Generation with Dual Self-rewards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07963v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Building upon large language models (LLMs), recent large multimodal models (LMMs) unify cross-model understanding and generation into a single framework. However, LMMs still struggle to achieve accurate image-text alignment, prone to generating text responses contradicting the visual input or failing to follow the text-to-image prompts. Current solutions require external supervision (e.g., human feedback or reward models) and only address unidirectional tasks-either understanding or generation. In this work, based on the observation that understanding and generation are inverse dual tasks, we introduce a self-supervised dual reward mechanism to reinforce the understanding and generation capabilities of LMMs. Specifically, we sample multiple outputs for a given input in one task domain, then reverse the input-output pairs to compute the dual likelihood of the model as self-rewards for optimization. Extensive experimental results on visual understanding and generation benchmarks demonstrate that our method can effectively enhance the performance of the model without any external supervision, especially achieving remarkable improvements in text-to-image tasks.</description>
