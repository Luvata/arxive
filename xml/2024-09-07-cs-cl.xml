      <title>CLUE: Concept-Level Uncertainty Estimation for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in various natural language generation (NLG) tasks. Previous studies suggest that LLMs' generation process involves uncertainty. However, existing approaches to uncertainty estimation mainly focus on sequence-level uncertainty, overlooking individual pieces of information within sequences. These methods fall short in separately assessing the uncertainty of each component in a sequence. In response, we propose a novel framework for Concept-Level Uncertainty Estimation (CLUE) for LLMs. We leverage LLMs to convert output sequences into concept-level representations, breaking down sequences into individual concepts and measuring the uncertainty of each concept separately. We conduct experiments to demonstrate that CLUE can provide more interpretable uncertainty estimation results compared with sentence-level uncertainty, and could be a useful tool for various tasks such as hallucination detection and story generation.</description>

      <title>Oddballness: universal anomaly detection with language models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new method to detect anomalies in texts (in general: in sequences of any data), using language models, in a totally unsupervised manner. The method considers probabilities (likelihoods) generated by a language model, but instead of focusing on low-likelihood tokens, it considers a new metric introduced in this paper: oddballness. Oddballness measures how ``strange'' a given token is according to the language model. We demonstrate in grammatical error detection tasks (a specific case of text anomaly detection) that oddballness is better than just considering low-likelihood events, if a totally unsupervised setup is assumed.</description>

      <title>Quantification of stylistic differences in human- and ASR-produced transcripts of African American English</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Common measures of accuracy used to assess the performance of automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems, as well as human transcribers, conflate multiple sources of error. Stylistic differences, such as verbatim vs non-verbatim, can play a significant role in ASR performance evaluation when differences exist between training and test datasets. The problem is compounded for speech from underrepresented varieties, where the speech to orthography mapping is not as standardized. We categorize the kinds of stylistic differences between 6 transcription versions, 4 human- and 2 ASR-produced, of 10 hours of African American English (AAE) speech. Focusing on verbatim features and AAE morphosyntactic features, we investigate the interactions of these categories with how well transcripts can be compared via word error rate (WER). The results, and overall analysis, help clarify how ASR outputs are a function of the decisions made by the training data's human transcribers.</description>

      <title>Probing self-attention in self-supervised speech models for cross-linguistic differences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speech models have gained traction thanks to increase in accuracy from novel transformer architectures. While this impressive increase in performance across automatic speech recognition (ASR) benchmarks is noteworthy, there is still much that is unknown about the use of attention mechanisms for speech-related tasks. For example, while it is assumed that these models are learning language-independent (i.e., universal) speech representations, there has not yet been an in-depth exploration of what it would mean for the models to be language-independent. In the current paper, we explore this question within the realm of self-attention mechanisms of one small self-supervised speech transformer model (TERA). We find that even with a small model, the attention heads learned are diverse ranging from almost entirely diagonal to almost entirely global regardless of the training language. We highlight some notable differences in attention patterns between Turkish and English and demonstrate that the models do learn important phonological information during pretraining. We also present a head ablation study which shows that models across languages primarily rely on diagonal heads to classify phonemes.</description>

      <title>Debate on Graph: a Flexible and Reliable Reasoning Framework for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) may suffer from hallucinations in real-world applications due to the lack of relevant knowledge. In contrast, knowledge graphs encompass extensive, multi-relational structures that store a vast array of symbolic facts. Consequently, integrating LLMs with knowledge graphs has been extensively explored, with Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) serving as a critical touchstone for the integration. This task requires LLMs to answer natural language questions by retrieving relevant triples from knowledge graphs. However, existing methods face two significant challenges: \textit{excessively long reasoning paths distracting from the answer generation}, and \textit{false-positive relations hindering the path refinement}. In this paper, we propose an iterative interactive KGQA framework that leverages the interactive learning capabilities of LLMs to perform reasoning and Debating over Graphs (DoG). Specifically, DoG employs a subgraph-focusing mechanism, allowing LLMs to perform answer trying after each reasoning step, thereby mitigating the impact of lengthy reasoning paths. On the other hand, DoG utilizes a multi-role debate team to gradually simplify complex questions, reducing the influence of false-positive relations. This debate mechanism ensures the reliability of the reasoning process. Experimental results on five public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our architecture. Notably, DoG outperforms the state-of-the-art method ToG by 23.7\% and 9.1\% in accuracy on WebQuestions and GrailQA, respectively. Furthermore, the integration experiments with various LLMs on the mentioned datasets highlight the flexibility of DoG. Code is available at \url{https://github.com/reml-group/DoG}.</description>

      <title>MaterialBENCH: Evaluating College-Level Materials Science Problem-Solving Abilities of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A college-level benchmark dataset for large language models (LLMs) in the materials science field, MaterialBENCH, is constructed. This dataset consists of problem-answer pairs, based on university textbooks. There are two types of problems: one is the free-response answer type, and the other is the multiple-choice type. Multiple-choice problems are constructed by adding three incorrect answers as choices to a correct answer, so that LLMs can choose one of the four as a response. Most of the problems for free-response answer and multiple-choice types overlap except for the format of the answers. We also conduct experiments using the MaterialBENCH on LLMs, including ChatGPT-3.5, ChatGPT-4, Bard (at the time of the experiments), and GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 with the OpenAI API. The differences and similarities in the performance of LLMs measured by the MaterialBENCH are analyzed and discussed. Performance differences between the free-response type and multiple-choice type in the same models and the influence of using system massages on multiple-choice problems are also studied. We anticipate that MaterialBENCH will encourage further developments of LLMs in reasoning abilities to solve more complicated problems and eventually contribute to materials research and discovery.</description>

      <title>MARAGS: A Multi-Adapter System for Multi-Task Retrieval Augmented Generation Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we present a multi-adapter retrieval augmented generation system (MARAGS) for Meta's Comprehensive RAG (CRAG) competition for KDD CUP 2024. CRAG is a question answering dataset contains 3 different subtasks aimed at realistic question and answering RAG related tasks, with a diverse set of question topics, question types, time dynamic answers, and questions featuring entities of varying popularity.
  Our system follows a standard setup for web based RAG, which uses processed web pages to provide context for an LLM to produce generations, while also querying API endpoints for additional information. MARAGS also utilizes multiple different adapters to solve the various requirements for these tasks with a standard cross-encoder model for ranking candidate passages relevant for answering the question. Our system achieved 2nd place for Task 1 as well as 3rd place on Task 2.</description>

      <title>Bypassing DARCY Defense: Indistinguishable Universal Adversarial Triggers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural networks (NN) classification models for Natural Language Processing (NLP) are vulnerable to the Universal Adversarial Triggers (UAT) attack that triggers a model to produce a specific prediction for any input. DARCY borrows the "honeypot" concept to bait multiple trapdoors, effectively detecting the adversarial examples generated by UAT. Unfortunately, we find a new UAT generation method, called IndisUAT, which produces triggers (i.e., tokens) and uses them to craft adversarial examples whose feature distribution is indistinguishable from that of the benign examples in a randomly-chosen category at the detection layer of DARCY. The produced adversarial examples incur the maximal loss of predicting results in the DARCY-protected models. Meanwhile, the produced triggers are effective in black-box models for text generation, text inference, and reading comprehension. Finally, the evaluation results under NN models for NLP tasks indicate that the IndisUAT method can effectively circumvent DARCY and penetrate other defenses. For example, IndisUAT can reduce the true positive rate of DARCY's detection by at least 40.8% and 90.6%, and drop the accuracy by at least 33.3% and 51.6% in the RNN and CNN models, respectively. IndisUAT reduces the accuracy of the BERT's adversarial defense model by at least 34.0%, and makes the GPT-2 language model spew racist outputs even when conditioned on non-racial context.</description>

      <title>An Effective Deployment of Diffusion LM for Data Augmentation in Low-Resource Sentiment Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sentiment classification (SC) often suffers from low-resource challenges such as domain-specific contexts, imbalanced label distributions, and few-shot scenarios. The potential of the diffusion language model (LM) for textual data augmentation (DA) remains unexplored, moreover, textual DA methods struggle to balance the diversity and consistency of new samples. Most DA methods either perform logical modifications or rephrase less important tokens in the original sequence with the language model. In the context of SC, strong emotional tokens could act critically on the sentiment of the whole sequence. Therefore, contrary to rephrasing less important context, we propose DiffusionCLS to leverage a diffusion LM to capture in-domain knowledge and generate pseudo samples by reconstructing strong label-related tokens. This approach ensures a balance between consistency and diversity, avoiding the introduction of noise and augmenting crucial features of datasets. DiffusionCLS also comprises a Noise-Resistant Training objective to help the model generalize. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in various low-resource scenarios including domain-specific and domain-general problems. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of our framework's modules, and visualization studies highlight optimal deployment conditions, reinforcing our conclusions.</description>

      <title>xLAM: A Family of Large Action Models to Empower AI Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs) have attracted significant research interest. However, the open-source community faces many challenges in developing specialized models for agent tasks, driven by the scarcity of high-quality agent datasets and the absence of standard protocols in this area. We introduce and publicly release xLAM, a series of large action models designed for AI agent tasks. The xLAM series includes five models with both dense and mixture-of-expert architectures, ranging from 1B to 8x22B parameters, trained using a scalable, flexible pipeline that unifies, augments, and synthesizes diverse datasets to enhance AI agents' generalizability and performance across varied environments. Our experimental results demonstrate that xLAM consistently delivers exceptional performance across multiple agent ability benchmarks, notably securing the 1st position on the Berkeley Function-Calling Leaderboard, outperforming GPT-4, Claude-3, and many other models in terms of tool use. By releasing the xLAM series, we aim to advance the performance of open-source LLMs for autonomous AI agents, potentially accelerating progress and democratizing access to high-performance models for agent tasks.

      <title>Enhancing Healthcare LLM Trust with Atypical Presentations Recalibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Black-box large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in various environments, making it essential for these models to effectively convey their confidence and uncertainty, especially in high-stakes settings. However, these models often exhibit overconfidence, leading to potential risks and misjudgments. Existing techniques for eliciting and calibrating LLM confidence have primarily focused on general reasoning datasets, yielding only modest improvements. Accurate calibration is crucial for informed decision-making and preventing adverse outcomes but remains challenging due to the complexity and variability of tasks these models perform. In this work, we investigate the miscalibration behavior of black-box LLMs within the healthcare setting. We propose a novel method, \textit{Atypical Presentations Recalibration}, which leverages atypical presentations to adjust the model's confidence estimates. Our approach significantly improves calibration, reducing calibration errors by approximately 60\% on three medical question answering datasets and outperforming existing methods such as vanilla verbalized confidence, CoT verbalized confidence and others. Additionally, we provide an in-depth analysis of the role of atypicality within the recalibration framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Named Entity Recognition (NER) encounters the challenge of unbalanced labels, where certain entity types are overrepresented while others are underrepresented in real-world datasets. This imbalance can lead to biased models that perform poorly on minority entity classes, impeding accurate and equitable entity recognition. This paper explores the effects of unbalanced entity labels of the BERT-based pre-trained model. We analyze the different mechanisms of loss calculation and loss propagation for the task of token classification on randomized datasets. Then we propose ways to improve the token classification for the highly imbalanced task of clinical entity recognition.</description>

      <title>E2CL: Exploration-based Error Correction Learning for Embodied Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Language models are exhibiting increasing capability in knowledge utilization and reasoning. However, when applied as agents in embodied environments, they often suffer from misalignment between their intrinsic knowledge and environmental knowledge, leading to infeasible actions. Traditional environment alignment methods, such as supervised learning on expert trajectories and reinforcement learning, face limitations in covering environmental knowledge and achieving efficient convergence, respectively. Inspired by human learning, we propose Exploration-based Error Correction Learning (E2CL), a novel framework that leverages exploration-induced errors and environmental feedback to enhance environment alignment for LM-based agents. E2CL incorporates teacher-guided and teacher-free exploration to gather environmental feedback and correct erroneous actions. The agent learns to provide feedback and self-correct, thereby enhancing its adaptability to target environments. Evaluations in the Virtualhome environment demonstrate that E2CL-trained agents outperform those trained by baseline methods and exhibit superior self-correction capabilities.</description>

      <title>Understanding LLM Development Through Longitudinal Study: Insights from the Open Ko-LLM Leaderboard</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper conducts a longitudinal study over eleven months to address the limitations of prior research on the Open Ko-LLM Leaderboard, which have relied on empirical studies with restricted observation periods of only five months. By extending the analysis duration, we aim to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the progression in developing Korean large language models (LLMs). Our study is guided by three primary research questions: (1) What are the specific challenges in improving LLM performance across diverse tasks on the Open Ko-LLM Leaderboard over time? (2) How does model size impact task performance correlations across various benchmarks? (3) How have the patterns in leaderboard rankings shifted over time on the Open Ko-LLM Leaderboard?. By analyzing 1,769 models over this period, our research offers a comprehensive examination of the ongoing advancements in LLMs and the evolving nature of evaluation frameworks.</description>

      <title>GraphInsight: Unlocking Insights in Large Language Models for Graph Structure Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential in processing graphs, they struggle with comprehending graphical structure information through prompts of graph description sequences, especially as the graph size increases. We attribute this challenge to the uneven memory performance of LLMs across different positions in graph description sequences, known as ''positional biases''. To address this, we propose GraphInsight, a novel framework aimed at improving LLMs' comprehension of both macro- and micro-level graphical information. GraphInsight is grounded in two key strategies: 1) placing critical graphical information in positions where LLMs exhibit stronger memory performance, and 2) investigating a lightweight external knowledge base for regions with weaker memory performance, inspired by retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Moreover, GraphInsight explores integrating these two strategies into LLM agent processes for composite graph tasks that require multi-step reasoning. Extensive empirical studies on benchmarks with a wide range of evaluation tasks show that GraphInsight significantly outperforms all other graph description methods (e.g., prompting techniques and reordering strategies) in understanding graph structures of varying sizes.</description>

      <title>LLM Detectors Still Fall Short of Real World: Case of LLM-Generated Short News-Like Posts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the emergence of widely available powerful LLMs, disinformation generated by large Language Models (LLMs) has become a major concern. Historically, LLM detectors have been touted as a solution, but their effectiveness in the real world is still to be proven. In this paper, we focus on an important setting in information operations -- short news-like posts generated by moderately sophisticated attackers.
  We demonstrate that existing LLM detectors, whether zero-shot or purpose-trained, are not ready for real-world use in that setting. All tested zero-shot detectors perform inconsistently with prior benchmarks and are highly vulnerable to sampling temperature increase, a trivial attack absent from recent benchmarks. A purpose-trained detector generalizing across LLMs and unseen attacks can be developed, but it fails to generalize to new human-written texts.
  We argue that the former indicates domain-specific benchmarking is needed, while the latter suggests a trade-off between the adversarial evasion resilience and overfitting to the reference human text, with both needing evaluation in benchmarks and currently absent. We believe this suggests a re-consideration of current LLM detector benchmarking approaches and provides a dynamically extensible benchmark to allow it (https://github.com/Reliable-Information-Lab-HEVS/dynamic_llm_detector_benchmark).</description>

      <title>N-gram Prediction and Word Difference Representations for Language Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Causal language modeling (CLM) serves as the foundational framework underpinning remarkable successes of recent large language models (LLMs). Despite its success, the training approach for next word prediction poses a potential risk of causing the model to overly focus on local dependencies within a sentence. While prior studies have been introduced to predict future N words simultaneously, they were primarily applied to tasks such as masked language modeling (MLM) and neural machine translation (NMT). In this study, we introduce a simple N-gram prediction framework for the CLM task. Moreover, we introduce word difference representation (WDR) as a surrogate and contextualized target representation during model training on the basis of N-gram prediction framework. To further enhance the quality of next word prediction, we propose an ensemble method that incorporates the future N words' prediction results. Empirical evaluations across multiple benchmark datasets encompassing CLM and NMT tasks demonstrate the significant advantages of our proposed methods over the conventional CLM.</description>

      <title>Normal forms in Virus Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present work, we further study the computational power of virus machines (VMs in short). VMs provide a computing paradigm inspired by the transmission and replication networks of viruses. VMs consist of process units (called hosts) structured by a directed graph whose arcs are called channels and an instruction graph that controls the transmissions of virus objects among hosts. The present work complements our understanding of the computing power of VMs by introducing normal forms; these expressions restrict the features in a given computing model. Some of the features that we restrict in our normal forms include (a) the number of hosts, (b) the number of instructions, and (c) the number of virus objects in each host. After we recall some known results on the computing power of VMs we give our normal forms, such as the size of the loops in the network, proving new characterisations of family of sets, such as the finite sets, semilinear sets, or NRE.</description>

      <title>Sketch: A Toolkit for Streamlining LLM Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) represented by GPT family have achieved remarkable success. The characteristics of LLMs lie in their ability to accommodate a wide range of tasks through a generative approach. However, the flexibility of their output format poses challenges in controlling and harnessing the model's outputs, thereby constraining the application of LLMs in various domains. In this work, we present Sketch, an innovative toolkit designed to streamline LLM operations across diverse fields. Sketch comprises the following components: (1) a suite of task description schemas and prompt templates encompassing various NLP tasks; (2) a user-friendly, interactive process for building structured output LLM services tailored to various NLP tasks; (3) an open-source dataset for output format control, along with tools for dataset construction; and (4) an open-source model based on LLaMA3-8B-Instruct that adeptly comprehends and adheres to output formatting instructions. We anticipate this initiative to bring considerable convenience to LLM users, achieving the goal of ''plug-and-play'' for various applications. The components of Sketch will be progressively open-sourced at https://github.com/cofe-ai/Sketch.</description>

      <title>Con-ReCall: Detecting Pre-training Data in LLMs via Contrastive Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The training data in large language models is key to their success, but it also presents privacy and security risks, as it may contain sensitive information. Detecting pre-training data is crucial for mitigating these concerns. Existing methods typically analyze target text in isolation or solely with non-member contexts, overlooking potential insights from simultaneously considering both member and non-member contexts. While previous work suggested that member contexts provide little information due to the minor distributional shift they induce, our analysis reveals that these subtle shifts can be effectively leveraged when contrasted with non-member contexts. In this paper, we propose Con-ReCall, a novel approach that leverages the asymmetric distributional shifts induced by member and non-member contexts through contrastive decoding, amplifying subtle differences to enhance membership inference. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that Con-ReCall achieves state-of-the-art performance on the WikiMIA benchmark and is robust against various text manipulation techniques.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Large Language Models through Natural Language Processing to provide interpretable Machine Learning predictions of mental deterioration in real time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on official estimates, 50 million people worldwide are affected by dementia, and this number increases by 10 million new patients every year. Without a cure, clinical prognostication and early intervention represent the most effective ways to delay its progression. To this end, Artificial Intelligence and computational linguistics can be exploited for natural language analysis, personalized assessment, monitoring, and treatment. However, traditional approaches need more semantic knowledge management and explicability capabilities. Moreover, using Large Language Models (LLMs) for cognitive decline diagnosis is still scarce, even though these models represent the most advanced way for clinical-patient communication using intelligent systems. Consequently, we leverage an LLM using the latest Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques in a chatbot solution to provide interpretable Machine Learning prediction of cognitive decline in real-time. Linguistic-conceptual features are exploited for appropriate natural language analysis. Through explainability, we aim to fight potential biases of the models and improve their potential to help clinical workers in their diagnosis decisions. More in detail, the proposed pipeline is composed of (i) data extraction employing NLP-based prompt engineering; (ii) stream-based data processing including feature engineering, analysis, and selection; (iii) real-time classification; and (iv) the explainability dashboard to provide visual and natural language descriptions of the prediction outcome. Classification results exceed 80 % in all evaluation metrics, with a recall value for the mental deterioration class about 85 %. To sum up, we contribute with an affordable, flexible, non-invasive, personalized diagnostic system to this work.</description>

      <title>CogniDual Framework: Self-Training Large Language Models within a Dual-System Theoretical Framework for Improving Cognitive Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cognitive psychology investigates perception, attention, memory, language, problem-solving, decision-making, and reasoning. Kahneman's dual-system theory elucidates the human decision-making process, distinguishing between the rapid, intuitive System 1 and the deliberative, rational System 2. Recent advancements have positioned large language Models (LLMs) as formidable tools nearing human-level proficiency in various cognitive tasks. Nonetheless, the presence of a dual-system framework analogous to human cognition in LLMs remains unexplored. This study introduces the \textbf{CogniDual Framework for LLMs} (CFLLMs), designed to assess whether LLMs can, through self-training, evolve from deliberate deduction to intuitive responses, thereby emulating the human process of acquiring and mastering new information. Our findings reveal the cognitive mechanisms behind LLMs' response generation, enhancing our understanding of their capabilities in cognitive psychology. Practically, self-trained models can provide faster responses to certain queries, reducing computational demands during inference.</description>

      <title>Rx Strategist: Prescription Verification using LLM Agents System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To protect patient safety, modern pharmaceutical complexity demands strict prescription verification. We offer a new approach - Rx Strategist - that makes use of knowledge graphs and different search strategies to enhance the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) inside an agentic framework. This multifaceted technique allows for a multi-stage LLM pipeline and reliable information retrieval from a custom-built active ingredient database. Different facets of prescription verification, such as indication, dose, and possible drug interactions, are covered in each stage of the pipeline. We alleviate the drawbacks of monolithic LLM techniques by spreading reasoning over these stages, improving correctness and reliability while reducing memory demands. Our findings demonstrate that Rx Strategist surpasses many current LLMs, achieving performance comparable to that of a highly experienced clinical pharmacist. In the complicated world of modern medications, this combination of LLMs with organized knowledge and sophisticated search methods presents a viable avenue for reducing prescription errors and enhancing patient outcomes.</description>

      <title>Fine-tuning large language models for domain adaptation: Exploration of training strategies, scaling, model merging and synergistic capabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) for domain applications in fields such as materials science and engineering depends on the development of fine-tuning strategies that adapt models for specialized, technical capabilities. In this work, we explore the effects of Continued Pretraining (CPT), Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), and various preference-based optimization approaches, including Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and Odds Ratio Preference Optimization (ORPO), on fine-tuned LLM performance. Our analysis shows how these strategies influence model outcomes and reveals that the merging of multiple fine-tuned models can lead to the emergence of capabilities that surpass the individual contributions of the parent models. We find that model merging leads to new functionalities that neither parent model could achieve alone, leading to improved performance in domain-specific assessments. Experiments with different model architectures are presented, including Llama 3.1 8B and Mistral 7B models, where similar behaviors are observed. Exploring whether the results hold also for much smaller models, we use a tiny LLM with 1.7 billion parameters and show that very small LLMs do not necessarily feature emergent capabilities under model merging, suggesting that model scaling may be a key component. In open-ended yet consistent chat conversations between a human and AI models, our assessment reveals detailed insights into how different model variants perform and show that the smallest model achieves a high intelligence score across key criteria including reasoning depth, creativity, clarity, and quantitative precision. Other experiments include the development of image generation prompts based on disparate biological material design concepts, to create new microstructures, architectural concepts, and urban design based on biological materials-inspired construction principles.</description>

      <title>How Much Data is Enough Data? Fine-Tuning Large Language Models for In-House Translation: Performance Evaluation Across Multiple Dataset Sizes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decoder-only LLMs have shown impressive performance in MT due to their ability to learn from extensive datasets and generate high-quality translations. However, LLMs often struggle with the nuances and style required for organisation-specific translation. In this study, we explore the effectiveness of fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly Llama 3 8B Instruct, leveraging translation memories (TMs), as a valuable resource to enhance accuracy and efficiency. We investigate the impact of fine-tuning the Llama 3 model using TMs from a specific organisation in the software sector. Our experiments cover five translation directions across languages of varying resource levels (English to Brazilian Portuguese, Czech, German, Finnish, and Korean). We analyse diverse sizes of training datasets (1k to 207k segments) to evaluate their influence on translation quality. We fine-tune separate models for each training set and evaluate their performance based on automatic metrics, BLEU, chrF++, TER, and COMET. Our findings reveal improvement in translation performance with larger datasets across all metrics. On average, BLEU and COMET scores increase by 13 and 25 points, respectively, on the largest training set against the baseline model. Notably, there is a performance deterioration in comparison with the baseline model when fine-tuning on only 1k and 2k examples; however, we observe a substantial improvement as the training dataset size increases. The study highlights the potential of integrating TMs with LLMs to create bespoke translation models tailored to the specific needs of businesses, thus enhancing translation quality and reducing turn-around times. This approach offers a valuable insight for organisations seeking to leverage TMs and LLMs for optimal translation outcomes, especially in narrower domains.</description>

      <title>100 instances is all you need: predicting the success of a new LLM on unseen data by testing on a few instances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting the performance of LLMs on individual task instances is essential to ensure their reliability in high-stakes applications. To do so, a possibility is to evaluate the considered LLM on a set of task instances and train an assessor to predict its performance based on features of the instances. However, this approach requires evaluating each new LLM on a sufficiently large set of task instances to train an assessor specific to it. In this work, we leverage the evaluation results of previously tested LLMs to reduce the number of evaluations required to predict the performance of a new LLM. In practice, we propose to test the new LLM on a small set of reference instances and train a generic assessor which predicts the performance of the LLM on an instance based on the performance of the former on the reference set and features of the instance of interest. We conduct empirical studies on HELM-Lite and KindsOfReasoning, a collection of existing reasoning datasets that we introduce, where we evaluate all instruction-fine-tuned OpenAI models until the January 2024 version of GPT4. When predicting performance on instances with the same distribution as those used to train the generic assessor, we find this achieves performance comparable to the LLM-specific assessors trained on the full set of instances. Additionally, we find that randomly selecting the reference instances performs as well as some advanced selection methods we tested. For out of distribution, however, no clear winner emerges and the overall performance is worse, suggesting that the inherent predictability of LLMs is low.</description>

      <title>Attend First, Consolidate Later: On the Importance of Attention in Different LLM Layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In decoder-based LLMs, the representation of a given layer serves two purposes: as input to the next layer during the computation of the current token; and as input to the attention mechanism of future tokens. In this work, we show that the importance of the latter role might be overestimated. To show that, we start by manipulating the representations of previous tokens; e.g. by replacing the hidden states at some layer k with random vectors. Our experimenting with four LLMs and four tasks show that this operation often leads to small to negligible drop in performance. Importantly, this happens if the manipulation occurs in the top part of the model-k is in the final 30-50% of the layers. In contrast, doing the same manipulation in earlier layers might lead to chance level performance. We continue by switching the hidden state of certain tokens with hidden states of other tokens from another prompt; e.g., replacing the word "Italy" with "France" in "What is the capital of Italy?". We find that when applying this switch in the top 1/3 of the model, the model ignores it (answering "Rome"). However if we apply it before, the model conforms to the switch ("Paris"). Our results hint at a two stage process in transformer-based LLMs: the first part gathers input from previous tokens, while the second mainly processes that information internally.</description>

      <title>LLM-based multi-agent poetry generation in non-cooperative environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite substantial progress of large language models (LLMs) for automatic poetry generation, the generated poetry lacks diversity while the training process differs greatly from human learning. Under the rationale that the learning process of the poetry generation systems should be more human-like and their output more diverse and novel, we introduce a framework based on social learning where we emphasize non-cooperative interactions besides cooperative interactions to encourage diversity. Our experiments are the first attempt at LLM-based multi-agent systems in non-cooperative environments for poetry generation employing both TRAINING-BASED agents (GPT-2) and PROMPTING-BASED agents (GPT-3 and GPT-4). Our evaluation based on 96k generated poems shows that our framework benefits the poetry generation process for TRAINING-BASED agents resulting in 1) a 3.0-3.7 percentage point (pp) increase in diversity and a 5.6-11.3 pp increase in novelty according to distinct and novel n-grams. The generated poetry from TRAINING-BASED agents also exhibits group divergence in terms of lexicons, styles and semantics. PROMPTING-BASED agents in our framework also benefit from non-cooperative environments and a more diverse ensemble of models with non-homogeneous agents has the potential to further enhance diversity, with an increase of 7.0-17.5 pp according to our experiments. However, PROMPTING-BASED agents show a decrease in lexical diversity over time and do not exhibit the group-based divergence intended in the social network. Our paper argues for a paradigm shift in creative tasks such as automatic poetry generation to include social learning processes (via LLM-based agent modeling) similar to human interaction.</description>

      <title>The representation landscape of few-shot learning and fine-tuning in large language models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) are two common strategies for improving the performance of modern large language models (LLMs) on specific tasks. Despite their different natures, these strategies often lead to comparable performance gains. However, little is known about whether they induce similar representations inside LLMs. We approach this problem by analyzing the probability landscape of their hidden representations in the two cases. More specifically, we compare how LLMs solve the same question-answering task, finding that ICL and SFT create very different internal structures, in both cases undergoing a sharp transition in the middle of the network. In the first half of the network, ICL shapes interpretable representations hierarchically organized according to their semantic content. In contrast, the probability landscape obtained with SFT is fuzzier and semantically mixed. In the second half of the model, the fine-tuned representations develop probability modes that better encode the identity of answers, while the landscape of ICL representations is characterized by less defined peaks. Our approach reveals the diverse computational strategies developed inside LLMs to solve the same task across different conditions, allowing us to make a step towards designing optimal methods to extract information from language models.</description>

      <title>LAST: Language Model Aware Speech Tokenization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speech tokenization serves as the foundation of speech language model (LM), enabling them to perform various tasks such as spoken language modeling, text-to-speech, speech-to-text, etc. Most speech tokenizers are trained independently of the LM training process, relying on separate acoustic models and quantization methods. Following such an approach may create a mismatch between the tokenization process and its usage afterward. In this study, we propose a novel approach to training a speech tokenizer by leveraging objectives from pre-trained textual LMs. We advocate for the integration of this objective into the process of learning discrete speech representations. Our aim is to transform features from a pre-trained speech model into a new feature space that enables better clustering for speech LMs. We empirically investigate the impact of various model design choices, including speech vocabulary size and text LM size. Our results demonstrate the proposed tokenization method outperforms the evaluated baselines considering both spoken language modeling and speech-to-text. More importantly, unlike prior work, the proposed method allows the utilization of a single pre-trained LM for processing both speech and text inputs, setting it apart from conventional tokenization approaches.</description>

      <title>RAG based Question-Answering for Contextual Response Prediction System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown versatility in various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, including their potential as effective question-answering systems. However, to provide precise and relevant information in response to specific customer queries in industry settings, LLMs require access to a comprehensive knowledge base to avoid hallucinations. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) emerges as a promising technique to address this challenge. Yet, developing an accurate question-answering framework for real-world applications using RAG entails several challenges: 1) data availability issues, 2) evaluating the quality of generated content, and 3) the costly nature of human evaluation. In this paper, we introduce an end-to-end framework that employs LLMs with RAG capabilities for industry use cases. Given a customer query, the proposed system retrieves relevant knowledge documents and leverages them, along with previous chat history, to generate response suggestions for customer service agents in the contact centers of a major retail company. Through comprehensive automated and human evaluations, we show that this solution outperforms the current BERT-based algorithms in accuracy and relevance. Our findings suggest that RAG-based LLMs can be an excellent support to human customer service representatives by lightening their workload.</description>

      <title>Attention Heads of Large Language Models: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the advent of ChatGPT, Large Language Models (LLMs) have excelled in various tasks but remain largely as black-box systems. Consequently, their development relies heavily on data-driven approaches, limiting performance enhancement through changes in internal architecture and reasoning pathways. As a result, many researchers have begun exploring the potential internal mechanisms of LLMs, aiming to identify the essence of their reasoning bottlenecks, with most studies focusing on attention heads. Our survey aims to shed light on the internal reasoning processes of LLMs by concentrating on the interpretability and underlying mechanisms of attention heads. We first distill the human thought process into a four-stage framework: Knowledge Recalling, In-Context Identification, Latent Reasoning, and Expression Preparation. Using this framework, we systematically review existing research to identify and categorize the functions of specific attention heads. Furthermore, we summarize the experimental methodologies used to discover these special heads, dividing them into two categories: Modeling-Free methods and Modeling-Required methods. Also, we outline relevant evaluation methods and benchmarks. Finally, we discuss the limitations of current research and propose several potential future directions. Our reference list is open-sourced at \url{https://github.com/IAAR-Shanghai/Awesome-Attention-Heads}.</description>

      <title>WildVis: Open Source Visualizer for Million-Scale Chat Logs in the Wild</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing availability of real-world conversation data offers exciting opportunities for researchers to study user-chatbot interactions. However, the sheer volume of this data makes manually examining individual conversations impractical. To overcome this challenge, we introduce WildVis, an interactive tool that enables fast, versatile, and large-scale conversation analysis. WildVis provides search and visualization capabilities in the text and embedding spaces based on a list of criteria. To manage million-scale datasets, we implemented optimizations including search index construction, embedding precomputation and compression, and caching to ensure responsive user interactions within seconds. We demonstrate WildVis's utility through three case studies: facilitating chatbot misuse research, visualizing and comparing topic distributions across datasets, and characterizing user-specific conversation patterns. WildVis is open-source and designed to be extendable, supporting additional datasets and customized search and visualization functionalities.</description>

      <title>Well, that escalated quickly: The Single-Turn Crescendo Attack (STCA)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores a novel approach to adversarial attacks on large language models (LLM): the Single-Turn Crescendo Attack (STCA). The STCA builds upon the multi-turn crescendo attack established by Mark Russinovich, Ahmed Salem, Ronen Eldan. Traditional multi-turn adversarial strategies gradually escalate the context to elicit harmful or controversial responses from LLMs. However, this paper introduces a more efficient method where the escalation is condensed into a single interaction. By carefully crafting the prompt to simulate an extended dialogue, the attack bypasses typical content moderation systems, leading to the generation of responses that would normally be filtered out. I demonstrate this technique through a few case studies. The results highlight vulnerabilities in current LLMs and underscore the need for more robust safeguards. This work contributes to the broader discourse on responsible AI (RAI) safety and adversarial testing, providing insights and practical examples for researchers and developers. This method is unexplored in the literature, making it a novel contribution to the field.</description>

      <title>GraphEx: A Graph-based Extraction Method for Advertiser Keyphrase Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Online sellers and advertisers are recommended keyphrases for their listed products, which they bid on to enhance their sales. One popular paradigm that generates such recommendations is Extreme Multi-Label Classification (XMC), which involves tagging/mapping keyphrases to items. We outline the limitations of using traditional item-query based tagging or mapping techniques for keyphrase recommendations on E-Commerce platforms. We introduce GraphEx, an innovative graph-based approach that recommends keyphrases to sellers using extraction of token permutations from item titles. Additionally, we demonstrate that relying on traditional metrics such as precision/recall can be misleading in practical applications, thereby necessitating a combination of metrics to evaluate performance in real-world scenarios. These metrics are designed to assess the relevance of keyphrases to items and the potential for buyer outreach. GraphEx outperforms production models at eBay, achieving the objectives mentioned above. It supports near real-time inferencing in resource-constrained production environments and scales effectively for billions of items.</description>

      <title>Continual Skill and Task Learning via Dialogue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Continual and interactive robot learning is a challenging problem as the robot is present with human users who expect the robot to learn novel skills to solve novel tasks perpetually with sample efficiency. In this work we present a framework for robots to query and learn visuo-motor robot skills and task relevant information via natural language dialog interactions with human users. Previous approaches either focus on improving the performance of instruction following agents, or passively learn novel skills or concepts. Instead, we used dialog combined with a language-skill grounding embedding to query or confirm skills and/or tasks requested by a user. To achieve this goal, we developed and integrated three different components for our agent. Firstly, we propose a novel visual-motor control policy ACT with Low Rank Adaptation (ACT-LoRA), which enables the existing SoTA ACT model to perform few-shot continual learning. Secondly, we develop an alignment model that projects demonstrations across skill embodiments into a shared embedding allowing us to know when to ask questions and/or demonstrations from users. Finally, we integrated an existing LLM to interact with a human user to perform grounded interactive continual skill learning to solve a task. Our ACT-LoRA model learns novel fine-tuned skills with a 100% accuracy when trained with only five demonstrations for a novel skill while still maintaining a 74.75% accuracy on pre-trained skills in the RLBench dataset where other models fall significantly short. We also performed a human-subjects study with 8 subjects to demonstrate the continual learning capabilities of our combined framework. We achieve a success rate of 75% in the task of sandwich making with the real robot learning from participant data demonstrating that robots can learn novel skills or task knowledge from dialogue with non-expert users using our approach.</description>

      <title>Strategic Chain-of-Thought: Guiding Accurate Reasoning in LLMs through Strategy Elicitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03271v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Chain-of-Thought (CoT) paradigm has emerged as a critical approach for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, despite their widespread adoption and success, CoT methods often exhibit instability due to their inability to consistently ensure the quality of generated reasoning paths, leading to sub-optimal reasoning performance. To address this challenge, we propose the \textbf{Strategic Chain-of-Thought} (SCoT), a novel methodology designed to refine LLM performance by integrating strategic knowledge prior to generating intermediate reasoning steps. SCoT employs a two-stage approach within a single prompt: first eliciting an effective problem-solving strategy, which is then used to guide the generation of high-quality CoT paths and final answers. Our experiments across eight challenging reasoning datasets demonstrate significant improvements, including a 21.05\% increase on the GSM8K dataset and 24.13\% on the Tracking\_Objects dataset, respectively, using the Llama3-8b model. Additionally, we extend the SCoT framework to develop a few-shot method with automatically matched demonstrations, yielding even stronger results. These findings underscore the efficacy of SCoT, highlighting its potential to substantially enhance LLM performance in complex reasoning tasks.</description>

      <title>ChartMoE: Mixture of Expert Connector for Advanced Chart Understanding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automatic chart understanding is crucial for content comprehension and document parsing. Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in chart understanding through domain-specific alignment and fine-tuning. However, the application of alignment training within the chart domain is still underexplored. To address this, we propose ChartMoE, which employs the mixture of expert (MoE) architecture to replace the traditional linear projector to bridge the modality gap. Specifically, we train multiple linear connectors through distinct alignment tasks, which are utilized as the foundational initialization parameters for different experts. Additionally, we introduce ChartMoE-Align, a dataset with over 900K chart-table-JSON-code quadruples to conduct three alignment tasks (chart-table/JSON/code). Combined with the vanilla connector, we initialize different experts in four distinct ways and adopt high-quality knowledge learning to further refine the MoE connector and LLM parameters. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the MoE connector and our initialization strategy, e.g., ChartMoE improves the accuracy of the previous state-of-the-art from 80.48% to 84.64% on the ChartQA benchmark.</description>

      <title>iText2KG: Incremental Knowledge Graphs Construction Using Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most available data is unstructured, making it challenging to access valuable information. Automatically building Knowledge Graphs (KGs) is crucial for structuring data and making it accessible, allowing users to search for information effectively. KGs also facilitate insights, inference, and reasoning. Traditional NLP methods, such as named entity recognition and relation extraction, are key in information retrieval but face limitations, including the use of predefined entity types and the need for supervised learning. Current research leverages large language models' capabilities, such as zero- or few-shot learning. However, unresolved and semantically duplicated entities and relations still pose challenges, leading to inconsistent graphs and requiring extensive post-processing. Additionally, most approaches are topic-dependent. In this paper, we propose iText2KG, a method for incremental, topic-independent KG construction without post-processing. This plug-and-play, zero-shot method is applicable across a wide range of KG construction scenarios and comprises four modules: Document Distiller, Incremental Entity Extractor, Incremental Relation Extractor, and Graph Integrator and Visualization. Our method demonstrates superior performance compared to baseline methods across three scenarios: converting scientific papers to graphs, websites to graphs, and CVs to graphs.</description>

      <title>From MOOC to MAIC: Reshaping Online Teaching and Learning through LLM-driven Agents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since the first instances of online education, where courses were uploaded to accessible and shared online platforms, this form of scaling the dissemination of human knowledge to reach a broader audience has sparked extensive discussion and widespread adoption. Recognizing that personalized learning still holds significant potential for improvement, new AI technologies have been continuously integrated into this learning format, resulting in a variety of educational AI applications such as educational recommendation and intelligent tutoring. The emergence of intelligence in large language models (LLMs) has allowed for these educational enhancements to be built upon a unified foundational model, enabling deeper integration. In this context, we propose MAIC (Massive AI-empowered Course), a new form of online education that leverages LLM-driven multi-agent systems to construct an AI-augmented classroom, balancing scalability with adaptivity. Beyond exploring the conceptual framework and technical innovations, we conduct preliminary experiments at Tsinghua University, one of China's leading universities. Drawing from over 100,000 learning records of more than 500 students, we obtain a series of valuable observations and initial analyses. This project will continue to evolve, ultimately aiming to establish a comprehensive open platform that supports and unifies research, technology, and applications in exploring the possibilities of online education in the era of large model AI. We envision this platform as a collaborative hub, bringing together educators, researchers, and innovators to collectively explore the future of AI-driven online education.</description>

      <title>CDM: A Reliable Metric for Fair and Accurate Formula Recognition Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Formula recognition presents significant challenges due to the complicated structure and varied notation of mathematical expressions. Despite continuous advancements in formula recognition models, the evaluation metrics employed by these models, such as BLEU and Edit Distance, still exhibit notable limitations. They overlook the fact that the same formula has diverse representations and is highly sensitive to the distribution of training data, thereby causing the unfairness in formula recognition evaluation. To this end, we propose a Character Detection Matching (CDM) metric, ensuring the evaluation objectivity by designing a image-level rather than LaTex-level metric score. Specifically, CDM renders both the model-predicted LaTeX and the ground-truth LaTeX formulas into image-formatted formulas, then employs visual feature extraction and localization techniques for precise character-level matching, incorporating spatial position information. Such a spatially-aware and character-matching method offers a more accurate and equitable evaluation compared with previous BLEU and Edit Distance metrics that rely solely on text-based character matching. Experimentally, we evaluated various formula recognition models using CDM, BLEU, and ExpRate metrics. Their results demonstrate that the CDM aligns more closely with human evaluation standards and provides a fairer comparison across different models by eliminating discrepancies caused by diverse formula representations.</description>

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is an effective approach for aligning language models to human preferences. Central to RLHF is learning a reward function for scoring human preferences. Two main approaches for learning a reward model are 1) training an EXplicit Reward Model (EXRM) as in RLHF, and 2) using an implicit reward learned from preference data through methods such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Prior work has shown that the implicit reward model of DPO (denoted as DPORM) can approximate an EXRM in the limit. DPORM's effectiveness directly implies the optimality of the learned policy, and also has practical implication for LLM alignment methods including iterative DPO. However, it is unclear how well DPORM empirically matches the performance of EXRM. This work studies the accuracy at distinguishing preferred and rejected answers for both DPORM and EXRM. Our findings indicate that even though DPORM fits the training dataset comparably, it generalizes less effectively than EXRM, especially when the validation datasets contain distribution shifts. Across five out-of-distribution settings, DPORM has a mean drop in accuracy of 3% and a maximum drop of 7%. These findings highlight that DPORM has limited generalization ability and substantiates the integration of an explicit reward model in iterative DPO approaches.</description>

      <title>A Fused Large Language Model for Predicting Startup Success</title>

Abstract: Investors are continuously seeking profitable investment opportunities in startups and, hence, for effective decision-making, need to predict a startup's probability of success. Nowadays, investors can use not only various fundamental information about a startup (e.g., the age of the startup, the number of founders, and the business sector) but also textual description of a startup's innovation and business model, which is widely available through online venture capital (VC) platforms such as Crunchbase. To support the decision-making of investors, we develop a machine learning approach with the aim of locating successful startups on VC platforms. Specifically, we develop, train, and evaluate a tailored, fused large language model to predict startup success. Thereby, we assess to what extent self-descriptions on VC platforms are predictive of startup success. Using 20,172 online profiles from Crunchbase, we find that our fused large language model can predict startup success, with textual self-descriptions being responsible for a significant part of the predictive power. Our work provides a decision support tool for investors to find profitable investment opportunities.</description>

      <title>Planning In Natural Language Improves LLM Search For Code Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While scaling training compute has led to remarkable improvements in large language models (LLMs), scaling inference compute has not yet yielded analogous gains. We hypothesize that a core missing component is a lack of diverse LLM outputs, leading to inefficient search due to models repeatedly sampling highly similar, yet incorrect generations. We empirically demonstrate that this lack of diversity can be mitigated by searching over candidate plans for solving a problem in natural language. Based on this insight, we propose PLANSEARCH, a novel search algorithm which shows strong results across HumanEval+, MBPP+, and LiveCodeBench (a contamination-free benchmark for competitive coding). PLANSEARCH generates a diverse set of observations about the problem and then uses these observations to construct plans for solving the problem. By searching over plans in natural language rather than directly over code solutions, PLANSEARCH explores a significantly more diverse range of potential solutions compared to baseline search methods. Using PLANSEARCH on top of Claude 3.5 Sonnet achieves a state-of-the-art pass@200 of 77.0% on LiveCodeBench, outperforming both the best score achieved without search (pass@1 = 41.4%) and using standard repeated sampling (pass@200 = 60.6%). Finally, we show that, across all models, search algorithms, and benchmarks analyzed, we can accurately predict performance gains due to search as a direct function of the diversity over generated ideas.</description>

      <title>Lexicon3D: Probing Visual Foundation Models for Complex 3D Scene Understanding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complex 3D scene understanding has gained increasing attention, with scene encoding strategies playing a crucial role in this success. However, the optimal scene encoding strategies for various scenarios remain unclear, particularly compared to their image-based counterparts. To address this issue, we present a comprehensive study that probes various visual encoding models for 3D scene understanding, identifying the strengths and limitations of each model across different scenarios. Our evaluation spans seven vision foundation encoders, including image-based, video-based, and 3D foundation models. We evaluate these models in four tasks: Vision-Language Scene Reasoning, Visual Grounding, Segmentation, and Registration, each focusing on different aspects of scene understanding. Our evaluations yield key findings: DINOv2 demonstrates superior performance, video models excel in object-level tasks, diffusion models benefit geometric tasks, and language-pretrained models show unexpected limitations in language-related tasks. These insights challenge some conventional understandings, provide novel perspectives on leveraging visual foundation models, and highlight the need for more flexible encoder selection in future vision-language and scene-understanding tasks.</description>

      <title>PESTS: Persian_English Cross Lingual Corpus for Semantic Textual Similarity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.07893v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the components of natural language processing that has received a lot of investigation recently is semantic textual similarity. In computational linguistics and natural language processing, assessing the semantic similarity of words, phrases, paragraphs, and texts is crucial. Calculating the degree of semantic resemblance between two textual pieces, paragraphs, or phrases provided in both monolingual and cross-lingual versions is known as semantic similarity. Cross lingual semantic similarity requires corpora in which there are sentence pairs in both the source and target languages with a degree of semantic similarity between them. Many existing cross lingual semantic similarity models use a machine translation due to the unavailability of cross lingual semantic similarity dataset, which the propagation of the machine translation error reduces the accuracy of the model. On the other hand, when we want to use semantic similarity features for machine translation the same machine translations should not be used for semantic similarity. For Persian, which is one of the low resource languages, no effort has been made in this regard and the need for a model that can understand the context of two languages is felt more than ever. In this article, the corpus of semantic textual similarity between sentences in Persian and English languages has been produced for the first time by using linguistic experts. We named this dataset PESTS (Persian English Semantic Textual Similarity). This corpus contains 5375 sentence pairs. Also, different models based on transformers have been fine-tuned using this dataset. The results show that using the PESTS dataset, the Pearson correlation of the XLM ROBERTa model increases from 85.87% to 95.62%.</description>

      <title>Resolving Knowledge Conflicts in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.00935v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often encounter knowledge conflicts, scenarios where discrepancy arises between the internal parametric knowledge of LLMs and non-parametric information provided in the prompt context. In this work we ask what are the desiderata for LLMs when a knowledge conflict arises and whether existing LLMs fulfill them. We posit that LLMs should 1) identify knowledge conflicts, 2) pinpoint conflicting information segments, and 3) provide distinct answers or viewpoints in conflicting scenarios. To this end, we introduce KNOWLEDGE CONFLICT, an evaluation framework for simulating contextual knowledge conflicts and quantitatively evaluating to what extent LLMs achieve these goals. KNOWLEDGE CONFLICT includes diverse and complex situations of knowledge conflict, knowledge from diverse entities and domains, two synthetic conflict creation methods, and settings with progressively increasing difficulty to reflect realistic knowledge conflicts. Extensive experiments with the KNOWLEDGE CONFLICT framework reveal that while LLMs perform well in identifying the existence of knowledge conflicts, they struggle to determine the specific conflicting knowledge and produce a response with distinct answers amidst conflicting information. To address these challenges, we propose new instruction-based approaches that augment LLMs to better achieve the three goals. Further analysis shows that abilities to tackle knowledge conflicts are greatly impacted by factors such as knowledge domain and prompt text, while generating robust responses to knowledge conflict scenarios remains an open research question.</description>

      <title>Unleashing the potential of prompt engineering in Large Language Models: a comprehensive review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.14735v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This comprehensive review delves into the pivotal role of prompt engineering in unleashing the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). The development of Artificial Intelligence (AI), from its inception in the 1950s to the emergence of advanced neural networks and deep learning architectures, has made a breakthrough in LLMs, with models such as GPT-4o and Claude-3, and in Vision-Language Models (VLMs), with models such as CLIP and ALIGN. Prompt engineering is the process of structuring inputs, which has emerged as a crucial technique to maximize the utility and accuracy of these models. This paper explores both foundational and advanced methodologies of prompt engineering, including techniques such as self-consistency, chain-of-thought, and generated knowledge, which significantly enhance model performance. Additionally, it examines the prompt method of VLMs through innovative approaches such as Context Optimization (CoOp), Conditional Context Optimization (CoCoOp), and Multimodal Prompt Learning (MaPLe). Critical to this discussion is the aspect of AI security, particularly adversarial attacks that exploit vulnerabilities in prompt engineering. Strategies to mitigate these risks and enhance model robustness are thoroughly reviewed. The evaluation of prompt methods is also addressed, through both subjective and objective metrics, ensuring a robust analysis of their efficacy. This review also reflects the essential role of prompt engineering in advancing AI capabilities, providing a structured framework for future research and application.</description>

      <title>Positioning Political Texts with Large Language Models by Asking and Averaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16639v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4, Llama 3, MiXtral, or Aya to position political texts within policy and ideological spaces. We ask an LLM where a tweet or a sentence of a political text stands on the focal dimension and take the average of the LLM responses to position political actors such as US Senators, or longer texts such as UK party manifestos or EU policy speeches given in 10 different languages. The correlations between the position estimates obtained with the best LLMs and benchmarks based on text coding by experts, crowdworkers, or roll call votes exceed .90. This approach is generally more accurate than the positions obtained with supervised classifiers trained on large amounts of research data. Using instruction-tuned LLMs to position texts in policy and ideological spaces is fast, cost-efficient, reliable, and reproducible (in the case of open LLMs) even if the texts are short and written in different languages. We conclude with cautionary notes about the need for empirical validation.</description>

      <title>Kun: Answer Polishment for Chinese Self-Alignment with Instruction Back-Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06477v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Kun, a novel approach for creating high-quality instruction-tuning datasets for large language models (LLMs) without relying on manual annotations. Adapting a self-training algorithm based on instruction back-translation and answer polishment, Kun leverages unlabelled data from diverse sources such as Wudao, Wanjuan, and SkyPile to generate a substantial dataset of over a million Chinese instructional data points. This approach significantly deviates from traditional methods by using a self-curation process to refine and select the most effective instruction-output pairs. Our experiments with the 6B-parameter Yi model across various benchmarks demonstrate Kun's robustness and scalability. Our method's core contributions lie in its algorithmic advancement, which enhances data retention and clarity, and its innovative data generation approach that substantially reduces the reliance on costly and time-consuming manual annotations. This methodology presents a scalable and efficient solution for improving the instruction-following capabilities of LLMs, with significant implications for their application across diverse fields.

      <title>Language-Guided World Models: A Model-Based Approach to AI Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01695v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces the concept of Language-Guided World Models (LWMs) -- probabilistic models that can simulate environments by reading texts. Agents equipped with these models provide humans with more extensive and efficient control, allowing them to simultaneously alter agent behaviors in multiple tasks via natural verbal communication. In this work, we take initial steps in developing robust LWMs that can generalize to compositionally novel language descriptions. We design a challenging world modeling benchmark based on the game of MESSENGER (Hanjie et al., 2021), featuring evaluation settings that require varying degrees of compositional generalization. Our experiments reveal the lack of generalizability of the state-of-the-art Transformer model, as it offers marginal improvements in simulation quality over a no-text baseline. We devise a more robust model by fusing the Transformer with the EMMA attention mechanism (Hanjie et al., 2021). Our model substantially outperforms the Transformer and approaches the performance of a model with an oracle semantic parsing and grounding capability. To demonstrate the practicality of this model in improving AI safety and transparency, we simulate a scenario in which the model enables an agent to present plans to a human before execution, and to revise plans based on their language feedback.</description>

      <title>Exploring Group and Symmetry Principles in Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06120v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across a wide range of applications; however, assessing their reasoning capabilities remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we introduce a framework grounded in group and symmetry principles, which have played a crucial role in fields such as physics and mathematics, and offer another way to evaluate their capabilities. While the proposed framework is general, to showcase the benefits of employing these properties, we focus on arithmetic reasoning and investigate the performance of these models on four group properties: closure, identity, inverse, and associativity. Our findings reveal that LLMs studied in this work struggle to preserve group properties across different test regimes. In the closure test, we observe biases towards specific outputs and an abrupt degradation in their performance from 100% to 0% after a specific sequence length. They also perform poorly in the identity test, which represents adding irrelevant information in the context, and show sensitivity when subjected to inverse test, which examines the robustness of the model with respect to negation. In addition, we demonstrate that breaking down problems into smaller steps helps LLMs in the associativity test that we have conducted. To support these tests we have developed a synthetic dataset which will be released.</description>

      <title>Cost-Efficient Subjective Task Annotation and Modeling through Few-Shot Annotator Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14101v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In subjective NLP tasks, where a single ground truth does not exist, the inclusion of diverse annotators becomes crucial as their unique perspectives significantly influence the annotations. In realistic scenarios, the annotation budget often becomes the main determinant of the number of perspectives (i.e., annotators) included in the data and subsequent modeling. We introduce a novel framework for annotation collection and modeling in subjective tasks that aims to minimize the annotation budget while maximizing the predictive performance for each annotator. Our framework has a two-stage design: first, we rely on a small set of annotators to build a multitask model, and second, we augment the model for a new perspective by strategically annotating a few samples per annotator. To test our framework at scale, we introduce and release a unique dataset, Moral Foundations Subjective Corpus, of 2000 Reddit posts annotated by 24 annotators for moral sentiment. We demonstrate that our framework surpasses the previous SOTA in capturing the annotators' individual perspectives with as little as 25% of the original annotation budget on two datasets. Furthermore, our framework results in more equitable models, reducing the performance disparity among annotators.</description>

      <title>Aligning Large Language Models to a Domain-specific Graph Database for NL2GQL</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16567v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph Databases (Graph DB) find extensive application across diverse domains such as finance, social networks, and medicine. Yet, the translation of Natural Language (NL) into the Graph Query Language (GQL), referred to as NL2GQL, poses significant challenges owing to its intricate and specialized nature. Some approaches have sought to utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) to address analogous tasks like text2SQL. Nonetheless, in the realm of NL2GQL tasks tailored to a particular domain, the absence of domain-specific NL-GQL data pairs adds complexity to aligning LLMs with the graph DB. To tackle this challenge, we present a well-defined pipeline. Initially, we utilize ChatGPT to generate NL-GQL data pairs, leveraging the provided graph DB with self-instruction. Subsequently, we employ the generated data to fine-tune LLMs, ensuring alignment between LLMs and the graph DB. Moreover, we find the importance of relevant schema in efficiently generating accurate GQLs. Thus, we introduce a method to extract relevant schema as the input context. We evaluate our method using two carefully constructed datasets derived from graph DBs in the finance and medicine domains, named FinGQL and MediGQL. Experimental results reveal that our approach significantly outperforms a set of baseline methods, with improvements of 5.90 and 6.36 absolute points on EM, and 6.00 and 7.09 absolute points on EX for FinGQL and MediGQL, respectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06570v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Past studies on end-to-end meeting transcription have focused on model architecture and have mostly been evaluated on simulated meeting data. We present a novel study aiming to optimize the use of a Speaker-Attributed ASR (SA-ASR) system in real-life scenarios, such as the AMI meeting corpus, for improved speaker assignment of speech segments. First, we propose a pipeline tailored to real-life applications involving Voice Activity Detection (VAD), Speaker Diarization (SD), and SA-ASR. Second, we advocate using VAD output segments to fine-tune the SA-ASR model, considering that it is also applied to VAD segments during test, and show that this results in a relative reduction of Speaker Error Rate (SER) up to 28%. Finally, we explore strategies to enhance the extraction of the speaker embedding templates used as inputs by the SA-ASR system. We show that extracting them from SD output rather than annotated speaker segments results in a relative SER reduction up to 20%.</description>

      <title>Exposing and Explaining Fake News On-the-Fly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06668</link>

Abstract: Social media platforms enable the rapid dissemination and consumption of information. However, users instantly consume such content regardless of the reliability of the shared data. Consequently, the latter crowdsourcing model is exposed to manipulation. This work contributes with an explainable and online classification method to recognize fake news in real-time. The proposed method combines both unsupervised and supervised Machine Learning approaches with online created lexica. The profiling is built using creator-, content- and context-based features using Natural Language Processing techniques. The explainable classification mechanism displays in a dashboard the features selected for classification and the prediction confidence. The performance of the proposed solution has been validated with real data sets from Twitter and the results attain 80 % accuracy and macro F-measure. This proposal is the first to jointly provide data stream processing, profiling, classification and explainability. Ultimately, the proposed early detection, isolation and explanation of fake news contribute to increase the quality and trustworthiness of social media contents.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Masking, Not Prompting Optimization: A Paradigm Shift in Fine-tuning LLMs for Simultaneous Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10443v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in various language processing tasks, motivating their adoption in simultaneous translation. Current fine-tuning methods to adapt LLMs for simultaneous translation focus on prompting optimization strategies using either data augmentation or prompt structure modifications. However, these methods suffer from several issues, such as unnecessarily expanded training sets, computational inefficiency from dumping the key and value cache, increased prompt sizes, or restriction to a single decision policy. To eliminate these issues, in this work, we propose SimulMask, a new paradigm for fine-tuning LLMs for simultaneous translation. It utilizes a novel attention mask approach that models simultaneous translation during fine-tuning by masking attention for a desired decision policy. Applying the proposed SimulMask on a Falcon LLM for the IWSLT 2017 dataset, we have observed a significant translation quality improvement compared to state-of-the-art prompting optimization strategies on five language pairs while reducing the computational cost.</description>

      <title>A review on the use of large language models as virtual tutors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11983v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transformer architectures contribute to managing long-term dependencies for Natural Language Processing, representing one of the most recent changes in the field. These architectures are the basis of the innovative, cutting-edge Large Language Models (LLMs) that have produced a huge buzz in several fields and industrial sectors, among the ones education stands out. Accordingly, these generative Artificial Intelligence-based solutions have directed the change in techniques and the evolution in educational methods and contents, along with network infrastructure, towards high-quality learning. Given the popularity of LLMs, this review seeks to provide a comprehensive overview of those solutions designed specifically to generate and evaluate educational materials and which involve students and teachers in their design or experimental plan. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first review of educational applications (e.g., student assessment) of LLMs. As expected, the most common role of these systems is as virtual tutors for automatic question generation. Moreover, the most popular models are GTP-3 and BERT. However, due to the continuous launch of new generative models, new works are expected to be published shortly.</description>

      <title>Predicting Drug-Gene Relations via Analogy Tasks with Word Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00984v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Natural language processing (NLP) is utilized in a wide range of fields, where words in text are typically transformed into feature vectors called embeddings. BioConceptVec is a specific example of embeddings tailored for biology, trained on approximately 30 million PubMed abstracts using models such as skip-gram. Generally, word embeddings are known to solve analogy tasks through simple vector arithmetic. For instance, $\mathrm{\textit{king}} - \mathrm{\textit{man}} + \mathrm{\textit{woman}}$ predicts $\mathrm{\textit{queen}}$. In this study, we demonstrate that BioConceptVec embeddings, along with our own embeddings trained on PubMed abstracts, contain information about drug-gene relations and can predict target genes from a given drug through analogy computations. We also show that categorizing drugs and genes using biological pathways improves performance. Furthermore, we illustrate that vectors derived from known relations in the past can predict unknown future relations in datasets divided by year. Despite the simplicity of implementing analogy tasks as vector additions, our approach demonstrated performance comparable to that of large language models such as GPT-4 in predicting drug-gene relations.</description>

      <title>CAVE: Controllable Authorship Verification Explanations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16672v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Authorship Verification (AV) (do two documents have the same author?) is essential in many sensitive real-life applications. AV is often used in proprietary domains that require a private, offline model, making SOTA online models like ChatGPT undesirable. Current offline models however have lower downstream utility due to low accuracy/scalability (eg: traditional stylometry AV systems) and lack of accessible post-hoc explanations. In this work, we take the first step to address the above challenges with our trained, offline Llama-3-8B model CAVE (Controllable Authorship Verification Explanations): CAVE generates free-text AV explanations that are controlled to be (1) structured (can be decomposed into sub-explanations in terms of relevant linguistic features), and (2) easily verified for explanation-label consistency (via intermediate labels in sub-explanations). We first engineer a prompt that can generate silver training data from a SOTA teacher model in the desired CAVE output format. We then filter and distill this data into a pretrained Llama-3-8B, our carefully selected student model. Results on three difficult AV datasets IMDb62, Blog-Auth, and Fanfiction show that CAVE generates high quality explanations (as measured by automatic and human evaluation) as well as competitive task accuracies.</description>

      <title>Data Mixture Inference: What do BPE Tokenizers Reveal about their Training Data?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16607v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The pretraining data of today's strongest language models is opaque; in particular, little is known about the proportions of various domains or languages represented. In this work, we tackle a task which we call data mixture inference, which aims to uncover the distributional make-up of training data. We introduce a novel attack based on a previously overlooked source of information: byte-pair encoding (BPE) tokenizers, used by the vast majority of modern language models. Our key insight is that the ordered list of merge rules learned by a BPE tokenizer naturally reveals information about the token frequencies in its training data. Given a tokenizer's merge list along with example data for each category of interest, we formulate a linear program that solves for the proportion of each category in the tokenizer's training set. In controlled experiments, we show that our attack recovers mixture ratios with high precision for tokenizers trained on known mixtures of natural languages, programming languages, and data sources. We then apply our approach to off-the-shelf tokenizers released with recent LMs. We confirm much publicly disclosed information about these models, and also make several new inferences: GPT-4o and Mistral NeMo's tokenizers are much more multilingual than their predecessors, training on 39% and 47% non-English language data, respectively; Llama 3 extends GPT-3.5's tokenizer primarily for multilingual (48%) use; GPT-3.5's and Claude's tokenizers are trained on predominantly code (~60%). We hope our work sheds light on current design practices for pretraining data, and inspires continued research into data mixture inference for LMs.</description>

      <title>RT-Surv: Improving Mortality Prediction After Radiotherapy with Large Language Model Structuring of Large-Scale Unstructured Electronic Health Records</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05074v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate patient selection is critical in radiotherapy (RT) to prevent ineffective treatments. Traditional survival prediction models, relying on structured data, often lack precision. This study explores the potential of large language models (LLMs) to structure unstructured electronic health record (EHR) data, thereby improving survival prediction accuracy through comprehensive clinical information integration. Data from 34,276 patients treated with RT at Yonsei Cancer Center between 2013 and 2023 were analyzed, encompassing both structured and unstructured data. An open-source LLM was used to structure the unstructured EHR data via single-shot learning, with its performance compared against a domain-specific medical LLM and a smaller variant. Survival prediction models were developed using statistical, machine learning, and deep learning approaches, incorporating both structured and LLM-structured data. Clinical experts evaluated the accuracy of the LLM-structured data. The open-source LLM achieved 87.5% accuracy in structuring unstructured EHR data without additional training, significantly outperforming the domain-specific medical LLM, which reached only 35.8% accuracy. Larger LLMs were more effective, particularly in extracting clinically relevant features like general condition and disease extent, which closely correlated with patient survival. Incorporating LLM-structured clinical features into survival prediction models significantly improved accuracy, with the C-index of deep learning models increasing from 0.737 to 0.820. These models also became more interpretable by emphasizing clinically significant factors. This study shows that general-domain LLMs, even without specific medical training, can effectively structure large-scale unstructured EHR data, substantially enhancing the accuracy and interpretability of clinical predictive models.</description>

      <title>Towards Evaluating and Building Versatile Large Language Models for Medicine</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12547v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we present MedS-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the performance of large language models (LLMs) in clinical contexts. Unlike existing benchmarks that focus on multiple-choice question answering, MedS-Bench spans 11 high-level clinical tasks, including clinical report summarization, treatment recommendations, diagnosis, named entity recognition, and medical concept explanation, among others. We evaluated six leading LLMs, e.g., MEDITRON, Mistral, InternLM 2, Llama 3, GPT-4, and Claude-3.5 using few-shot prompting, and found that even the most sophisticated models struggle with these complex tasks. To address these limitations, we developed MedS-Ins, a large-scale instruction tuning dataset for medicine. MedS-Ins comprises 58 medically oriented language corpora, totaling 13.5 million samples across 122 tasks. To demonstrate the dataset's utility, we conducted a proof-of-concept experiment by performing instruction tuning on a lightweight, open-source medical language model. The resulting model, MMedIns-Llama 3, significantly outperformed existing models across nearly all clinical tasks. To promote further advancements in the application of LLMs to clinical challenges, we have made the MedS-Ins dataset fully accessible and invite the research community to contribute to its expansion.Additionally, we have launched a dynamic leaderboard for MedS-Bench, which we plan to regularly update the test set to track progress and enhance the adaptation of general LLMs to the medical domain.

      <title>Legilimens: Practical and Unified Content Moderation for Large Language Model Services</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15488v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given the societal impact of unsafe content generated by large language models (LLMs), ensuring that LLM services comply with safety standards is a crucial concern for LLM service providers. Common content moderation methods are limited by an effectiveness-and-efficiency dilemma, where simple models are fragile while sophisticated models consume excessive computational resources. In this paper, we reveal for the first time that effective and efficient content moderation can be achieved by extracting conceptual features from chat-oriented LLMs, despite their initial fine-tuning for conversation rather than content moderation. We propose a practical and unified content moderation framework for LLM services, named Legilimens, which features both effectiveness and efficiency. Our red-team model-based data augmentation enhances the robustness of Legilimens against state-of-the-art jailbreaking. Additionally, we develop a framework to theoretically analyze the cost-effectiveness of Legilimens compared to other methods. We have conducted extensive experiments on five host LLMs, seventeen datasets, and nine jailbreaking methods to verify the effectiveness, efficiency, and robustness of Legilimens against normal and adaptive adversaries. A comparison of Legilimens with both commercial and academic baselines demonstrates the superior performance of Legilimens. Furthermore, we confirm that Legilimens can be applied to few-shot scenarios and extended to multi-label classification tasks.</description>

      <title>Learning to Ask: When LLMs Meet Unclear Instruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00557v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Equipped with the capability to call functions, modern large language models (LLMs) can leverage external tools for addressing a range of tasks unattainable through language skills alone. However, the effective execution of these tools relies heavily not just on the advanced capabilities of LLMs but also on precise user instructions, which often cannot be ensured in the real world. To evaluate the performance of LLMs tool-use under imperfect instructions, we meticulously examine the real-world instructions queried from users, analyze the error patterns, and build a challenging tool-use benchmark called Noisy ToolBench (NoisyToolBench). We find that due to the next-token prediction training objective, LLMs tend to arbitrarily generate the missed argument, which may lead to hallucinations and risks. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework, Ask-when-Needed (AwN), which prompts LLMs to ask questions to users whenever they encounter obstacles due to unclear instructions. Moreover, to reduce the manual labor involved in user-LLM interaction and assess LLMs performance in tool utilization from both accuracy and efficiency perspectives, we design an automated evaluation tool named ToolEvaluator. Our experiments demonstrate that the AwN significantly outperforms existing frameworks for tool learning in the NoisyToolBench. We will release all related code and datasets to support future research.</description>

      <title>Booster: Tackling Harmful Fine-tuning for Large Language Models via Attenuating Harmful Perturbation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01586v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Harmful fine-tuning issue \citep{qi2023fine} poses serious safety concerns for Large language models' fine-tuning-as-a-service. While existing defenses \citep{huang2024vaccine,rosati2024representation} have been proposed to mitigate the issue, their performances are still far away from satisfactory, and the root cause of the problem has not been fully recovered. For the first time in the literature, we in this paper show that \textit{harmful perturbation} over the model weights should be the root cause of alignment-broken of harmful fine-tuning. In order to attenuate the negative impact of harmful perturbation, we propose an alignment-stage solution, dubbed Booster. Technically, along with the original alignment loss, we append a loss regularizer in the alignment stage's optimization. The regularizer ensures that the model's harmful loss reduction before/after simulated harmful perturbation is attenuated, thereby mitigating the subsequent fine-tuning risk. Empirical results show that Booster can effectively reduce the harmful score of the fine-tuned models while maintaining the performance of downstream tasks.

      <title>Enhancing Code-Switching Speech Recognition with LID-Based Collaborative Mixture of Experts Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02050v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Due to the inherent difficulty in modeling phonetic similarities across different languages, code-switching speech recognition presents a formidable challenge. This study proposes a Collaborative-MoE, a Mixture of Experts (MoE) model that leverages a collaborative mechanism among expert groups. Initially, a preceding routing network explicitly learns Language Identification (LID) tasks and selects experts based on acquired LID weights. This process ensures robust routing information to the MoE layer, mitigating interference from diverse language domains on expert network parameter updates. The LID weights are also employed to facilitate inter-group collaboration, enabling the integration of language-specific representations. Furthermore, within each language expert group, a gating network operates unsupervised to foster collaboration on attributes beyond language. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, achieving significant performance enhancements compared to alternative methods. Importantly, our method preserves the efficient inference capabilities characteristic of MoE models without necessitating additional pre-training.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02649v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents the experiments and results for the CheckThat! Lab at CLEF 2024 Task 6: Robustness of Credibility Assessment with Adversarial Examples (InCrediblAE). The primary objective of this task was to generate adversarial examples in five problem domains in order to evaluate the robustness of widely used text classification methods (fine-tuned BERT, BiLSTM, and RoBERTa) when applied to credibility assessment issues.
  This study explores the application of ensemble learning to enhance adversarial attacks on natural language processing (NLP) models. We systematically tested and refined several adversarial attack methods, including BERT-Attack, Genetic algorithms, TextFooler, and CLARE, on five datasets across various misinformation tasks. By developing modified versions of BERT-Attack and hybrid methods, we achieved significant improvements in attack effectiveness. Our results demonstrate the potential of modification and combining multiple methods to create more sophisticated and effective adversarial attack strategies, contributing to the development of more robust and secure systems.</description>

      <title>Pooling And Attention: What Are Effective Designs For LLM-Based Embedding Models?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02727v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The significant advancements of Large Language Models (LLMs) in generative tasks have led to a growing body of work exploring LLM-based embedding models. While these models, employing different pooling and attention strategies, have achieved state-of-the-art performance on public embedding benchmarks, questions still arise about what constitutes an effective design for LLM-based embedding models. However, these models are often trained on different datasets, using different LLM base models or training settings. Moreover, evaluations on public embedding benchmarks often fail to report statistical significance, making it difficult to determine which designs truly contribute to final performance. This complicates the process for practitioners seeking optimal training recipes for LLM-based embedding models. In this study, we conduct a large-scale experiment by training a series of LLM-based embedding models using the same training data and base model but differing in their pooling and attention strategies. The results show that there is no one-size-fits-all solution: while bidirectional attention and an additional trainable pooling layer outperform in text similarity and information retrieval tasks, they do not significantly surpass simpler designs like EOS-last token pooling and default causal attention in clustering and classification tasks. Furthermore, we propose a new pooling strategy, Multi-Layers Trainable Pooling, which transforms the outputs of all hidden layers, rather than just the last layer, using a cross-attention network. This method proves to be statistically superior in text similarity and retrieval tasks compared to existing pooling methods. Overall, this paper sheds light on effective training strategies for LLM-based embedding models.</description>

      <title>LongCite: Enabling LLMs to Generate Fine-grained Citations in Long-context QA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02897v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Though current long-context large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capacities in answering user questions based on extensive text, the lack of citations in their responses makes user verification difficult, leading to concerns about their trustworthiness due to their potential hallucinations. In this work, we aim to enable long-context LLMs to generate responses with fine-grained sentence-level citations, improving their faithfulness and verifiability. We first introduce LongBench-Cite, an automated benchmark for assessing current LLMs' performance in Long-Context Question Answering with Citations (LQAC), revealing considerable room for improvement. To this end, we propose CoF (Coarse to Fine), a novel pipeline that utilizes off-the-shelf LLMs to automatically generate long-context QA instances with precise sentence-level citations, and leverage this pipeline to construct LongCite-45k, a large-scale SFT dataset for LQAC. Finally, we train LongCite-8B and LongCite-9B using the LongCite-45k dataset, successfully enabling their generation of accurate responses and fine-grained sentence-level citations in a single output. The evaluation results on LongBench-Cite show that our trained models achieve state-of-the-art citation quality, surpassing advanced proprietary models including GPT-4o.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Byte-level Representation for End-to-end ASR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09676v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel approach to optimizing a byte-level representation for end-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR). Byte-level representation is often used by large scale multilingual ASR systems when the character set of the supported languages is large. The compactness and universality of byte-level representation allow the ASR models to use smaller output vocabularies and therefore, provide more flexibility. UTF-8 is a commonly used byte-level representation for multilingual ASR, but it is not designed to optimize machine learning tasks directly. By using auto-encoder and vector quantization, we show that we can optimize a byte-level representation for ASR and achieve better accuracy. Our proposed framework can incorporate information from different modalities, and provides an error correction mechanism. In an English/Mandarin dictation task, we show that a bilingual ASR model built with this approach can outperform UTF-8 representation by 5% relative in error rate.</description>

      <title>Model Merging in LLMs, MLLMs, and Beyond: Methods, Theories, Applications and Opportunities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07666v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Model merging is an efficient empowerment technique in the machine learning community that does not require the collection of raw training data and does not require expensive computation. As model merging becomes increasingly prevalent across various fields, it is crucial to understand the available model merging techniques comprehensively. However, there is a significant gap in the literature regarding a systematic and thorough review of these techniques. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of model merging methods and theories, their applications in various domains and settings, and future research directions. Specifically, we first propose a new taxonomic approach that exhaustively discusses existing model merging methods. Secondly, we discuss the application of model merging techniques in large language models, multimodal large language models, and 10+ machine learning subfields, including continual learning, multi-task learning, few-shot learning, etc. Finally, we highlight the remaining challenges of model merging and discuss future research directions. A comprehensive list of papers about model merging is available at \url{https://github.com/EnnengYang/Awesome-Model-Merging-Methods-Theories-Applications}.</description>

      <title>Tracing Privacy Leakage of Language Models to Training Data via Adjusted Influence Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10468v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The responses generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) can include sensitive information from individuals and organizations, leading to potential privacy leakage. This work implements Influence Functions (IFs) to trace privacy leakage back to the training data, thereby mitigating privacy concerns of Language Models (LMs). However, we notice that current IFs struggle to accurately estimate the influence of tokens with large gradient norms, potentially overestimating their influence. When tracing the most influential samples, this leads to frequently tracing back to samples with large gradient norm tokens, overshadowing the actual most influential samples even if their influences are well estimated. To address this issue, we propose Heuristically Adjusted IF (HAIF), which reduces the weight of tokens with large gradient norms, thereby significantly improving the accuracy of tracing the most influential samples. To establish easily obtained groundtruth for tracing privacy leakage, we construct two datasets, PII-E and PII-CR, representing two distinct scenarios: one with identical text in the model outputs and pre-training data, and the other where models leverage their reasoning abilities to generate text divergent from pre-training data. HAIF significantly improves tracing accuracy, enhancing it by 20.96% to 73.71% on the PII-E dataset and 3.21% to 45.93% on the PII-CR dataset, compared to the best SOTA IFs against various GPT-2 and QWen-1.5 models. HAIF also outperforms SOTA IFs on real-world pretraining data CLUECorpus2020, demonstrating strong robustness regardless prompt and response lengths.</description>

      <title>Prediction of COPD Using Machine Learning, Clinical Summary Notes, and Vital Signs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13958v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a chronic inflammatory lung disease that causes obstructed airflow from the lungs. In the United States, more than 15.7 million Americans have been diagnosed with COPD, with 96% of individuals living with at least one other chronic health condition. It is the 4th leading cause of death in the country. Over 2.2 million patients are admitted to hospitals annually due to COPD exacerbations. Monitoring and predicting patient exacerbations on-time could save their life. This paper presents two different predictive models to predict COPD exacerbation using AI and natural language processing (NLP) approaches. These models use respiration summary notes, symptoms, and vital signs. To train and test these models, data records containing physiologic signals and vital signs time series were used. These records were captured from patient monitors and comprehensive clinical data obtained from hospital medical information systems for tens of thousands of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients. We achieved an area under the Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of 0.82 in detection and prediction of COPD exacerbation.</description>

      <title>LogicGame: Benchmarking Rule-Based Reasoning Abilities of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15778v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated notable capabilities across various tasks, showcasing complex problem-solving abilities. Understanding and executing complex rules, along with multi-step planning, are fundamental to logical reasoning and critical for practical LLM agents and decision-making systems. However, evaluating LLMs as effective rule-based executors and planners remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce LogicGame, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the comprehensive rule understanding, execution, and planning capabilities of LLMs. Unlike traditional benchmarks, LogicGame provides diverse games that contain a series of rules with an initial state, requiring models to comprehend and apply predefined regulations to solve problems. We create simulated scenarios in which models execute or plan operations to achieve specific outcomes. These game scenarios are specifically designed to distinguish logical reasoning from mere knowledge by relying exclusively on predefined rules. This separation allows for a pure assessment of rule-based reasoning capabilities. The evaluation considers not only final outcomes but also intermediate steps, providing a comprehensive assessment of model performance. Moreover, these intermediate steps are deterministic and can be automatically verified. LogicGame defines game scenarios with varying difficulty levels, from simple rule applications to complex reasoning chains, in order to offer a precise evaluation of model performance on rule understanding and multi-step execution. Utilizing LogicGame, we test various LLMs and identify notable shortcomings in their rule-based logical reasoning abilities.</description>

      <title>More Text, Less Point: Towards 3D Data-Efficient Point-Language Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15966v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Enabling Large Language Models (LLMs) to comprehend the 3D physical world remains a significant challenge. Due to the lack of large-scale 3D-text pair datasets, the success of LLMs has yet to be replicated in 3D understanding. In this paper, we rethink this issue and propose a new task: 3D Data-Efficient Point-Language Understanding. The goal is to enable LLMs to achieve robust 3D object understanding with minimal 3D point cloud and text data pairs. To address this task, we introduce GreenPLM, which leverages more text data to compensate for the lack of 3D data. First, inspired by using CLIP to align images and text, we utilize a pre-trained point cloud-text encoder to map the 3D point cloud space to the text space. This mapping leaves us to seamlessly connect the text space with LLMs. Once the point-text-LLM connection is established, we further enhance text-LLM alignment by expanding the intermediate text space, thereby reducing the reliance on 3D point cloud data. Specifically, we generate 6M free-text descriptions of 3D objects, and design a three-stage training strategy to help LLMs better explore the intrinsic connections between different modalities. To achieve efficient modality alignment, we design a zero-parameter cross-attention module for token pooling. Extensive experimental results show that GreenPLM requires only 12% of the 3D training data used by existing state-of-the-art models to achieve superior 3D understanding. Remarkably, GreenPLM also achieves competitive performance using text-only data. The code and weights are available at: https://github.com/TangYuan96/GreenPLM.</description>

      <title>Temporal Order Preserved Optimal Transport-based Cross-modal Knowledge Transfer Learning for ASR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02239v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transferring linguistic knowledge from a pretrained language model (PLM) to an acoustic model has been shown to greatly improve the performance of automatic speech recognition (ASR). However, due to the heterogeneous feature distributions in cross-modalities, designing an effective model for feature alignment and knowledge transfer between linguistic and acoustic sequences remains a challenging task. Optimal transport (OT), which efficiently measures probability distribution discrepancies, holds great potential for aligning and transferring knowledge between acoustic and linguistic modalities. Nonetheless, the original OT treats acoustic and linguistic feature sequences as two unordered sets in alignment and neglects temporal order information during OT coupling estimation. Consequently, a time-consuming pretraining stage is required to learn a good alignment between the acoustic and linguistic representations. In this paper, we propose a Temporal Order Preserved OT (TOT)-based Cross-modal Alignment and Knowledge Transfer (CAKT) (TOT-CAKT) for ASR. In the TOT-CAKT, local neighboring frames of acoustic sequences are smoothly mapped to neighboring regions of linguistic sequences, preserving their temporal order relationship in feature alignment and matching. With the TOT-CAKT model framework, we conduct Mandarin ASR experiments with a pretrained Chinese PLM for linguistic knowledge transfer. Our results demonstrate that the proposed TOT-CAKT significantly improves ASR performance compared to several state-of-the-art models employing linguistic knowledge transfer, and addresses the weaknesses of the original OT-based method in sequential feature alignment for ASR.</description>
