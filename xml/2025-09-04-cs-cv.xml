      <title>AMMKD: Adaptive Multimodal Multi-teacher Distillation for Lightweight Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The success of large-scale visual language pretraining (VLP) models has driven widespread adoption of image-text retrieval tasks. However, their deployment on mobile devices remains limited due to large model sizes and computational complexity. We propose Adaptive Multi-Modal Multi-Teacher Knowledge Distillation (AMMKD), a novel framework that integrates multi-modal feature fusion, multi-teacher distillation, and adaptive optimization to deliver lightweight yet effective retrieval models. Specifically, our method begins with a feature fusion network that extracts and merges discriminative features from both the image and text modalities. To reduce model parameters and further improve performance, we design a multi-teacher knowledge distillation framework to pre-train two CLIP teacher models. We decouple modalities by pre-computing and storing text features as class vectors via the teacher text encoder to enhance efficiency. To better align teacher and student outputs, we apply KL scatter for probability distribution matching. Finally, we design an adaptive dynamic weighting scheme that treats multi-teacher distillation as a multi-objective optimization problem. By leveraging gradient space diversity, we dynamically adjust the influence of each teacher, reducing conflicts and guiding the student toward more optimal learning directions. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that AMMKD achieves superior performance while significantly reducing model complexity, validating its effectiveness and flexibility.</description>

      <title>ARTPS: Depth-Enhanced Hybrid Anomaly Detection and Learnable Curiosity Score for Autonomous Rover Target Prioritization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present ARTPS (Autonomous Rover Target Prioritization System), a novel hybrid AI system that combines depth estimation, anomaly detection, and learnable curiosity scoring for autonomous exploration of planetary surfaces. Our approach integrates monocular depth estimation using Vision Transformers with multi-component anomaly detection and a weighted curiosity score that balances known value, anomaly signals, depth variance, and surface roughness. The system achieves state-of-the-art performance with AUROC of 0.94, AUPRC of 0.89, and F1-Score of 0.87 on Mars rover datasets. We demonstrate significant improvements in target prioritization accuracy through ablation studies and provide comprehensive analysis of component contributions. The hybrid fusion approach reduces false positives by 23% while maintaining high detection sensitivity across diverse terrain types.</description>

      <title>Performance is not All You Need: Sustainability Considerations for Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work focuses on the high carbon emissions generated by deep learning model training, specifically addressing the core challenge of balancing algorithm performance and energy consumption. It proposes an innovative two-dimensional sustainability evaluation system. Different from the traditional single performance-oriented evaluation paradigm, this study pioneered two quantitative indicators that integrate energy efficiency ratio and accuracy: the sustainable harmonic mean (FMS) integrates accumulated energy consumption and performance parameters through the harmonic mean to reveal the algorithm performance under unit energy consumption; the area under the sustainability curve (ASC) constructs a performance-power consumption curve to characterize the energy efficiency characteristics of the algorithm throughout the cycle. To verify the universality of the indicator system, the study constructed benchmarks in various multimodal tasks, including image classification, segmentation, pose estimation, and batch and online learning. Experiments demonstrate that the system can provide a quantitative basis for evaluating cross-task algorithms and promote the transition of green AI research from theory to practice. Our sustainability evaluation framework code can be found here, providing methodological support for the industry to establish algorithm energy efficiency standards.</description>

      <title>MESTI-MEGANet: Micro-expression Spatio-Temporal Image and Micro-expression Gradient Attention Networks for Micro-expression Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Micro-expression recognition (MER) is a challenging task due to the subtle and fleeting nature of micro-expressions. Traditional input modalities, such as Apex Frame, Optical Flow, and Dynamic Image, often fail to adequately capture these brief facial movements, resulting in suboptimal performance. In this study, we introduce the Micro-expression Spatio-Temporal Image (MESTI), a novel dynamic input modality that transforms a video sequence into a single image while preserving the essential characteristics of micro-movements. Additionally, we present the Micro-expression Gradient Attention Network (MEGANet), which incorporates a novel Gradient Attention block to enhance the extraction of fine-grained motion features from micro-expressions. By combining MESTI and MEGANet, we aim to establish a more effective approach to MER. Extensive experiments were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of MESTI, comparing it with existing input modalities across three CNN architectures (VGG19, ResNet50, and EfficientNetB0). Moreover, we demonstrate that replacing the input of previously published MER networks with MESTI leads to consistent performance improvements. The performance of MEGANet, both with MESTI and Dynamic Image, is also evaluated, showing that our proposed network achieves state-of-the-art results on the CASMEII and SAMM datasets. The combination of MEGANet and MESTI achieves the highest accuracy reported to date, setting a new benchmark for micro-expression recognition. These findings underscore the potential of MESTI as a superior input modality and MEGANet as an advanced recognition network, paving the way for more effective MER systems in a variety of applications.</description>

      <title>Scaffold Diffusion: Sparse Multi-Category Voxel Structure Generation with Discrete Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating realistic sparse multi-category 3D voxel structures is difficult due to the cubic memory scaling of voxel structures and moreover the significant class imbalance caused by sparsity. We introduce Scaffold Diffusion, a generative model designed for sparse multi-category 3D voxel structures. By treating voxels as tokens, Scaffold Diffusion uses a discrete diffusion language model to generate 3D voxel structures. We show that discrete diffusion language models can be extended beyond inherently sequential domains such as text to generate spatially coherent 3D structures. We evaluate on Minecraft house structures from the 3D-Craft dataset and demonstrate that, unlike prior baselines and an auto-regressive formulation, Scaffold Diffusion produces realistic and coherent structures even when trained on data with over 98% sparsity. We provide an interactive viewer where readers can visualize generated samples and the generation process. Our results highlight discrete diffusion as a promising framework for 3D sparse voxel generative modeling.</description>

      <title>Dual-Stage Global and Local Feature Framework for Image Dehazing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Addressing the challenge of removing atmospheric fog or haze from digital images, known as image dehazing, has recently gained significant traction in the computer vision community. Although contemporary dehazing models have demonstrated promising performance, few have thoroughly investigated high-resolution imagery. In such scenarios, practitioners often resort to downsampling the input image or processing it in smaller patches, which leads to a notable performance degradation. This drop is primarily linked to the difficulty of effectively combining global contextual information with localized, fine-grained details as the spatial resolution grows. In this chapter, we propose a novel framework, termed the Streamlined Global and Local Features Combinator (SGLC), to bridge this gap and enable robust dehazing for high-resolution inputs. Our approach is composed of two principal components: the Global Features Generator (GFG) and the Local Features Enhancer (LFE). The GFG produces an initial dehazed output by focusing on broad contextual understanding of the scene. Subsequently, the LFE refines this preliminary output by enhancing localized details and pixel-level features, thereby capturing the interplay between global appearance and local structure. To evaluate the effectiveness of SGLC, we integrated it with the Uformer architecture, a state-of-the-art dehazing model. Experimental results on high-resolution datasets reveal a considerable improvement in peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) when employing SGLC, indicating its potency in addressing haze in large-scale imagery. Moreover, the SGLC design is model-agnostic, allowing any dehazing network to be augmented with the proposed global-and-local feature fusion mechanism. Through this strategy, practitioners can harness both scene-level cues and granular details, significantly improving visual fidelity in high-resolution environments.</description>

      <title>Self-supervised large-scale kidney abnormality detection in drug safety assessment studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kidney abnormality detection is required for all preclinical drug development. It involves a time-consuming and costly examination of hundreds to thousands of whole-slide images per drug safety study, most of which are normal, to detect any subtle changes indicating toxic effects. In this study, we present the first large-scale self-supervised abnormality detection model for kidney toxicologic pathology, spanning drug safety assessment studies from 158 compounds. We explore the complexity of kidney abnormality detection on this scale using features extracted from the UNI foundation model (FM) and show that a simple k-nearest neighbor classifier on these features performs at chance, demonstrating that the FM-generated features alone are insufficient for detecting abnormalities. We then demonstrate that a self-supervised method applied to the same features can achieve better-than-chance performance, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.62 and a negative predictive value of 89%. With further development, such a model can be used to rule out normal slides in drug safety assessment studies, reducing the costs and time associated with drug development.</description>

      <title>Waste-Bench: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Evaluating VLLMs in Cluttered Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have paved the way for Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs) capable of performing a wide range of visual understanding tasks. While LLMs have demonstrated impressive performance on standard natural images, their capabilities have not been thoroughly explored in cluttered datasets where there is complex environment having deformed shaped objects. In this work, we introduce a novel dataset specifically designed for waste classification in real-world scenarios, characterized by complex environments and deformed shaped objects. Along with this dataset, we present an in-depth evaluation approach to rigorously assess the robustness and accuracy of VLLMs. The introduced dataset and comprehensive analysis provide valuable insights into the performance of VLLMs under challenging conditions. Our findings highlight the critical need for further advancements in VLLM's robustness to perform better in complex environments. The dataset and code for our experiments will be made publicly available.</description>

      <title>Category-level Text-to-Image Retrieval Improved: Bridging the Domain Gap with Diffusion Models and Vision Encoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work explores text-to-image retrieval for queries that specify or describe a semantic category. While vision-and-language models (VLMs) like CLIP offer a straightforward open-vocabulary solution, they map text and images to distant regions in the representation space, limiting retrieval performance. To bridge this modality gap, we propose a two-step approach. First, we transform the text query into a visual query using a generative diffusion model. Then, we estimate image-to-image similarity with a vision model. Additionally, we introduce an aggregation network that combines multiple generated images into a single vector representation and fuses similarity scores across both query modalities. Our approach leverages advancements in vision encoders, VLMs, and text-to-image generation models. Extensive evaluations show that it consistently outperforms retrieval methods relying solely on text queries. Source code is available at: https://github.com/faixan-khan/cletir</description>

      <title>Safe-LLaVA: A Privacy-Preserving Vision-Language Dataset and Benchmark for Biometric Safety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in vision-language tasks. However, these models often infer and reveal sensitive biometric attributes - such as race, gender, age, body weight, and eye color - even when such information is not explicitly requested. This raises critical concerns, particularly in real-world applications and socially-sensitive domains. Despite increasing awareness, no publicly available dataset or benchmark exists to comprehensively evaluate or mitigate biometric leakage in MLLMs. To address this gap, we introduce PRISM (Privacy-aware Evaluation of Responses in Sensitive Modalities), a new benchmark designed to assess MLLMs on two fronts: (1) refuse biometric-related queries and (2) implicit biometric leakage in general responses while maintaining semantic faithfulness. Further, we conduct a detailed audit of the widely used LLaVA datasets and uncover extensive biometric leakage across pretraining and instruction data. To address this, we present Safe-LLaVA dataset, the first privacy-preserving MLLM training dataset constructed by systematically removing explicit and implicit biometric information from LLaVA dataset. Our evaluations on PRISM reveal biometric leakages across MLLMs for different attributes, highlighting the detailed privacy-violations. We also fine-tune a model on Safe-LLaVA dataset and show that it substantially reduces the biometric leakages. Together, Safe-LLaVA &amp; PRISM set a new standard for privacy-aligned development and evaluation of MLLMs. The Safe-LLaVA dataset &amp; PRISM benchmark are publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/kyh9191/Safe-LLaVA, and the source code is available at https://github.com/Kimyounggun99/Safe-LLaVA.git.</description>

      <title>Beyond Pixels: Introducing Geometric-Semantic World Priors for Video-based Embodied Models via Spatio-temporal Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving human-like reasoning in deep learning models for complex tasks in unknown environments remains a critical challenge in embodied intelligence. While advanced vision-language models (VLMs) excel in static scene understanding, their limitations in spatio-temporal reasoning and adaptation to dynamic, open-set tasks like task-oriented navigation and embodied question answering (EQA) persist due to inadequate modeling of fine-grained spatio-temporal cues and physical world comprehension. To address this, we propose VEME, a novel cross-modal alignment method that enhances generalization in unseen scenes by learning an ego-centric, experience-centered world model. Our framework integrates three key components: (1) a cross-modal alignment framework bridging objects, spatial representations, and visual semantics with spatio-temporal cues to enhance VLM in-context learning; (2) a dynamic, implicit cognitive map activated by world embedding to enable task-relevant geometric-semantic memory recall; and (3) an instruction-based navigation and reasoning framework leveraging embodied priors for long-term planning and efficient exploration. By embedding geometry-aware spatio-temporal episodic experiences, our method significantly improves reasoning and planning in dynamic environments. Experimental results on VSI-Bench and VLN-CE demonstrate 1%-3% accuracy and exploration efficiency improvement compared to traditional approaches.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Deep Learning for Phyllodes Tumor Classification from Ultrasound and Clinical Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phyllodes tumors (PTs) are rare fibroepithelial breast lesions that are difficult to classify preoperatively due to their radiological similarity to benign fibroadenomas. This often leads to unnecessary surgical excisions. To address this, we propose a multimodal deep learning framework that integrates breast ultrasound (BUS) images with structured clinical data to improve diagnostic accuracy. We developed a dual-branch neural network that extracts and fuses features from ultrasound images and patient metadata from 81 subjects with confirmed PTs. Class-aware sampling and subject-stratified 5-fold cross-validation were applied to prevent class imbalance and data leakage. The results show that our proposed multimodal method outperforms unimodal baselines in classifying benign versus borderline/malignant PTs. Among six image encoders, ConvNeXt and ResNet18 achieved the best performance in the multimodal setting, with AUC-ROC scores of 0.9427 and 0.9349, and F1-scores of 0.6720 and 0.7294, respectively. This study demonstrates the potential of multimodal AI to serve as a non-invasive diagnostic tool, reducing unnecessary biopsies and improving clinical decision-making in breast tumor management.</description>

      <title>GraViT: Transfer Learning with Vision Transformers and MLP-Mixer for Strong Gravitational Lens Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational lensing offers a powerful probe into the properties of dark matter and is crucial to infer cosmological parameters. The Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) is predicted to find O(10^5) gravitational lenses over the next decade, demanding automated classifiers. In this work, we introduce GraViT, a PyTorch pipeline for gravitational lens detection that leverages extensive pretraining of state-of-the-art Vision Transformer (ViT) models and MLP-Mixer. We assess the impact of transfer learning on classification performance by examining data quality (source and sample size), model architecture (selection and fine-tuning), training strategies (augmentation, normalization, and optimization), and ensemble predictions. This study reproduces the experiments in a previous systematic comparison of neural networks and provides insights into the detectability of strong gravitational lenses on that common test sample. We fine-tune ten architectures using datasets from HOLISMOKES VI and SuGOHI X, and benchmark them against convolutional baselines, discussing complexity and inference-time analysis.</description>

      <title>A High-Accuracy Fast Hough Transform with Linear-Log-Cubed Computational Complexity for Arbitrary-Shaped Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hough transform (HT) is a fundamental tool across various domains, from classical image analysis to neural networks and tomography. Two key aspects of the algorithms for computing the HT are their computational complexity and accuracy - the latter often defined as the error of approximation of continuous lines by discrete ones within the image region. The fast HT (FHT) algorithms with optimal linearithmic complexity - such as the Brady-Yong algorithm for power-of-two-sized images - are well established. Generalizations like $FHT2DT$ extend this efficiency to arbitrary image sizes, but with reduced accuracy that worsens with scale. Conversely, accurate HT algorithms achieve constant-bounded error but require near-cubic computational cost. This paper introduces $FHT2SP$ algorithm - a fast and highly accurate HT algorithm. It builds on our development of Brady's superpixel concept, extending it to arbitrary shapes beyond the original power-of-two square constraint, and integrates it into the $FHT2DT$ algorithm. With an appropriate choice of the superpixel's size, for an image of shape $w \times h$, the $FHT2SP$ algorithm achieves near-optimal computational complexity $\mathcal{O}(wh \ln^3 w)$, while keeping the approximation error bounded by a constant independent of image size, and controllable via a meta-parameter. We provide theoretical and experimental analyses of the algorithm's complexity and accuracy.</description>

      <title>Generative AI for Industrial Contour Detection: A Language-Guided Vision System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Industrial computer vision systems often struggle with noise, material variability, and uncontrolled imaging conditions, limiting the effectiveness of classical edge detectors and handcrafted pipelines. In this work, we present a language-guided generative vision system for remnant contour detection in manufacturing, designed to achieve CAD-level precision. The system is organized into three stages: data acquisition and preprocessing, contour generation using a conditional GAN, and multimodal contour refinement through vision-language modeling, where standardized prompts are crafted in a human-in-the-loop process and applied through image-text guided synthesis. On proprietary FabTrack datasets, the proposed system improved contour fidelity, enhancing edge continuity and geometric alignment while reducing manual tracing. For the refinement stage, we benchmarked several vision-language models, including Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash, OpenAI's GPT-image-1 integrated within a VLM-guided workflow, and open-source baselines. Under standardized conditions, GPT-image-1 consistently outperformed Gemini 2.0 Flash in both structural accuracy and perceptual quality. These findings demonstrate the promise of VLM-guided generative workflows for advancing industrial computer vision beyond the limitations of classical pipelines.</description>

      <title>Language-Aware Information Maximization for Transductive Few-Shot CLIP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transductive few-shot learning has triggered an abundant literature focusing on vision-only models, but is still at a nascent stage within the recent context of foundational vision-language models (VLMs). Only a few recent methods addressed the problem, pointing to the potential of tranduction in VLMs and to the need for VLM-tailored methods. Building on this momentum, we leverage information-theoretic concepts and recent progress in parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), developing a highly competitive transductive few-shot CLIP method. Specifically, we introduce a novel Language-aware Information MaximizatiOn (LIMO) loss integrating three complementary terms: (i) the mutual information between the vision inputs and the textual class descriptions; (ii) a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence penalizing deviation of the network's probabilistic outputs from the text-driven zero-shot predictions; and (iii) a standard cross-entropy loss based on the labeled shots. Furthermore, we challenge the commonly followed fine-tuning practices in the context of transductive few-shot learning, and explore PEFT strategies, completely overlooked in this context. Surprisingly, we observe substantial boosts in performances, which points to the potential of adapting a subset of the model's parameters in the transductive few-shot setting. We report comprehensive evaluations, which show that LIMO outperforms the very recent transductive few-shot CLIP methods by a large margin and yields significant gains over the best-performing inductive methods.

      <title>MorphGen: Morphology-Guided Representation Learning for Robust Single-Domain Generalization in Histopathological Cancer Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Domain generalization in computational histopathology is hindered by heterogeneity in whole slide images (WSIs), caused by variations in tissue preparation, staining, and imaging conditions across institutions. Unlike machine learning systems, pathologists rely on domain-invariant morphological cues such as nuclear atypia (enlargement, irregular contours, hyperchromasia, chromatin texture, spatial disorganization), structural atypia (abnormal architecture and gland formation), and overall morphological atypia that remain diagnostic across diverse settings. Motivated by this, we hypothesize that explicitly modeling biologically robust nuclear morphology and spatial organization will enable the learning of cancer representations that are resilient to domain shifts. We propose MorphGen (Morphology-Guided Generalization), a method that integrates histopathology images, augmentations, and nuclear segmentation masks within a supervised contrastive learning framework. By aligning latent representations of images and nuclear masks, MorphGen prioritizes diagnostic features such as nuclear and morphological atypia and spatial organization over staining artifacts and domain-specific features. To further enhance out-of-distribution robustness, we incorporate stochastic weight averaging (SWA), steering optimization toward flatter minima. Attention map analyses revealed that MorphGen primarily relies on nuclear morphology, cellular composition, and spatial cell organization within tumors or normal regions for final classification. Finally, we demonstrate resilience of the learned representations to image corruptions (such as staining artifacts) and adversarial attacks, showcasing not only OOD generalization but also addressing critical vulnerabilities in current deep learning systems for digital pathology.

      <title>Towards Adaptive Visual Token Pruning for Large Multimodal Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have achieved significant success across various tasks. These models usually encode visual inputs into dense token sequences, which are then concatenated with textual tokens and jointly processed by a language model. However, the increased token count substantially raises computational and memory costs during inference. Token pruning has emerged as a promising approach to address this issue. Existing token pruning methods often rely on costly calibration or suboptimal importance metrics, leading to redundant retained tokens. In this paper, we analyze the redundancy differences between visual and textual tokens and propose pruning exclusively on visual tokens. Based on this, we propose a visual token pruning strategy that explicitly preserves both cross-modal alignment and intra-modal informational diversity. We introduce a mutual information-based token pruning strategy that removes visual tokens semantically misaligned with textual tokens, effectively preserving the alignment between the visual and textual modalities. To further improve the representational quality of the retained tokens, we additionally prune redundant visual tokens by maximizing the expected pairwise distances in the embedding space, which is solved efficiently with a greedy algorithm. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method maintains strong performance while reducing tokens by 88.9% on models such as LLaVA-1.5-7B and LLaVA-NEXT-7B, resulting in a 56.7% improvement in inference speed.</description>

      <title>CryptoFace: End-to-End Encrypted Face Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Face recognition is central to many authentication, security, and personalized applications. Yet, it suffers from significant privacy risks, particularly arising from unauthorized access to sensitive biometric data. This paper introduces CryptoFace, the first end-to-end encrypted face recognition system with fully homomorphic encryption (FHE). It enables secure processing of facial data across all stages of a face-recognition process--feature extraction, storage, and matching--without exposing raw images or features. We introduce a mixture of shallow patch convolutional networks to support higher-dimensional tensors via patch-based processing while reducing the multiplicative depth and, thus, inference latency. Parallel FHE evaluation of these networks ensures near-resolution-independent latency. On standard face recognition benchmarks, CryptoFace significantly accelerates inference and increases verification accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art FHE neural networks adapted for face recognition. CryptoFace will facilitate secure face recognition systems requiring robust and provable security. The code is available at https://github.com/human-analysis/CryptoFace.</description>

      <title>LUT-Fuse: Towards Extremely Fast Infrared and Visible Image Fusion via Distillation to Learnable Look-Up Tables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current advanced research on infrared and visible image fusion primarily focuses on improving fusion performance, often neglecting the applicability on real-time fusion devices. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that towards extremely fast fusion via distillation to learnable lookup tables specifically designed for image fusion, termed as LUT-Fuse. Firstly, we develop a look-up table structure that utilizing low-order approximation encoding and high-level joint contextual scene encoding, which is well-suited for multi-modal fusion. Moreover, given the lack of ground truth in multi-modal image fusion, we naturally proposed the efficient LUT distillation strategy instead of traditional quantization LUT methods. By integrating the performance of the multi-modal fusion network (MM-Net) into the MM-LUT model, our method achieves significant breakthroughs in efficiency and performance. It typically requires less than one-tenth of the time compared to the current lightweight SOTA fusion algorithms, ensuring high operational speed across various scenarios, even in low-power mobile devices. Extensive experiments validate the superiority, reliability, and stability of our fusion approach. The code is available at https://github.com/zyb5/LUT-Fuse.</description>

      <title>Target-Oriented Single Domain Generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep models trained on a single source domain often fail catastrophically under distribution shifts, a critical challenge in Single Domain Generalization (SDG). While existing methods focus on augmenting source data or learning invariant features, they neglect a readily available resource: textual descriptions of the target deployment environment. We propose Target-Oriented Single Domain Generalization (TO-SDG), a novel problem setup that leverages the textual description of the target domain, without requiring any target data, to guide model generalization. To address TO-SDG, we introduce Spectral TARget Alignment (STAR), a lightweight module that injects target semantics into source features by exploiting visual-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP. STAR uses a target-anchored subspace derived from the text embedding of the target description to recenter image features toward the deployment domain, then utilizes spectral projection to retain directions aligned with target cues while discarding source-specific noise. Moreover, we use a vision-language distillation to align backbone features with VLM's semantic geometry. STAR further employs feature-space Mixup to ensure smooth transitions between source and target-oriented representations. Experiments across various image classification and object detection benchmarks demonstrate STAR's superiority. This work establishes that minimal textual metadata, which is a practical and often overlooked resource, significantly enhances generalization under severe data constraints, opening new avenues for deploying robust models in target environments with unseen data.</description>

      <title>AQFusionNet: Multimodal Deep Learning for Air Quality Index Prediction with Imagery and Sensor Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Air pollution monitoring in resource-constrained regions remains challenging due to sparse sensor deployment and limited infrastructure. This work introduces AQFusionNet, a multimodal deep learning framework for robust Air Quality Index (AQI) prediction. The framework integrates ground-level atmospheric imagery with pollutant concentration data using lightweight CNN backbones (MobileNetV2, ResNet18, EfficientNet-B0). Visual and sensor features are combined through semantically aligned embedding spaces, enabling accurate and efficient prediction. Experiments on more than 8,000 samples from India and Nepal demonstrate that AQFusionNet consistently outperforms unimodal baselines, achieving up to 92.02% classification accuracy and an RMSE of 7.70 with the EfficientNet-B0 backbone. The model delivers an 18.5% improvement over single-modality approaches while maintaining low computational overhead, making it suitable for deployment on edge devices. AQFusionNet provides a scalable and practical solution for AQI monitoring in infrastructure-limited environments, offering robust predictive capability even under partial sensor availability.</description>

      <title>Iterative Low-rank Network for Hyperspectral Image Denoising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) denoising is a crucial preprocessing step for subsequent tasks. The clean HSI usually reside in a low-dimensional subspace, which can be captured by low-rank and sparse representation, known as the physical prior of HSI. It is generally challenging to adequately use such physical properties for effective denoising while preserving image details. This paper introduces a novel iterative low-rank network (ILRNet) to address these challenges. ILRNet integrates the strengths of model-driven and data-driven approaches by embedding a rank minimization module (RMM) within a U-Net architecture. This module transforms feature maps into the wavelet domain and applies singular value thresholding (SVT) to the low-frequency components during the forward pass, leveraging the spectral low-rankness of HSIs in the feature domain. The parameter, closely related to the hyperparameter of the singular vector thresholding algorithm, is adaptively learned from the data, allowing for flexible and effective capture of low-rankness across different scenarios. Additionally, ILRNet features an iterative refinement process that adaptively combines intermediate denoised HSIs with noisy inputs. This manner ensures progressive enhancement and superior preservation of image details. Experimental results demonstrate that ILRNet achieves state-of-the-art performance in both synthetic and real-world noise removal tasks.</description>

      <title>SurgLLM: A Versatile Large Multimodal Model with Spatial Focus and Temporal Awareness for Surgical Video Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surgical video understanding is crucial for facilitating Computer-Assisted Surgery (CAS) systems. Despite significant progress in existing studies, two major limitations persist, including inadequate visual content perception and insufficient temporal awareness in surgical videos, and hinder the development of versatile CAS solutions. In this work, we propose the SurgLLM framework, an effective large multimodal model tailored for versatile surgical video understanding tasks with enhanced spatial focus and temporal awareness. Specifically, to empower the spatial focus of surgical videos, we first devise Surgical Context-aware Multimodal Pretraining (Surg-Pretrain) for the video encoder of SurgLLM, by performing instrument-centric Masked Video Reconstruction (MV-Recon) and subsequent multimodal alignment. To incorporate surgical temporal knowledge into SurgLLM, we further propose Temporal-aware Multimodal Tuning (TM-Tuning) to enhance temporal reasoning with interleaved multimodal embeddings. Moreover, to accommodate various understanding tasks of surgical videos without conflicts, we devise a Surgical Task Dynamic Ensemble to efficiently triage a query with optimal learnable parameters in our SurgLLM. Extensive experiments performed on diverse surgical video understanding tasks, including captioning, general VQA, and temporal VQA, demonstrate significant improvements over the state-of-the-art approaches, validating the effectiveness of our SurgLLM in versatile surgical video understanding.

      <title>A Multimodal Head and Neck Cancer Dataset for AI-Driven Precision Oncology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe a publicly available multimodal dataset of annotated Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography (PET/CT) studies for head and neck cancer research. The dataset includes 1123 FDG-PET/CT studies from patients with histologically confirmed head and neck cancer, acquired from 10 international medical centers. All examinations consisted of co-registered PET/CT scans with varying acquisition protocols, reflecting real-world clinical diversity across institutions. Primary gross tumor volumes (GTVp) and involved lymph nodes (GTVn) were manually segmented by experienced radiation oncologists and radiologists following standardized guidelines and quality control measures. We provide anonymized NifTi files of all studies, along with expert-annotated segmentation masks, radiotherapy dose distribution for a subset of patients, and comprehensive clinical metadata. This metadata includes TNM staging, HPV status, demographics (age and gender), long-term follow-up outcomes, survival times, censoring indicators, and treatment information. We demonstrate how this dataset can be used for three key clinical tasks: automated tumor segmentation, recurrence-free survival prediction, and HPV status classification, providing benchmark results using state-of-the-art deep learning models, including UNet, SegResNet, and multimodal prognostic frameworks.</description>

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved impressive advances, yet object hallucination remains a persistent challenge. Existing methods, based on the flawed assumption that omission and fabrication hallucinations share a common cause, often reduce omissions only to trigger more fabrications. In this work, we overturn this view by demonstrating that omission hallucinations arise from insufficient confidence when mapping perceived visual features to linguistic expressions, whereas fabrication hallucinations result from spurious associations within the cross-modal representation space due to statistical biases in the training corpus. Building on findings from visual attention intervention experiments, we propose the Visual-Semantic Attention Potential Field, a conceptual framework that reveals how the model constructs visual evidence to infer the presence or absence of objects. Leveraging this insight, we introduce Visual Potential Field Calibration (VPFC), a plug-and-play hallucination mitigation method that effectively reduces omission hallucinations without introducing additional fabrication hallucinations. Our findings reveal a critical oversight in current object hallucination research and chart new directions for developing more robust and balanced hallucination mitigation strategies.</description>

      <title>Activation Steering Meets Preference Optimization: Defense Against Jailbreaks in Vision Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in integrating visual and textual information for understanding and reasoning, but remain highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks. While activation steering has emerged as a promising defence, existing approaches often rely on task-specific contrastive prompts to extract harmful directions, which exhibit suboptimal performance and can degrade visual grounding performance. To address these limitations, we propose \textit{Sequence-Level Preference Optimization} for VLM (\textit{SPO-VLM}), a novel two-stage defense framework that combines activation-level intervention with policy-level optimization to enhance model robustness. In \textit{Stage I}, we compute adaptive layer-specific steering vectors from diverse data sources, enabling generalized suppression of harmful behaviors during inference. In \textit{Stage II}, we refine these steering vectors through a sequence-level preference optimization process. This stage integrates automated toxicity assessment, as well as visual-consistency rewards based on caption-image alignment, to achieve safe and semantically grounded text generation. The two-stage structure of SPO-VLM balances efficiency and effectiveness by combining a lightweight mitigation foundation in Stage I with deeper policy refinement in Stage II. Extensive experiments shown SPO-VLM enhances safety against attacks via activation steering and preference optimization, while maintaining strong performance on benign tasks without compromising visual understanding capabilities. We will release our code, model weights, and evaluation toolkit to support reproducibility and future research. \textcolor{red}{Warning: This paper may contain examples of offensive or harmful text and images.}</description>

      <title>Adaptive Point-Prompt Tuning: Fine-Tuning Heterogeneous Foundation Models for 3D Point Cloud Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategies for foundation models in 1D textual and 2D visual analysis have demonstrated remarkable efficacy. However, due to the scarcity of point cloud data, pre-training large 3D models remains a challenging task. While many efforts have been made to apply pre-trained visual models to 3D domains through "high-to-low" mapping, these approaches often lead to the loss of spatial geometries and lack a generalizable framework for adapting any modality to 3D. This paper, therefore, attempts to directly leverage point features to calibrate the heterogeneous foundation model of any modality for 3D point cloud analysis. Specifically, we propose the Adaptive Point-Prompt Tuning (APPT) method, which fine-tunes pre-trained models with a modest number of parameters, enabling direct point cloud processing without heterogeneous mappings. We convert raw point clouds into point embeddings by aggregating local geometry to capture spatial features followed by linear layers to ensure seamless utilization of frozen pre-trained models. Given the inherent disorder of point clouds, in contrast to the structured nature of images and language, we employ a permutation-invariant feature to capture the relative positions of point embeddings, thereby obtaining point tokens enriched with location information to optimize self-attention mechanisms. To calibrate self-attention across source domains of any modality to 3D and reduce computational overhead, we introduce a prompt generator that shares weights with the point embedding module, dynamically producing point-prompts without adding additional parameters. These prompts are then concatenated into a frozen foundation model, providing rich global structural information and compensating for the lack of structural context in the heterogeneous data.</description>

      <title>NoiseCutMix: A Novel Data Augmentation Approach by Mixing Estimated Noise in Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we propose a novel data augmentation method that introduces the concept of CutMix into the generation process of diffusion models, thereby exploiting both the ability of diffusion models to generate natural and high-resolution images and the characteristic of CutMix, which combines features from two classes to create diverse augmented data. Representative data augmentation methods for combining images from multiple classes include CutMix and MixUp. However, techniques like CutMix often result in unnatural boundaries between the two images due to contextual differences. Therefore, in this study, we propose a method, called NoiseCutMix, to achieve natural, high-resolution image generation featuring the fused characteristics of two classes by partially combining the estimated noise corresponding to two different classes in a diffusion model. In the classification experiments, we verified the effectiveness of the proposed method by comparing it with conventional data augmentation techniques that combine multiple classes, random image generation using Stable Diffusion, and combinations of these methods.

      <title>Domain Adaptation-Based Crossmodal Knowledge Distillation for 3D Semantic Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic segmentation of 3D LiDAR data plays a pivotal role in autonomous driving. Traditional approaches rely on extensive annotated data for point cloud analysis, incurring high costs and time investments. In contrast, realworld image datasets offer abundant availability and substantial scale. To mitigate the burden of annotating 3D LiDAR point clouds, we propose two crossmodal knowledge distillation methods: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation Knowledge Distillation (UDAKD) and Feature and Semantic-based Knowledge Distillation (FSKD). Leveraging readily available spatio-temporally synchronized data from cameras and LiDARs in autonomous driving scenarios, we directly apply a pretrained 2D image model to unlabeled 2D data. Through crossmodal knowledge distillation with known 2D-3D correspondence, we actively align the output of the 3D network with the corresponding points of the 2D network, thereby obviating the necessity for 3D annotations. Our focus is on preserving modality-general information while filtering out modality-specific details during crossmodal distillation. To achieve this, we deploy self-calibrated convolution on 3D point clouds as the foundation of our domain adaptation module. Rigorous experimentation validates the effectiveness of our proposed methods, consistently surpassing the performance of state-of-the-art approaches in the field.</description>

      <title>Visually Grounded Narratives: Reducing Cognitive Burden in Researcher-Participant Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Narrative inquiry has been one of the prominent application domains for the analysis of human experience, aiming to know more about the complexity of human society. However, researchers are often required to transform various forms of data into coherent hand-drafted narratives in storied form throughout narrative analysis, which brings an immense burden of data analysis. Participants, too, are expected to engage in member checking and presentation of these narrative products, which involves reviewing and responding to large volumes of documents. Given the dual burden and the need for more efficient and participant-friendly approaches to narrative making and representation, we made a first attempt: (i) a new paradigm is proposed, NAME, as the initial attempt to push the field of narrative inquiry. Name is able to transfer research documents into coherent story images, alleviating the cognitive burden of interpreting extensive text-based materials during member checking for both researchers and participants. (ii) We develop an actor location and shape module to facilitate plausible image generation. (iii) We have designed a set of robust evaluation metrics comprising three key dimensions to objectively measure the perceptual quality and narrative consistency of generated characters. Our approach consistently demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across different data partitioning schemes. Remarkably, while the baseline relies on the full 100% of the available data, our method requires only 0.96% yet still reduces the FID score from 195 to 152. Under identical data volumes, our method delivers substantial improvements: for the 70:30 split, the FID score decreases from 175 to 152, and for the 95:5 split, it is nearly halved from 96 to 49. Furthermore, the proposed model achieves a score of 3.62 on the newly introduced metric, surpassing the baseline score of 2.66.</description>

      <title>HERO-VQL: Hierarchical, Egocentric and Robust Visual Query Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we tackle the egocentric visual query localization (VQL), where a model should localize the query object in a long-form egocentric video. Frequent and abrupt viewpoint changes in egocentric videos cause significant object appearance variations and partial occlusions, making it difficult for existing methods to achieve accurate localization. To tackle these challenges, we introduce Hierarchical, Egocentric and RObust Visual Query Localization (HERO-VQL), a novel method inspired by human cognitive process in object recognition. We propose i) Top-down Attention Guidance (TAG) and ii) Egocentric Augmentation based Consistency Training (EgoACT). Top-down Attention Guidance refines the attention mechanism by leveraging the class token for high-level context and principal component score maps for fine-grained localization. To enhance learning in diverse and challenging matching scenarios, EgoAug enhances query diversity by replacing the query with a randomly selected corresponding object from groundtruth annotations and simulates extreme viewpoint changes by reordering video frames. Additionally, CT loss enforces stable object localization across different augmentation scenarios. Extensive experiments on VQ2D dataset validate that HERO-VQL effectively handles egocentric challenges, significantly outperforming baselines.</description>

      <title>Double-Constraint Diffusion Model with Nuclear Regularization for Ultra-low-dose PET Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra-low-dose positron emission tomography (PET) reconstruction holds significant potential for reducing patient radiation exposure and shortening examination times. However, it may also lead to increased noise and reduced imaging detail, which could decrease the image quality. In this study, we present a Double-Constraint Diffusion Model (DCDM), which freezes the weights of a pre-trained diffusion model and injects a trainable double-constraint controller into the encoding architecture, greatly reducing the number of trainable parameters for ultra-low-dose PET reconstruction. Unlike full fine-tuning models, DCDM can adapt to different dose levels without retraining all model parameters, thereby improving reconstruction flexibility. Specifically, the two constraint modules, named the Nuclear Transformer Constraint (NTC) and the Encoding Nexus Constraint (ENC), serve to refine the pre-trained diffusion model. The NTC leverages the nuclear norm as an approximation for matrix rank minimization, integrates the low-rank property into the Transformer architecture, and enables efficient information extraction from low-dose images and conversion into compressed feature representations in the latent space. Subsequently, the ENC utilizes these compressed feature representations to encode and control the pre-trained diffusion model, ultimately obtaining reconstructed PET images in the pixel space. In clinical reconstruction, the compressed feature representations from NTC help select the most suitable ENC for efficient unknown low-dose PET reconstruction. Experiments conducted on the UDPET public dataset and the Clinical dataset demonstrated that DCDM outperforms state-of-the-art methods on known dose reduction factors (DRF) and generalizes well to unknown DRF scenarios, proving valuable even at ultra-low dose levels, such as 1% of the full dose.</description>

      <title>DAOVI: Distortion-Aware Omnidirectional Video Inpainting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Omnidirectional videos that capture the entire surroundings are employed in a variety of fields such as VR applications and remote sensing. However, their wide field of view often causes unwanted objects to appear in the videos. This problem can be addressed by video inpainting, which enables the natural removal of such objects while preserving both spatial and temporal consistency. Nevertheless, most existing methods assume processing ordinary videos with a narrow field of view and do not tackle the distortion in equirectangular projection of omnidirectional videos. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel deep learning model for omnidirectional video inpainting, called Distortion-Aware Omnidirectional Video Inpainting (DAOVI). DAOVI introduces a module that evaluates temporal motion information in the image space considering geodesic distance, as well as a depth-aware feature propagation module in the feature space that is designed to address the geometric distortion inherent to omnidirectional videos. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing methods both quantitatively and qualitatively.</description>

      <title>DevilSight: Augmenting Monocular Human Avatar Reconstruction through a Virtual Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel framework to reconstruct human avatars from monocular videos. Recent approaches have struggled either to capture the fine-grained dynamic details from the input or to generate plausible details at novel viewpoints, which mainly stem from the limited representational capacity of the avatar model and insufficient observational data. To overcome these challenges, we propose to leverage the advanced video generative model, Human4DiT, to generate the human motions from alternative perspective as an additional supervision signal. This approach not only enriches the details in previously unseen regions but also effectively regularizes the avatar representation to mitigate artifacts. Furthermore, we introduce two complementary strategies to enhance video generation: To ensure consistent reproduction of human motion, we inject the physical identity into the model through video fine-tuning. For higher-resolution outputs with finer details, a patch-based denoising algorithm is employed. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms recent state-of-the-art approaches and validate the effectiveness of our proposed strategies.</description>

      <title>LightVLM: Acceleraing Large Multimodal Models with Pyramid Token Merging and KV Cache Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce LightVLM, a simple but effective method that can be seamlessly deployed upon existing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to greatly accelerate the inference process in a training-free manner. We divide the inference procedure of VLMs into two stages, i.e., encoding and decoding, and propose to simultaneously accelerate VLMs in both stages to largely improve model efficiency. During encoding, we propose pyramid token merging to reduce tokens of different LLM layers in a hierarchical manner by finally only keeping a few dominant tokens to achieve high efficiency. During decoding, aimed at reducing the high latency of outputting long sequences, we propose KV Cache compression to remove unnecessary caches to increase the network throughput. Experimental results show that LightVLM successfully retains 100% performance when only preserving 35% image tokens, and maintains around 98% performance when keeping only 3% image tokens. LightVLM could 2.02$\times$ the network throughput and reduce the prefilling time by 3.65$\times$. LightVLM also makes large VLMs faster again by enabling a heavy model (e.g., InternVL2.5 26B) to infer faster than significantly smaller models (e.g., InternVL2.5 8B), hopefully facilitating the real-world deployment. When generating long text sequences (e.g., 4096 tokens), LightVLM could reduce the inference time by 3.21$\times$, largely outperforming existing methods.</description>

      <title>Mixture of Global and Local Experts with Diffusion Transformer for Controllable Face Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controllable face generation poses critical challenges in generative modeling due to the intricate balance required between semantic controllability and photorealism. While existing approaches struggle with disentangling semantic controls from generation pipelines, we revisit the architectural potential of Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) through the lens of expert specialization. This paper introduces Face-MoGLE, a novel framework featuring: (1) Semantic-decoupled latent modeling through mask-conditioned space factorization, enabling precise attribute manipulation; (2) A mixture of global and local experts that captures holistic structure and region-level semantics for fine-grained controllability; (3) A dynamic gating network producing time-dependent coefficients that evolve with diffusion steps and spatial locations. Face-MoGLE provides a powerful and flexible solution for high-quality, controllable face generation, with strong potential in generative modeling and security applications. Extensive experiments demonstrate its effectiveness in multimodal and monomodal face generation settings and its robust zero-shot generalization capability.

      <title>SemaMIL: Semantic Reordering with Retrieval-Guided State Space Modeling for Whole Slide Image Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiple instance learning (MIL) has become the leading approach for extracting discriminative features from whole slide images (WSIs) in computational pathology. Attention-based MIL methods can identify key patches but tend to overlook contextual relationships. Transformer models are able to model interactions but require quadratic computational cost and are prone to overfitting. State space models (SSMs) offer linear complexity, yet shuffling patch order disrupts histological meaning and reduces interpretability. In this work, we introduce SemaMIL, which integrates Semantic Reordering (SR), an adaptive method that clusters and arranges semantically similar patches in sequence through a reversible permutation, with a Semantic-guided Retrieval State Space Module (SRSM) that chooses a representative subset of queries to adjust state space parameters for improved global modeling. Evaluation on four WSI subtype datasets shows that, compared to strong baselines, SemaMIL achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with fewer FLOPs and parameters.</description>

      <title>Stage-wise Adaptive Label Distribution for Facial Age Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Label ambiguity poses a significant challenge in age estimation tasks. Most existing methods address this issue by modeling correlations between adjacent age groups through label distribution learning. However, they often overlook the varying degrees of ambiguity present across different age stages. In this paper, we propose a Stage-wise Adaptive Label Distribution Learning (SA-LDL) algorithm, which leverages the observation -- revealed through our analysis of embedding similarities between an anchor and all other ages -- that label ambiguity exhibits clear stage-wise patterns. By jointly employing stage-wise adaptive variance modeling and weighted loss function, SA-LDL effectively captures the complex and structured nature of label ambiguity, leading to more accurate and robust age estimation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SA-LDL achieves competitive performance, with MAE of 1.74 and 2.15 on the MORPH-II and FG-NET datasets.</description>

      <title>Encoder-Only Image Registration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning-based techniques have significantly improved the accuracy and speed of deformable image registration. However, challenges such as reducing computational complexity and handling large deformations persist. To address these challenges, we analyze how convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) influence registration performance using the Horn-Schunck optical flow equation. Supported by prior studies and our empirical experiments, we observe that ConvNets play two key roles in registration: linearizing local intensities and harmonizing global contrast variations. Based on these insights, we propose the Encoder-Only Image Registration (EOIR) framework, designed to achieve a better accuracy-efficiency trade-off. EOIR separates feature learning from flow estimation, employing only a 3-layer ConvNet for feature extraction and a set of 3-layer flow estimators to construct a Laplacian feature pyramid, progressively composing diffeomorphic deformations under a large-deformation model. Results on five datasets across different modalities and anatomical regions demonstrate EOIR's effectiveness, achieving superior accuracy-efficiency and accuracy-smoothness trade-offs. With comparable accuracy, EOIR provides better efficiency and smoothness, and vice versa. The source code of EOIR will be publicly available on https://github.com/XiangChen1994/EOIR.</description>

      <title>Exploring Decision-Making Capabilities of LLM Agents: An Experimental Study on Jump-Jump Game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Jump-Jump game, as a simple yet challenging casual game, provides an ideal testing environment for studying LLM decision-making capabilities. The game requires players to precisely control jumping force based on current position and target platform distance, involving multiple cognitive aspects including spatial reasoning, physical modeling, and strategic planning. It illustrates the basic gameplay mechanics of the Jump-Jump game, where the player character (red circle) must jump across platforms with appropriate force to maximize score.</description>

      <title>VideoRewardBench: Comprehensive Evaluation of Multimodal Reward Models for Video Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal reward models (MRMs) play a crucial role in the training, inference, and evaluation of Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) by assessing response quality. However, existing benchmarks for evaluating MRMs in the video domain suffer from a limited number and diversity of questions, a lack of comprehensive evaluation dimensions, and inadequate evaluation of diverse types of MRMs. To address these gaps, we introduce VideoRewardBench, the first comprehensive benchmark covering four core aspects of video understanding: perception, knowledge, reasoning, and safety. Through our AI-assisted data pipeline, we curate a high-quality preference dataset of 1,563 annotated samples, including 1,482 unique videos and 1,559 distinct questions--15 times the number found in the most question-rich prior benchmark. Each sample is a triplet consisting of a video-text prompt, a chosen response, and a rejected response. We also conduct a comprehensive evaluation across 28 multimodal reward models spanning three categories: generative, discriminative, and semi-scalar. Results show that even the top-performing model GPT-4o achieves only 57.0% overall accuracy, and the state-of-the-art open-source model Qwen2.5-VL-72B reaches merely 53.3%. Our analysis further reveals three key insights: (i) MRMs trained with reinforcement learning (RL) do not necessarily exhibit stronger cross-modal generalization than those trained without RL; (ii) except for discriminative MRMs, other types of MRMs across varying model capacities can benefit from inference-time scaling; and (iii) variations in input video frame count have different effects on different types of MRMs. We believe VideoRewardBench offers a challenging and valuable benchmark for advancing the evaluation and development of MRMs in the video domain.</description>

      <title>Multi-Focused Video Group Activities Hashing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the explosive growth of video data in various complex scenarios, quickly retrieving group activities has become an urgent problem. However, many tasks can only retrieve videos focusing on an entire video, not the activity granularity. To solve this problem, we propose a new STVH (spatiotemporal interleaved video hashing) technique for the first time. Through a unified framework, the STVH simultaneously models individual object dynamics and group interactions, capturing the spatiotemporal evolution on both group visual features and positional features. Moreover, in real-life video retrieval scenarios, it may sometimes require activity features, while at other times, it may require visual features of objects. We then further propose a novel M-STVH (multi-focused spatiotemporal video hashing) as an enhanced version to handle this difficult task. The advanced method incorporates hierarchical feature integration through multi-focused representation learning, allowing the model to jointly focus on activity semantics features and object visual features. We conducted comparative experiments on publicly available datasets, and both STVH and M-STVH can achieve excellent results.</description>

      <title>TRUST: Token-dRiven Ultrasound Style Transfer for Cross-Device Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrasound images acquired from different devices exhibit diverse styles, resulting in decreased performance of downstream tasks. To mitigate the style gap, unpaired image-to-image (UI2I) translation methods aim to transfer images from a source domain, corresponding to new device acquisitions, to a target domain where a frozen task model has been trained for downstream applications. However, existing UI2I methods have not explicitly considered filtering the most relevant style features, which may result in translated images misaligned with the needs of downstream tasks. In this work, we propose TRUST, a token-driven dual-stream framework that preserves source content while transferring the common style of the target domain, ensuring that content and style remain unblended. Given multiple styles in the target domain, we introduce a Token-dRiven (TR) module that operates from two perspectives: (1) a data view--selecting "suitable" target tokens corresponding to each source token, and (2) a model view--identifying ``optimal" target tokens for the downstream model, guided by a behavior mirror loss. Additionally, we inject auxiliary prompts into the source encoder to match content representation with downstream behavior. Experimental results on ultrasound datasets demonstrate that TRUST outperforms existing UI2I methods in both visual quality and downstream task performance.</description>

      <title>Make me an Expert: Distilling from Generalist Black-Box Models into Specialized Models for Semantic Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rise of Artificial Intelligence as a Service (AIaaS) democratizes access to pre-trained models via Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), but also raises a fundamental question: how can local models be effectively trained using black-box models that do not expose their weights, training data, or logits, a constraint in which current domain adaptation paradigms are impractical ? To address this challenge, we introduce the Black-Box Distillation (B2D) setting, which enables local model adaptation under realistic constraints: (1) the API model is open-vocabulary and trained on large-scale general-purpose data, and (2) access is limited to one-hot predictions only. We identify that open-vocabulary models exhibit significant sensitivity to input resolution, with different object classes being segmented optimally at different scales, a limitation termed the "curse of resolution". Our method, ATtention-Guided sCaler (ATGC), addresses this challenge by leveraging DINOv2 attention maps to dynamically select optimal scales for black-box model inference. ATGC scores the attention maps with entropy to identify informative scales for pseudo-labelling, enabling effective distillation. Experiments demonstrate substantial improvements under black-box supervision across multiple datasets while requiring only one-hot API predictions. Our code is available at https://github.com/yasserben/ATGC.</description>

      <title>Learning Yourself: Class-Incremental Semantic Segmentation with Language-Inspired Bootstrapped Disentanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Class-Incremental Semantic Segmentation (CISS) requires continuous learning of newly introduced classes while retaining knowledge of past classes. By abstracting mainstream methods into two stages (visual feature extraction and prototype-feature matching), we identify a more fundamental challenge termed catastrophic semantic entanglement. This phenomenon involves Prototype-Feature Entanglement caused by semantic misalignment during the incremental process, and Background-Increment Entanglement due to dynamic data evolution. Existing techniques, which rely on visual feature learning without sufficient cues to distinguish targets, introduce significant noise and errors. To address these issues, we introduce a Language-inspired Bootstrapped Disentanglement framework (LBD). We leverage the prior class semantics of pre-trained visual-language models (e.g., CLIP) to guide the model in autonomously disentangling features through Language-guided Prototypical Disentanglement and Manifold Mutual Background Disentanglement. The former guides the disentangling of new prototypes by treating hand-crafted text features as topological templates, while the latter employs multiple learnable prototypes and mask-pooling-based supervision for background-incremental class disentanglement. By incorporating soft prompt tuning and encoder adaptation modifications, we further bridge the capability gap of CLIP between dense and sparse tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance on both Pascal VOC and ADE20k, particularly in multi-step scenarios.</description>

      <title>A Modality-agnostic Multi-task Foundation Model for Human Brain Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent learning-based approaches have made astonishing advances in calibrated medical imaging like computerized tomography (CT), yet they struggle to generalize in uncalibrated modalities -- notably magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, where performance is highly sensitive to the differences in MR contrast, resolution, and orientation. This prevents broad applicability to diverse real-world clinical protocols. Here we introduce BrainFM, a modality-agnostic, multi-task vision foundation model for human brain imaging. With the proposed "mild-to-severe" intra-subject generation and "real-synth" mix-up training strategy, BrainFM is resilient to the appearance of acquired images (e.g., modality, contrast, deformation, resolution, artifacts), and can be directly applied to five fundamental brain imaging tasks, including image synthesis for CT and T1w/T2w/FLAIR MRI, anatomy segmentation, scalp-to-cortical distance, bias field estimation, and registration. We evaluate the efficacy of BrainFM on eleven public datasets, and demonstrate its robustness and effectiveness across all tasks and input modalities.

      <title>C-DiffDet+: Fusing Global Scene Context with Generative Denoising for High-Fidelity Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fine-grained object detection in challenging visual domains, such as vehicle damage assessment, presents a formidable challenge even for human experts to resolve reliably. While DiffusionDet has advanced the state-of-the-art through conditional denoising diffusion, its performance remains limited by local feature conditioning in context-dependent scenarios. We address this fundamental limitation by introducing Context-Aware Fusion (CAF), which leverages cross-attention mechanisms to integrate global scene context with local proposal features directly. The global context is generated using a separate dedicated encoder that captures comprehensive environmental information, enabling each object proposal to attend to scene-level understanding. Our framework significantly enhances the generative detection paradigm by enabling each object proposal to attend to comprehensive environmental information. Experimental results demonstrate an improvement over state-of-the-art models on the CarDD benchmark, establishing new performance benchmarks for context-aware object detection in fine-grained domains</description>

      <title>DGL-RSIS: Decoupling Global Spatial Context and Local Class Semantics for Training-Free Remote Sensing Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of vision language models (VLMs) has bridged vision and language, enabling joint multimodal understanding beyond traditional visual-only deep learning models. However, transferring VLMs from the natural image domain to remote sensing (RS) segmentation remains challenging due to the limited category diversity in RS datasets and the domain gap between natural and RS imagery. Here, we propose a training-free framework, DGL-RSIS, that decouples visual and textual inputs, performing visual-language alignment at both the local semantic and global contextual levels through tailored strategies. Specifically, we first introduce a global-local decoupling (GLD) module, where text inputs are divided into local class nouns and global modifiers using natural language processing (NLP) techniques; image inputs are partitioned into a set of class-agnostic mask proposals via unsupervised mask proposal networks. Second, visual and textual features are aligned at local scale, through a novel context-aware cropping strategy for extracting image patches with proper boundaries and introducing RS-specific knowledge to enrich the text inputs. By matching the enhanced text features with mask-guided visual features, we enable the mask classification, supporting open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS). Third, at the global scale, we propose a Cross-Scale Grad-CAM module to refine Grad-CAM maps using contextual information from global modifiers. A subsequent mask selection module integrates pixel-level Grad-CAM activations into the mask-level segmentation output, such that accurate and interpretable alignment can be realized across global and local dimensions for referring expression segmentation (RES).</description>

      <title>Towards Methane Detection Onboard Satellites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Methane is a potent greenhouse gas and a major driver of climate change, making its timely detection critical for effective mitigation. Machine learning (ML) deployed onboard satellites can enable rapid detection while reducing downlink costs, supporting faster response systems. Conventional methane detection methods often rely on image processing techniques, such as orthorectification to correct geometric distortions and matched filters to enhance plume signals. We introduce a novel approach that bypasses these preprocessing steps by using \textit{unorthorectified} data (UnorthoDOS). We find that ML models trained on this dataset achieve performance comparable to those trained on orthorectified data. Moreover, we also train models on an orthorectified dataset, showing that they can outperform the matched filter baseline (mag1c). We release model checkpoints and two ML-ready datasets comprising orthorectified and unorthorectified hyperspectral images from the Earth Surface Mineral Dust Source Investigation (EMIT) sensor at https://huggingface.co/datasets/SpaceML/UnorthoDOS , along with code at https://github.com/spaceml-org/plume-hunter.</description>

      <title>MV-SSM: Multi-View State Space Modeling for 3D Human Pose Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While significant progress has been made in single-view 3D human pose estimation, multi-view 3D human pose estimation remains challenging, particularly in terms of generalizing to new camera configurations. Existing attention-based transformers often struggle to accurately model the spatial arrangement of keypoints, especially in occluded scenarios. Additionally, they tend to overfit specific camera arrangements and visual scenes from training data, resulting in substantial performance drops in new settings. In this study, we introduce a novel Multi-View State Space Modeling framework, named MV-SSM, for robustly estimating 3D human keypoints. We explicitly model the joint spatial sequence at two distinct levels: the feature level from multi-view images and the person keypoint level. We propose a Projective State Space (PSS) block to learn a generalized representation of joint spatial arrangements using state space modeling. Moreover, we modify Mamba's traditional scanning into an effective Grid Token-guided Bidirectional Scanning (GTBS), which is integral to the PSS block. Multiple experiments demonstrate that MV-SSM achieves strong generalization, outperforming state-of-the-art methods: +10.8 on AP25 (+24%) on the challenging three-camera setting in CMU Panoptic, +7.0 on AP25 (+13%) on varying camera arrangements, and +15.3 PCP (+38%) on Campus A1 in cross-dataset evaluations.

Abstract: Ensuring fairness and robustness in machine learning models remains a challenge, particularly under domain shifts. We present Face4FairShifts, a large-scale facial image benchmark designed to systematically evaluate fairness-aware learning and domain generalization. The dataset includes 100,000 images across four visually distinct domains with 39 annotations within 14 attributes covering demographic and facial features. Through extensive experiments, we analyze model performance under distribution shifts and identify significant gaps. Our findings emphasize the limitations of existing related datasets and the need for more effective fairness-aware domain adaptation techniques. Face4FairShifts provides a comprehensive testbed for advancing equitable and reliable AI systems. The dataset is available online at https://meviuslab.github.io/Face4FairShifts/.</description>

      <title>Automatic Identification and Description of Jewelry Through Computer Vision and Neural Networks for Translators and Interpreters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying jewelry pieces presents a significant challenge due to the wide range of styles and designs. Currently, precise descriptions are typically limited to industry experts. However, translators and interpreters often require a comprehensive understanding of these items. In this study, we introduce an innovative approach to automatically identify and describe jewelry using neural networks. This method enables translators and interpreters to quickly access accurate information, aiding in resolving queries and gaining essential knowledge about jewelry. Our model operates at three distinct levels of description, employing computer vision techniques and image captioning to emulate expert analysis of accessories. The key innovation involves generating natural language descriptions of jewelry across three hierarchical levels, capturing nuanced details of each piece. Different image captioning architectures are utilized to detect jewels in images and generate descriptions with varying levels of detail. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in recognizing diverse types of jewelry, we assembled a comprehensive database of accessory images. The evaluation process involved comparing various image captioning architectures, focusing particularly on the encoder decoder model, crucial for generating descriptive captions. After thorough evaluation, our final model achieved a captioning accuracy exceeding 90 per cent.</description>

      <title>Fusion to Enhance: Fusion Visual Encoder to Enhance Multimodal Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made significant progress in bridging visual perception with high-level textual reasoning. However, they face a fundamental contradiction: while excelling at complex semantic understanding, these models often fail at basic visual tasks that require precise detail perception. This deficiency primarily stems from the prevalent architectural reliance on a single vision encoder optimized for high-level semantic alignment, which inherently sacrifices the ability to capture fine-grained visual information. To address this issue, we introduce Fusion to Enhance (FtZ), a novel vision tower framework. FtZ moves beyond the single-encoder design by innovatively composing a semantically powerful anchor encoder with a perception-rich augmenting encoder via a lightweight Multi-Head Cross-Attention mechanism. Experimental results demonstrate that on several challenging benchmarks demanding fine-grained visual understanding, such as TextVQA, POPE, MMMU, MME and MM-Vet, our FtZ model significantly outperforms baselines that use only a single encoder or existing feature fusion methods. This work proves that composing heterogeneous expert encoders is an efficient and effective path to overcoming the visual perception bottleneck in current MLLMs, offering a new design paradigm for building next-generation AI systems with stronger perceptual capabilities.</description>

      <title>ER-LoRA: Effective-Rank Guided Adaptation for Weather-Generalized Depth Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monocular depth estimation under adverse weather conditions (e.g.\ rain, fog, snow, and nighttime) remains highly challenging due to the lack of reliable ground truth and the difficulty of learning from unlabeled real-world data. Existing methods often rely on synthetic adverse data with pseudo-labels, which suffer from domain gaps, or employ self-supervised learning, which violates photometric assumptions in adverse scenarios. In this work, we propose to achieve weather--generalized depth estimation by Parameter--Efficient Fine--Tuning (PEFT) of Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), using only a small amount of high--visibility (normal) data. While PEFT has shown strong performance in semantic tasks such as segmentation, it remains underexplored for geometry--centric tasks like depth estimation -- especially in terms of balancing effective adaptation with the preservation of pretrained knowledge. To this end, we introduce the Selecting--Tuning--Maintaining (STM) strategy, which structurally decomposes the pretrained weights of VFMs based on two kinds of effective ranks (entropy--rank and stable--rank). In the tuning phase, we adaptively select the proper rank number as well as the task--aware singular directions for initialization, based on the entropy--rank and full--tuned weight; while in the maintaining stage, we enforce a principal direction regularization based on the stable--rank. This design guarantees flexible task adaptation while preserving the strong generalization capability of the pretrained VFM. Extensive experiments on four real--world benchmarks across diverse weather conditions demonstrate that STM not only outperforms existing PEFT methods and full fine--tuning but also surpasses methods trained with adverse synthetic data, and even the depth foundation model</description>

      <title>LLaVA-Critic-R1: Your Critic Model is Secretly a Strong Policy Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In vision-language modeling, critic models are typically trained to evaluate outputs -- assigning scalar scores or pairwise preferences -- rather than to generate responses. This separation from policy models, which produce the responses, is so entrenched that critics are rarely considered for direct policy use. In this work, we challenge this convention. We propose to reorganize preference-labeled critic datasets into verifiable training signals and perform reinforcement learning directly on a base generative model, producing LLaVA-Critic-R1, a multimodal critic trained to optimize preference judgments while retaining full generation ability. Surprisingly, LLaVA-Critic-R1 emerges not only as a top-performing critic but also as a competitive policy model -- matching or surpassing specialized reasoning VLMs trained with in-domain data across 26 visual reasoning and understanding benchmarks, with an average gain of +5.7% over its base model (Qwen-2.5-VL-7B). Extending this approach to existing strong reasoning VLMs yields LLaVA-Critic-R1+, which further advances policy performance without sacrificing critic quality, achieving a SoTA performance of 71.9 on MMMU at the 7B scale. Finally, we show that the enhanced critic ability benefits inference: applying self-critique at test time yields an average +13.8% improvement on five representative reasoning tasks without additional training. Our results reveal that RL training on critic data can produce a unified model excelling at both evaluation and generation, offering a simple path toward scalable, self-improving multimodal systems.</description>

      <title>CSFMamba: Cross State Fusion Mamba Operator for Multimodal Remote Sensing Image Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal fusion has made great progress in the field of remote sensing image classification due to its ability to exploit the complementary spatial-spectral information. Deep learning methods such as CNN and Transformer have been widely used in these domains. State Space Models recently highlighted that prior methods suffer from quadratic computational complexity. As a result, modeling longer-range dependencies of spatial-spectral features imposes an overwhelming burden on the network. Mamba solves this problem by incorporating time-varying parameters into ordinary SSM and performing hardware optimization, but it cannot perform feature fusion directly. In order to make full use of Mamba's low computational burden and explore the potential of internal structure in multimodal feature fusion, we propose Cross State Fusion Mamba (CSFMamba) Network. Specifically, we first design the preprocessing module of remote sensing image information for the needs of Mamba structure, and combine it with CNN to extract multi-layer features. Secondly, a cross-state module based on Mamba operator is creatively designed to fully fuse the feature of the two modalities. The advantages of Mamba and CNN are combined by designing a more powerful backbone. We capture the fusion relationship between HSI and LiDAR modalities with stronger full-image understanding. The experimental results on two datasets of MUUFL and Houston2018 show that the proposed method outperforms the experimental results of Transformer under the premise of reducing the network training burden.</description>

      <title>CascadeFormer: A Family of Two-stage Cascading Transformers for Skeleton-based Human Action Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Skeleton-based human action recognition leverages sequences of human joint coordinates to identify actions performed in videos. Owing to the intrinsic spatiotemporal structure of skeleton data, Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have been the dominant architecture in this field. However, recent advances in transformer models and masked pretraining frameworks open new avenues for representation learning. In this work, we propose CascadeFormer, a family of two-stage cascading transformers for skeleton-based human action recognition. Our framework consists of a masked pretraining stage to learn generalizable skeleton representations, followed by a cascading fine-tuning stage tailored for discriminative action classification. We evaluate CascadeFormer across three benchmark datasets (Penn Action N-UCLA, and NTU RGB+D 60), achieving competitive performance on all tasks. To promote reproducibility, we release our code and model checkpoints.</description>

      <title>Prompt the Unseen: Evaluating Visual-Language Alignment Beyond Supervision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) combine a vision encoder and a large language model (LLM) through alignment training, showing strong performance on multimodal tasks. A central component in this architecture is the projection layer, which maps visual features into the LLM's embedding space. Despite its importance, its ability to generalize to unseen visual concepts has not been systematically evaluated. To address this, we propose a benchmark for evaluating projection-layer generalization. We adapt object detection datasets (rich in fine-grained annotations) into a prompting format and design train/test splits with disjoint label sets, enabling precise control over seen and unseen concept separation. Experimental results show that the projection layer retains about 79 to 88 percent of the performance on unseen classes compared to seen ones across various settings, suggesting a non-trivial level of generalization even without explicit alignment supervision on those concepts. We further analyze this behavior through a mechanistic interpretability lens. Our findings indicate that the feed-forward network in the projection layer functions like a key-value memory, processing seen and unseen tokens in similar ways. This study introduces a new evaluation framework for alignment generalization and highlights the potential for efficient VLM training with limited aligned data.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Fairness in Skin Lesion Classification for Medical Diagnosis Using Prune Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have significantly improved the accuracy of skin lesion classification models, supporting medical diagnoses and promoting equitable healthcare. However, concerns remain about potential biases related to skin color, which can impact diagnostic outcomes. Ensuring fairness is challenging due to difficulties in classifying skin tones, high computational demands, and the complexity of objectively verifying fairness. To address these challenges, we propose a fairness algorithm for skin lesion classification that overcomes the challenges associated with achieving diagnostic fairness across varying skin tones. By calculating the skewness of the feature map in the convolution layer of the VGG (Visual Geometry Group) network and the patches and the heads of the Vision Transformer, our method reduces unnecessary channels related to skin tone, focusing instead on the lesion area. This approach lowers computational costs and mitigates bias without relying on conventional statistical methods. It potentially reduces model size while maintaining fairness, making it more practical for real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Causal Interpretation of Sparse Autoencoder Features in Vision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding what sparse auto-encoder (SAE) features in vision transformers truly represent is usually done by inspecting the patches where a feature's activation is highest. However, self-attention mixes information across the entire image, so an activated patch often co-occurs with-but does not cause-the feature's firing. We propose Causal Feature Explanation (CaFE), which leverages Effective Receptive Field (ERF). We consider each activation of an SAE feature to be a target and apply input-attribution methods to identify the image patches that causally drive that activation. Across CLIP-ViT features, ERF maps frequently diverge from naive activation maps, revealing hidden context dependencies (e.g., a "roaring face" feature that requires the co-occurrence of eyes and nose, rather than merely an open mouth). Patch insertion tests confirm that CaFE more effectively recovers or suppresses feature activations than activation-ranked patches. Our results show that CaFE yields more faithful and semantically precise explanations of vision-SAE features, highlighting the risk of misinterpretation when relying solely on activation location.</description>

      <title>EVENT-Retriever: Event-Aware Multimodal Image Retrieval for Realistic Captions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Event-based image retrieval from free-form captions presents a significant challenge: models must understand not only visual features but also latent event semantics, context, and real-world knowledge. Conventional vision-language retrieval approaches often fall short when captions describe abstract events, implicit causality, temporal context, or contain long, complex narratives. To tackle these issues, we introduce a multi-stage retrieval framework combining dense article retrieval, event-aware language model reranking, and efficient image collection, followed by caption-guided semantic matching and rank-aware selection. We leverage Qwen3 for article search, Qwen3-Reranker for contextual alignment, and Qwen2-VL for precise image scoring. To further enhance performance and robustness, we fuse outputs from multiple configurations using Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF). Our system achieves the top-1 score on the private test set of Track 2 in the EVENTA 2025 Grand Challenge, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining language-based reasoning and multimodal retrieval for complex, real-world image understanding. The code is available at https://github.com/vdkhoi20/EVENT-Retriever.</description>

      <title>Multi-Level CLS Token Fusion for Contrastive Learning in Endoscopy Image Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a unified vision-language framework tailored for ENT endoscopy image analysis that simultaneously tackles three clinically-relevant tasks: image classification, image-to-image retrieval, and text-to-image retrieval. Unlike conventional CNN-based pipelines that struggle to capture cross-modal semantics, our approach leverages the CLIP ViT-B/16 backbone and enhances it through Low-Rank Adaptation, multi-level CLS token aggregation, and spherical feature interpolation. These components collectively enable efficient fine-tuning on limited medical data while improving representation diversity and semantic alignment across modalities. To bridge the gap between visual inputs and textual diagnostic context, we introduce class-specific natural language prompts that guide the image encoder through a joint training objective combining supervised classification with contrastive learning. We validated our framework through participation in the ACM MM'25 ENTRep Grand Challenge, achieving 95% accuracy and F1-score in classification, Recall@1 of 0.93 and 0.92 for image-to-image and text-to-image retrieval respectively, and MRR scores of 0.97 and 0.96. Ablation studies demonstrated the incremental benefits of each architectural component, validating the effectiveness of our design for robust multimodal medical understanding in low-resource clinical settings.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing popularity of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has intensified the need for effective copyright protection. Current 3DGS watermarking methods rely on computationally expensive fine-tuning procedures for each predefined message. We propose the first generalizable watermarking framework that enables efficient protection of Splatter Image-based 3DGS models through a single forward pass. We introduce GaussianBridge that transforms unstructured 3D Gaussians into Splatter Image format, enabling direct neural processing for arbitrary message embedding. To ensure imperceptibility, we design a Gaussian-Uncertainty-Perceptual heatmap prediction strategy for preserving visual quality. For robust message recovery, we develop a dense segmentation-based extraction mechanism that maintains reliable extraction even when watermarked objects occupy minimal regions in rendered views.

      <title>No More Sibling Rivalry: Debiasing Human-Object Interaction Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detection transformers have been applied to human-object interaction (HOI) detection, enhancing the localization and recognition of human-action-object triplets in images. Despite remarkable progress, this study identifies a critical issue-"Toxic Siblings" bias-which hinders the interaction decoder's learning, as numerous similar yet distinct HOI triplets interfere with and even compete against each other both input side and output side to the interaction decoder. This bias arises from high confusion among sibling triplets/categories, where increased similarity paradoxically reduces precision, as one's gain comes at the expense of its toxic sibling's decline. To address this, we propose two novel debiasing learning objectives-"contrastive-then-calibration" and "merge-then-split"-targeting the input and output perspectives, respectively. The former samples sibling-like incorrect HOI triplets and reconstructs them into correct ones, guided by strong positional priors. The latter first learns shared features among sibling categories to distinguish them from other groups, then explicitly refines intra-group differentiation to preserve uniqueness. Experiments show that we significantly outperform both the baseline (+9.18% mAP on HICO-Det) and the state-of-the-art (+3.59% mAP) across various settings.</description>

      <title>InterPose: Learning to Generate Human-Object Interactions from Large-Scale Web Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human motion generation has shown great advances thanks to the recent diffusion models trained on large-scale motion capture data. Most of existing works, however, currently target animation of isolated people in empty scenes. Meanwhile, synthesizing realistic human-object interactions in complex 3D scenes remains a critical challenge in computer graphics and robotics. One obstacle towards generating versatile high-fidelity human-object interactions is the lack of large-scale datasets with diverse object manipulations. Indeed, existing motion capture data is typically restricted to single people and manipulations of limited sets of objects. To address this issue, we propose an automatic motion extraction pipeline and use it to collect interaction-rich human motions. Our new dataset InterPose contains 73.8K sequences of 3D human motions and corresponding text captions automatically obtained from 45.8K videos with human-object interactions. We perform extensive experiments and demonstrate InterPose to bring significant improvements to state-of-the-art methods for human motion generation. Moreover, using InterPose we develop an LLM-based agent enabling zero-shot animation of people interacting with diverse objects and scenes.</description>

      <title>Secure and Scalable Face Retrieval via Cancelable Product Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the ubiquity of modern face retrieval systems, their retrieval stage is often outsourced to third-party entities, posing significant risks to user portrait privacy. Although homomorphic encryption (HE) offers strong security guarantees by enabling arithmetic computations in the cipher space, its high computational inefficiency makes it unsuitable for real-time, real-world applications. To address this issue, we propose Cancelable Product Quantization, a highly efficient framework for secure face representation retrieval. Our hierarchical two-stage framework comprises: (i) a high-throughput cancelable PQ indexing module for fast candidate filtering, and (ii) a fine-grained cipher-space retrieval module for final precise face ranking. A tailored protection mechanism is designed to secure the indexing module for cancelable biometric authentication while ensuring efficiency. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves an decent balance between effectiveness, efficiency and security.</description>

      <title>Aligned Anchor Groups Guided Line Segment Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel line segment detector, the Aligned Anchor Groups guided Line Segment Detector (AAGLSD), designed to detect line segments from images with high precision and completeness. The algorithm employs a hierarchical approach to extract candidate pixels with different saliency levels, including regular anchors and aligned anchor groups. AAGLSD initiates from these aligned anchor groups, sequentially linking anchors and updating the currently predicted line segment simultaneously. The final predictions are derived through straightforward validation and merging of adjacent line segments, avoiding complex refinement strategies. AAGLSD is evaluated on various datasets and quantitative experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively extract complete line segments from input images compared to other advanced line segment detectors. The implementation is available at https://github.com/LLiDaBao/AAGLSD.</description>

On the one hand, researchers have been continuously improving the brain decoding framework of visual prostheses by leveraging the powerful image generation capabilities of diffusion models. On the other hand, the brain encoding stage of visual prostheses struggles to generate brain signals with sufficient biological similarity. Although existing works have recognized this problem, the quality of predicted stimuli still remains a critical issue, as existing approaches typically lack supervised signals from real brain responses to validate the biological plausibility of predicted stimuli. To address this issue, we propose a novel image-to-brain framework based on denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) enhanced with cross-attention mechanisms. Our framework consists of two key architectural components: a pre-trained CLIP visual encoder that extracts rich semantic representations from input images, and a cross-attention enhanced U-Net diffusion model that learns to reconstruct biologically plausible brain signals through iterative denoising. Unlike conventional generative models that rely on simple concatenation for conditioning, our cross-attention modules enable dynamic interaction between visual features and brain signal representations, facilitating fine-grained alignment during the generation process. We evaluate our framework on two multimodal datasets (THINGS-EEG2 and THINGS-MEG) to demonstrate its effectiveness in generating biologically plausible brain signals. Moreover, we visualize the training and test M/EEG topographies for all subjects on both datasets to intuitively demonstrate the intra-subject variations and inter-subject variations in M/EEG signals.</description>

      <title>OmniReason: A Temporal-Guided Vision-Language-Action Framework for Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive spatial reasoning capabilities for autonomous driving, yet existing methods predominantly focus on static scene understanding while neglecting the essential temporal dimension of real-world driving scenarios. To address this critical limitation, we propose the OmniReason framework, which establishes robust spatiotemporal reasoning by jointly modeling dynamic 3D environments and their underlying decision-making processes. Our work makes two fundamental advances: (1) We introduce OmniReason-Data, two large-scale vision-language-action (VLA) datasets with dense spatiotemporal annotations and natural language explanations, generated through a novel hallucination-mitigated auto-labeling pipeline that ensures both physical plausibility and temporal coherence; (2) We develop the OmniReason-Agent architecture, which integrates a sparse temporal memory module for persistent scene context modeling and an explanation generator that produces human-interpretable decision rationales, facilitated by our spatiotemporal knowledge distillation approach that effectively captures spatiotemporal causal reasoning patterns. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, where OmniReason-Agent achieves significant improvements in both open-loop planning tasks and visual question answering (VQA) benchmarks, while establishing new capabilities for interpretable, temporally-aware autonomous vehicles operating in complex, dynamic environments.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Iterative RAG for Knowledge Visual Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly advanced multimodal understanding, their performance remains limited on knowledge-intensive visual questions that require external knowledge beyond the image. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a promising solution for providing models with external knowledge, its conventional single-pass framework often fails to gather sufficient knowledge. To overcome this limitation, we propose MI-RAG, a Multimodal Iterative RAG framework that leverages reasoning to enhance retrieval and update reasoning over newly retrieved knowledge across modalities. At each iteration, MI-RAG leverages an accumulated reasoning record to dynamically formulate a multi-query. These queries then drive a joint search across heterogeneous knowledge bases containing both visually-grounded and textual knowledge. The newly acquired knowledge is synthesized into the reasoning record, progressively refining understanding across iterations. Experiments on challenging benchmarks, including Encyclopedic VQA, InfoSeek, and OK-VQA, show that MI-RAG significantly improves both retrieval recall and answer accuracy, establishing a scalable approach for compositional reasoning in knowledge-intensive VQA.</description>

      <title>SWAGSplatting: Semantic-guided Water-scene Augmented Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate 3D reconstruction in underwater environments remains a complex challenge due to issues such as light distortion, turbidity, and limited visibility. AI-based techniques have been applied to address these issues, however, existing methods have yet to fully exploit the potential of AI, particularly in integrating language models with visual processing. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that leverages multimodal cross-knowledge to create semantic-guided 3D Gaussian Splatting for robust and high-fidelity deep-sea scene reconstruction. By embedding an extra semantic feature into each Gaussian primitive and supervised by the CLIP extracted semantic feature, our method enforces semantic and structural awareness throughout the training. The dedicated semantic consistency loss ensures alignment with high-level scene understanding. Besides, we propose a novel stage-wise training strategy, combining coarse-to-fine learning with late-stage parameter refinement, to further enhance both stability and reconstruction quality. Extensive results show that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on SeaThru-NeRF and Submerged3D datasets across three metrics, with an improvement of up to 3.09 dB on average in terms of PSNR, making it a strong candidate for applications in underwater exploration and marine perception.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Contrast Adjustment Module: A Clinically-Inspired Plug-and-Play Approach for Enhanced Fetal Plane Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fetal ultrasound standard plane classification is essential for reliable prenatal diagnosis but faces inherent challenges, including low tissue contrast, boundary ambiguity, and operator-dependent image quality variations. To overcome these limitations, we propose a plug-and-play adaptive contrast adjustment module (ACAM), whose core design is inspired by the clinical practice of doctors adjusting image contrast to obtain clearer and more discriminative structural information. The module employs a shallow texture-sensitive network to predict clinically plausible contrast parameters, transforms input images into multiple contrast-enhanced views through differentiable mapping, and fuses them within downstream classifiers. Validated on a multi-center dataset of 12,400 images across six anatomical categories, the module consistently improves performance across diverse models, with accuracy of lightweight models increasing by 2.02 percent, accuracy of traditional models increasing by 1.29 percent, and accuracy of state-of-the-art models increasing by 1.15 percent. The innovation of the module lies in its content-aware adaptation capability, replacing random preprocessing with physics-informed transformations that align with sonographer workflows while improving robustness to imaging heterogeneity through multi-view fusion. This approach effectively bridges low-level image features with high-level semantics, establishing a new paradigm for medical image analysis under real-world image quality variations.</description>

      <title>Sequential Difference Maximization: Generating Adversarial Examples via Multi-Stage Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient adversarial attack methods are critical for assessing the robustness of computer vision models. In this paper, we reconstruct the optimization objective for generating adversarial examples as "maximizing the difference between the non-true labels' probability upper bound and the true label's probability," and propose a gradient-based attack method termed Sequential Difference Maximization (SDM). SDM establishes a three-layer optimization framework of "cycle-stage-step." The processes between cycles and between iterative steps are respectively identical, while optimization stages differ in terms of loss functions: in the initial stage, the negative probability of the true label is used as the loss function to compress the solution space; in subsequent stages, we introduce the Directional Probability Difference Ratio (DPDR) loss function to gradually increase the non-true labels' probability upper bound by compressing the irrelevant labels' probabilities. Experiments demonstrate that compared with previous SOTA methods, SDM not only exhibits stronger attack performance but also achieves higher attack cost-effectiveness. Additionally, SDM can be combined with adversarial training methods to enhance their defensive effects. The code is available at https://github.com/X-L-Liu/SDM.</description>

      <title>Surface Defect Detection with Gabor Filter Using Reconstruction-Based Blurring U-Net-ViT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel approach to enhance the accuracy and reliability of texture-based surface defect detection using Gabor filters and a blurring U-Net-ViT model. By combining the local feature training of U-Net with the global processing of the Vision Transformer(ViT), the model effectively detects defects across various textures. A Gaussian filter-based loss function removes background noise and highlights defect patterns, while Salt-and-Pepper(SP) masking in the training process reinforces texture-defect boundaries, ensuring robust performance in noisy environments. Gabor filters are applied in post-processing to emphasize defect orientation and frequency characteristics. Parameter optimization, including filter size, sigma, wavelength, gamma, and orientation, maximizes performance across datasets like MVTec-AD, Surface Crack Detection, and Marble Surface Anomaly Dataset, achieving an average Area Under the Curve(AUC) of 0.939. The ablation studies validate that the optimal filter size and noise probability significantly enhance defect detection performance.</description>

      <title>UPGS: Unified Pose-aware Gaussian Splatting for Dynamic Scene Deblurring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic 3D scenes from monocular video has broad applications in AR/VR, robotics, and autonomous navigation, but often fails due to severe motion blur caused by camera and object motion. Existing methods commonly follow a two-step pipeline, where camera poses are first estimated and then 3D Gaussians are optimized. Since blurring artifacts usually undermine pose estimation, pose errors could be accumulated to produce inferior reconstruction results. To address this issue, we introduce a unified optimization framework by incorporating camera poses as learnable parameters complementary to 3DGS attributes for end-to-end optimization. Specifically, we recast camera and object motion as per-primitive SE(3) affine transformations on 3D Gaussians and formulate a unified optimization objective. For stable optimization, we introduce a three-stage training schedule that optimizes camera poses and Gaussians alternatively. Particularly, 3D Gaussians are first trained with poses being fixed, and then poses are optimized with 3D Gaussians being untouched. Finally, all learnable parameters are optimized together. Extensive experiments on the Stereo Blur dataset and challenging real-world sequences demonstrate that our method achieves significant gains in reconstruction quality and pose estimation accuracy over prior dynamic deblurring methods.</description>

      <title>SegDINO: An Efficient Design for Medical and Natural Image Segmentation with DINO-V3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The DINO family of self-supervised vision models has shown remarkable transferability, yet effectively adapting their representations for segmentation remains challenging. Existing approaches often rely on heavy decoders with multi-scale fusion or complex upsampling, which introduce substantial parameter overhead and computational cost. In this work, we propose SegDINO, an efficient segmentation framework that couples a frozen DINOv3 backbone with a lightweight decoder. SegDINO extracts multi-level features from the pretrained encoder, aligns them to a common resolution and channel width, and utilizes a lightweight MLP head to directly predict segmentation masks. This design minimizes trainable parameters while preserving the representational power of foundation features. Extensive experiments across six benchmarks, including three medical datasets (TN3K, Kvasir-SEG, ISIC) and three natural image datasets (MSD, VMD-D, ViSha), demonstrate that SegDINO consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods.

      <title>Satellite Image Utilization for Dehazing with Swin Transformer-Hybrid U-Net and Watershed loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Satellite imagery plays a crucial role in various fields; however, atmospheric interference and haze significantly degrade image clarity and reduce the accuracy of information extraction. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a hybrid dehazing framework that integrates Swin Transformer and U-Net to balance global context learning and local detail restoration, called SUFERNOBWA. The proposed network employs SwinRRDB, a Swin Transformer-based Residual-in-Residual Dense Block, in both the encoder and decoder to effectively extract features. This module enables the joint learning of global contextual information and fine spatial structures, which is crucial for structural preservation in satellite image. Furthermore, we introduce a composite loss function that combines L2 loss, guided loss, and a novel watershed loss, which enhances structural boundary preservation and ensures pixel-level accuracy. This architecture enables robust dehazing under diverse atmospheric conditions while maintaining structural consistency across restored images. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art models on both the RICE and SateHaze1K datasets. Specifically, on the RICE dataset, the proposed approach achieved a PSNR of 33.24 dB and an SSIM of 0.967, which is a significant improvement over existing method. This study provides an effective solution for mitigating atmospheric interference in satellite imagery and highlights its potential applicability across diverse remote sensing applications.</description>

      <title>Look Beyond: Two-Stage Scene View Generation via Panorama and Video Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Novel view synthesis (NVS) from a single image is highly ill-posed due to large unobserved regions, especially for views that deviate significantly from the input. While existing methods focus on consistency between the source and generated views, they often fail to maintain coherence and correct view alignment across long-range or looped trajectories. We propose a model that addresses this by decomposing single-view NVS into a 360-degree scene extrapolation followed by novel view interpolation. This design ensures long-term view and scene consistency by conditioning on keyframes extracted and warped from a generated panoramic representation. In the first stage, a panorama diffusion model learns the scene prior from the input perspective image. Perspective keyframes are then sampled and warped from the panorama and used as anchor frames in a pre-trained video diffusion model, which generates novel views through a proposed spatial noise diffusion process. Compared to prior work, our method produces globally consistent novel views -- even in loop closure scenarios -- while enabling flexible camera control. Experiments on diverse scene datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods in generating coherent views along user-defined trajectories. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/YiGuYT/LookBeyond.</description>

      <title>Quantization Meets OOD: Generalizable Quantization-aware Training from a Flatness Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current quantization-aware training (QAT) methods primarily focus on enhancing the performance of quantized models on in-distribution (I.D) data, while overlooking the potential performance degradation on out-of-distribution (OOD) data. In this paper, we first substantiate this problem through rigorous experiment, showing that QAT can lead to a significant OOD generalization performance degradation. Further, we find the contradiction between the perspective that flatness of loss landscape gives rise to superior OOD generalization and the phenomenon that QAT lead to a sharp loss landscape, can cause the above problem. Therefore, we propose a flatness-oriented QAT method, FQAT, to achieve generalizable QAT. Specifically, i) FQAT introduces a layer-wise freezing mechanism to mitigate the gradient conflict issue between dual optimization objectives (i.e., vanilla QAT and flatness). ii) FQAT proposes an disorder-guided adaptive freezing algorithm to dynamically determines which layers to freeze at each training step, effectively addressing the challenges caused by interference between layers. A gradient disorder metric is designed to help the algorithm identify unstable layers during training. Extensive experiments on influential OOD benchmark demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art baselines under both I.D and OOD image classification tasks.</description>

      <title>Pose as Clinical Prior: Learning Dual Representations for Scoliosis Screening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent AI-based scoliosis screening methods primarily rely on large-scale silhouette datasets, often neglecting clinically relevant postural asymmetries-key indicators in traditional screening. In contrast, pose data provide an intuitive skeletal representation, enhancing clinical interpretability across various medical applications. However, pose-based scoliosis screening remains underexplored due to two main challenges: (1) the scarcity of large-scale, annotated pose datasets; and (2) the discrete and noise-sensitive nature of raw pose coordinates, which hinders the modeling of subtle asymmetries. To address these limitations, we introduce Scoliosis1K-Pose, a 2D human pose annotation set that extends the original Scoliosis1K dataset, comprising 447,900 frames of 2D keypoints from 1,050 adolescents. Building on this dataset, we introduce the Dual Representation Framework (DRF), which integrates a continuous skeleton map to preserve spatial structure with a discrete Postural Asymmetry Vector (PAV) that encodes clinically relevant asymmetry descriptors. A novel PAV-Guided Attention (PGA) module further uses the PAV as clinical prior to direct feature extraction from the skeleton map, focusing on clinically meaningful asymmetries. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DRF achieves state-of-the-art performance. Visualizations further confirm that the model leverages clinical asymmetry cues to guide feature extraction and promote synergy between its dual representations. The dataset and code are publicly available at https://zhouzi180.github.io/Scoliosis1K/.</description>

      <title>Spotlighter: Revisiting Prompt Tuning from a Representative Mining View</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CLIP's success has demonstrated that prompt tuning can achieve robust cross-modal semantic alignment for tasks ranging from open-domain recognition to fine-grained classification. However, redundant or weakly relevant feature components introduce noise and incur unnecessary computational costs. In this work, we propose Spotlighter, a lightweight token-selection framework that simultaneously enhances accuracy and efficiency in prompt tuning. Spotlighter evaluates each visual token's activation from both sample-wise and semantic-wise perspectives and retains only the top-scoring tokens for downstream prediction. A class-specific semantic memory bank of learned prototypes refines this selection, ensuring semantic representativeness and compensating for discarded features. To further prioritize informative signals, we introduce a two-level ranking mechanism that dynamically weights token--prototype interactions. Across 11 few-shot benchmarks, Spotlighter outperforms CLIP by up to 11.19\% in harmonic mean accuracy and achieves up to 0.8K additional FPS, with only 21 extra parameters. These results establish Spotlighter as an effective and scalable baseline for prompt tuning. Code for our method will be available at https://github.com/greatest-gourmet/Spotlighter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-light RAW video denoising is a fundamentally challenging task due to severe signal degradation caused by high sensor gain and short exposure times, which are inherently limited by video frame rate requirements. To address this, we propose DarkVRAI, a novel framework that achieved first place in the AIM 2025 Low-light RAW Video Denoising Challenge. Our method introduces two primary contributions: (1) a successful application of a conditioning scheme for image denoising, which explicitly leverages capture metadata, to video denoising to guide the alignment and denoising processes, and (2) a Burst-Order Selective Scan (BOSS) mechanism that effectively models long-range temporal dependencies within the noisy video sequence. By synergistically combining these components, DarkVRAI demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on a rigorous and realistic benchmark dataset, setting a new standard for low-light video denoising.</description>

      <title>Seeing More, Saying More: Lightweight Language Experts are Dynamic Video Token Compressors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in large video-language models have revolutionized video understanding tasks. However, their efficiency is significantly constrained by processing high volumes of visual tokens. Existing token compression strategies apply a fixed compression ratio, ignoring the variability in semantic density among different video clips. Consequently, this lead to inadequate representation of information-rich clips due to insufficient tokens and unnecessary computation on static or content-poor ones. To address this, we propose LangDC, a Language-aware Dynamic Token Compressor. LangDC leverages a lightweight language model to describe video clips, converting them into soft caption tokens as visual representations. Trained with our proposed semantic density-aware supervision, LangDC aims to 1) cover key visual cues necessary for downstream task reasoning and 2) dynamically adjust compression ratios based on scene richness, reflected by descriptions length. Our design mimics how humans dynamically express what they see: complex scenes (seeing more) elicit more detailed language to convey nuances (saying more), whereas simpler scenes are described with fewer words. Experimental results show that our method reduces FLOPs by 49% compared to VideoGPT+ while maintaining competitive performance. Furthermore, qualitative results demonstrate our approach adaptively adjusts the token compression ratio based on video segment richness.</description>

      <title>Towards Integrating Multi-Spectral Imaging with Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a study of how to integrate color (RGB) and multi-spectral imagery (red, green, red-edge, and near-infrared) into the 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) framework, a state-of-the-art explicit radiance-field-based method for fast and high-fidelity 3D reconstruction from multi-view images. While 3DGS excels on RGB data, naive per-band optimization of additional spectra yields poor reconstructions due to inconsistently appearing geometry in the spectral domain. This problem is prominent, even though the actual geometry is the same, regardless of spectral modality. To investigate this, we evaluate three strategies: 1) Separate per-band reconstruction with no shared structure. 2) Splitting optimization, in which we first optimize RGB geometry, copy it, and then fit each new band to the model by optimizing both geometry and band representation. 3) Joint, in which the modalities are jointly optimized, optionally with an initial RGB-only phase. We showcase through quantitative metrics and qualitative novel-view renderings on multi-spectral datasets the effectiveness of our dedicated optimized Joint strategy, increasing overall spectral reconstruction as well as enhancing RGB results through spectral cross-talk. We therefore suggest integrating multi-spectral data directly into the spherical harmonics color components to compactly model each Gaussian's multi-spectral reflectance. Moreover, our analysis reveals several key trade-offs in when and how to introduce spectral bands during optimization, offering practical insights for robust multi-modal 3DGS reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Weather-Dependent Variations in Driver Gaze Behavior: A Case Study in Rainy Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rainy weather significantly increases the risk of road accidents due to reduced visibility and vehicle traction. Understanding how experienced drivers adapt their visual perception through gaze behavior under such conditions is critical for designing robust driver monitoring systems (DMS) and for informing advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS). This case study investigates the eye gaze behavior of a driver operating the same highway route under both clear and rainy conditions. To this end, gaze behavior was analyzed by a two-step clustering approach: first, clustering gaze points within 10-second intervals, and then aggregating cluster centroids into meta-clusters. This, along with Markov transition matrices and metrics such as fixation duration, gaze elevation, and azimuth distributions, reveals meaningful behavioral shifts. While the overall gaze behavior focused on the road with occasional mirror checks remains consistent, rainy conditions lead to more frequent dashboard glances, longer fixation durations, and higher gaze elevation, indicating increased cognitive focus. These findings offer valuable insight into visual attention patterns under adverse conditions and highlight the potential of leveraging gaze modeling to aid in the design of more robust ADAS and DMS.</description>

      <title>AI-driven Dispensing of Coral Reseeding Devices for Broad-scale Restoration of the Great Barrier Reef</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coral reefs are on the brink of collapse, with climate change, ocean acidification, and pollution leading to a projected 70-90% loss of coral species within the next decade. Restoration efforts are crucial, but their success hinges on introducing automation to upscale efforts. We present automated deployment of coral re-seeding devices powered by artificial intelligence, computer vision, and robotics. Specifically, we perform automated substrate classification, enabling detection of areas of the seafloor suitable for coral growth, thus significantly reducing reliance on human experts and increasing the range and efficiency of restoration. Real-world testing of the algorithms on the Great Barrier Reef leads to deployment accuracy of 77.8%, sub-image patch classification of 89.1%, and real-time model inference at 5.5 frames per second. Further, we present and publicly contribute a large collection of annotated substrate image data to foster future research in this area.</description>

      <title>CompSlider: Compositional Slider for Disentangled Multiple-Attribute Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In text-to-image (T2I) generation, achieving fine-grained control over attributes - such as age or smile - remains challenging, even with detailed text prompts. Slider-based methods offer a solution for precise control of image attributes. Existing approaches typically train individual adapter for each attribute separately, overlooking the entanglement among multiple attributes. As a result, interference occurs among different attributes, preventing precise control of multiple attributes together. To address this challenge, we aim to disentangle multiple attributes in slider-based generation to enbale more reliable and independent attribute manipulation. Our approach, CompSlider, can generate a conditional prior for the T2I foundation model to control multiple attributes simultaneously. Furthermore, we introduce novel disentanglement and structure losses to compose multiple attribute changes while maintaining structural consistency within the image. Since CompSlider operates in the latent space of the conditional prior and does not require retraining the foundation model, it reduces the computational burden for both training and inference. We evaluate our approach on a variety of image attributes and highlight its generality by extending to video generation.</description>

      <title>Seeing through Unclear Glass: Occlusion Removal with One Shot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Images taken through window glass are often degraded by contaminants adhered to the glass surfaces. Such contaminants cause occlusions that attenuate the incoming light and scatter stray light towards the camera. Most of existing deep learning methods for neutralizing the effects of contaminated glasses relied on synthetic training data. Few researchers used real degraded and clean image pairs, but they only considered removing or alleviating the effects of rain drops on glasses. This paper is concerned with the more challenging task of learning the restoration of images taken through glasses contaminated by a wide range of occluders, including muddy water, dirt and other small foreign particles found in reality. To facilitate the learning task we have gone to a great length to acquire real paired images with and without glass contaminants. More importantly, we propose an all-in-one model to neutralize contaminants of different types by utilizing the one-shot test-time adaptation mechanism. It involves a self-supervised auxiliary learning task to update the trained model for the unique occlusion type of each test image. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods quantitatively and qualitatively in cleaning realistic contaminated images, especially the unseen ones.</description>

      <title>A Unified Low-level Foundation Model for Enhancing Pathology Image Quality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foundation models have revolutionized computational pathology by achieving remarkable success in high-level diagnostic tasks, yet the critical challenge of low-level image enhancement remains largely unaddressed. Real-world pathology images frequently suffer from degradations such as noise, blur, and low resolution due to slide preparation artifacts, staining variability, and imaging constraints, while the reliance on physical staining introduces significant costs, delays, and inconsistency. Although existing methods target individual problems like denoising or super-resolution, their task-specific designs lack the versatility to handle the diverse low-level vision challenges encountered in practice. To bridge this gap, we propose the first unified Low-level Pathology Foundation Model (LPFM), capable of enhancing image quality in restoration tasks, including super-resolution, deblurring, and denoising, as well as facilitating image translation tasks like virtual staining (H&amp;E and special stains), all through a single adaptable architecture. Our approach introduces a contrastive pre-trained encoder that learns transferable, stain-invariant feature representations from 190 million unlabeled pathology images, enabling robust identification of degradation patterns. A unified conditional diffusion process dynamically adapts to specific tasks via textual prompts, ensuring precise control over output quality. Trained on a curated dataset of 87,810 whole slied images (WSIs) across 34 tissue types and 5 staining protocols, LPFM demonstrates statistically significant improvements (p&lt;0.01) over state-of-the-art methods in most tasks (56/66), achieving Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) gains of 10-15% for image restoration and Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) improvements of 12-18% for virtual staining.</description>

      <title>SpectMamba: Integrating Frequency and State Space Models for Enhanced Medical Image Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Abnormality detection in medical imaging is a critical task requiring both high efficiency and accuracy to support effective diagnosis. While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformer-based models are widely used, both face intrinsic challenges: CNNs have limited receptive fields, restricting their ability to capture broad contextual information, and Transformers encounter prohibitive computational costs when processing high-resolution medical images. Mamba, a recent innovation in natural language processing, has gained attention for its ability to process long sequences with linear complexity, offering a promising alternative. Building on this foundation, we present SpectMamba, the first Mamba-based architecture designed for medical image detection. A key component of SpectMamba is the Hybrid Spatial-Frequency Attention (HSFA) block, which separately learns high- and low-frequency features. This approach effectively mitigates the loss of high-frequency information caused by frequency bias and correlates frequency-domain features with spatial features, thereby enhancing the model's ability to capture global context. To further improve long-range dependencies, we propose the Visual State-Space Module (VSSM) and introduce a novel Hilbert Curve Scanning technique to strengthen spatial correlations and local dependencies, further optimizing the Mamba framework. Comprehensive experiments show that SpectMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance while being both effective and efficient across various medical image detection tasks.</description>

      <title>Bidirectional Sparse Attention for Faster Video Diffusion Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video diffusion Transformer (DiT) models excel in generative quality but hit major computational bottlenecks when producing high-resolution, long-duration videos. The quadratic complexity of full attention leads to prohibitively high training and inference costs. Full attention inefficiency stems from two key challenges: excessive computation due to the inherent sparsity of Queries and Key-Value pairs, and redundant computation as fixed sparse patterns fail to leverage DiT's dynamic attention. To overcome this limitation, we propose a Bidirectional Sparse Attention (BSA) framework for faster video DiT training, the first to dynamically sparsify both Queries and Key-Value pairs within 3D full attention, thereby substantially improving training and inference efficiency. BSA addresses these issues through two key components. Query sparsity is optimized by selecting the most informative query tokens via semantic similarity and with a dynamic spatial-time training strategy, while KV sparsity is achieved by computing a statistical dynamic threshold to retain only the most salient KV blocks for computation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BSA significantly accelerates DiT training across long sequences, reducing FLOPs by up to 20x and achieving 17.79x faster attention training, while preserving or even surpassing the generative quality of full attention.</description>

      <title>An End-to-End Framework for Video Multi-Person Pose Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video-based human pose estimation models aim to address scenarios that cannot be effectively solved by static image models such as motion blur, out-of-focus and occlusion. Most existing approaches consist of two stages: detecting human instances in each image frame and then using a temporal model for single-person pose estimation. This approach separates the spatial and temporal dimensions and cannot capture the global spatio-temporal context between spatial instances for end-to-end optimization. In addition, it relies on separate detectors and complex post-processing such as RoI cropping and NMS, which reduces the inference efficiency of the video scene. To address the above problems, we propose VEPE (Video End-to-End Pose Estimation), a simple and flexible framework for end-to-end pose estimation in video. The framework utilizes three crucial spatio-temporal Transformer components: the Spatio-Temporal Pose Encoder (STPE), the Spatio-Temporal Deformable Memory Encoder (STDME), and the Spatio-Temporal Pose Decoder (STPD). These components are designed to effectively utilize temporal context for optimizing human body pose estimation. Furthermore, to reduce the mismatch problem during the cross-frame pose query matching process, we propose an instance consistency mechanism, which aims to enhance the consistency and discrepancy of the cross-frame instance query and realize the instance tracking function, which in turn accurately guides the pose query to perform cross-frame matching. Extensive experiments on the Posetrack dataset show that our approach outperforms most two-stage models and improves inference efficiency by 300%.</description>

      <title>PVINet: Point-Voxel Interlaced Network for Point Cloud Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In point cloud compression, the quality of a reconstructed point cloud relies on both the global structure and the local context, with existing methods usually processing global and local information sequentially and lacking communication between these two types of information. In this paper, we propose a point-voxel interlaced network (PVINet), which captures global structural features and local contextual features in parallel and performs interactions at each scale to enhance feature perception efficiency. Specifically, PVINet contains a voxel-based encoder (Ev) for extracting global structural features and a point-based encoder (Ep) that models local contexts centered at each voxel. Particularly, a novel conditional sparse convolution is introduced, which applies point embeddings to dynamically customize kernels for voxel feature extraction, facilitating feature interactions from Ep to Ev. During decoding, a voxel-based decoder employs conditional sparse convolutions to incorporate point embeddings as guidance to reconstruct the point cloud. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that PVINet delivers competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>FICGen: Frequency-Inspired Contextual Disentanglement for Layout-driven Degraded Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Layout-to-image (L2I) generation has exhibited promising results in natural domains, but suffers from limited generative fidelity and weak alignment with user-provided layouts when applied to degraded scenes (i.e., low-light, underwater). We primarily attribute these limitations to the "contextual illusion dilemma" in degraded conditions, where foreground instances are overwhelmed by context-dominant frequency distributions. Motivated by this, our paper proposes a new Frequency-Inspired Contextual Disentanglement Generative (FICGen) paradigm, which seeks to transfer frequency knowledge of degraded images into the latent diffusion space, thereby facilitating the rendering of degraded instances and their surroundings via contextual frequency-aware guidance. To be specific, FICGen consists of two major steps. Firstly, we introduce a learnable dual-query mechanism, each paired with a dedicated frequency resampler, to extract contextual frequency prototypes from pre-collected degraded exemplars in the training set. Secondly, a visual-frequency enhanced attention is employed to inject frequency prototypes into the degraded generation process. To alleviate the contextual illusion and attribute leakage, an instance coherence map is developed to regulate latent-space disentanglement between individual instances and their surroundings, coupled with an adaptive spatial-frequency aggregation module to reconstruct spatial-frequency mixed degraded representations. Extensive experiments on 5 benchmarks involving a variety of degraded scenarios-from severe low-light to mild blur-demonstrate that FICGen consistently surpasses existing L2I methods in terms of generative fidelity, alignment and downstream auxiliary trainability.</description>

      <title>GPSToken: Gaussian Parameterized Spatially-adaptive Tokenization for Image Representation and Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective and efficient tokenization plays an important role in image representation and generation. Conventional methods, constrained by uniform 2D/1D grid tokenization, are inflexible to represent regions with varying shapes and textures and at different locations, limiting their efficacy of feature representation. In this work, we propose $\textbf{GPSToken}$, a novel $\textbf{G}$aussian $\textbf{P}$arameterized $\textbf{S}$patially-adaptive $\textbf{Token}$ization framework, to achieve non-uniform image tokenization by leveraging parametric 2D Gaussians to dynamically model the shape, position, and textures of different image regions. We first employ an entropy-driven algorithm to partition the image into texture-homogeneous regions of variable sizes. Then, we parameterize each region as a 2D Gaussian (mean for position, covariance for shape) coupled with texture features. A specialized transformer is trained to optimize the Gaussian parameters, enabling continuous adaptation of position/shape and content-aware feature extraction. During decoding, Gaussian parameterized tokens are reconstructed into 2D feature maps through a differentiable splatting-based renderer, bridging our adaptive tokenization with standard decoders for end-to-end training. GPSToken disentangles spatial layout (Gaussian parameters) from texture features to enable efficient two-stage generation: structural layout synthesis using lightweight networks, followed by structure-conditioned texture generation. Experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of GPSToken, which achieves rFID and FID scores of 0.65 and 1.50 on image reconstruction and generation tasks using 128 tokens, respectively. Codes and models of GPSToken can be found at $\href{https://github.com/xtudbxk/GPSToken}{https://github.com/xtudbxk/GPSToken}$.</description>

      <title>MetaSSL: A General Heterogeneous Loss for Semi-Supervised Medical Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) is important for reducing the annotation cost for medical image segmentation models. State-of-the-art SSL methods such as Mean Teacher, FixMatch and Cross Pseudo Supervision (CPS) are mainly based on consistency regularization or pseudo-label supervision between a reference prediction and a supervised prediction. Despite the effectiveness, they have overlooked the potential noise in the labeled data, and mainly focus on strategies to generate the reference prediction, while ignoring the heterogeneous values of different unlabeled pixels. We argue that effectively mining the rich information contained by the two predictions in the loss function, instead of the specific strategy to obtain a reference prediction, is more essential for SSL, and propose a universal framework MetaSSL based on a spatially heterogeneous loss that assigns different weights to pixels by simultaneously leveraging the uncertainty and consistency information between the reference and supervised predictions. Specifically, we split the predictions on unlabeled data into four regions with decreasing weights in the loss: Unanimous and Confident (UC), Unanimous and Suspicious (US), Discrepant and Confident (DC), and Discrepant and Suspicious (DS), where an adaptive threshold is proposed to distinguish confident predictions from suspicious ones. The heterogeneous loss is also applied to labeled images for robust learning considering the potential annotation noise. Our method is plug-and-play and general to most existing SSL methods. The experimental results showed that it improved the segmentation performance significantly when integrated with existing SSL frameworks on different datasets.

      <title>MVTrajecter: Multi-View Pedestrian Tracking with Trajectory Motion Cost and Trajectory Appearance Cost</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-View Pedestrian Tracking (MVPT) aims to track pedestrians in the form of a bird's eye view occupancy map from multi-view videos. End-to-end methods that detect and associate pedestrians within one model have shown great progress in MVPT. The motion and appearance information of pedestrians is important for the association, but previous end-to-end MVPT methods rely only on the current and its single adjacent past timestamp, discarding the past trajectories before that. This paper proposes a novel end-to-end MVPT method called Multi-View Trajectory Tracker (MVTrajecter) that utilizes information from multiple timestamps in past trajectories for robust association. MVTrajecter introduces trajectory motion cost and trajectory appearance cost to effectively incorporate motion and appearance information, respectively. These costs calculate which pedestrians at the current and each past timestamp are likely identical based on the information between those timestamps. Even if a current pedestrian could be associated with a false pedestrian at some past timestamp, these costs enable the model to associate that current pedestrian with the correct past trajectory based on other past timestamps. In addition, MVTrajecter effectively captures the relationships between multiple timestamps leveraging the attention mechanism. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of each component in MVTrajecter and show that it outperforms the previous state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Do Video Language Models Really Know Where to Look? Diagnosing Attention Failures in Video Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have led to much progress in video understanding tasks. To avoid the heavy computational cost of processing all frames, these models typically rely on keyframe sampling methods guided by vision-language encoders (\textit{e.g.,} SigLIP). However, it remains unclear whether such encoders can truly identify the most informative frames. In this work, we provide several empirical pieces of evidence revealing that popular vision encoders critically suffer from their limited capability to identify where the MLLM should look inside the video to handle the given textual query appropriately. Our findings suggest that the development of better keyframe identification techniques may be necessary for efficient video MLLMs.</description>

      <title>DynaMind: Reconstructing Dynamic Visual Scenes from EEG by Aligning Temporal Dynamics and Multimodal Semantics to Guided Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconstruction dynamic visual scenes from electroencephalography (EEG) signals remains a primary challenge in brain decoding, limited by the low spatial resolution of EEG, a temporal mismatch between neural recordings and video dynamics, and the insufficient use of semantic information within brain activity. Therefore, existing methods often inadequately resolve both the dynamic coherence and the complex semantic context of the perceived visual stimuli. To overcome these limitations, we introduce DynaMind, a novel framework that reconstructs video by jointly modeling neural dynamics and semantic features via three core modules: a Regional-aware Semantic Mapper (RSM), a Temporal-aware Dynamic Aligner (TDA), and a Dual-Guidance Video Reconstructor (DGVR). The RSM first utilizes a regional-aware encoder to extract multimodal semantic features from EEG signals across distinct brain regions, aggregating them into a unified diffusion prior. In the mean time, the TDA generates a dynamic latent sequence, or blueprint, to enforce temporal consistency between the feature representations and the original neural recordings. Together, guided by the semantic diffusion prior, the DGVR translates the temporal-aware blueprint into a high-fidelity video reconstruction. On the SEED-DV dataset, DynaMind sets a new state-of-the-art (SOTA), boosting reconstructed video accuracies (video- and frame-based) by 12.5 and 10.3 percentage points, respectively. It also achieves a leap in pixel-level quality, showing exceptional visual fidelity and temporal coherence with a 9.4% SSIM improvement and a 19.7% FVMD reduction. This marks a critical advancement, bridging the gap between neural dynamics and high-fidelity visual semantics.</description>

      <title>FocusDPO: Dynamic Preference Optimization for Multi-Subject Personalized Image Generation via Adaptive Focus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-subject personalized image generation aims to synthesize customized images containing multiple specified subjects without requiring test-time optimization. However, achieving fine-grained independent control over multiple subjects remains challenging due to difficulties in preserving subject fidelity and preventing cross-subject attribute leakage. We present FocusDPO, a framework that adaptively identifies focus regions based on dynamic semantic correspondence and supervision image complexity. During training, our method progressively adjusts these focal areas across noise timesteps, implementing a weighted strategy that rewards information-rich patches while penalizing regions with low prediction confidence. The framework dynamically adjusts focus allocation during the DPO process according to the semantic complexity of reference images and establishes robust correspondence mappings between generated and reference subjects. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method substantially enhances the performance of existing pre-trained personalized generation models, achieving state-of-the-art results on both single-subject and multi-subject personalized image synthesis benchmarks. Our method effectively mitigates attribute leakage while preserving superior subject fidelity across diverse generation scenarios, advancing the frontier of controllable multi-subject image synthesis.</description>

      <title>SegAssess: Panoramic quality mapping for robust and transferable unsupervised segmentation assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-quality image segmentation is fundamental to pixel-level geospatial analysis in remote sensing, necessitating robust segmentation quality assessment (SQA), particularly in unsupervised settings lacking ground truth. Although recent deep learning (DL) based unsupervised SQA methods show potential, they often suffer from coarse evaluation granularity, incomplete assessments, and poor transferability. To overcome these limitations, this paper introduces Panoramic Quality Mapping (PQM) as a new paradigm for comprehensive, pixel-wise SQA, and presents SegAssess, a novel deep learning framework realizing this approach. SegAssess distinctively formulates SQA as a fine-grained, four-class panoramic segmentation task, classifying pixels within a segmentation mask under evaluation into true positive (TP), false positive (FP), true negative (TN), and false negative (FN) categories, thereby generating a complete quality map. Leveraging an enhanced Segment Anything Model (SAM) architecture, SegAssess uniquely employs the input mask as a prompt for effective feature integration via cross-attention. Key innovations include an Edge Guided Compaction (EGC) branch with an Aggregated Semantic Filter (ASF) module to refine predictions near challenging object edges, and an Augmented Mixup Sampling (AMS) training strategy integrating multi-source masks to significantly boost cross-domain robustness and zero-shot transferability. Comprehensive experiments across 32 datasets derived from 6 sources demonstrate that SegAssess achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance and exhibits remarkable zero-shot transferability to unseen masks, establishing PQM via SegAssess as a robust and transferable solution for unsupervised SQA.

      <title>PrediTree: A Multi-Temporal Sub-meter Dataset of Multi-Spectral Imagery Aligned With Canopy Height Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present PrediTree, the first comprehensive open-source dataset designed for training and evaluating tree height prediction models at sub-meter resolution. This dataset combines very high-resolution (0.5m) LiDAR-derived canopy height maps, spatially aligned with multi-temporal and multi-spectral imagery, across diverse forest ecosystems in France, totaling 3,141,568 images. PrediTree addresses a critical gap in forest monitoring capabilities by enabling the training of deep learning methods that can predict tree growth based on multiple past observations. %\sout{Initially focused on French forests, PrediTree is designed as an expanding resource with ongoing efforts to incorporate data from other countries. } To make use of this PrediTree dataset, we propose an encoder-decoder framework that requires the multi-temporal multi-spectral imagery and the relative time differences in years between the canopy height map timestamp (target) and each image acquisition date for which this framework predicts the canopy height. The conducted experiments demonstrate that a U-Net architecture trained on the PrediTree dataset provides the highest masked mean squared error of $11.78\%$, outperforming the next-best architecture, ResNet-50, by around $12\%$, and cutting the error of the same experiments but on fewer bands (red, green, blue only), by around $30\%$. This dataset is publicly available on \href{URL}{HuggingFace}, and both processing and training codebases are available on \href{URL}{GitHub}.</description>

      <title>DcMatch: Unsupervised Multi-Shape Matching with Dual-Level Consistency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Establishing point-to-point correspondences across multiple 3D shapes is a fundamental problem in computer vision and graphics. In this paper, we introduce DcMatch, a novel unsupervised learning framework for non-rigid multi-shape matching. Unlike existing methods that learn a canonical embedding from a single shape, our approach leverages a shape graph attention network to capture the underlying manifold structure of the entire shape collection. This enables the construction of a more expressive and robust shared latent space, leading to more consistent shape-to-universe correspondences via a universe predictor. Simultaneously, we represent these correspondences in both the spatial and spectral domains and enforce their alignment in the shared universe space through a novel cycle consistency loss. This dual-level consistency fosters more accurate and coherent mappings. Extensive experiments on several challenging benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches across diverse multi-shape matching scenarios.

      <title>Generalizable Self-supervised Monocular Depth Estimation with Mixture of Low-Rank Experts for Diverse Endoscopic Scenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-supervised monocular depth estimation is a significant task for low-cost and efficient three-dimensional scene perception in endoscopy. The variety of illumination conditions and scene features is still the primary challenge for generalizable depth estimation in endoscopic scenes. In this work, a self-supervised framework is proposed for monocular depth estimation in various endoscopy. Firstly, due to various features in endoscopic scenes with different tissues, a novel block-wise mixture of dynamic low-rank experts is proposed to efficiently finetuning the foundation model for endoscopic depth estimation. In the proposed module, based on the input feature, different experts with a small amount of trainable parameters are adaptively selected for weighted inference, from various mixture of low-rank experts which are allocated based on the training quality of each block. Moreover, a novel self-supervised training framework is proposed to jointly cope with the inconsistency of brightness and reflectance. The proposed method outperform state-of-the-art works on both realistic and simulated endoscopic datasets. Furthermore, the proposed network also achieves the best generalization based on zero-shot depth estimation on diverse endoscopic scenes. The proposed method could contribute to accurate endoscopic perception for minimally invasive measurement and surgery. The code will be released upon acceptance, while the demo video can be found on here: https://endo-gede.netlify.app/.</description>

      <title>Measuring Image-Relation Alignment: Reference-Free Evaluation of VLMs and Synthetic Pre-training for Open-Vocabulary Scene Graph Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scene Graph Generation (SGG) encodes visual relationships between objects in images as graph structures. Thanks to the advances of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), the task of Open-Vocabulary SGG has been recently proposed where models are evaluated on their functionality to learn a wide and diverse range of relations. Current benchmarks in SGG, however, possess a very limited vocabulary, making the evaluation of open-source models inefficient. In this paper, we propose a new reference-free metric to fairly evaluate the open-vocabulary capabilities of VLMs for relation prediction. Another limitation of Open-Vocabulary SGG is the reliance on weakly supervised data of poor quality for pre-training. We also propose a new solution for quickly generating high-quality synthetic data through region-specific prompt tuning of VLMs. Experimental results show that pre-training with this new data split can benefit the generalization capabilities of Open-Voc SGG models.</description>

      <title>PRINTER:Deformation-Aware Adversarial Learning for Virtual IHC Staining with In Situ Fidelity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tumor spatial heterogeneity analysis requires precise correlation between Hematoxylin and Eosin H&amp;E morphology and immunohistochemical (IHC) biomarker expression, yet current methods suffer from spatial misalignment in consecutive sections, severely compromising in situ pathological interpretation. In order to obtain a more accurate virtual staining pattern, We propose PRINTER, a weakly-supervised framework that integrates PRototype-drIven content and staiNing patTERn decoupling and deformation-aware adversarial learning strategies designed to accurately learn IHC staining patterns while preserving H&amp;E staining details. Our approach introduces three key innovations: (1) A prototype-driven staining pattern transfer with explicit content-style decoupling; and (2) A cyclic registration-synthesis framework GapBridge that bridges H&amp;E and IHC domains through deformable structural alignment, where registered features guide cross-modal style transfer while synthesized outputs iteratively refine the registration;(3) Deformation-Aware Adversarial Learning: We propose a training framework where a generator and deformation-aware registration network jointly adversarially optimize a style-focused discriminator. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PRINTER effectively achieves superior performance in preserving H&amp;E staining details and virtual staining fidelity, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Our work provides a robust and scalable solution for virtual staining, advancing the field of computational pathology.</description>

      <title>POINTS-Reader: Distillation-Free Adaptation of Vision-Language Models for Document Conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-quality labeled data is essential for training accurate document conversion models, particularly in domains with complex formats such as tables, formulas, and multi-column text. However, manual annotation is both costly and time-consuming, while automatic labeling using existing models often lacks accuracy in handling such challenging scenarios. Consequently, training student models by distilling outputs from teacher models can significantly limit their performance in real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a fully automated, distillation-free framework comprising two stages for constructing high-quality document extraction datasets and models capable of handling diverse document formats and layouts. In the first stage, we introduce a method for generating large-scale, diverse synthetic data, which enables a model to extract key elements in a unified format with strong initial performance. In the second stage, we present a self-improvement approach that further adapts the model, initially trained on synthetic data, to real-world documents. Specifically, we first use the fine-tuned model to annotate real documents, then apply a suite of filtering strategies to verify annotation quality, and finally retrain the model on the verified dataset. By iteratively repeating this process, we progressively enhance both the model's conversion capabilities and the quality of the generated data. We train a public POINTS-1.5 model to obtain POINTS-Reader, which surpasses many existing public and proprietary models of comparable or larger size. Our model is available at https://github.com/Tencent/POINTS-Reader.</description>

      <title>FantasyHSI: Video-Generation-Centric 4D Human Synthesis In Any Scene through A Graph-based Multi-Agent Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human-Scene Interaction (HSI) seeks to generate realistic human behaviors within complex environments, yet it faces significant challenges in handling long-horizon, high-level tasks and generalizing to unseen scenes. To address these limitations, we introduce FantasyHSI, a novel HSI framework centered on video generation and multi-agent systems that operates without paired data. We model the complex interaction process as a dynamic directed graph, upon which we build a collaborative multi-agent system. This system comprises a scene navigator agent for environmental perception and high-level path planning, and a planning agent that decomposes long-horizon goals into atomic actions. Critically, we introduce a critic agent that establishes a closed-loop feedback mechanism by evaluating the deviation between generated actions and the planned path. This allows for the dynamic correction of trajectory drifts caused by the stochasticity of the generative model, thereby ensuring long-term logical consistency. To enhance the physical realism of the generated motions, we leverage Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to train the action generator, significantly reducing artifacts such as limb distortion and foot-sliding. Extensive experiments on our custom SceneBench benchmark demonstrate that FantasyHSI significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of generalization, long-horizon task completion, and physical realism.

Abstract: Object detection architectures are notoriously difficult to understand, often more so than large language models. While RT-DETRv2 represents an important advance in real-time detection, most existing diagrams do little to clarify how its components actually work and fit together. In this article, we explain the architecture of RT-DETRv2 through a series of eight carefully designed illustrations, moving from the overall pipeline down to critical components such as the encoder, decoder, and multi-scale deformable attention. Our goal is to make the existing one genuinely understandable. By visualizing the flow of tensors and unpacking the logic behind each module, we hope to provide researchers and practitioners with a clearer mental model of how RT-DETRv2 works under the hood.</description>

      <title>Learning Correlation-aware Aleatoric Uncertainty for 3D Hand Pose Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D hand pose estimation is a fundamental task in understanding human hands. However, accurately estimating 3D hand poses remains challenging due to the complex movement of hands, self-similarity, and frequent occlusions. In this work, we address two limitations: the inability of existing 3D hand pose estimation methods to estimate aleatoric (data) uncertainty, and the lack of uncertainty modeling that incorporates joint correlation knowledge, which has not been thoroughly investigated. To this end, we introduce aleatoric uncertainty modeling into the 3D hand pose estimation framework, aiming to achieve a better trade-off between modeling joint correlations and computational efficiency. We propose a novel parameterization that leverages a single linear layer to capture intrinsic correlations among hand joints. This is enabled by formulating the hand joint output space as a probabilistic distribution, allowing the linear layer to capture joint correlations. Our proposed parameterization is used as a task head layer, and can be applied as an add-on module on top of the existing models. Our experiments demonstrate that our parameterization for uncertainty modeling outperforms existing approaches. Furthermore, the 3D hand pose estimation model equipped with our uncertainty head achieves favorable accuracy in 3D hand pose estimation while introducing new uncertainty modeling capability to the model.

      <title>Towards More Diverse and Challenging Pre-training for Point Cloud Learning: Self-Supervised Cross Reconstruction with Decoupled Views</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Point cloud learning, especially in a self-supervised way without manual labels, has gained growing attention in both vision and learning communities due to its potential utility in a wide range of applications. Most existing generative approaches for point cloud self-supervised learning focus on recovering masked points from visible ones within a single view. Recognizing that a two-view pre-training paradigm inherently introduces greater diversity and variance, it may thus enable more challenging and informative pre-training. Inspired by this, we explore the potential of two-view learning in this domain. In this paper, we propose Point-PQAE, a cross-reconstruction generative paradigm that first generates two decoupled point clouds/views and then reconstructs one from the other. To achieve this goal, we develop a crop mechanism for point cloud view generation for the first time and further propose a novel positional encoding to represent the 3D relative position between the two decoupled views. The cross-reconstruction significantly increases the difficulty of pre-training compared to self-reconstruction, which enables our method to surpass previous single-modal self-reconstruction methods in 3D self-supervised learning. Specifically, it outperforms the self-reconstruction baseline (Point-MAE) by 6.5%, 7.0%, and 6.7% in three variants of ScanObjectNN with the Mlp-Linear evaluation protocol.

      <title>ReCap: Event-Aware Image Captioning with Article Retrieval and Semantic Gaussian Normalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image captioning systems often produce generic descriptions that fail to capture event-level semantics which are crucial for applications like news reporting and digital archiving. We present ReCap, a novel pipeline for event-enriched image retrieval and captioning that incorporates broader contextual information from relevant articles to generate narrative-rich, factually grounded captions. Our approach addresses the limitations of standard vision-language models that typically focus on visible content while missing temporal, social, and historical contexts. ReCap comprises three integrated components: (1) a robust two-stage article retrieval system using DINOv2 embeddings with global feature similarity for initial candidate selection followed by patch-level mutual nearest neighbor similarity re-ranking; (2) a context extraction framework that synthesizes information from article summaries, generic captions, and original source metadata; and (3) a large language model-based caption generation system with Semantic Gaussian Normalization to enhance fluency and relevance. Evaluated on the OpenEvents V1 dataset as part of Track 1 in the EVENTA 2025 Grand Challenge, ReCap achieved a strong overall score of 0.54666, ranking 2nd on the private test set. These results highlight ReCap's effectiveness in bridging visual perception with real-world knowledge, offering a practical solution for context-aware image understanding in high-stakes domains.

      <title>Novel Category Discovery with X-Agent Attention for Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) conducts pixel-level classification via text-driven alignment, where the domain discrepancy between base category training and open-vocabulary inference poses challenges in discriminative modeling of latent unseen category. To address this challenge, existing vision-language model (VLM)-based approaches demonstrate commendable performance through pre-trained multi-modal representations. However, the fundamental mechanisms of latent semantic comprehension remain underexplored, making the bottleneck for OVSS. In this work, we initiate a probing experiment to explore distribution patterns and dynamics of latent semantics in VLMs under inductive learning paradigms. Building on these insights, we propose X-Agent, an innovative OVSS framework employing latent semantic-aware ``agent'' to orchestrate cross-modal attention mechanisms, simultaneously optimizing latent semantic dynamic and amplifying its perceptibility. Extensive benchmark evaluations demonstrate that X-Agent achieves state-of-the-art performance while effectively enhancing the latent semantic saliency.</description>

      <title>SAR-NAS: Lightweight SAR Object Detection with Neural Architecture Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) object detection faces significant challenges from speckle noise, small target ambiguities, and on-board computational constraints. While existing approaches predominantly focus on SAR-specific architectural modifications, this paper explores the application of the existing lightweight object detector, i.e., YOLOv10, for SAR object detection and enhances its performance through Neural Architecture Search (NAS). Specifically, we employ NAS to systematically optimize the network structure, especially focusing on the backbone architecture search. By constructing an extensive search space and leveraging evolutionary search, our method identifies a favorable architecture that balances accuracy, parameter efficiency, and computational cost. Notably, this work introduces NAS to SAR object detection for the first time. The experimental results on the large-scale SARDet-100K dataset demonstrate that our optimized model outperforms existing SAR detection methods, achieving superior detection accuracy while maintaining lower computational overhead. We hope this work offers a novel perspective on leveraging NAS for real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Multi-Representation Adapter with Neural Architecture Search for Efficient Range-Doppler Radar Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting objects efficiently from radar sensors has recently become a popular trend due to their robustness against adverse lighting and weather conditions compared with cameras. This paper presents an efficient object detection model for Range-Doppler (RD) radar maps. Specifically, we first represent RD radar maps with multi-representation, i.e., heatmaps and grayscale images, to gather high-level object and fine-grained texture features. Then, we design an additional Adapter branch, an Exchanger Module with two modes, and a Primary-Auxiliary Fusion Module to effectively extract, exchange, and fuse features from the multi-representation inputs, respectively. Furthermore, we construct a supernet with various width and fusion operations in the Adapter branch for the proposed model and employ a One-Shot Neural Architecture Search method to further improve the model's efficiency while maintaining high performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our model obtains favorable accuracy and efficiency trade-off. Moreover, we achieve new state-of-the-art performance on RADDet and CARRADA datasets with mAP@50 of 71.9 and 57.1, respectively.</description>

      <title>Cross-Domain Few-Shot Segmentation via Ordinary Differential Equations over Time Intervals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cross-domain few-shot segmentation (CD-FSS) not only enables the segmentation of unseen categories with very limited samples, but also improves cross-domain generalization ability within the few-shot segmentation framework. Currently, existing CD-FSS studies typically design multiple independent modules to enhance the cross-domain generalization ability of feature representations. However, the independence among these modules hinders the effective flow of knowledge, making it difficult to fully leverage their collective potential. In contrast, this paper proposes an all-in-one module based on ordinary differential equations and Fourier transform, resulting in a structurally concise method--Few-Shot Segmentation over Time Intervals (FSS-TIs). FSS-TIs assumes the existence of an ODE relationship between the spectra (including amplitude and phase spectra) of domain-specific features and domain-agnostic features. This ODE formulation yields an iterative transformation process along a sequence of time intervals, while simultaneously applying affine transformations with randomized perturbations to the spectra. In doing so, the exploration of domain-agnostic feature representation spaces and the simulation of diverse potential target-domain distributions are reformulated as an optimization process over the intrinsic parameters of the ODE. Moreover, we strictly constrain the support-sample selection during target-domain fine-tuning so that it is consistent with the requirements of real-world few-shot segmentation tasks. For evaluation, we introduce five datasets from substantially different domains and define two sets of cross-domain few-shot segmentation tasks to comprehensively analyze the performance of FSS-TIs. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of FSS-TIs over existing CD-FSS methods, and in-depth ablation studies further validate the cross-domain adaptability of FSS-TIs.</description>

      <title>Guided Model-based LiDAR Super-Resolution for Resource-Efficient Automotive scene Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-resolution LiDAR data plays a critical role in 3D semantic segmentation for autonomous driving, but the high cost of advanced sensors limits large-scale deployment. In contrast, low-cost sensors such as 16-channel LiDAR produce sparse point clouds that degrade segmentation accuracy. To overcome this, we introduce the first end-to-end framework that jointly addresses LiDAR super-resolution (SR) and semantic segmentation. The framework employs joint optimization during training, allowing the SR module to incorporate semantic cues and preserve fine details, particularly for smaller object classes. A new SR loss function further directs the network to focus on regions of interest. The proposed lightweight, model-based SR architecture uses significantly fewer parameters than existing LiDAR SR approaches, while remaining easily compatible with segmentation networks. Experiments show that our method achieves segmentation performance comparable to models operating on high-resolution and costly 64-channel LiDAR data.</description>

      <title>Prior-Guided Residual Diffusion: Calibrated and Efficient Medical Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ambiguity in medical image segmentation calls for models that capture full conditional distributions rather than a single point estimate. We present Prior-Guided Residual Diffusion (PGRD), a diffusion-based framework that learns voxel-wise distributions while maintaining strong calibration and practical sampling efficiency. PGRD embeds discrete labels as one-hot targets in a continuous space to align segmentation with diffusion modeling. A coarse prior predictor provides step-wise guidance; the diffusion network then learns the residual to the prior, accelerating convergence and improving calibration. A deep diffusion supervision scheme further stabilizes training by supervising intermediate time steps. Evaluated on representative MRI and CT datasets, PGRD achieves higher Dice scores and lower NLL/ECE values than Bayesian, ensemble, Probabilistic U-Net, and vanilla diffusion baselines, while requiring fewer sampling steps to reach strong performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper tackles two key challenges: detecting small, dense, and overlapping objects (a major hurdle in computer vision) and improving the quality of noisy images, especially those encountered in industrial environments. [1, 2]. Our focus is on evaluating methods built on supervised deep learning. We perform an analysis of these methods, using a newly de- veloped dataset comprising over 10k images and 120k in- stances. By evaluating their performance, accuracy, and com- putational efficiency, we identify the most reliable detection systems and highlight the specific challenges they address in industrial applications. This paper also examines the use of deep learning models to improve image quality in noisy industrial environments. We introduce a lightweight model based on a fully connected convolutional network. Addition- ally, we suggest potential future directions for further enhanc- ing the effectiveness of the model.

      <title>Street-Level Geolocalization Using Multimodal Large Language Models and Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Street-level geolocalization from images is crucial for a wide range of essential applications and services, such as navigation, location-based recommendations, and urban planning. With the growing popularity of social media data and cameras embedded in smartphones, applying traditional computer vision techniques to localize images has become increasingly challenging, yet highly valuable. This paper introduces a novel approach that integrates open-weight and publicly accessible multimodal large language models with retrieval-augmented generation. The method constructs a vector database using the SigLIP encoder on two large-scale datasets (EMP-16 and OSV-5M). Query images are augmented with prompts containing both similar and dissimilar geolocation information retrieved from this database before being processed by the multimodal large language models. Our approach has demonstrated state-of-the-art performance, achieving higher accuracy compared against three widely used benchmark datasets (IM2GPS, IM2GPS3k, and YFCC4k). Importantly, our solution eliminates the need for expensive fine-tuning or retraining and scales seamlessly to incorporate new data sources. The effectiveness of retrieval-augmented generation-based multimodal large language models in geolocation estimation demonstrated by this paper suggests an alternative path to the traditional methods which rely on the training models from scratch, opening new possibilities for more accessible and scalable solutions in GeoAI.</description>

      <title>AgroSense: An Integrated Deep Learning System for Crop Recommendation via Soil Image Analysis and Nutrient Profiling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Meeting the increasing global demand for food security and sustainable farming requires intelligent crop recommendation systems that operate in real time. Traditional soil analysis techniques are often slow, labor-intensive, and not suitable for on-field decision-making. To address these limitations, we introduce AgroSense, a deep-learning framework that integrates soil image classification and nutrient profiling to produce accurate and contextually relevant crop recommendations. AgroSense comprises two main components: a Soil Classification Module, which leverages ResNet-18, EfficientNet-B0, and Vision Transformer architectures to categorize soil types from images; and a Crop Recommendation Module, which employs a Multi-Layer Perceptron, XGBoost, LightGBM, and TabNet to analyze structured soil data, including nutrient levels, pH, and rainfall. We curated a multimodal dataset of 10,000 paired samples drawn from publicly available Kaggle repositories, approximately 50,000 soil images across seven classes, and 25,000 nutrient profiles for experimental evaluation. The fused model achieves 98.0% accuracy, with a precision of 97.8%, a recall of 97.7%, and an F1-score of 96.75%, while RMSE and MAE drop to 0.32 and 0.27, respectively. Ablation studies underscore the critical role of multimodal coupling, and statistical validation via t-tests and ANOVA confirms the significance of our improvements. AgroSense offers a practical, scalable solution for real-time decision support in precision agriculture and paves the way for future lightweight multimodal AI systems in resource-constrained environments.</description>

      <title>M3Ret: Unleashing Zero-shot Multimodal Medical Image Retrieval via Self-Supervision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medical image retrieval is essential for clinical decision-making and translational research, relying on discriminative visual representations. Yet, current methods remain fragmented, relying on separate architectures and training strategies for 2D, 3D, and video-based medical data. This modality-specific design hampers scalability and inhibits the development of unified representations. To enable unified learning, we curate a large-scale hybrid-modality dataset comprising 867,653 medical imaging samples, including 2D X-rays and ultrasounds, RGB endoscopy videos, and 3D CT scans. Leveraging this dataset, we train M3Ret, a unified visual encoder without any modality-specific customization. It successfully learns transferable representations using both generative (MAE) and contrastive (SimDINO) self-supervised learning (SSL) paradigms. Our approach sets a new state-of-the-art in zero-shot image-to-image retrieval across all individual modalities, surpassing strong baselines such as DINOv3 and the text-supervised BMC-CLIP. More remarkably, strong cross-modal alignment emerges without paired data, and the model generalizes to unseen MRI tasks, despite never observing MRI during pretraining, demonstrating the generalizability of purely visual self-supervision to unseen modalities. Comprehensive analyses further validate the scalability of our framework across model and data sizes. These findings deliver a promising signal to the medical imaging community, positioning M3Ret as a step toward foundation models for visual SSL in multimodal medical image understanding.</description>

      <title>Identity-Preserving Text-to-Video Generation via Training-Free Prompt, Image, and Guidance Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identity-preserving text-to-video (IPT2V) generation creates videos faithful to both a reference subject image and a text prompt. While fine-tuning large pretrained video diffusion models on ID-matched data achieves state-of-the-art results on IPT2V, data scarcity and high tuning costs hinder broader improvement. We thus introduce a Training-Free Prompt, Image, and Guidance Enhancement (TPIGE) framework that bridges the semantic gap between the video description and the reference image and design sampling guidance that enhances identity preservation and video quality, achieving performance gains at minimal cost.Specifically, we first propose Face Aware Prompt Enhancement, using GPT-4o to enhance the text prompt with facial details derived from the reference image. We then propose Prompt Aware Reference Image Enhancement, leveraging an identity-preserving image generator to refine the reference image, rectifying conflicts with the text prompt. The above mutual refinement significantly improves input quality before video generation. Finally, we propose ID-Aware Spatiotemporal Guidance Enhancement, utilizing unified gradients to optimize identity preservation and video quality jointly during generation.Our method outperforms prior work and is validated by automatic and human evaluations on a 1000 video test set, winning first place in the ACM Multimedia 2025 Identity-Preserving Video Generation Challenge, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance and strong generality.

      <description>arXiv:2509.01371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-time video analytics on high-resolution cameras has become a popular technology for various intelligent services like traffic control and crowd monitoring. While extensive work has been done on improving analytics accuracy with timing guarantees, virtually all of them target static viewpoint cameras. In this paper, we present Uirapuru, a novel framework for real-time, edge-based video analytics on high-resolution steerable cameras. The actuation performed by those cameras brings significant dynamism to the scene, presenting a critical challenge to existing popular approaches such as frame tiling. To address this problem, Uirapuru incorporates a comprehensive understanding of camera actuation into the system design paired with fast adaptive tiling at a per-frame level. We evaluate Uirapuru on a high-resolution video dataset, augmented by pan-tilt-zoom (PTZ) movements typical for steerable cameras and on real-world videos collected from an actual PTZ camera. Our experimental results show that Uirapuru provides up to 1.45x improvement in accuracy while respecting specified latency budgets or reaches up to 4.53x inference speedup with on-par accuracy compared to state-of-the-art static camera approaches.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Ultra-High-Resolution UAV Low-Light Image Enhancement: A Benchmark, Metric and Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low light conditions significantly degrade Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) performance in critical applications. Existing Low-light Image Enhancement (LIE) methods struggle with the unique challenges of aerial imagery, including Ultra-High Resolution (UHR), lack of paired data, severe non-uniform illumination, and deployment constraints. To address these issues, we propose three key contributions. First, we present U3D, the first unsupervised UHR UAV dataset for LIE, with a unified evaluation toolkit. Second, we introduce the Edge Efficiency Index (EEI), a novel metric balancing perceptual quality with key deployment factors: speed, resolution, model complexity, and memory footprint. Third, we develop U3LIE, an efficient framework with two training-only designs-Adaptive Pre-enhancement Augmentation (APA) for input normalization and a Luminance Interval Loss (L_int) for exposure control. U3LIE achieves SOTA results, processing 4K images at 23.8 FPS on a single GPU, making it ideal for real-time on-board deployment. In summary, these contributions provide a holistic solution (dataset, metric, and method) for advancing robust 24/7 UAV vision. The code and datasets are available at https://github.com/lwCVer/U3D_Toolkit.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Partially Relevant Video Retrieval with Robust Alignment Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Partially Relevant Video Retrieval (PRVR) aims to retrieve untrimmed videos partially relevant to a given query. The core challenge lies in learning robust query-video alignment against spurious semantic correlations arising from inherent data uncertainty: 1) query ambiguity, where the query incompletely characterizes the target video and often contains uninformative tokens, and 2) partial video relevance, where abundant query-irrelevant segments introduce contextual noise in cross-modal alignment. Existing methods often focus on enhancing multi-scale clip representations and retrieving the most relevant clip. However, the inherent data uncertainty in PRVR renders them vulnerable to distractor videos with spurious similarities, leading to suboptimal performance. To fill this research gap, we propose Robust Alignment Learning (RAL) framework, which explicitly models the uncertainty in data. Key innovations include: 1) we pioneer probabilistic modeling for PRVR by encoding videos and queries as multivariate Gaussian distributions. This not only quantifies data uncertainty but also enables proxy-level matching to capture the variability in cross-modal correspondences; 2) we consider the heterogeneous informativeness of query words and introduce learnable confidence gates to dynamically weight similarity. As a plug-and-play solution, RAL can be seamlessly integrated into the existing architectures. Extensive experiments across diverse retrieval backbones demonstrate its effectiveness.</description>

      <title>RibPull: Implicit Occupancy Fields and Medial Axis Extraction for CT Ribcage Scans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present RibPull, a methodology that utilizes implicit occupancy fields to bridge computational geometry and medical imaging. Implicit 3D representations use continuous functions that handle sparse and noisy data more effectively than discrete methods. While voxel grids are standard for medical imaging, they suffer from resolution limitations, topological information loss, and inefficient handling of sparsity. Coordinate functions preserve complex geometrical information and represent a better solution for sparse data representation, while allowing for further morphological operations. Implicit scene representations enable neural networks to encode entire 3D scenes within their weights. The result is a continuous function that can implicitly compesate for sparse signals and infer further information about the 3D scene by passing any combination of 3D coordinates as input to the model. In this work, we use neural occupancy fields that predict whether a 3D point lies inside or outside an object to represent CT-scanned ribcages. We also apply a Laplacian-based contraction to extract the medial axis of the ribcage, thus demonstrating a geometrical operation that benefits greatly from continuous coordinate-based 3D scene representations versus voxel-based representations. We evaluate our methodology on 20 medical scans from the RibSeg dataset, which is itself an extension of the RibFrac dataset. We will release our code upon publication.</description>

      <title>Neural Scene Designer: Self-Styled Semantic Image Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Maintaining stylistic consistency is crucial for the cohesion and aesthetic appeal of images, a fundamental requirement in effective image editing and inpainting. However, existing methods primarily focus on the semantic control of generated content, often neglecting the critical task of preserving this consistency. In this work, we introduce the Neural Scene Designer (NSD), a novel framework that enables photo-realistic manipulation of user-specified scene regions while ensuring both semantic alignment with user intent and stylistic consistency with the surrounding environment. NSD leverages an advanced diffusion model, incorporating two parallel cross-attention mechanisms that separately process text and style information to achieve the dual objectives of semantic control and style consistency. To capture fine-grained style representations, we propose the Progressive Self-style Representational Learning (PSRL) module. This module is predicated on the intuitive premise that different regions within a single image share a consistent style, whereas regions from different images exhibit distinct styles. The PSRL module employs a style contrastive loss that encourages high similarity between representations from the same image while enforcing dissimilarity between those from different images. Furthermore, to address the lack of standardized evaluation protocols for this task, we establish a comprehensive benchmark. This benchmark includes competing algorithms, dedicated style-related metrics, and diverse datasets and settings to facilitate fair comparisons. Extensive experiments conducted on our benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.</description>

      <title>MILO: A Lightweight Perceptual Quality Metric for Image and Latent-Space Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present MILO (Metric for Image- and Latent-space Optimization), a lightweight, multiscale, perceptual metric for full-reference image quality assessment (FR-IQA). MILO is trained using pseudo-MOS (Mean Opinion Score) supervision, in which reproducible distortions are applied to diverse images and scored via an ensemble of recent quality metrics that account for visual masking effects. This approach enables accurate learning without requiring large-scale human-labeled datasets. Despite its compact architecture, MILO outperforms existing metrics across standard FR-IQA benchmarks and offers fast inference suitable for real-time applications. Beyond quality prediction, we demonstrate the utility of MILO as a perceptual loss in both image and latent domains. In particular, we show that spatial masking modeled by MILO, when applied to latent representations from a VAE encoder within Stable Diffusion, enables efficient and perceptually aligned optimization. By combining spatial masking with a curriculum learning strategy, we first process perceptually less relevant regions before progressively shifting the optimization to more visually distorted areas. This strategy leads to significantly improved performance in tasks like denoising, super-resolution, and face restoration, while also reducing computational overhead. MILO thus functions as both a state-of-the-art image quality metric and as a practical tool for perceptual optimization in generative pipelines.</description>

      <title>Bangladeshi Street Food Calorie Estimation Using Improved YOLOv8 and Regression Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As obesity rates continue to increase, automated calorie tracking has become a vital tool for people seeking to maintain a healthy lifestyle or adhere to a diet plan. Although numerous research efforts have addressed this issue, existing approaches often face key limitations, such as providing only constant caloric output, struggling with multiple food recognition challenges, challenges in image scaling and normalization, and a predominant focus on Western cuisines. In this paper, we propose a tailored solution that specifically targets Bangladeshi street food. We first construct a diverse dataset of popular street foods found across Bangladesh. Then, we develop a refined calorie estimation system by modifying the state-of-the-art vision model YOLOv8. Our modified model achieves superior classification and segmentation results, with only a slight increase in computational complexity compared to the base variant. Coupled with a machine learning regression model, our system achieves an impressive 6.94 mean absolute error (MAE), 11.03 root mean squared error (RMSE), and a 96.0% R^2 score in calorie estimation, making it both highly effective and accurate for real-world food calorie calculations.</description>

      <title>InfoScale: Unleashing Training-free Variable-scaled Image Generation via Effective Utilization of Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have become dominant in visual generation but suffer performance drop when tested on resolutions that differ from the training scale, whether lower or higher. In fact, the key challenge in generating variable-scale images lies in the differing amounts of information across resolutions, which requires information conversion procedures to be varied for generating variable-scaled images. In this paper, we investigate the issues of three critical aspects in DMs for a unified analysis in variable-scaled generation: dilated convolution, attention mechanisms, and initial noise. Specifically, 1) dilated convolution in DMs for the higher-resolution generation loses high-frequency information. 2) Attention for variable-scaled image generation struggles to adjust the information aggregation adaptively. 3) The spatial distribution of information in the initial noise is misaligned with variable-scaled image. To solve the above problems, we propose \textbf{InfoScale}, an information-centric framework for variable-scaled image generation by effectively utilizing information from three aspects correspondingly. For information loss in 1), we introduce Progressive Frequency Compensation module to compensate for high-frequency information lost by dilated convolution in higher-resolution generation. For information aggregation inflexibility in 2), we introduce Adaptive Information Aggregation module to adaptively aggregate information in lower-resolution generation and achieve an effective balance between local and global information in higher-resolution generation. For information distribution misalignment in 3), we design Noise Adaptation module to re-distribute information in initial noise for variable-scaled generation. Our method is plug-and-play for DMs and extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness in variable-scaled image generation.</description>

      <title>Mamba-CNN: A Hybrid Architecture for Efficient and Accurate Facial Beauty Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The computational assessment of facial attractiveness, a challenging subjective regression task, is dominated by architectures with a critical trade-off: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) offer efficiency but have limited receptive fields, while Vision Transformers (ViTs) model global context at a quadratic computational cost. To address this, we propose Mamba-CNN, a novel and efficient hybrid architecture. Mamba-CNN integrates a lightweight, Mamba-inspired State Space Model (SSM) gating mechanism into a hierarchical convolutional backbone. This core innovation allows the network to dynamically modulate feature maps and selectively emphasize salient facial features and their long-range spatial relationships, mirroring human holistic perception while maintaining computational efficiency. We conducted extensive experiments on the widely-used SCUT-FBP5500 benchmark, where our model sets a new state-of-the-art. Mamba-CNN achieves a Pearson Correlation (PC) of 0.9187, a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.2022, and a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.2610. Our findings validate the synergistic potential of combining CNNs with selective SSMs and present a powerful new architectural paradigm for nuanced visual understanding tasks.</description>

      <title>SoccerHigh: A Benchmark Dataset for Automatic Soccer Video Summarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video summarization aims to extract key shots from longer videos to produce concise and informative summaries. One of its most common applications is in sports, where highlight reels capture the most important moments of a game, along with notable reactions and specific contextual events. Automatic summary generation can support video editors in the sports media industry by reducing the time and effort required to identify key segments. However, the lack of publicly available datasets poses a challenge in developing robust models for sports highlight generation. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing a curated dataset for soccer video summarization, designed to serve as a benchmark for the task. The dataset includes shot boundaries for 237 matches from the Spanish, French, and Italian leagues, using broadcast footage sourced from the SoccerNet dataset. Alongside the dataset, we propose a baseline model specifically designed for this task, which achieves an F1 score of 0.3956 in the test set. Furthermore, we propose a new metric constrained by the length of each target summary, enabling a more objective evaluation of the generated content. The dataset and code are available at https://ipcv.github.io/SoccerHigh/.</description>

      <title>Traces of Image Memorability in Vision Encoders: Activations, Attention Distributions and Autoencoder Losses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Images vary in how memorable they are to humans. Inspired by findings from cognitive science and computer vision, this paper explores the correlates of image memorability in pretrained vision encoders, focusing on latent activations, attention distributions, and the uniformity of image patches. We find that these features correlate with memorability to some extent. Additionally, we explore sparse autoencoder loss over the representations of vision transformers as a proxy for memorability, which yields results outperforming past methods using convolutional neural network representations. Our results shed light on the relationship between model-internal features and memorability. They show that some features are informative predictors of what makes images memorable to humans.</description>

      <title>Im2Haircut: Single-view Strand-based Hair Reconstruction for Human Avatars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel approach for 3D hair reconstruction from single photographs based on a global hair prior combined with local optimization. Capturing strand-based hair geometry from single photographs is challenging due to the variety and geometric complexity of hairstyles and the lack of ground truth training data. Classical reconstruction methods like multi-view stereo only reconstruct the visible hair strands, missing the inner structure of hairstyles and hampering realistic hair simulation. To address this, existing methods leverage hairstyle priors trained on synthetic data. Such data, however, is limited in both quantity and quality since it requires manual work from skilled artists to model the 3D hairstyles and create near-photorealistic renderings. To address this, we propose a novel approach that uses both, real and synthetic data to learn an effective hairstyle prior. Specifically, we train a transformer-based prior model on synthetic data to obtain knowledge of the internal hairstyle geometry and introduce real data in the learning process to model the outer structure. This training scheme is able to model the visible hair strands depicted in an input image, while preserving the general 3D structure of hairstyles. We exploit this prior to create a Gaussian-splatting-based reconstruction method that creates hairstyles from one or more images. Qualitative and quantitative comparisons with existing reconstruction pipelines demonstrate the effectiveness and superior performance of our method for capturing detailed hair orientation, overall silhouette, and backside consistency.

      <title>PointSlice: Accurate and Efficient Slice-Based Representation for 3D Object Detection from Point Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D object detection from point clouds plays a critical role in autonomous driving. Currently, the primary methods for point cloud processing are voxel-based and pillarbased approaches. Voxel-based methods offer high accuracy through fine-grained spatial segmentation but suffer from slower inference speeds. Pillar-based methods enhance inference speed but still fall short of voxel-based methods in accuracy. To address these issues, we propose a novel point cloud processing method, PointSlice, which slices point clouds along the horizontal plane and includes a dedicated detection network. The main contributions of PointSlice are: (1) A new point cloud processing technique that converts 3D point clouds into multiple sets of 2D (x-y) data slices. The model only learns 2D data distributions, treating the 3D point cloud as separate batches of 2D data, which reduces the number of model parameters and enhances inference speed; (2) The introduction of a Slice Interaction Network (SIN). To maintain vertical relationships across slices, we incorporate SIN into the 2D backbone network, which improves the model's 3D object perception capability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PointSlice achieves high detection accuracy and inference speed. On the Waymo dataset, PointSlice is 1.13x faster and has 0.79x fewer parameters than the state-of-the-art voxel-based method (SAFDNet), with only a 1.2 mAPH accuracy reduction. On the nuScenes dataset, we achieve a state-of-the-art detection result of 66.74 mAP. On the Argoverse 2 dataset, PointSlice is 1.10x faster, with 0.66x fewer parameters and a 1.0 mAP accuracy reduction. The code will be available at https://github.com/qifeng22/PointSlice2.</description>

      <title>A Continuous-Time Consistency Model for 3D Point Cloud Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast and accurate 3D shape generation from point clouds is essential for applications in robotics, AR/VR, and digital content creation. We introduce ConTiCoM-3D, a continuous-time consistency model that synthesizes 3D shapes directly in point space, without discretized diffusion steps, pre-trained teacher models, or latent-space encodings. The method integrates a TrigFlow-inspired continuous noise schedule with a Chamfer Distance-based geometric loss, enabling stable training on high-dimensional point sets while avoiding expensive Jacobian-vector products. This design supports efficient one- to two-step inference with high geometric fidelity. In contrast to previous approaches that rely on iterative denoising or latent decoders, ConTiCoM-3D employs a time-conditioned neural network operating entirely in continuous time, thereby achieving fast generation. Experiments on the ShapeNet benchmark show that ConTiCoM-3D matches or outperforms state-of-the-art diffusion and latent consistency models in both quality and efficiency, establishing it as a practical framework for scalable 3D shape generation.</description>

Abstract: The nnUNet segmentation framework adeptly adjusts most hyperparameters in training scripts automatically, but it overlooks the tuning of internal hyperparameters within the segmentation network itself, which constrains the model's ability to generalize. Addressing this limitation, this study presents a novel Self-Adaptive Convolution Module that dynamically adjusts the size of the convolution kernels depending on the unique fingerprints of different datasets. This adjustment enables the MSA2-Net, when equipped with this module, to proficiently capture both global and local features within the feature maps. Self-Adaptive Convolution Module is strategically integrated into two key components of the MSA2-Net: the Multi-Scale Convolution Bridge and the Multi-Scale Amalgamation Decoder. In the MSConvBridge, the module enhances the ability to refine outputs from various stages of the CSWin Transformer during the skip connections, effectively eliminating redundant data that could potentially impair the decoder's performance. Simultaneously, the MSADecoder, utilizing the module, excels in capturing detailed information of organs varying in size during the decoding phase. This capability ensures that the decoder's output closely reproduces the intricate details within the feature maps, thus yielding highly accurate segmentation images. MSA2-Net, bolstered by this advanced architecture, has demonstrated exceptional performance, achieving Dice coefficient scores of 86.49\%, 92.56\%, 93.37\%, and 92.98\% on the Synapse, ACDC, Kvasir, and Skin Lesion Segmentation (ISIC2017) datasets, respectively. This underscores MSA2-Net's robustness and precision in medical image segmentation tasks across various datasets.</description>

      <title>Variation-aware Vision Token Dropping for Faster Large Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in multimodal understanding tasks. However, the increasing demand for high-resolution image and long-video understanding results in substantial token counts, leading to reduced inference efficiency. Token compression offers a direct solution by reducing the number of tokens to be processed, thereby improving computational efficiency. Through extensive analysis, we identify two critical limitations in existing inner-LLM token compression methods: positional bias and incompatibility with efficient operators, which hinder their practical deployment for LVLM acceleration. This paper presents the first approach from a token variation perspective, revealing that visual token variations within LLMs exhibit task-agnostic properties. We propose Variation-aware Vision Token Dropping (\textit{i.e.}, \textbf{V$^2$Drop}), which progressively removes visual tokens with minimal variation during LVLM inference, thereby enhancing computational efficiency. Extensive experiments across multiple models and benchmarks demonstrate that our V$^2$Drop is able to maintain \textbf{94.0\%} and \textbf{98.6\%} of the original model performance for image and video understanding tasks respectively, while reducing LLM generation latency by \textbf{31.5\%} and \textbf{74.2\%}. When combined with efficient operators, V$^2$Drop further reduces GPU peak memory usage.</description>

      <title>Unified Supervision For Vision-Language Modeling in 3D Computed Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: General-purpose vision-language models (VLMs) have emerged as promising tools in radiology, offering zero-shot capabilities that mitigate the need for large labeled datasets. However, in high-stakes domains like diagnostic radiology, these models often lack the discriminative precision required for reliable clinical use. This challenge is compounded by the scarcity and heterogeneity of publicly available volumetric CT datasets, which vary widely in annotation formats and granularity. To address these limitations, we introduce Uniferum, a volumetric VLM that unifies diverse supervision signals, encoded in classification labels and segmentation masks, into a single training framework. By harmonizing three public 3D CT datasets with distinct annotations, Uniferum achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving AUROC on the CT-RATE benchmark by 7% compared to CLIP-based and conventional multi-label convolutional models. The model demonstrates robust out-of-distribution generalization, with observed evidence of unexpected zero-shot performance on the RAD-CHEST and INSPECT datasets. Our results highlight the effectiveness of integrating heterogeneous annotations and body segmentation to enhance model performance, setting a new direction for clinically reliable, data-efficient VLMs in 3D medical imaging.</description>

      <title>Acoustic Interference Suppression in Ultrasound images for Real-Time HIFU Monitoring Using an Image-Based Latent Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) is a non-invasive therapeutic technique widely used for treating various diseases. However, the success and safety of HIFU treatments depend on real-time monitoring, which is often hindered by interference when using ultrasound to guide HIFU treatment. To address these challenges, we developed HIFU-ILDiff, a novel deep learning-based approach leveraging latent diffusion models to suppress HIFU-induced interference in ultrasound images. The HIFU-ILDiff model employs a Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) to encode noisy ultrasound images into a lower-dimensional latent space, followed by a latent diffusion model that iteratively removes interference. The denoised latent vectors are then decoded to reconstruct high-resolution, interference-free ultrasound images. We constructed a comprehensive dataset comprising 18,872 image pairs from in vitro phantoms, ex vivo tissues, and in vivo animal data across multiple imaging modalities and HIFU power levels to train and evaluate the model. Experimental results demonstrate that HIFU-ILDiff significantly outperforms the commonly used Notch Filter method, achieving a Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) of 0.796 and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) of 23.780 compared to SSIM of 0.443 and PSNR of 14.420 for the Notch Filter under in vitro scenarios. Additionally, HIFU-ILDiff achieves real-time processing at 15 frames per second, markedly faster than the Notch Filter's 5 seconds per frame. These findings indicate that HIFU-ILDiff is able to denoise HIFU interference in ultrasound guiding images for real-time monitoring during HIFU therapy, which will greatly improve the treatment precision in current clinical applications.</description>

      <title>Kwai Keye-VL 1.5 Technical Report</title>

Abstract: In recent years, the development of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly advanced, extending their capabilities to multimodal tasks through Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, video understanding remains a challenging area due to the dynamic and information-dense nature of videos. Existing models struggle with the trade-off between spatial resolution and temporal coverage when processing video content. We present Keye-VL-1.5, which addresses fundamental challenges in video comprehension through three key innovations. First, we introduce a novel Slow-Fast video encoding strategy that dynamically allocates computational resources based on inter-frame similarity, processing key frames with significant visual changes at higher resolution (Slow pathway) while handling relatively static frames with increased temporal coverage at lower resolution (Fast pathway). Second, we implement a progressive four-stage pre-training methodology that systematically extends the model's context length from 8K to 128K tokens, enabling processing of longer videos and more complex visual content. Third, we develop a comprehensive post-training pipeline focusing on reasoning enhancement and human preference alignment, incorporating a 5-step chain-of-thought data construction process, iterative GSPO-based reinforcement learning with progressive prompt hinting for difficult cases, and alignment training. Through extensive evaluation on public benchmarks and rigorous internal human assessment, Keye-VL-1.5 demonstrates significant improvements over existing models, particularly excelling in video understanding tasks while maintaining competitive performance on general multimodal benchmarks.</description>

      <title>ViSTA-SLAM: Visual SLAM with Symmetric Two-view Association</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present ViSTA-SLAM as a real-time monocular visual SLAM system that operates without requiring camera intrinsics, making it broadly applicable across diverse camera setups. At its core, the system employs a lightweight symmetric two-view association (STA) model as the frontend, which simultaneously estimates relative camera poses and regresses local pointmaps from only two RGB images. This design reduces model complexity significantly, the size of our frontend is only 35\% that of comparable state-of-the-art methods, while enhancing the quality of two-view constraints used in the pipeline. In the backend, we construct a specially designed Sim(3) pose graph that incorporates loop closures to address accumulated drift. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance in both camera tracking and dense 3D reconstruction quality compared to current methods.

      <title>O-DisCo-Edit: Object Distortion Control for Unified Realistic Video Editing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models have recently advanced video editing, yet controllable editing remains challenging due to the need for precise manipulation of diverse object properties. Current methods require different control signal for diverse editing tasks, which complicates model design and demands significant training resources. To address this, we propose O-DisCo-Edit, a unified framework that incorporates a novel object distortion control (O-DisCo). This signal, based on random and adaptive noise, flexibly encapsulates a wide range of editing cues within a single representation. Paired with a "copy-form" preservation module for preserving non-edited regions, O-DisCo-Edit enables efficient, high-fidelity editing through an effective training paradigm. Extensive experiments and comprehensive human evaluations consistently demonstrate that O-DisCo-Edit surpasses both specialized and multitask state-of-the-art methods across various video editing tasks. https://cyqii.github.io/O-DisCo-Edit.github.io/</description>

      <title>TransForSeg: A Multitask Stereo ViT for Joint Stereo Segmentation and 3D Force Estimation in Catheterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the emergence of multitask deep learning models has enhanced catheterization procedures by providing tactile and visual perception data through an end-to-end architec- ture. This information is derived from a segmentation and force estimation head, which localizes the catheter in X-ray images and estimates the applied pressure based on its deflection within the image. These stereo vision architectures incorporate a CNN- based encoder-decoder that captures the dependencies between X-ray images from two viewpoints, enabling simultaneous 3D force estimation and stereo segmentation of the catheter. With these tasks in mind, this work approaches the problem from a new perspective. We propose a novel encoder-decoder Vision Transformer model that processes two input X-ray images as separate sequences. Given sequences of X-ray patches from two perspectives, the transformer captures long-range dependencies without the need to gradually expand the receptive field for either image. The embeddings generated by both the encoder and decoder are fed into two shared segmentation heads, while a regression head employs the fused information from the decoder for 3D force estimation. The proposed model is a stereo Vision Transformer capable of simultaneously segmenting the catheter from two angles while estimating the generated forces at its tip in 3D. This model has undergone extensive experiments on synthetic X-ray images with various noise levels and has been compared against state-of-the-art pure segmentation models, vision-based catheter force estimation methods, and a multitask catheter segmentation and force estimation approach. It outperforms existing models, setting a new state-of-the-art in both catheter segmentation and force estimation.</description>

      <title>Improving Large Vision and Language Models by Learning from a Panel of Peers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional alignment methods for Large Vision and Language Models (LVLMs) primarily rely on human-curated preference data. Human-generated preference data is costly; machine-generated preference data is limited in quality; and self-supervised preference data often introduces hallucinations. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel Panel-of-Peers learning framework inspired by collaborative learning among humans. This approach leverages a panel of LVLMs, each evaluating and learning from their collective outputs through an iterative self-improvement process. By simulating a peer review system, our models generate, assess, and refine outputs in response to a curated set of prompts, mimicking a classroom learning environment. We demonstrate that this methodology enhances model performance without requiring extensive human-labeled datasets. Our experiments show significant improvement across multiple benchmarks, demonstrating the potential of peer evaluations as a scalable alternative to self-supervised alignment. Notably, we show that Panel-of-Peers increases the average score on fifteen benchmarks from 48% to 57%</description>

      <title>Q-Sched: Pushing the Boundaries of Few-Step Diffusion Models with Quantization-Aware Scheduling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models are computationally intensive, often requiring dozens of forward passes through large transformer backbones. For instance, Stable Diffusion XL generates high-quality images with 50 evaluations of a 2.6B-parameter model, an expensive process even for a single batch. Few-step diffusion models reduce this cost to 2-8 denoising steps but still depend on large, uncompressed U-Net or diffusion transformer backbones, which are often too costly for full-precision inference without datacenter GPUs. These requirements also limit existing post-training quantization methods that rely on full-precision calibration. We introduce Q-Sched, a new paradigm for post-training quantization that modifies the diffusion model scheduler rather than model weights. By adjusting the few-step sampling trajectory, Q-Sched achieves full-precision accuracy with a 4x reduction in model size. To learn quantization-aware pre-conditioning coefficients, we propose the JAQ loss, which combines text-image compatibility with an image quality metric for fine-grained optimization. JAQ is reference-free and requires only a handful of calibration prompts, avoiding full-precision inference during calibration. Q-Sched delivers substantial gains: a 15.5% FID improvement over the FP16 4-step Latent Consistency Model and a 16.6% improvement over the FP16 8-step Phased Consistency Model, showing that quantization and few-step distillation are complementary for high-fidelity generation. A large-scale user study with more than 80,000 annotations further confirms Q-Sched's effectiveness on both FLUX.1[schnell] and SDXL-Turbo.</description>

      <title>OpenVision 2: A Family of Generative Pretrained Visual Encoders for Multimodal Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides a simplification on OpenVision's architecture and loss design for enhancing its training efficiency. Following the prior vision-language pretraining works CapPa and AIMv2, as well as modern multimodal designs like LLaVA, our changes are straightforward: we remove the text encoder (and therefore the contrastive loss), retaining only the captioning loss as a purely generative training signal. We name this new version OpenVision 2. The initial results are promising: despite this simplification, OpenVision 2 competitively matches the original model's performance on a broad set of multimodal benchmarks while substantially cutting both training time and memory consumption. For example, with ViT-L/14, it reduces training time by about 1.5x (from 83h to 57h), and memory usage by about 1.8x (from 24.5GB to 13.8GB, equivalently allowing the maximum batch size to grow from 2k to 8k). This superior training efficiency also allows us to scale far beyond the largest vision encoder used in OpenVision, reaching more than 1 billion parameters. We hold a strong belief that this lightweight, generative-only paradigm is compelling for future vision encoder development in multimodal foundation models.</description>

      <title>Reinforced Visual Perception with Tools</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visual reasoning, a cornerstone of human intelligence, encompasses complex perceptual and logical processes essential for solving diverse visual problems. While advances in computer vision have produced powerful models for various perceptual tasks, leveraging these for general visual reasoning remains challenging. Prior work demonstrates that augmenting LLMs with vision models via supervised finetuning improves performance, but faces key limitations such as expensive data generation, reliance on careful data filtering, and poor generalization. To address these issues, we propose ReVPT to enhance multi-modal LLMs' abilities to reason about and use visual tools through reinforcement learning. We introduce a novel RL algorithm based on GRPO, designed to train models to reason with a suite of four visual tools. Through extensive experiments, we show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on several perception-heavy benchmarks, including SAT, CV-Bench, BLINK and MMStar, significantly outperforming the supervised and text-based RL finetuning baselines. Notably, Our ReVPT-3B and ReVPT-7B outperform the instruct models by 9.03% and 9.44% on CV-Bench. Finally, we bring to the community new insights on RL-based visual tool-usage through extensive ablations. Our code is available at https://github.com/ls-kelvin/REVPT.</description>

      <title>GaussianGAN: Real-Time Photorealistic controllable Human Avatars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photorealistic and controllable human avatars have gained popularity in the research community thanks to rapid advances in neural rendering, providing fast and realistic synthesis tools. However, a limitation of current solutions is the presence of noticeable blurring. To solve this problem, we propose GaussianGAN, an animatable avatar approach developed for photorealistic rendering of people in real-time. We introduce a novel Gaussian splatting densification strategy to build Gaussian points from the surface of cylindrical structures around estimated skeletal limbs. Given the camera calibration, we render an accurate semantic segmentation with our novel view segmentation module. Finally, a UNet generator uses the rendered Gaussian splatting features and the segmentation maps to create photorealistic digital avatars. Our method runs in real-time with a rendering speed of 79 FPS. It outperforms previous methods regarding visual perception and quality, achieving a state-of-the-art results in terms of a pixel fidelity of 32.94db on the ZJU Mocap dataset and 33.39db on the Thuman4 dataset.</description>

      <title>Examination of PCA Utilisation for Multilabel Classifier of Multispectral Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the utility of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for multi-label classification of multispectral images using ResNet50 and DINOv2, acknowledging the high dimensionality of such data and the associated processing challenges. Multi-label classification, where each image may belong to multiple classes, adds further complexity to feature extraction. Our pipeline includes an optional PCA step that reduces the data to three dimensions before feeding it into a three-layer classifier. The findings demonstrate that the effectiveness of PCA for multi-label multispectral image classification depends strongly on the chosen deep learning architecture and training strategy, opening avenues for future research into self-supervised pre-training and alternative dimensionality reduction approaches.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning-Based Rock Particulate Classification Using Attention-Enhanced ConvNeXt</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate classification of rock sizes is a vital component in geotechnical engineering, mining, and resource management, where precise estimation influences operational efficiency and safety. In this paper, we propose an enhanced deep learning model based on the ConvNeXt architecture, augmented with both self-attention and channel attention mechanisms. Building upon the foundation of ConvNext, our proposed model, termed CNSCA, introduces self-attention to capture long-range spatial dependencies and channel attention to emphasize informative feature channels. This hybrid design enables the model to effectively capture both fine-grained local patterns and broader contextual relationships within rock imagery, leading to improved classification accuracy and robustness. We evaluate our model on a rock size classification dataset and compare it against three strong baseline. The results demonstrate that the incorporation of attention mechanisms significantly enhances the models capability for fine-grained classification tasks involving natural textures like rocks.</description>

      <title>Clinical Metadata Guided Limited-Angle CT Image Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Limited-angle computed tomography (LACT) offers improved temporal resolution and reduced radiation dose for cardiac imaging, but suffers from severe artifacts due to truncated projections. To address the ill-posedness of LACT reconstruction, we propose a two-stage diffusion framework guided by structured clinical metadata. In the first stage, a transformer-based diffusion model conditioned exclusively on metadata, including acquisition parameters, patient demographics, and diagnostic impressions, generates coarse anatomical priors from noise. The second stage further refines the images by integrating both the coarse prior and metadata to produce high-fidelity results. Physics-based data consistency is enforced at each sampling step in both stages using an Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers module, ensuring alignment with the measured projections. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real cardiac CT datasets demonstrate that incorporating metadata significantly improves reconstruction fidelity, particularly under severe angular truncation. Compared to existing metadata-free baselines, our method achieves superior performance in SSIM, PSNR, nMI, and PCC. Ablation studies confirm that different types of metadata contribute complementary benefits, particularly diagnostic and demographic priors under limited-angle conditions. These findings highlight the dual role of clinical metadata in improving both reconstruction quality and efficiency, supporting their integration into future metadata-guided medical imaging frameworks.</description>

      <title>TransMatch: A Transfer-Learning Framework for Defect Detection in Laser Powder Bed Fusion Additive Manufacturing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surface defects in Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) pose significant risks to the structural integrity of additively manufactured components. This paper introduces TransMatch, a novel framework that merges transfer learning and semi-supervised few-shot learning to address the scarcity of labeled AM defect data. By effectively leveraging both labeled and unlabeled novel-class images, TransMatch circumvents the limitations of previous meta-learning approaches. Experimental evaluations on a Surface Defects dataset of 8,284 images demonstrate the efficacy of TransMatch, achieving 98.91% accuracy with minimal loss, alongside high precision, recall, and F1-scores for multiple defect classes. These findings underscore its robustness in accurately identifying diverse defects, such as cracks, pinholes, holes, and spatter. TransMatch thus represents a significant leap forward in additive manufacturing defect detection, offering a practical and scalable solution for quality assurance and reliability across a wide range of industrial applications.</description>

      <title>Mixture of Balanced Information Bottlenecks for Long-Tailed Visual Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved significant success in various applications with large-scale and balanced data. However, data in real-world visual recognition are usually long-tailed, bringing challenges to efficient training and deployment of DNNs. Information bottleneck (IB) is an elegant approach for representation learning. In this paper, we propose a balanced information bottleneck (BIB) approach, in which loss function re-balancing and self-distillation techniques are integrated into the original IB network. BIB is thus capable of learning a sufficient representation with essential label-related information fully preserved for long-tailed visual recognition. To further enhance the representation learning capability, we also propose a novel structure of mixture of multiple balanced information bottlenecks (MBIB), where different BIBs are responsible for combining knowledge from different network layers. MBIB facilitates an end-to-end learning strategy that trains representation and classification simultaneously from an information theory perspective. We conduct experiments on commonly used long-tailed datasets, including CIFAR100-LT, ImageNet-LT, and iNaturalist 2018. Both BIB and MBIB reach state-of-the-art performance for long-tailed visual recognition.</description>

      <title>PractiLight: Practical Light Control Using Foundational Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light control in generated images is a difficult task, posing specific challenges, spanning over the entire image and frequency spectrum. Most approaches tackle this problem by training on extensive yet domain-specific datasets, limiting the inherent generalization and applicability of the foundational backbones used. Instead, PractiLight is a practical approach, effectively leveraging foundational understanding of recent generative models for the task. Our key insight is that lighting relationships in an image are similar in nature to token interaction in self-attention layers, and hence are best represented there. Based on this and other analyses regarding the importance of early diffusion iterations, PractiLight trains a lightweight LoRA regressor to produce the direct irradiance map for a given image, using a small set of training images. We then employ this regressor to incorporate the desired lighting into the generation process of another image using Classifier Guidance. This careful design generalizes well to diverse conditions and image domains. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in terms of quality and control with proven parameter and data efficiency compared to leading works over a wide variety of scenes types. We hope this work affirms that image lighting can feasibly be controlled by tapping into foundational knowledge, enabling practical and general relighting.</description>

      <title>Latent Gene Diffusion for Spatial Transcriptomics Completion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computer Vision has proven to be a powerful tool for analyzing Spatial Transcriptomics (ST) data. However, current models that predict spatially resolved gene expression from histopathology images suffer from significant limitations due to data dropout. Most existing approaches rely on single-cell RNA sequencing references, making them dependent on alignment quality and external datasets while also risking batch effects and inherited dropout. In this paper, we address these limitations by introducing LGDiST, the first reference-free latent gene diffusion model for ST data dropout. We show that LGDiST outperforms the previous state-of-the-art in gene expression completion, with an average Mean Squared Error that is 18% lower across 26 datasets. Furthermore, we demonstrate that completing ST data with LGDiST improves gene expression prediction performance on six state-of-the-art methods up to 10% in MSE. A key innovation of LGDiST is using context genes previously considered uninformative to build a rich and biologically meaningful genetic latent space. Our experiments show that removing key components of LGDiST, such as the context genes, the ST latent space, and the neighbor conditioning, leads to considerable drops in performance. These findings underscore that the full architecture of LGDiST achieves substantially better performance than any of its isolated components.</description>

      <title>Enabling Federated Object Detection for Connected Autonomous Vehicles: A Deployment-Oriented Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Object detection is crucial for Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) to perceive their surroundings and make safe driving decisions. Centralized training of object detection models often achieves promising accuracy, fast convergence, and simplified training process, but it falls short in scalability, adaptability, and privacy-preservation. Federated learning (FL), by contrast, enables collaborative, privacy-preserving, and continuous training across naturally distributed CAV fleets. However, deploying FL in real-world CAVs remains challenging due to the substantial computational demands of training and inference, coupled with highly diverse operating conditions. Practical deployment must address three critical factors: (i) heterogeneity from non-IID data distributions, (ii) constrained onboard computing hardware, and (iii) environmental variability such as lighting and weather, alongside systematic evaluation to ensure reliable performance. This work introduces the first holistic deployment-oriented evaluation of FL-based object detection in CAVs, integrating model performance, system-level resource profiling, and environmental robustness. Using state-of-the-art detectors, YOLOv5, YOLOv8, YOLOv11, and Deformable DETR, evaluated on the KITTI, BDD100K, and nuScenes datasets, we analyze trade-offs between detection accuracy, computational cost, and resource usage under diverse resolutions, batch sizes, weather and lighting conditions, and dynamic client participation, paving the way for robust FL deployment in CAVs.</description>

      <title>Doctoral Thesis: Geometric Deep Learning For Camera Pose Prediction, Registration, Depth Estimation, and 3D Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern deep learning developments create new opportunities for 3D mapping technology, scene reconstruction pipelines, and virtual reality development. Despite advances in 3D deep learning technology, direct training of deep learning models on 3D data faces challenges due to the high dimensionality inherent in 3D data and the scarcity of labeled datasets. Structure-from-motion (SfM) and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) exhibit robust performance when applied to structured indoor environments but often struggle with ambiguous features in unstructured environments. These techniques often struggle to generate detailed geometric representations effective for downstream tasks such as rendering and semantic analysis. Current limitations require the development of 3D representation methods that combine traditional geometric techniques with deep learning capabilities to generate robust geometry-aware deep learning models.
  The dissertation provides solutions to the fundamental challenges in 3D vision by developing geometric deep learning methods tailored for essential tasks such as camera pose estimation, point cloud registration, depth prediction, and 3D reconstruction. The integration of geometric priors or constraints, such as including depth information, surface normals, and equivariance into deep learning models, enhances both the accuracy and robustness of geometric representations. This study systematically investigates key components of 3D vision, including camera pose estimation, point cloud registration, depth estimation, and high-fidelity 3D reconstruction, demonstrating their effectiveness across real-world applications such as digital cultural heritage preservation and immersive VR/AR environments.</description>

      <title>HydroVision: Predicting Optically Active Parameters in Surface Water Using Computer Vision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ongoing advancements in computer vision, particularly in pattern recognition and scene classification, have enabled new applications in environmental monitoring. Deep learning now offers non-contact methods for assessing water quality and detecting contamination, both critical for disaster response and public health protection. This work introduces HydroVision, a deep learning-based scene classification framework that estimates optically active water quality parameters including Chlorophyll-Alpha, Chlorophylls, Colored Dissolved Organic Matter (CDOM), Phycocyanins, Suspended Sediments, and Turbidity from standard Red-Green-Blue (RGB) images of surface water. HydroVision supports early detection of contamination trends and strengthens monitoring by regulatory agencies during external environmental stressors, industrial activities, and force majeure events. The model is trained on more than 500,000 seasonally varied images collected from the United States Geological Survey Hydrologic Imagery Visualization and Information System between 2022 and 2024. This approach leverages widely available RGB imagery as a scalable, cost-effective alternative to traditional multispectral and hyperspectral remote sensing. Four state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (VGG-16, ResNet50, MobileNetV2, DenseNet121) and a Vision Transformer are evaluated through transfer learning to identify the best-performing architecture. DenseNet121 achieves the highest validation performance, with an R2 score of 0.89 in predicting CDOM, demonstrating the framework's promise for real-world water quality monitoring across diverse conditions. While the current model is optimized for well-lit imagery, future work will focus on improving robustness under low-light and obstructed scenarios to expand its operational utility.</description>

      <title>Automated Wildfire Damage Assessment from Multi view Ground level Imagery Via Vision Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The escalating intensity and frequency of wildfires demand innovative computational methods for rapid and accurate property damage assessment. Traditional methods are often time consuming, while modern computer vision approaches typically require extensive labeled datasets, hindering immediate post-disaster deployment. This research introduces a novel, zero-shot framework leveraging pre-trained vision language models (VLMs) to classify damage from ground-level imagery. We propose and evaluate two pipelines applied to the 2025 Eaton and Palisades fires in California, a VLM (Pipeline A) and a VLM + large language model (LLM) approach (Pipeline B), that integrate structured prompts based on specific wildfire damage indicators. A primary scientific contribution of this study is demonstrating the VLMs efficacy in synthesizing information from multiple perspectives to identify nuanced damage, a critical limitation in existing literature. Our findings reveal that while single view assessments struggled to classify affected structures (F1 scores ranging from 0.225 to 0.511), the multi-view analysis yielded dramatic improvements (F1 scores ranging from 0.857 to 0.947). Moreover, the McNemar test confirmed that pipelines with a multi-view image assessment yields statistically significant classification improvements; however, the improvements this research observed between Pipeline A and B were not statistically significant. Thus, future research can explore the potential of LLM prompting in damage assessment. The practical contribution is an immediately deployable, flexible, and interpretable workflow that bypasses the need for supervised training, significantly accelerating triage and prioritization for disaster response practitioners.</description>

      <title>DroneSR: Rethinking Few-shot Thermal Image Super-Resolution from Drone-based Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although large scale models achieve significant improvements in performance, the overfitting challenge still frequently undermines their generalization ability. In super resolution tasks on images, diffusion models as representatives of generative models typically adopt large scale architectures. However, few-shot drone-captured infrared training data frequently induces severe overfitting in large-scale architectures. To address this key challenge, our method proposes a new Gaussian quantization representation learning method oriented to diffusion models that alleviates overfitting and enhances robustness. At the same time, an effective monitoring mechanism tracks large scale architectures during training to detect signs of overfitting. By introducing Gaussian quantization representation learning, our method effectively reduces overfitting while maintaining architecture complexity. On this basis, we construct a multi source drone-based infrared image benchmark dataset for detection and use it to emphasize overfitting issues of large scale architectures in few sample, drone-based diverse drone-based image reconstruction scenarios. To verify the efficacy of the method in mitigating overfitting, experiments are conducted on the constructed benchmark. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing super resolution approaches and significantly mitigates overfitting of large scale architectures under complex conditions. The code and DroneSR dataset will be available at: https://github.com/wengzp1/GARLSR.</description>

      <title>RSCC: A Large-Scale Remote Sensing Change Caption Dataset for Disaster Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Remote sensing is critical for disaster monitoring, yet existing datasets lack temporal image pairs and detailed textual annotations. While single-snapshot imagery dominates current resources, it fails to capture dynamic disaster impacts over time. To address this gap, we introduce the Remote Sensing Change Caption (RSCC) dataset, a large-scale benchmark comprising 62,315 pre-/post-disaster image pairs (spanning earthquakes, floods, wildfires, and more) paired with rich, human-like change captions. By bridging the temporal and semantic divide in remote sensing data, RSCC enables robust training and evaluation of vision-language models for disaster-aware bi-temporal understanding. Our results highlight RSCC's ability to facilitate detailed disaster-related analysis, paving the way for more accurate, interpretable, and scalable vision-language applications in remote sensing. Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/Bili-Sakura/RSCC.</description>

      <title>Towards Interpretable Geo-localization: a Concept-Aware Global Image-GPS Alignment Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Worldwide geo-localization involves determining the exact geographic location of images captured globally, typically guided by geographic cues such as climate, landmarks, and architectural styles. Despite advancements in geo-localization models like GeoCLIP, which leverages images and location alignment via contrastive learning for accurate predictions, the interpretability of these models remains insufficiently explored. Current concept-based interpretability methods fail to align effectively with Geo-alignment image-location embedding objectives, resulting in suboptimal interpretability and performance. To address this gap, we propose a novel framework integrating global geo-localization with concept bottlenecks. Our method inserts a Concept-Aware Alignment Module that jointly projects image and location embeddings onto a shared bank of geographic concepts (e.g., tropical climate, mountain, cathedral) and minimizes a concept-level loss, enhancing alignment in a concept-specific subspace and enabling robust interpretability. To our knowledge, this is the first work to introduce interpretability into geo-localization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach surpasses GeoCLIP in geo-localization accuracy and boosts performance across diverse geospatial prediction tasks, revealing richer semantic insights into geographic decision-making processes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal models, such as the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model, have demonstrated remarkable success in aligning visual and linguistic representations. However, these models exhibit limitations when applied to specialised visual domains, such as diagrams, which encode structured, symbolic information distinct from that of natural imagery.
  In this paper, we introduce a novel training paradigm explicitly designed to enhance the comprehension of diagrammatic images within vision-language models. Our approach uses ``hard'' samples for our proposed contrastive learning that incorporates two specialised loss functions that leverage the inherent structural properties of diagrams. By integrating these objectives into model training, our method enables models to develop a more structured and semantically coherent understanding of diagrammatic content.
  We empirically validate our approach on a benchmark dataset of flowcharts, as a representative class of diagrammatic imagery, demonstrating substantial improvements over standard CLIP and conventional hard negative CLIP learning paradigms for both image-text matching and visual question answering tasks. Our findings underscore the significance of tailored training strategies for specialised tasks and contribute to advancing diagrammatic understanding within the broader landscape of vision-language integration.</description>

      <title>2D Gaussian Splatting with Semantic Alignment for Image Inpainting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gaussian Splatting (GS), a recent technique for converting discrete points into continuous spatial representations, has shown promising results in 3D scene modeling and 2D image super-resolution. In this paper, we explore its untapped potential for image inpainting, which demands both locally coherent pixel synthesis and globally consistent semantic restoration. We propose the first image inpainting framework based on 2D Gaussian Splatting, which encodes incomplete images into a continuous field of 2D Gaussian splat coefficients and reconstructs the final image via a differentiable rasterization process. The continuous rendering paradigm of GS inherently promotes pixel-level coherence in the inpainted results. To improve efficiency and scalability, we introduce a patch-wise rasterization strategy that reduces memory overhead and accelerates inference. For global semantic consistency, we incorporate features from a pretrained DINO model. We observe that DINO's global features are naturally robust to small missing regions and can be effectively adapted to guide semantic alignment in large-mask scenarios, ensuring that the inpainted content remains contextually consistent with the surrounding scene. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance in both quantitative metrics and perceptual quality, establishing a new direction for applying Gaussian Splatting to 2D image processing.</description>

      <title>Ensemble-Based Event Camera Place Recognition Under Varying Illumination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compared to conventional cameras, event cameras provide a high dynamic range and low latency, offering greater robustness to rapid motion and challenging lighting conditions. Although the potential of event cameras for visual place recognition (VPR) has been established, developing robust VPR frameworks under severe illumination changes remains an open research problem. In this paper, we introduce an ensemble-based approach to event camera place recognition that combines sequence-matched results from multiple event-to-frame reconstructions, VPR feature extractors, and temporal resolutions. Unlike previous event-based ensemble methods, which only utilise temporal resolution, our broader fusion strategy delivers significantly improved robustness under varied lighting conditions (e.g., afternoon, sunset, night), achieving a 57% relative improvement in Recall@1 across day-night transitions. We evaluate our approach on two long-term driving datasets (with 8 km per traverse) without metric subsampling, thereby preserving natural variations in speed and stop duration that influence event density. We also conduct a comprehensive analysis of key design choices, including binning strategies, polarity handling, reconstruction methods, and feature extractors, to identify the most critical components for robust performance. Additionally, we propose a modification to the standard sequence matching framework that enhances performance at longer sequence lengths. To facilitate future research, we will release our codebase and benchmarking framework.</description>

      <title>MOSAIC: Multi-Subject Personalized Generation via Correspondence-Aware Alignment and Disentanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-subject personalized generation presents unique challenges in maintaining identity fidelity and semantic coherence when synthesizing images conditioned on multiple reference subjects. Existing methods often suffer from identity blending and attribute leakage due to inadequate modeling of how different subjects should interact within shared representation spaces. We present MOSAIC, a representation-centric framework that rethinks multi-subject generation through explicit semantic correspondence and orthogonal feature disentanglement. Our key insight is that multi-subject generation requires precise semantic alignment at the representation level - knowing exactly which regions in the generated image should attend to which parts of each reference. To enable this, we introduce SemAlign-MS, a meticulously annotated dataset providing fine-grained semantic correspondences between multiple reference subjects and target images, previously unavailable in this domain. Building on this foundation, we propose the semantic correspondence attention loss to enforce precise point-to-point semantic alignment, ensuring high consistency from each reference to its designated regions. Furthermore, we develop the multi-reference disentanglement loss to push different subjects into orthogonal attention subspaces, preventing feature interference while preserving individual identity characteristics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MOSAIC achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks. Notably, while existing methods typically degrade beyond 3 subjects, MOSAIC maintains high fidelity with 4+ reference subjects, opening new possibilities for complex multi-subject synthesis applications.</description>

      <title>Discrete Noise Inversion for Next-scale Autoregressive Text-based Image Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visual autoregressive models (VAR) have recently emerged as a promising class of generative models, achieving performance comparable to diffusion models in text-to-image generation tasks. While conditional generation has been widely explored, the ability to perform prompt-guided image editing without additional training is equally critical, as it supports numerous practical real-world applications. This paper investigates the text-to-image editing capabilities of VAR by introducing Visual AutoRegressive Inverse Noise (VARIN), the first noise inversion-based editing technique designed explicitly for VAR models. VARIN leverages a novel pseudo-inverse function for argmax sampling, named Location-aware Argmax Inversion (LAI), to generate inverse Gumbel noises. These inverse noises enable precise reconstruction of the source image and facilitate targeted, controllable edits aligned with textual prompts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VARIN effectively modifies source images according to specified prompts while significantly preserving the original background and structural details, thus validating its efficacy as a practical editing approach.</description>

      <title>Draw-In-Mind: Learning Precise Image Editing via Chain-of-Thought Imagination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, integrating multimodal understanding and generation into a single unified model has emerged as a promising paradigm. While this approach achieves strong results in text-to-image (T2I) generation, it still struggles with precise image editing. We attribute this limitation to an imbalanced division of responsibilities. The understanding module primarily functions as a translator that encodes user instructions into semantic conditions, while the generation module must simultaneously act as designer and painter, inferring the original layout, identifying the target editing region, and rendering the new content. This imbalance is counterintuitive because the understanding module is typically trained with several times more data on complex reasoning tasks than the generation module. To address this issue, we introduce Draw-In-Mind (DIM), a dataset comprising two complementary subsets: (i) DIM-T2I, containing 14M long-context image-text pairs to enhance complex instruction comprehension; and (ii) DIM-Edit, consisting of 233K chain-of-thought imaginations generated by GPT-4o, serving as explicit design blueprints for image edits. We connect a frozen Qwen2.5-VL-3B with a trainable SANA1.5-1.6B via a lightweight two-layer MLP, and train it on the proposed DIM dataset, resulting in DIM-4.6B-T2I/Edit. Despite its modest parameter scale, DIM-4.6B-Edit achieves SOTA or competitive performance on the ImgEdit and GEdit-Bench benchmarks, outperforming much larger models such as UniWorld-V1 and Step1X-Edit. These findings demonstrate that explicitly assigning the design responsibility to the understanding module provides significant benefits for image editing. Our dataset and models will be available at https://github.com/showlab/DIM.</description>

      <title>Explaining What Machines See: XAI Strategies in Deep Object Detection Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, deep learning has achieved unprecedented success in various computer vision tasks, particularly in object detection. However, the black-box nature and high complexity of deep neural networks pose significant challenges for interpretability, especially in critical domains such as autonomous driving, medical imaging, and security systems. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) aims to address this challenge by providing tools and methods to make model decisions more transparent, interpretable, and trust-worthy for humans. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of state-of-the-art explain-ability methods specifically applied to object detection models. The paper be-gins by categorizing existing XAI techniques based on their underlying mechanisms-perturbation-based, gradient-based, backpropagation-based, and graph-based methods. Notable methods such as D-RISE, BODEM, D-CLOSE, and FSOD are discussed in detail. Furthermore, the paper investigates their applicability to various object detection architectures, including YOLO, SSD, Faster R-CNN, and EfficientDet. Statistical analysis of publication trends from 2022 to mid-2025 shows an accelerating interest in explainable object detection, indicating its increasing importance. The study also explores common datasets and evaluation metrics, and highlights the major challenges associated with model interpretability. By providing a structured taxonomy and a critical assessment of existing methods, this review aims to guide researchers and practitioners in selecting suitable explainability techniques for object detection applications and to foster the development of more interpretable AI systems.</description>

      <title>Palette Aligned Image Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the Palette-Adapter, a novel method for conditioning text-to-image diffusion models on a user-specified color palette. While palettes are a compact and intuitive tool widely used in creative workflows, they introduce significant ambiguity and instability when used for conditioning image generation. Our approach addresses this challenge by interpreting palettes as sparse histograms and introducing two scalar control parameters: histogram entropy and palette-to-histogram distance, which allow flexible control over the degree of palette adherence and color variation. We further introduce a negative histogram mechanism that allows users to suppress specific undesired hues, improving adherence to the intended palette under the standard classifier-free guidance mechanism. To ensure broad generalization across the color space, we train on a carefully curated dataset with balanced coverage of rare and common colors. Our method enables stable, semantically coherent generation across a wide range of palettes and prompts. We evaluate our method qualitatively, quantitatively, and through a user study, and show that it consistently outperforms existing approaches in achieving both strong palette adherence and high image quality.</description>

      <title>Vision-Based Embedded System for Noncontact Monitoring of Preterm Infant Behavior in Low-Resource Care Settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Preterm birth remains a leading cause of neonatal mortality, disproportionately affecting low-resource settings with limited access to advanced neonatal intensive care units (NICUs).Continuous monitoring of infant behavior, such as sleep/awake states and crying episodes, is critical but relies on manual observation or invasive sensors, which are prone to error, impractical, and can cause skin damage. This paper presents a novel, noninvasive, and automated vision-based framework to address this gap. We introduce an embedded monitoring system that utilizes a quantized MobileNet model deployed on a Raspberry Pi for real-time behavioral state detection. When trained and evaluated on public neonatal image datasets, our system achieves state-of-the-art accuracy (91.8% for sleep detection and 97.7% for crying/normal classification) while maintaining computational efficiency suitable for edge deployment. Through comparative benchmarking, we provide a critical analysis of the trade-offs between model size, inference latency, and diagnostic accuracy. Our findings demonstrate that while larger architectures (e.g., ResNet152, VGG19) offer marginal gains in accuracy, their computational cost is prohibitive for real-time edge use. The proposed framework integrates three key innovations: model quantization for memory-efficient inference (68% reduction in size), Raspberry Pi-optimized vision pipelines, and secure IoT communication for clinical alerts. This work conclusively shows that lightweight, optimized models such as the MobileNet offer the most viable foundation for scalable, low-cost, and clinically actionable NICU monitoring systems, paving the way for improved preterm care in resource-constrained environments.</description>

Abstract: This paper does not introduce a novel method per se. Instead, we address the neglected potential of hard negative samples in self-supervised learning. Previous works explored synthetic hard negatives but rarely in the context of vision transformers. We build on this observation and integrate synthetic hard negatives to improve vision transformer representation learning. This simple yet effective technique notably improves the discriminative power of learned representations. Our experiments show performance improvements for both DeiT-S and Swin-T architectures.</description>

      <title>See No Evil: Adversarial Attacks Against Linguistic-Visual Association in Referring Multi-Object Tracking Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Language-vision understanding has driven the development of advanced perception systems, most notably the emerging paradigm of Referring Multi-Object Tracking (RMOT). By leveraging natural-language queries, RMOT systems can selectively track objects that satisfy a given semantic description, guided through Transformer-based spatial-temporal reasoning modules. End-to-End (E2E) RMOT models further unify feature extraction, temporal memory, and spatial reasoning within a Transformer backbone, enabling long-range spatial-temporal modeling over fused textual-visual representations. Despite these advances, the reliability and robustness of RMOT remain underexplored. In this paper, we examine the security implications of RMOT systems from a design-logic perspective, identifying adversarial vulnerabilities that compromise both the linguistic-visual referring and track-object matching components. Additionally, we uncover a novel vulnerability in advanced RMOT models employing FIFO-based memory, whereby targeted and consistent attacks on their spatial-temporal reasoning introduce errors that persist within the history buffer over multiple subsequent frames. We present VEIL, a novel adversarial framework designed to disrupt the unified referring-matching mechanisms of RMOT models. We show that carefully crafted digital and physical perturbations can corrupt the tracking logic reliability, inducing track ID switches and terminations. We conduct comprehensive evaluations using the Refer-KITTI dataset to validate the effectiveness of VEIL and demonstrate the urgent need for security-aware RMOT designs for critical large-scale applications.</description>

      <title>Fake &amp; Square: Training Self-Supervised Vision Transformers with Synthetic Data and Synthetic Hard Negatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper does not introduce a new method per se. Instead, we build on existing self-supervised learning approaches for vision, drawing inspiration from the adage "fake it till you make it". While contrastive self-supervised learning has achieved remarkable success, it typically relies on vast amounts of real-world data and carefully curated hard negatives. To explore alternatives to these requirements, we investigate two forms of "faking it" in vision transformers. First, we study the potential of generative models for unsupervised representation learning, leveraging synthetic data to augment sample diversity. Second, we examine the feasibility of generating synthetic hard negatives in the representation space, creating diverse and challenging contrasts. Our framework - dubbed Syn2Co - combines both approaches and evaluates whether synthetically enhanced training can lead to more robust and transferable visual representations on DeiT-S and Swin-T architectures. Our findings highlight the promise and limitations of synthetic data in self-supervised learning, offering insights for future work in this direction.</description>

      <title>ContextFusion and Bootstrap: An Effective Approach to Improve Slot Attention-Based Object-Centric Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A key human ability is to decompose a scene into distinct objects and use their relationships to understand the environment. Object-centric learning aims to mimic this process in an unsupervised manner. Recently, the slot attention-based framework has emerged as a leading approach in this area and has been widely used in various downstream tasks. However, existing slot attention methods face two key limitations: (1) a lack of high-level semantic information. In current methods, image areas are assigned to slots based on low-level features such as color and texture. This makes the model overly sensitive to low-level features and limits its understanding of object contours, shapes, or other semantic characteristics. (2) The inability to fine-tune the encoder. Current methods require a stable feature space throughout training to enable reconstruction from slots, which restricts the flexibility needed for effective object-centric learning. To address these limitations, we propose a novel ContextFusion stage and a Bootstrap Branch, both of which can be seamlessly integrated into existing slot attention models. In the ContextFusion stage, we exploit semantic information from the foreground and background, incorporating an auxiliary indicator that provides additional contextual cues about them to enrich the semantic content beyond low-level features. In the Bootstrap Branch, we decouple feature adaptation from the original reconstruction phase and introduce a bootstrap strategy to train a feature-adaptive mechanism, allowing for more flexible adaptation. Experimental results show that our method significantly improves the performance of different SOTA slot attention models on both simulated and real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>A Data-Centric Approach to Pedestrian Attribute Recognition: Synthetic Augmentation via Prompt-driven Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pedestrian Attribute Recognition (PAR) is a challenging task as models are required to generalize across numerous attributes in real-world data. Traditional approaches focus on complex methods, yet recognition performance is often constrained by training dataset limitations, particularly the under-representation of certain attributes. In this paper, we propose a data-centric approach to improve PAR by synthetic data augmentation guided by textual descriptions. First, we define a protocol to identify weakly recognized attributes across multiple datasets. Second, we propose a prompt-driven pipeline that leverages diffusion models to generate synthetic pedestrian images while preserving the consistency of PAR datasets. Finally, we derive a strategy to seamlessly incorporate synthetic samples into training data, which considers prompt-based annotation rules and modifies the loss function. Results on popular PAR datasets demonstrate that our approach not only boosts recognition of underrepresented attributes but also improves overall model performance beyond the targeted attributes. Notably, this approach strengthens zero-shot generalization without requiring architectural changes of the model, presenting an efficient and scalable solution to improve the recognition of attributes of pedestrians in the real world.</description>

      <title>SALAD -- Semantics-Aware Logical Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent surface anomaly detection methods excel at identifying structural anomalies, such as dents and scratches, but struggle with logical anomalies, such as irregular or missing object components. The best-performing logical anomaly detection approaches rely on aggregated pretrained features or handcrafted descriptors (most often derived from composition maps), which discard spatial and semantic information, leading to suboptimal performance. We propose SALAD, a semantics-aware discriminative logical anomaly detection method that incorporates a newly proposed composition branch to explicitly model the distribution of object composition maps, consequently learning important semantic relationships. Additionally, we introduce a novel procedure for extracting composition maps that requires no hand-made labels or category-specific information, in contrast to previous methods. By effectively modelling the composition map distribution, SALAD significantly improves upon state-of-the-art methods on the standard benchmark for logical anomaly detection, MVTec LOCO, achieving an impressive image-level AUROC of 96.1%.

      <title>NOOUGAT: Towards Unified Online and Offline Multi-Object Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The long-standing division between \textit{online} and \textit{offline} Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) has led to fragmented solutions that fail to address the flexible temporal requirements of real-world deployment scenarios. Current \textit{online} trackers rely on frame-by-frame hand-crafted association strategies and struggle with long-term occlusions, whereas \textit{offline} approaches can cover larger time gaps, but still rely on heuristic stitching for arbitrarily long sequences. In this paper, we introduce NOOUGAT, the first tracker designed to operate with arbitrary temporal horizons. NOOUGAT leverages a unified Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework that processes non-overlapping subclips, and fuses them through a novel Autoregressive Long-term Tracking (ALT) layer. The subclip size controls the trade-off between latency and temporal context, enabling a wide range of deployment scenarios, from frame-by-frame to batch processing. NOOUGAT achieves state-of-the-art performance across both tracking regimes, improving \textit{online} AssA by +2.3 on DanceTrack, +9.2 on SportsMOT, and +5.0 on MOT20, with even greater gains in \textit{offline} mode.</description>

      <title>SegFormer Fine-Tuning with Dropout: Advancing Hair Artifact Removal in Skin Lesion Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hair artifacts in dermoscopic images present significant challenges for accurate skin lesion analysis, potentially obscuring critical diagnostic features in dermatological assessments. This work introduces a fine-tuned SegFormer model augmented with dropout regularization to achieve precise hair mask segmentation. The proposed SegformerWithDropout architecture leverages the MiT-B2 encoder, pretrained on ImageNet, with an in-channel count of 3 and 2 output classes, incorporating a dropout probability of 0.3 in the segmentation head to prevent overfitting. Training is conducted on a specialized dataset of 500 dermoscopic skin lesion images with fine-grained hair mask annotations, employing 10-fold cross-validation, AdamW optimization with a learning rate of 0.001, and cross-entropy loss. Early stopping is applied based on validation loss, with a patience of 3 epochs and a maximum of 20 epochs per fold. Performance is evaluated using a comprehensive suite of metrics, including Intersection over Union (IoU), Dice coefficient, Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), and Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS). Experimental results from the cross-validation demonstrate robust performance, with average Dice coefficients reaching approximately 0.96 and IoU values of 0.93, alongside favorable PSNR (around 34 dB), SSIM (0.97), and low LPIPS (0.06), highlighting the model's effectiveness in accurate hair artifact segmentation and its potential to enhance preprocessing for downstream skin cancer detection tasks.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Zero-Shot Pedestrian Attribute Recognition with Synthetic Data Generation: A Comparative Study with Image-To-Image Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pedestrian Attribute Recognition (PAR) involves identifying various human attributes from images with applications in intelligent monitoring systems. The scarcity of large-scale annotated datasets hinders the generalization of PAR models, specially in complex scenarios involving occlusions, varying poses, and diverse environments. Recent advances in diffusion models have shown promise for generating diverse and realistic synthetic images, allowing to expand the size and variability of training data. However, the potential of diffusion-based data expansion for generating PAR-like images remains underexplored. Such expansion may enhance the robustness and adaptability of PAR models in real-world scenarios. This paper investigates the effectiveness of diffusion models in generating synthetic pedestrian images tailored to PAR tasks. We identify key parameters of img2img diffusion-based data expansion; including text prompts, image properties, and the latest enhancements in diffusion-based data augmentation, and examine their impact on the quality of generated images for PAR. Furthermore, we employ the best-performing expansion approach to generate synthetic images for training PAR models, by enriching the zero-shot datasets. Experimental results show that prompt alignment and image properties are critical factors in image generation, with optimal selection leading to a 4.5% improvement in PAR recognition performance.</description>

      <title>Omnidirectional Spatial Modeling from Correlated Panoramas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Omnidirectional scene understanding is vital for various downstream applications, such as embodied AI, autonomous driving, and immersive environments, yet remains challenging due to geometric distortion and complex spatial relations in 360{\deg} imagery. Existing omnidirectional methods achieve scene understanding within a single frame while neglecting cross-frame correlated panoramas. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{CFpano}, the \textbf{first} benchmark dataset dedicated to cross-frame correlated panoramas visual question answering in the holistic 360{\deg} scenes. CFpano consists of over 2700 images together with over 8000 question-answer pairs, and the question types include both multiple choice and open-ended VQA. Building upon our CFpano, we further present \methodname, a multi-modal large language model (MLLM) fine-tuned with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and a set of tailored reward functions for robust and consistent reasoning with cross-frame correlated panoramas. Benchmark experiments with existing MLLMs are conducted with our CFpano. The experimental results demonstrate that \methodname achieves state-of-the-art performance across both multiple-choice and open-ended VQA tasks, outperforming strong baselines on all major reasoning categories (\textbf{+5.37\%} in overall performance). Our analyses validate the effectiveness of GRPO and establish a new benchmark for panoramic scene understanding.</description>

      <title>Understanding Space Is Rocket Science - Only Top Reasoning Models Can Solve Spatial Understanding Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose RocketScience, an open-source contrastive VLM benchmark that tests for spatial relation understanding. It is comprised of entirely new real-world image-text pairs covering mostly relative spatial understanding and the order of objects. The benchmark is designed
  to be very easy for humans and hard for the current generation of VLMs, and this is empirically verified. Our results show a striking lack of spatial relation understanding in open source and frontier commercial VLMs and a surprisingly high performance of reasoning models. Additionally, we perform a disentanglement analysis to separate the contributions of object localization and spatial reasoning in chain-of-thought-based models and find that the performance on the benchmark is bottlenecked by spatial reasoning and not object localization capabilities.

      <title>ADVMEM: Adversarial Memory Initialization for Realistic Test-Time Adaptation via Tracklet-Based Benchmarking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel tracklet-based dataset for benchmarking test-time adaptation (TTA) methods. The aim of this dataset is to mimic the intricate challenges encountered in real-world environments such as images captured by hand-held cameras, self-driving cars, etc. The current benchmarks for TTA focus on how models face distribution shifts, when deployed, and on violations to the customary independent-and-identically-distributed (i.i.d.) assumption in machine learning. Yet, these benchmarks fail to faithfully represent realistic scenarios that naturally display temporal dependencies, such as how consecutive frames from a video stream likely show the same object across time. We address this shortcoming of current datasets by proposing a novel TTA benchmark we call the "Inherent Temporal Dependencies" (ITD) dataset. We ensure the instances in ITD naturally embody temporal dependencies by collecting them from tracklets-sequences of object-centric images we compile from the bounding boxes of an object-tracking dataset. We use ITD to conduct a thorough experimental analysis of current TTA methods, and shed light on the limitations of these methods when faced with the challenges of temporal dependencies. Moreover, we build upon these insights and propose a novel adversarial memory initialization strategy to improve memory-based TTA methods. We find this strategy substantially boosts the performance of various methods on our challenging benchmark.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the automated analysis of palmar features using machine learning techniques. We present a computer vision pipeline that extracts key characteristics from palm images, such as principal line structures, texture, and shape metrics. These features are used to train predictive models on a novel dataset curated from annotated palm images. Our approach moves beyond traditional subjective interpretation by providing a data-driven, quantitative framework for studying the correlations between palmar morphology and externally validated traits or conditions. The methodology demonstrates feasibility for applications in digital anthropometry and personalized user analytics, with potential for deployment on mobile platforms. Results indicate that machine learning models can identify complex patterns in palm data, opening avenues for research that intersects cultural practices with computational analysis.</description>

      <title>A Multimodal Cross-View Model for Predicting Postoperative Neck Pain in Cervical Spondylosis Patients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neck pain is the primary symptom of cervical spondylosis, yet its underlying mechanisms remain unclear, leading to uncertain treatment outcomes. To address the challenges of multimodal feature fusion caused by imaging differences and spatial mismatches, this paper proposes an Adaptive Bidirectional Pyramid Difference Convolution (ABPDC) module that facilitates multimodal integration by exploiting the advantages of difference convolution in texture extraction and grayscale invariance, and a Feature Pyramid Registration Auxiliary Network (FPRAN) to mitigate structural misalignment. Experiments on the MMCSD dataset demonstrate that the proposed model achieves superior prediction accuracy of postoperative neck pain recovery compared with existing methods, and ablation studies further confirm its effectiveness.</description>

      <title>DSGC-Net: A Dual-Stream Graph Convolutional Network for Crowd Counting via Feature Correlation Mining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning-based crowd counting methods have achieved remarkable progress in recent years. However, in complex crowd scenarios, existing models still face challenges when adapting to significant density distribution differences between regions. Additionally, the inconsistency of individual representations caused by viewpoint changes and body posture differences further limits the counting accuracy of the models. To address these challenges, we propose DSGC-Net, a Dual-Stream Graph Convolutional Network based on feature correlation mining. DSGC-Net introduces a Density Approximation (DA) branch and a Representation Approximation (RA) branch. By modeling two semantic graphs, it captures the potential feature correlations in density variations and representation distributions. The DA branch incorporates a density prediction module that generates the density distribution map, and constructs a density-driven semantic graph based on density similarity. The RA branch establishes a representation-driven semantic graph by computing global representation similarity. Then, graph convolutional networks are applied to the two semantic graphs separately to model the latent semantic relationships, which enhance the model's ability to adapt to density variations and improve counting accuracy in multi-view and multi-pose scenarios. Extensive experiments on three widely used datasets demonstrate that DSGC-Net outperforms current state-of-the-art methods. In particular, we achieve MAE of 48.9 and 5.9 in ShanghaiTech Part A and Part B datasets, respectively. The released code is available at: https://github.com/Wu-eon/CrowdCounting-DSGCNet.</description>

      <title>RS-OOD: A Vision-Language Augmented Framework for Out-of-Distribution Detection in Remote Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection represents a critical challenge in remote sensing applications, where reliable identification of novel or anomalous patterns is essential for autonomous monitoring, disaster response, and environmental assessment. Despite remarkable progress in OOD detection for natural images, existing methods and benchmarks remain poorly suited to remote sensing imagery due to data scarcity, complex multi-scale scene structures, and pronounced distribution shifts. To this end, we propose RS-OOD, a novel framework that leverages remote sensing-specific vision-language modeling to enable robust few-shot OOD detection. Our approach introduces three key innovations: spatial feature enhancement that improved scene discrimination, a dual-prompt alignment mechanism that cross-verifies scene context against fine-grained semantics for spatial-semantic consistency, and a confidence-guided self-training loop that dynamically mines pseudo-labels to expand training data without manual annotation. RS-OOD consistently outperforms existing methods across multiple remote sensing benchmarks and enables efficient adaptation with minimal labeled data, demonstrating the critical value of spatial-semantic integration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unstructured urban environments present unique challenges for scene understanding and generalization due to their complex and diverse layouts. We introduce SynthGenNet, a self-supervised student-teacher architecture designed to enable robust test-time domain generalization using synthetic multi-source imagery. Our contributions include the novel ClassMix++ algorithm, which blends labeled data from various synthetic sources while maintaining semantic integrity, enhancing model adaptability. We further employ Grounded Mask Consistency Loss (GMC), which leverages source ground truth to improve cross-domain prediction consistency and feature alignment. The Pseudo-Label Guided Contrastive Learning (PLGCL) mechanism is integrated into the student network to facilitate domain-invariant feature learning through iterative knowledge distillation from the teacher network. This self-supervised strategy improves prediction accuracy, addresses real-world variability, bridges the sim-to-real domain gap, and reliance on labeled target data, even in complex urban areas. Outcomes show our model outperforms the state-of-the-art (relying on single source) by achieving 50% Mean Intersection-Over-Union (mIoU) value on real-world datasets like Indian Driving Dataset (IDD).</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Loss Functions for Inference-Time Optimization in Text-to-Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models can generate stunning visuals, yet they often fail at tasks children find trivial--like placing a dog to the right of a teddy bear rather than to the left. When combinations get more unusual--a giraffe above an airplane--these failures become even more pronounced. Existing methods attempt to fix these spatial reasoning failures through model fine-tuning or test-time optimization with handcrafted losses that are suboptimal. Rather than imposing our assumptions about spatial encoding, we propose learning these objectives directly from the model's internal representations. We introduce Learn-to-Steer, a novel framework that learns data-driven objectives for test-time optimization rather than handcrafting them. Our key insight is to train a lightweight classifier that decodes spatial relationships from the diffusion model's cross-attention maps, then deploy this classifier as a learned loss function during inference. Training such classifiers poses a surprising challenge: they can take shortcuts by detecting linguistic traces rather than learning true spatial patterns. We solve this with a dual-inversion strategy that enforces geometric understanding. Our method dramatically improves spatial accuracy: from 0.20 to 0.61 on FLUX.1-dev and from 0.07 to 0.54 on SD2.1 across standard benchmarks. Moreover, our approach generalizes to multiple relations and significantly improves accuracy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Playing games is inherently human, and a lot of games are created to challenge different human characteristics. However, these tasks are often left out when evaluating the human-like nature of artificial models. The objective of this work is proposing a new approach to evaluate artificial models via board games. To this effect, we test the color perception and color naming capabilities of CLIP by playing the board game Hues &amp; Cues and assess its alignment with humans. Our experiments show that CLIP is generally well aligned with human observers, but our approach brings to light certain cultural biases and inconsistencies when dealing with different abstraction levels that are hard to identify with other testing strategies. Our findings indicate that assessing models with different tasks like board games can make certain deficiencies in the models stand out in ways that are difficult to test with the commonly used benchmarks.</description>

      <title>OmniActor: A Generalist GUI and Embodied Agent for 2D&amp;3D Worlds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models are evolving toward multimodal agents capable of proactively executing tasks. Most agent research focuses on GUI or embodied scenarios, which correspond to agents interacting with 2D virtual worlds or 3D real worlds, respectively. However, many complex tasks typically require agents to interleavely interact with these two types of environment. We initially mix GUI and embodied data to train, but find the performance degeneration brought by the data conflict. Further analysis reveals that GUI and embodied data exhibit synergy and conflict at the shallow and deep layers, respectively, which resembles the cerebrum-cerebellum mechanism in the human brain. To this end, we propose a high-performance generalist agent OmniActor, designed from both structural and data perspectives. First, we propose Layer-heterogeneity MoE to eliminate the conflict between GUI and embodied data by separating deep-layer parameters, while leverage their synergy by sharing shallow-layer parameters. By successfully leveraging the synergy and eliminating the conflict, OmniActor outperforms agents only trained by GUI or embodied data in GUI or embodied tasks. Furthermore, we unify the action spaces of GUI and embodied tasks, and collect large-scale GUI and embodied data from various sources for training. This significantly improves OmniActor under different scenarios, especially in GUI tasks. The code will be publicly available.</description>

      <title>Ordinal Adaptive Correction: A Data-Centric Approach to Ordinal Image Classification with Noisy Labels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Labeled data is a fundamental component in training supervised deep learning models for computer vision tasks. However, the labeling process, especially for ordinal image classification where class boundaries are often ambiguous, is prone to error and noise. Such label noise can significantly degrade the performance and reliability of machine learning models. This paper addresses the problem of detecting and correcting label noise in ordinal image classification tasks. To this end, a novel data-centric method called ORDinal Adaptive Correction (ORDAC) is proposed for adaptive correction of noisy labels. The proposed approach leverages the capabilities of Label Distribution Learning (LDL) to model the inherent ambiguity and uncertainty present in ordinal labels. During training, ORDAC dynamically adjusts the mean and standard deviation of the label distribution for each sample. Rather than discarding potentially noisy samples, this approach aims to correct them and make optimal use of the entire training dataset. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated on benchmark datasets for age estimation (Adience) and disease severity detection (Diabetic Retinopathy) under various asymmetric Gaussian noise scenarios. Results show that ORDAC and its extended versions (ORDAC_C and ORDAC_R) lead to significant improvements in model performance. For instance, on the Adience dataset with 40% noise, ORDAC_R reduced the mean absolute error from 0.86 to 0.62 and increased the recall metric from 0.37 to 0.49. The method also demonstrated its effectiveness in correcting intrinsic noise present in the original datasets. This research indicates that adaptive label correction using label distributions is an effective strategy to enhance the robustness and accuracy of ordinal classification models in the presence of noisy data.</description>

      <title>Category-Aware 3D Object Composition with Disentangled Texture and Shape Multi-view Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we tackle a new task of 3D object synthesis, where a 3D model is composited with another object category to create a novel 3D model. However, most existing text/image/3D-to-3D methods struggle to effectively integrate multiple content sources, often resulting in inconsistent textures and inaccurate shapes. To overcome these challenges, we propose a straightforward yet powerful approach, category+3D-to-3D (C33D), for generating novel and structurally coherent 3D models. Our method begins by rendering multi-view images and normal maps from the input 3D model, then generating a novel 2D object using adaptive text-image harmony (ATIH) with the front-view image and a text description from another object category as inputs. To ensure texture consistency, we introduce texture multi-view diffusion, which refines the textures of the remaining multi-view RGB images based on the novel 2D object. For enhanced shape accuracy, we propose shape multi-view diffusion to improve the 2D shapes of both the multi-view RGB images and the normal maps, also conditioned on the novel 2D object. Finally, these outputs are used to reconstruct a complete and novel 3D model. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, yielding impressive 3D creations, such as shark(3D)-crocodile(text) in the first row of Fig. 1.

      <title>Why Do MLLMs Struggle with Spatial Understanding? A Systematic Analysis from Data to Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatial understanding is essential for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to support perception, reasoning, and planning in embodied environments. Despite recent progress, existing studies reveal that MLLMs still struggle with spatial understanding. However, existing research lacks a comprehensive and systematic evaluation of these limitations, often restricted to isolated scenarios, such as single-view or video. In this work, we present a systematic analysis of spatial understanding from both data and architectural perspectives across three representative scenarios: single-view, multi-view, and video. We propose a benchmark named MulSeT (Multi-view Spatial Understanding Tasks), and design a series of experiments to analyze the spatial reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. From the data perspective, the performance of spatial understanding converges quickly as the training data increases, and the upper bound is relatively low, especially for tasks that require spatial imagination. This indicates that merely expanding training data is insufficient to achieve satisfactory performance. From the architectural perspective, we find that spatial understanding relies more heavily on the positional encoding within the visual encoder than within the language model, in both cascaded and native MLLMs. Moreover, we explore reasoning injection and envision future improvements through architectural design to optimize spatial understanding. These insights shed light on the limitations of current MLLMs and suggest new directions for improving spatial reasoning capabilities through data scaling and architectural tuning.</description>

      <title>MedDINOv3: How to adapt vision foundation models for medical image segmentation?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate segmentation of organs and tumors in CT and MRI scans is essential for diagnosis, treatment planning, and disease monitoring. While deep learning has advanced automated segmentation, most models remain task-specific, lacking generalizability across modalities and institutions. Vision foundation models (FMs) pretrained on billion-scale natural images offer powerful and transferable representations. However, adapting them to medical imaging faces two key challenges: (1) the ViT backbone of most foundation models still underperform specialized CNNs on medical image segmentation, and (2) the large domain gap between natural and medical images limits transferability. We introduce \textbf{MedDINOv3}, a simple and effective framework for adapting DINOv3 to medical segmentation. We first revisit plain ViTs and design a simple and effective architecture with multi-scale token aggregation. Then, we perform domain-adaptive pretraining on \textbf{CT-3M}, a curated collection of 3.87M axial CT slices, using a multi-stage DINOv3 recipe to learn robust dense features. MedDINOv3 matches or exceeds state-of-the-art performance across four segmentation benchmarks, demonstrating the potential of vision foundation models as unified backbones for medical image segmentation. The code is available at https://github.com/ricklisz/MedDINOv3.</description>

      <title>Decoupling Bidirectional Geometric Representations of 4D cost volume with 2D convolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-performance real-time stereo matching methods invariably rely on 3D regularization of the cost volume, which is unfriendly to mobile devices. And 2D regularization based methods struggle in ill-posed regions. In this paper, we present a deployment-friendly 4D cost aggregation network DBStereo, which is based on pure 2D convolutions. Specifically, we first provide a thorough analysis of the decoupling characteristics of 4D cost volume. And design a lightweight bidirectional geometry aggregation block to capture spatial and disparity representation respectively. Through decoupled learning, our approach achieves real-time performance and impressive accuracy simultaneously. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed DBStereo outperforms all existing aggregation-based methods in both inference time and accuracy, even surpassing the iterative-based method IGEV-Stereo. Our study break the empirical design of using 3D convolutions for 4D cost volume and provides a simple yet strong baseline of the proposed decouple aggregation paradigm for further study.

      <title>From Noisy Labels to Intrinsic Structure: A Geometric-Structural Dual-Guided Framework for Noise-Robust Medical Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effectiveness of convolutional neural networks in medical image segmentation relies on large-scale, high-quality annotations, which are costly and time-consuming to obtain. Even expert-labeled datasets inevitably contain noise arising from subjectivity and coarse delineations, which disrupt feature learning and adversely impact model performance. To address these challenges, this study propose a Geometric-Structural Dual-Guided Network (GSD-Net), which integrates geometric and structural cues to improve robustness against noisy annotations. It incorporates a Geometric Distance-Aware module that dynamically adjusts pixel-level weights using geometric features, thereby strengthening supervision in reliable regions while suppressing noise. A Structure-Guided Label Refinement module further refines labels with structural priors, and a Knowledge Transfer module enriches supervision and improves sensitivity to local details. To comprehensively assess its effectiveness, we evaluated GSD-Net on six publicly available datasets: four containing three types of simulated label noise, and two with multi-expert annotations that reflect real-world subjectivity and labeling inconsistencies. Experimental results demonstrate that GSD-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance under noisy annotations, achieving improvements of 2.52% on Kvasir, 22.76% on Shenzhen, 8.87% on BU-SUC, and 4.59% on BraTS2020 under SR simulated noise.

      <title>Faster and Better: Reinforced Collaborative Distillation and Self-Learning for Infrared-Visible Image Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Infrared and visible image fusion plays a critical role in enhancing scene perception by combining complementary information from different modalities. Despite recent advances, achieving high-quality image fusion with lightweight models remains a significant challenge. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel collaborative distillation and self-learning framework for image fusion driven by reinforcement learning. Unlike conventional distillation, this approach not only enables the student model to absorb image fusion knowledge from the teacher model, but more importantly, allows the student to perform self-learning on more challenging samples to enhance its capabilities. Particularly, in our framework, a reinforcement learning agent explores and identifies a more suitable training strategy for the student.The agent takes both the student's performance and the teacher-student gap as inputs, which leads to the generation of challenging samples to facilitate the student's self-learning. Simultaneously, it dynamically adjusts the teacher's guidance strength based on the student's state to optimize the knowledge transfer. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can significantly improve student performance and achieve better fusion results compared to existing techniques.</description>

      <title>Towards High-Fidelity, Identity-Preserving Real-Time Makeup Transfer: Decoupling Style Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel framework for real-time virtual makeup try-on that achieves high-fidelity, identity-preserving cosmetic transfer with robust temporal consistency. In live makeup transfer applications, it is critical to synthesize temporally coherent results that accurately replicate fine-grained makeup and preserve user's identity. However, existing methods often struggle to disentangle semitransparent cosmetics from skin tones and other identify features, causing identity shifts and raising fairness concerns. Furthermore, current methods lack real-time capabilities and fail to maintain temporal consistency, limiting practical adoption. To address these challenges, we decouple makeup transfer into two steps: transparent makeup mask extraction and graphics-based mask rendering. After the makeup extraction step, the makeup rendering can be performed in real time, enabling live makeup try-on. Our makeup extraction model trained on pseudo-ground-truth data generated via two complementary methods: a graphics-based rendering pipeline and an unsupervised k-means clustering approach. To further enhance transparency estimation and color fidelity, we propose specialized training objectives, including alpha-weighted reconstruction and lip color losses. Our method achieves robust makeup transfer across diverse poses, expressions, and skin tones while preserving temporal smoothness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing baselines in capturing fine details, maintaining temporal stability, and preserving identity integrity.</description>

      <title>RiverScope: High-Resolution River Masking Dataset</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surface water dynamics play a critical role in Earth's climate system, influencing ecosystems, agriculture, disaster resilience, and sustainable development. Yet monitoring rivers and surface water at fine spatial and temporal scales remains challenging -- especially for narrow or sediment-rich rivers that are poorly captured by low-resolution satellite data. To address this, we introduce RiverScope, a high-resolution dataset developed through collaboration between computer science and hydrology experts. RiverScope comprises 1,145 high-resolution images (covering 2,577 square kilometers) with expert-labeled river and surface water masks, requiring over 100 hours of manual annotation. Each image is co-registered with Sentinel-2, SWOT, and the SWOT River Database (SWORD), enabling the evaluation of cost-accuracy trade-offs across sensors -- a key consideration for operational water monitoring. We also establish the first global, high-resolution benchmark for river width estimation, achieving a median error of 7.2 meters -- significantly outperforming existing satellite-derived methods. We extensively evaluate deep networks across multiple architectures (e.g., CNNs and transformers), pretraining strategies (e.g., supervised and self-supervised), and training datasets (e.g., ImageNet and satellite imagery). Our best-performing models combine the benefits of transfer learning with the use of all the multispectral PlanetScope channels via learned adaptors. RiverScope provides a valuable resource for fine-scale and multi-sensor hydrological modeling, supporting climate adaptation and sustainable water management.</description>

      <title>GenCompositor: Generative Video Compositing with Diffusion Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video compositing combines live-action footage to create video production, serving as a crucial technique in video creation and film production. Traditional pipelines require intensive labor efforts and expert collaboration, resulting in lengthy production cycles and high manpower costs. To address this issue, we automate this process with generative models, called generative video compositing. This new task strives to adaptively inject identity and motion information of foreground video to the target video in an interactive manner, allowing users to customize the size, motion trajectory, and other attributes of the dynamic elements added in final video. Specifically, we designed a novel Diffusion Transformer (DiT) pipeline based on its intrinsic properties. To maintain consistency of the target video before and after editing, we revised a light-weight DiT-based background preservation branch with masked token injection. As to inherit dynamic elements from other sources, a DiT fusion block is proposed using full self-attention, along with a simple yet effective foreground augmentation for training. Besides, for fusing background and foreground videos with different layouts based on user control, we developed a novel position embedding, named Extended Rotary Position Embedding (ERoPE). Finally, we curated a dataset comprising 61K sets of videos for our new task, called VideoComp. This data includes complete dynamic elements and high-quality target videos. Experiments demonstrate that our method effectively realizes generative video compositing, outperforming existing possible solutions in fidelity and consistency.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we rethink text-to-avatar generative models by proposing TeRA, a more efficient and effective framework than the previous SDS-based models and general large 3D generative models.Our approach employs a two-stage training strategy for learning a native 3D avatar generative model. Initially, we distill a decoder to derive a structured latent space from a large human reconstruction model. Subsequently, a text-controlled latent diffusion model is trained to generate photorealistic 3D human avatars within this latent space. TeRA enhances the model performance by eliminating slow iterative optimization and enables text-based partial customization through a structured 3D human representation.Experiments have proven our approach's superiority over previous text-to-avatar generative models in subjective and objective evaluation.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic Fourier Features for Positional Encoding in Medical Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The adoption of Transformer-based architectures in the medical domain is growing rapidly. In medical imaging, the analysis of complex shapes - such as organs, tissues, or other anatomical structures - combined with the often anisotropic nature of high-dimensional images complicates these adaptations. In this study, we critically examine the role of Positional Encodings (PEs), arguing that commonly used approaches may be suboptimal for the specific challenges of medical imaging. Sinusoidal Positional Encodings (SPEs) have proven effective in vision tasks, but they struggle to preserve Euclidean distances in higher-dimensional spaces. Isotropic Fourier Feature Positional Encodings (IFPEs) have been proposed to better preserve Euclidean distances, but they lack the ability to account for anisotropy in images. To address these limitations, we propose Anisotropic Fourier Feature Positional Encoding (AFPE), a generalization of IFPE that incorporates anisotropic, class-specific, and domain-specific spatial dependencies. We systematically benchmark AFPE against commonly used PEs on multi-label classification in chest X-rays, organ classification in CT images, and ejection fraction regression in echocardiography. Our results demonstrate that choosing the correct PE can significantly improve model performance. We show that the optimal PE depends on the shape of the structure of interest and the anisotropy of the data. Finally, our proposed AFPE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art PEs in all tested anisotropic settings. We conclude that, in anisotropic medical images and videos, it is of paramount importance to choose an anisotropic PE that fits the data and the shape of interest.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Fitness Movement Recognition with Attention Mechanism and Pre-Trained Feature Extractors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fitness movement recognition, a focused subdomain of human activity recognition (HAR), plays a vital role in health monitoring, rehabilitation, and personalized fitness training by enabling automated exercise classification from video data. However, many existing deep learning approaches rely on computationally intensive 3D models, limiting their feasibility in real-time or resource-constrained settings. In this paper, we present a lightweight and effective framework that integrates pre-trained 2D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) such as ResNet50, EfficientNet, and Vision Transformers (ViT) with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network enhanced by spatial attention. These models efficiently extract spatial features while the LSTM captures temporal dependencies, and the attention mechanism emphasizes informative segments. We evaluate the framework on a curated subset of the UCF101 dataset, achieving a peak accuracy of 93.34\% with the ResNet50-based configuration. Comparative results demonstrate the superiority of our approach over several state-of-the-art HAR systems. The proposed method offers a scalable and real-time-capable solution for fitness activity recognition with broader applications in vision-based health and activity monitoring.</description>

      <title>Mix-modal Federated Learning for MRI Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) image segmentation is crucial in diagnosing and treating many diseases, such as brain tumors. Existing MRI image segmentation methods mainly fall into a centralized multimodal paradigm, which is inapplicable in engineering non-centralized mix-modal medical scenarios. In this situation, each distributed client (hospital) processes multiple mixed MRI modalities, and the modality set and image data for each client are diverse, suffering from extensive client-wise modality heterogeneity and data heterogeneity. In this paper, we first formulate non-centralized mix-modal MRI image segmentation as a new paradigm for federated learning (FL) that involves multiple modalities, called mix-modal federated learning (MixMFL). It distinguishes from existing multimodal federating learning (MulMFL) and cross-modal federating learning (CroMFL) paradigms. Then, we proposed a novel modality decoupling and memorizing mix-modal federated learning framework (MDM-MixMFL) for MRI image segmentation, which is characterized by a modality decoupling strategy and a modality memorizing mechanism. Specifically, the modality decoupling strategy disentangles each modality into modality-tailored and modality-shared information. During mix-modal federated updating, corresponding modality encoders undergo tailored and shared updating, respectively. It facilitates stable and adaptive federating aggregation of heterogeneous data and modalities from distributed clients. Besides, the modality memorizing mechanism stores client-shared modality prototypes dynamically refreshed from every modality-tailored encoder to compensate for incomplete modalities in each local client. It further benefits modality aggregation and fusion processes during mixmodal federated learning. Extensive experiments on two public datasets for MRI image segmentation demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our methods.</description>

      <title>Motion-Refined DINOSAUR for Unsupervised Multi-Object Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unsupervised multi-object discovery (MOD) aims to detect and localize distinct object instances in visual scenes without any form of human supervision. Recent approaches leverage object-centric learning (OCL) and motion cues from video to identify individual objects. However, these approaches use supervision to generate pseudo labels to train the OCL model. We address this limitation with MR-DINOSAUR -- Motion-Refined DINOSAUR -- a minimalistic unsupervised approach that extends the self-supervised pre-trained OCL model, DINOSAUR, to the task of unsupervised multi-object discovery. We generate high-quality unsupervised pseudo labels by retrieving video frames without camera motion for which we perform motion segmentation of unsupervised optical flow. We refine DINOSAUR's slot representations using these pseudo labels and train a slot deactivation module to assign slots to foreground and background. Despite its conceptual simplicity, MR-DINOSAUR achieves strong multi-object discovery results on the TRI-PD and KITTI datasets, outperforming the previous state of the art despite being fully unsupervised.</description>

      <title>FastVGGT: Training-Free Acceleration of Visual Geometry Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foundation models for 3D vision have recently demonstrated remarkable capabilities in 3D perception. However, scaling these models to long-sequence image inputs remains a significant challenge due to inference-time inefficiency. In this work, we present a detailed analysis of VGGT, a state-of-the-art feed-forward visual geometry model and identify its primary bottleneck. Visualization further reveals a token collapse phenomenon in the attention maps. Motivated by these findings, we explore the potential of token merging in the feed-forward visual geometry model. Owing to the unique architectural and task-specific properties of 3D models, directly applying existing merging techniques proves challenging. To this end, we propose FastVGGT, which, for the first time, leverages token merging in the 3D domain through a training-free mechanism for accelerating VGGT. we devise a unique token partitioning strategy tailored to 3D architectures and tasks, effectively eliminating redundant computation while preserving VGGT's powerful reconstruction capacity. Extensive experiments on multiple 3D geometry benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our approach. Notably, with 1000 input images, FastVGGT achieves a 4x speedup over VGGT while mitigating error accumulation in long-sequence scenarios. These findings underscore the potential of token merging as a principled solution for scalable 3D vision systems. Code is available at: https://mystorm16.github.io/fastvggt/.</description>

      <title>MultiStream-LLM: Bridging Modalities for Robust Sign Language Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite progress in gloss-free Sign Language Translation (SLT), monolithic end-to-end models consistently fail on two critical components of natural signing: the precise recognition of high-speed fingerspelling and the integration of asynchronous non-manual cues from the face. Recent progress in Automated Sign Language Translation with Large Language Models has side stepped this challenge, forcing a single network to learn these simultaneously resulting in poor performance when tasked with translating crucial information such as names,places, and technical terms. We introduce MultiStream-LLM, a modular framework designed to overcome these limitations. Our approach employs separate, specialized predictors for continuous signing, fingerspelling, and lipreading. Each expert network first decodes its specific modality into a sequence of tokens. These parallel streams are then fused by a lightweight transformer that resolves temporal misalignments before passing the combined representation to a Large Language Model (LLM) for final sentence generation. Our method establishes a new state-of-the-art on the How2Sign benchmark with a BLEU-4 score of 23.5 and achieves 73.2% letter accuracy on the challenging ChicagoFSWildPlus fingerspelling dataset. These results validate our core hypothesis: by isolating and solving distinct recogni tion tasks before fusion, our multi-expert approach provides a more powerful and effective pathway to robust, high-fidelity sign language translation.</description>

      <title>A-FloPS: Accelerating Diffusion Sampling with Adaptive Flow Path Sampler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models deliver state-of-the-art generative performance across diverse modalities but remain computationally expensive due to their inherently iterative sampling process. Existing training-free acceleration methods typically improve numerical solvers for the reverse-time ODE, yet their effectiveness is fundamentally constrained by the inefficiency of the underlying sampling trajectories. We propose A-FloPS (Adaptive Flow Path Sampler), a principled, training-free framework that reparameterizes the sampling trajectory of any pre-trained diffusion model into a flow-matching form and augments it with an adaptive velocity decomposition. The reparameterization analytically maps diffusion scores to flow-compatible velocities, yielding integration-friendly trajectories without retraining. The adaptive mechanism further factorizes the velocity field into a linear drift term and a residual component whose temporal variation is actively suppressed, restoring the accuracy benefits of high-order integration even in extremely low-NFE regimes. Extensive experiments on conditional image generation and text-to-image synthesis show that A-FloPS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art training-free samplers in both sample quality and efficiency. Notably, with as few as $5$ function evaluations, A-FloPS achieves substantially lower FID and generates sharper, more coherent images. The adaptive mechanism also improves native flow-based generative models, underscoring its generality. These results position A-FloPS as a versatile and effective solution for high-quality, low-latency generative modeling.</description>

      <title>Lightning Fast Caching-based Parallel Denoising Prediction for Accelerating Talking Head Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion-based talking head models generate high-quality, photorealistic videos but suffer from slow inference, limiting practical applications. Existing acceleration methods for general diffusion models fail to exploit the temporal and spatial redundancies unique to talking head generation. In this paper, we propose a task-specific framework addressing these inefficiencies through two key innovations. First, we introduce Lightning-fast Caching-based Parallel denoising prediction (LightningCP), caching static features to bypass most model layers in inference time. We also enable parallel prediction using cached features and estimated noisy latents as inputs, efficiently bypassing sequential sampling. Second, we propose Decoupled Foreground Attention (DFA) to further accelerate attention computations, exploiting the spatial decoupling in talking head videos to restrict attention to dynamic foreground regions. Additionally, we remove reference features in certain layers to bring extra speedup. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework significantly improves inference speed while preserving video quality.</description>

      <title>From Data to Decision: A Multi-Stage Framework for Class Imbalance Mitigation in Optical Network Failure Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning-based failure management in optical networks has gained significant attention in recent years. However, severe class imbalance, where normal instances vastly outnumber failure cases, remains a considerable challenge. While pre- and in-processing techniques have been widely studied, post-processing methods are largely unexplored. In this work, we present a direct comparison of pre-, in-, and post-processing approaches for class imbalance mitigation in failure detection and identification using an experimental dataset. For failure detection, post-processing methods-particularly Threshold Adjustment-achieve the highest F1 score improvement (up to 15.3%), while Random Under-Sampling provides the fastest inference. In failure identification, GenAI methods deliver the most substantial performance gains (up to 24.2%), whereas post-processing shows limited impact in multi-class settings. When class overlap is present and latency is critical, over-sampling methods such as the SMOTE are most effective; without latency constraints, Meta-Learning yields the best results. In low-overlap scenarios, Generative AI approaches provide the highest performance with minimal inference time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robotic practices on the construction site emerge as an attention-attracting manner owing to their capability of tackle complex challenges, especially in the rebar-involved scenarios. Most of existing products and research are mainly focused on flat rebar setting with model training demands. To fulfill this gap, we propose OpenTie, a 3D training-free rebar tying framework utilizing a RGB-to-point-cloud generation and an open-vocabulary detection. We implements the OpenTie via a robotic arm with a binocular camera and guarantees a high accuracy by applying the prompt-based object detection method on the image filtered by our propose post-processing procedure based a image to point cloud generation framework. The system is flexible for horizontal and vertical rebar tying tasks and the experiments on the real-world rebar setting verifies that the effectiveness of the system in practice.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Perception and Equivariant Diffusion for Robust Multi-Node Rebar Tying</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rebar tying is a repetitive but critical task in reinforced concrete construction, typically performed manually at considerable ergonomic risk. Recent advances in robotic manipulation hold the potential to automate the tying process, yet face challenges in accurately estimating tying poses in congested rebar nodes. In this paper, we introduce a hybrid perception and motion planning approach that integrates geometry-based perception with Equivariant Denoising Diffusion on SE(3) (Diffusion-EDFs) to enable robust multi-node rebar tying with minimal training data. Our perception module utilizes density-based clustering (DBSCAN), geometry-based node feature extraction, and principal component analysis (PCA) to segment rebar bars, identify rebar nodes, and estimate orientation vectors for sequential ranking, even in complex, unstructured environments. The motion planner, based on Diffusion-EDFs, is trained on as few as 5-10 demonstrations to generate sequential end-effector poses that optimize collision avoidance and tying efficiency. The proposed system is validated on various rebar meshes, including single-layer, multi-layer, and cluttered configurations, demonstrating high success rates in node detection and accurate sequential tying. Compared with conventional approaches that rely on large datasets or extensive manual parameter tuning, our method achieves robust, efficient, and adaptable multi-node tying while significantly reducing data requirements. This result underscores the potential of hybrid perception and diffusion-driven planning to enhance automation in on-site construction tasks, improving both safety and labor efficiency.</description>

      <title>Progressive Element-wise Gradient Estimation for Neural Network Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural network quantization aims to reduce the bit-widths of weights and activations, making it a critical technique for deploying deep neural networks on resource-constrained hardware. Most Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) methods rely on the Straight-Through Estimator (STE) to address the non-differentiability of discretization functions by replacing their derivatives with that of the identity function. While effective, STE overlooks discretization errors between continuous and quantized values, which can lead to accuracy degradation -- especially at extremely low bit-widths. In this paper, we propose Progressive Element-wise Gradient Estimation (PEGE), a simple yet effective alternative to STE, which can be seamlessly integrated with any forward propagation methods and improves the quantized model accuracy. PEGE progressively replaces full-precision weights and activations with their quantized counterparts via a novel logarithmic curriculum-driven mixed-precision replacement strategy. Then it formulates QAT as a co-optimization problem that simultaneously minimizes the task loss for prediction and the discretization error for quantization, providing a unified and generalizable framework. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet across various architectures (e.g., ResNet, VGG) demonstrate that PEGE consistently outperforms existing backpropagation methods and enables low-precision models to match or even outperform the accuracy of their full-precision counterparts.</description>

      <title>3D-LATTE: Latent Space 3D Editing from Textual Instructions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the recent success of multi-view diffusion models for text/image-based 3D asset generation, instruction-based editing of 3D assets lacks surprisingly far behind the quality of generation models. The main reason is that recent approaches using 2D priors suffer from view-inconsistent editing signals. Going beyond 2D prior distillation methods and multi-view editing strategies, we propose a training-free editing method that operates within the latent space of a native 3D diffusion model, allowing us to directly manipulate 3D geometry. We guide the edit synthesis by blending 3D attention maps from the generation with the source object. Coupled with geometry-aware regularization guidance, a spectral modulation strategy in the Fourier domain and a refinement step for 3D enhancement, our method outperforms previous 3D editing methods enabling high-fidelity, precise, and robust edits across a wide range of shapes and semantic manipulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This thesis introduces "Embodied Spatial Intelligence" to address the challenge of creating robots that can perceive and act in the real world based on natural language instructions. To bridge the gap between Large Language Models (LLMs) and physical embodiment, we present contributions on two fronts: scene representation and spatial reasoning. For perception, we develop robust, scalable, and accurate scene representations using implicit neural models, with contributions in self-supervised camera calibration, high-fidelity depth field generation, and large-scale reconstruction. For spatial reasoning, we enhance the spatial capabilities of LLMs by introducing a novel navigation benchmark, a method for grounding language in 3D, and a state-feedback mechanism to improve long-horizon decision-making. This work lays a foundation for robots that can robustly perceive their surroundings and intelligently act upon complex, language-based commands.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The trajectory data of traffic participants (TPs) is a fundamental resource for evaluating traffic conditions and optimizing policies, especially at urban intersections. Although data acquisition using drones is efficient, existing datasets still have limitations in scene representativeness, information richness, and data fidelity. This study introduces FLUID, comprising a fine-grained trajectory dataset that captures dense conflicts at typical urban signalized intersections, and a lightweight, full-pipeline framework for drone-based trajectory processing. FLUID covers three distinct intersection types, with approximately 5 hours of recording time and featuring over 20,000 TPs across 8 categories. Notably, the dataset averages two vehicle conflicts per minute, involving roughly 25% of all motor vehicles. FLUID provides comprehensive data, including trajectories, traffic signals, maps, and raw videos. Comparison with the DataFromSky platform and ground-truth measurements validates its high spatio-temporal accuracy. Through a detailed classification of motor vehicle conflicts and violations, FLUID reveals a diversity of interactive behaviors, demonstrating its value for human preference mining, traffic behavior modeling, and autonomous driving research.</description>

      <title>LatentEdit: Adaptive Latent Control for Consistent Semantic Editing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion-based Image Editing has achieved significant success in recent years. However, it remains challenging to achieve high-quality image editing while maintaining the background similarity without sacrificing speed or memory efficiency. In this work, we introduce LatentEdit, an adaptive latent fusion framework that dynamically combines the current latent code with a reference latent code inverted from the source image. By selectively preserving source features in high-similarity, semantically important regions while generating target content in other regions guided by the target prompt, LatentEdit enables fine-grained, controllable editing. Critically, the method requires no internal model modifications or complex attention mechanisms, offering a lightweight, plug-and-play solution compatible with both UNet-based and DiT-based architectures. Extensive experiments on the PIE-Bench dataset demonstrate that our proposed LatentEdit achieves an optimal balance between fidelity and editability, outperforming the state-of-the-art method even in 8-15 steps. Additionally, its inversion-free variant further halves the number of neural function evaluations and eliminates the need for storing any intermediate variables, substantially enhancing real-time deployment efficiency.</description>

      <title>Integrated Multivariate Segmentation Tree for the Analysis of Heterogeneous Credit Data in Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional decision tree models, which rely exclusively on numerical variables, often encounter difficulties in handling high-dimensional data and fail to effectively incorporate textual information. To address these limitations, we propose the Integrated Multivariate Segmentation Tree (IMST), a comprehensive framework designed to enhance credit evaluation for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) by integrating financial data with textual sources. The methodology comprises three core stages: (1) transforming textual data into numerical matrices through matrix factorization; (2) selecting salient financial features using Lasso regression; and (3) constructing a multivariate segmentation tree based on the Gini index or Entropy, with weakest-link pruning applied to regulate model complexity. Experimental results derived from a dataset of 1,428 Chinese SMEs demonstrate that IMST achieves an accuracy of 88.9%, surpassing baseline decision trees (87.4%) as well as conventional models such as logistic regression and support vector machines (SVM). Furthermore, the proposed model exhibits superior interpretability and computational efficiency, featuring a more streamlined architecture and enhanced risk detection capabilities.</description>

Abstract: Free-roaming dollies enhance filmmaking with dynamic movement, but challenges in automated camera control remain unresolved. Our study advances this field by applying Reinforcement Learning (RL) to automate dolly-in shots using free-roaming ground-based filming robots, overcoming traditional control hurdles. We demonstrate the effectiveness of combined control for precise film tasks by comparing it to independent control strategies. Our robust RL pipeline surpasses traditional Proportional-Derivative controller performance in simulation and proves its efficacy in real-world tests on a modified ROSBot 2.0 platform equipped with a camera turret. This validates our approach's practicality and sets the stage for further research in complex filming scenarios, contributing significantly to the fusion of technology with cinematic creativity. This work presents a leap forward in the field and opens new avenues for research and development, effectively bridging the gap between technological advancement and creative filmmaking.</description>

      <title>Galaxea Open-World Dataset and G0 Dual-System VLA Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Galaxea Open-World Dataset, a large-scale, diverse collection of robot behaviors recorded in authentic human living and working environments. All demonstrations are gathered using a consistent robotic embodiment, paired with precise subtask-level language annotations to facilitate both training and evaluation. Building on this dataset, we introduce G0, a dual-system framework that couples a Vision-Language Model (VLM) for multimodal planning with a Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model for fine-grained execution. G0 is trained using a three-stage curriculum: cross-embodiment pre-training, single-embodiment pre-training, and task-specific post-training. A comprehensive benchmark spanning tabletop manipulation, few-shot learning, and long-horizon mobile manipulation, demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach. In particular, we find that the single-embodiment pre-training stage, together with the Galaxea Open-World Dataset, plays a critical role in achieving strong performance.</description>

      <title>Promptable Longitudinal Lesion Segmentation in Whole-Body CT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate segmentation of lesions in longitudinal whole-body CT is essential for monitoring disease progression and treatment response. While automated methods benefit from incorporating longitudinal information, they remain limited in their ability to consistently track individual lesions across time. Task 2 of the autoPET/CT IV Challenge addresses this by providing lesion localizations and baseline delineations, framing the problem as longitudinal promptable segmentation. In this work, we extend the recently proposed LongiSeg framework with promptable capabilities, enabling lesion-specific tracking through point and mask interactions. To address the limited size of the provided training set, we leverage large-scale pretraining on a synthetic longitudinal CT dataset. Our experiments show that pretraining substantially improves the ability to exploit longitudinal context, yielding an improvement of up to 6 Dice points compared to models trained from scratch. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of combining longitudinal context with interactive prompting for robust lesion tracking. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/LongiSeg/tree/autoPET.</description>

      <title>AMCR: A Framework for Assessing and Mitigating Copyright Risks in Generative Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative models have achieved impressive results in text to image tasks, significantly advancing visual content creation. However, this progress comes at a cost, as such models rely heavily on large-scale training data and may unintentionally replicate copyrighted elements, creating serious legal and ethical challenges for real-world deployment. To address these concerns, researchers have proposed various strategies to mitigate copyright risks, most of which are prompt based methods that filter or rewrite user inputs to prevent explicit infringement. While effective in handling obvious cases, these approaches often fall short in more subtle situations, where seemingly benign prompts can still lead to infringing outputs. To address these limitations, this paper introduces Assessing and Mitigating Copyright Risks (AMCR), a comprehensive framework which i) builds upon prompt-based strategies by systematically restructuring risky prompts into safe and non-sensitive forms, ii) detects partial infringements through attention-based similarity analysis, and iii) adaptively mitigates risks during generation to reduce copyright violations without compromising image quality. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of AMCR in revealing and mitigating latent copyright risks, offering practical insights and benchmarks for the safer deployment of generative models.</description>

      <title>IntrinsicReal: Adapting IntrinsicAnything from Synthetic to Real Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estimating albedo (a.k.a., intrinsic image decomposition) from single RGB images captured in real-world environments (e.g., the MVImgNet dataset) presents a significant challenge due to the absence of paired images and their ground truth albedos. Therefore, while recent methods (e.g., IntrinsicAnything) have achieved breakthroughs by harnessing powerful diffusion priors, they remain predominantly trained on large-scale synthetic datasets (e.g., Objaverse) and applied directly to real-world RGB images, which ignores the large domain gap between synthetic and real-world data and leads to suboptimal generalization performance. In this work, we address this gap by proposing IntrinsicReal, a novel domain adaptation framework that bridges the above-mentioned domain gap for real-world intrinsic image decomposition. Specifically, our IntrinsicReal adapts IntrinsicAnything to the real domain by fine-tuning it using its high-quality output albedos selected by a novel dual pseudo-labeling strategy: i) pseudo-labeling with an absolute confidence threshold on classifier predictions, and ii) pseudo-labeling using the relative preference ranking of classifier predictions for individual input objects. This strategy is inspired by human evaluation, where identifying the highest-quality outputs is straightforward, but absolute scores become less reliable for sub-optimal cases. In these situations, relative comparisons of outputs become more accurate. To implement this, we propose a novel two-phase pipeline that sequentially applies these pseudo-labeling techniques to effectively adapt IntrinsicAnything to the real domain. Experimental results show that our IntrinsicReal significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art results for albedo estimation on both synthetic and real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>Energy Efficient Exact and Approximate Systolic Array Architecture for Matrix Multiplication</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) require highly efficient matrix multiplication engines for complex computations. This paper presents a systolic array architecture incorporating novel exact and approximate processing elements (PEs), designed using energy-efficient positive partial product and negative partial product cells, termed as PPC and NPPC, respectively. The proposed 8-bit exact and approximate PE designs are employed in a 8x8 systolic array, which achieves a energy savings of 22% and 32%, respectively, compared to the existing design. To demonstrate their effectiveness, the proposed PEs are integrated into a systolic array (SA) for Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) computation, achieving high output quality with a PSNR of 38.21,dB. Furthermore, in an edge detection application using convolution, the approximate PE achieves a PSNR of 30.45,dB. These results highlight the potential of the proposed design to deliver significant energy efficiency while maintaining competitive output quality, making it well-suited for error-resilient image and vision processing applications.</description>

      <title>Can General-Purpose Omnimodels Compete with Specialists? A Case Study in Medical Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emergence of powerful, general-purpose omnimodels capable of processing diverse data modalities has raised a critical question: can these ``jack-of-all-trades'' systems perform on par with highly specialized models in knowledge-intensive domains? This work investigates this question within the high-stakes field of medical image segmentation. We conduct a comparative study analyzing the zero-shot performance of a state-of-the-art omnimodel (Gemini 2.5 Pro, the ``Nano Banana'' model) against domain-specific deep learning models on three distinct tasks: polyp (endoscopy), retinal vessel (fundus), and breast tumor segmentation (ultrasound). Our study focuses on performance at the extremes by curating subsets of the ``easiest'' and ``hardest'' cases based on the specialist models' accuracy. Our findings reveal a nuanced and task-dependent landscape. For polyp and breast tumor segmentation, specialist models excel on easy samples, but the omnimodel demonstrates greater robustness on hard samples where specialists fail catastrophically. Conversely, for the fine-grained task of retinal vessel segmentation, the specialist model maintains superior performance across both easy and hard cases. Intriguingly, qualitative analysis suggests omnimodels may possess higher sensitivity, identifying subtle anatomical features missed by human annotators. Our results indicate that while current omnimodels are not yet a universal replacement for specialists, their unique strengths suggest a potential complementary role with specialist models, particularly in enhancing robustness on challenging edge cases.</description>

      <title>Towards Early Detection: AI-Based Five-Year Forecasting of Breast Cancer Risk Using Digital Breast Tomosynthesis Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As early detection of breast cancer strongly favors successful therapeutic outcomes, there is major commercial interest in optimizing breast cancer screening. However, current risk prediction models achieve modest performance and do not incorporate digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) imaging, which was FDA-approved for breast cancer screening in 2011. To address this unmet need, we present a deep learning (DL)-based framework capable of forecasting an individual patient's 5-year breast cancer risk directly from screening DBT. Using an unparalleled dataset of 161,753 DBT examinations from 50,590 patients, we trained a risk predictor based on features extracted using the Meta AI DINOv2 image encoder, combined with a cumulative hazard layer, to assess a patient's likelihood of developing breast cancer over five years. On a held-out test set, our best-performing model achieved an AUROC of 0.80 on predictions within 5 years. These findings reveal the high potential of DBT-based DL approaches to complement traditional risk assessment tools, and serve as a promising basis for additional investigation to validate and enhance our work.</description>

      <title>GS-TG: 3D Gaussian Splatting Accelerator with Tile Grouping for Reducing Redundant Sorting while Preserving Rasterization Efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) has emerged as a promising alternative to neural radiance fields (NeRF) as it offers high speed as well as high image quality in novel view synthesis. Despite these advancements, 3D-GS still struggles to meet the frames per second (FPS) demands of real-time applications. In this paper, we introduce GS-TG, a tile-grouping-based accelerator that enhances 3D-GS rendering speed by reducing redundant sorting operations and preserving rasterization efficiency. GS-TG addresses a critical trade-off issue in 3D-GS rendering: increasing the tile size effectively reduces redundant sorting operations, but it concurrently increases unnecessary rasterization computations. So, during sorting of the proposed approach, GS-TG groups small tiles (for making large tiles) to share sorting operations across tiles within each group, significantly reducing redundant computations. During rasterization, a bitmask assigned to each Gaussian identifies relevant small tiles, to enable efficient sharing of sorting results. Consequently, GS-TG enables sorting to be performed as if a large tile size is used by grouping tiles during the sorting stage, while allowing rasterization to proceed with the original small tiles by using bitmasks in the rasterization stage. GS-TG is a lossless method requiring no retraining or fine-tuning and it can be seamlessly integrated with previous 3D-GS optimization techniques. Experimental results show that GS-TG achieves an average speed-up of 1.54 times over state-of-the-art 3D-GS accelerators.</description>

      <title>Protocol for Clustering 4DSTEM Data for Phase Differentiation in Glasses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phase-change materials (PCMs) such as Ge-Sb-Te alloys are widely used in non-volatile memory applications due to their rapid and reversible switching between amorphous and crystalline states. However, their functional properties are strongly governed by nanoscale variations in composition and structure, which are challenging to resolve using conventional techniques. Here, we apply unsupervised machine learning to 4-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) data to identify compositional and structural heterogeneity in Ge-Sb-Te. After preprocessing and dimensionality reduction with principal component analysis (PCA), cluster validation was performed with t-SNE and UMAP, followed by k-means clustering optimized through silhouette scoring. Four distinct clusters were identified which were mapped back to the diffraction data. Elemental intensity histograms revealed chemical signatures change across clusters, oxygen and germanium enrichment in Cluster 1, tellurium in Cluster 2, antimony in Cluster 3, and germanium again in Cluster 4. Furthermore, averaged diffraction patterns from these clusters confirmed structural variations. Together, these findings demonstrate that clustering analysis can provide a powerful framework for correlating local chemical and structural features in PCMs, offering deeper insights into their intrinsic heterogeneity.</description>

Abstract: To develop and externally validate integrated ultrasound nomograms combining BIRADS features and quantitative morphometric characteristics, and to compare their performance with expert radiologists and state of the art large language models in biopsy recommendation and malignancy prediction for breast lesions. In this retrospective multicenter, multinational study, 1747 women with pathologically confirmed breast lesions underwent ultrasound across three centers in Iran and Turkey. A total of 10 BIRADS and 26 morphological features were extracted from each lesion. A BIRADS, morphometric, and fused nomogram integrating both feature sets was constructed via logistic regression. Three radiologists (one senior, two general) and two ChatGPT variants independently interpreted deidentified breast lesion images. Diagnostic performance for biopsy recommendation (BIRADS 4,5) and malignancy prediction was assessed in internal and two external validation cohorts. In pooled analysis, the fused nomogram achieved the highest accuracy for biopsy recommendation (83.0%) and malignancy prediction (83.8%), outperforming the morphometric nomogram, three radiologists and both ChatGPT models. Its AUCs were 0.901 and 0.853 for the two tasks, respectively. In addition, the performance of the BIRADS nomogram was significantly higher than the morphometric nomogram, three radiologists and both ChatGPT models for biopsy recommendation and malignancy prediction. External validation confirmed the robust generalizability across different ultrasound platforms and populations. An integrated BIRADS morphometric nomogram consistently outperforms standalone models, LLMs, and radiologists in guiding biopsy decisions and predicting malignancy. These interpretable, externally validated tools have the potential to reduce unnecessary biopsies and enhance personalized decision making in breast imaging.</description>

Abstract: Many real-world datasets -- from an artist's body of work to a person's social media history -- exhibit meaningful semantic changes over time that are difficult to capture with existing dimensionality reduction methods. To address this gap, we introduce a visualization technique that combines force-based projection and streaming clustering methods to build a spatial-temporal map of embeddings. Applying this technique, we create Chronotome, a tool for interactively exploring evolving themes in time-based data -- in real time. We demonstrate the utility of our approach through use cases on text and image data, showing how it offers a new lens for understanding the aesthetics and semantics of temporal datasets.</description>

      <title>FlashAdventure: A Benchmark for GUI Agents Solving Full Story Arcs in Diverse Adventure Games</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: GUI agents powered by LLMs show promise in interacting with diverse digital environments. Among these, video games offer a valuable testbed due to their varied interfaces, with adventure games posing additional challenges through complex, narrative-driven interactions. Existing game benchmarks, however, lack diversity and rarely evaluate agents on completing entire storylines. To address this, we introduce FlashAdventure, a benchmark of 34 Flash-based adventure games designed to test full story arc completion and tackle the observation-behavior gap: the challenge of remembering and acting on earlier gameplay information. We also propose CUA-as-a-Judge, an automated gameplay evaluator, and COAST, an agentic framework leveraging long-term clue memory to better plan and solve sequential tasks. Experiments show current GUI agents struggle with full story arcs, while COAST improves milestone completion by bridging the observation-behavior gap. Nonetheless, a marked discrepancy between humans and best-performing agents warrants continued research efforts to narrow this divide.</description>

      <title>VerlTool: Towards Holistic Agentic Reinforcement Learning with Tool Use</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has demonstrated success in enhancing LLM reasoning capabilities, but remains limited to single-turn interactions without tool integration. While recent Agentic Reinforcement Learning with Tool use (ARLT) approaches have emerged to address multi-turn tool interactions, existing works develop task-specific codebases that suffer from fragmentation, synchronous execution bottlenecks, and limited extensibility across domains. These inefficiencies hinder broader community adoption and algorithmic innovation. We introduce VerlTool, a unified and modular framework that addresses these limitations through systematic design principles. VerlTool provides four key contributions: (1) upstream alignment with VeRL ensuring compatibility and simplified maintenance, (2) unified tool management via standardized APIs supporting diverse modalities including code execution, search, SQL databases, and vision processing, (3) asynchronous rollout execution achieving near 2$\times$ speedup by eliminating synchronization bottlenecks, and (4) comprehensive evaluation demonstrating competitive performance across 6 ARLT domains. Our framework formalizes ARLT as multi-turn trajectories with multi-modal observation tokens (text/image/video), extending beyond single-turn RLVR paradigms. We train and evaluate models on mathematical reasoning, knowledge QA, SQL generation, visual reasoning, web search, and software engineering tasks, achieving results comparable to specialized systems while providing unified training infrastructure. The modular plugin architecture enables rapid tool integration requiring only lightweight Python definitions, significantly reducing development overhead and providing a scalable foundation for tool-augmented RL research. Our code is open-sourced at https://github.com/TIGER-AI-Lab/verl-tool.</description>

      <title>Robix: A Unified Model for Robot Interaction, Reasoning and Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Robix, a unified model that integrates robot reasoning, task planning, and natural language interaction within a single vision-language architecture. Acting as the high-level cognitive layer in a hierarchical robot system, Robix dynamically generates atomic commands for the low-level controller and verbal responses for human interaction, enabling robots to follow complex instructions, plan long-horizon tasks, and interact naturally with human within an end-to-end framework. Robix further introduces novel capabilities such as proactive dialogue, real-time interruption handling, and context-aware commonsense reasoning during task execution. At its core, Robix leverages chain-of-thought reasoning and adopts a three-stage training strategy: (1) continued pretraining to enhance foundational embodied reasoning abilities including 3D spatial understanding, visual grounding, and task-centric reasoning; (2) supervised finetuning to model human-robot interaction and task planning as a unified reasoning-action sequence; and (3) reinforcement learning to improve reasoning-action consistency and long-horizon task coherence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Robix outperforms both open-source and commercial baselines (e.g., GPT-4o and Gemini 2.5 Pro) in interactive task execution, demonstrating strong generalization across diverse instruction types (e.g., open-ended, multi-stage, constrained, invalid, and interrupted) and various user-involved tasks such as table bussing, grocery shopping, and dietary filtering.</description>

      <title>RealMat: Realistic Materials with Diffusion and Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative models for high-quality materials are particularly desirable to make 3D content authoring more accessible. However, the majority of material generation methods are trained on synthetic data. Synthetic data provides precise supervision for material maps, which is convenient but also tends to create a significant visual gap with real-world materials. Alternatively, recent work used a small dataset of real flash photographs to guarantee realism, however such data is limited in scale and diversity. To address these limitations, we propose RealMat, a diffusion-based material generator that leverages realistic priors, including a text-to-image model and a dataset of realistic material photos under natural lighting. In RealMat, we first finetune a pretrained Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL) with synthetic material maps arranged in $2 \times 2$ grids. This way, our model inherits some realism of SDXL while learning the data distribution of the synthetic material grids. Still, this creates a realism gap, with some generated materials appearing synthetic. We propose to further finetune our model through reinforcement learning (RL), encouraging the generation of realistic materials. We develop a realism reward function for any material image under natural lighting, by collecting a large-scale dataset of realistic material images. We show that this approach increases generated materials' realism compared to our base model and related work.</description>

      <title>Learn2Reg 2024: New Benchmark Datasets Driving Progress on New Challenges</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Medical image registration is critical for clinical applications, and fair benchmarking of different methods is essential for monitoring ongoing progress. To date, the Learn2Reg 2020-2023 challenges have released several complementary datasets and established metrics for evaluations. However, these editions did not capture all aspects of the registration problem, particularly in terms of modality diversity and task complexity. To address these limitations, the 2024 edition introduces three new tasks, including large-scale multi-modal registration and unsupervised inter-subject brain registration, as well as the first microscopy-focused benchmark within Learn2Reg. The new datasets also inspired new method developments, including invertibility constraints, pyramid features, keypoints alignment and instance optimisation.</description>

      <title>Automatic Screening of Parkinson's Disease from Visual Explorations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Eye movements can reveal early signs of neurodegeneration, including those associated with Parkinson's Disease (PD). This work investigates the utility of a set of gaze-based features for the automatic screening of PD from different visual exploration tasks. For this purpose, a novel methodology is introduced, combining classic fixation/saccade oculomotor features (e.g., saccade count, fixation duration, scanned area) with features derived from gaze clusters (i.e., regions with a considerable accumulation of fixations). These features are automatically extracted from six exploration tests and evaluated using different machine learning classifiers. A Mixture of Experts ensemble is used to integrate outputs across tests and both eyes. Results show that ensemble models outperform individual classifiers, achieving an Area Under the Receiving Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC) of 0.95 on a held-out test set. The findings support visual exploration as a non-invasive tool for early automatic screening of PD.</description>

      <title>DCA: Graph-Guided Deep Embedding Clustering for Brain Atlases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Brain atlases are essential for reducing the dimensionality of neuroimaging data and enabling interpretable analysis. However, most existing atlases are predefined, group-level templates with limited flexibility and resolution. We present Deep Cluster Atlas (DCA), a graph-guided deep embedding clustering framework for generating individualized, voxel-wise brain parcellations. DCA combines a pretrained autoencoder with spatially regularized deep clustering to produce functionally coherent and spatially contiguous regions. Our method supports flexible control over resolution and anatomical scope, and generalizes to arbitrary brain structures. We further introduce a standardized benchmarking platform for atlas evaluation, using multiple large-scale fMRI datasets. Across multiple datasets and scales, DCA outperforms state-of-the-art atlases, improving functional homogeneity by 98.8\% and silhouette coefficient by 29\%, and achieves superior performance in downstream tasks such as autism diagnosis and cognitive decoding. Codes and models will be released soon.</description>

      <title>Forward-Only Continual Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting remains a central challenge in continual learning (CL) with pre-trained models. While existing approaches typically freeze the backbone and fine-tune a small number of parameters to mitigate forgetting, they still rely on iterative error backpropagation and gradient-based optimization, which can be computationally intensive and less suitable for resource-constrained environments. To address this, we propose FoRo, a forward-only, gradient-free continual learning method. FoRo consists of a lightweight prompt tuning strategy and a novel knowledge encoding mechanism, both designed without modifying the pre-trained model. Specifically, prompt embeddings are inserted at the input layer and optimized using the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES), which mitigates distribution shifts and extracts high-quality task representations. Subsequently, task-specific knowledge is encoded into a knowledge encoding matrix via nonlinear random projection and recursive least squares, enabling incremental updates to the classifier without revisiting prior data. Experiments show that FoRo significantly reduces average forgetting and improves accuracy. Thanks to forward-only learning, FoRo reduces memory usage and run time while maintaining high knowledge retention across long task sequences. These results suggest that FoRo could serve as a promising direction for exploring continual learning with pre-trained models, especially in real-world multimedia applications where both efficiency and effectiveness are critical.</description>

Abstract: This user manual is intended to provide a detailed description on model-based optimization for imaging inverse problem. Theseproblems can be particularly complex and challenging, especially for individuals without prior exposure to convex optimization orinverse problem theory, like myself. In light of this, I am writing this manual to clarify and systematically organize the mathematicalrationale underlying imaging inverse problems. This manual might not be accurate in mathmatical notion but more focus on the logicalthinking on how to solve and proceed to solve the problems. If you want to think deep about something, try to raise questions! Thismanual is seaprated into four sections, aiming to answer the following four questions: (1) What is inverse imaging problem? (2) Why optimization is used to solve the inverse imaging problem? (3) How to solve the optimization problem? (4) How to implement the optimization algorithm in real imaging system?</description>

      <title>Aleatoric Uncertainty from AI-based 6D Object Pose Predictors for Object-relative State Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep Learning (DL) has become essential in various robotics applications due to excelling at processing raw sensory data to extract task specific information from semantic objects. For example, vision-based object-relative navigation relies on a DL-based 6D object pose predictor to provide the relative pose between the object and the robot as measurements to the robot's state estimator. Accurately knowing the uncertainty inherent in such Deep Neural Network (DNN) based measurements is essential for probabilistic state estimators subsequently guiding the robot's tasks. Thus, in this letter, we show that we can extend any existing DL-based object-relative pose predictor for aleatoric uncertainty inference simply by including two multi-layer perceptrons detached from the translational and rotational part of the DL predictor. This allows for efficient training while freezing the existing pre-trained predictor. We then use the inferred 6D pose and its uncertainty as a measurement and corresponding noise covariance matrix in an extended Kalman filter (EKF). Our approach induces minimal computational overhead such that the state estimator can be deployed on edge devices while benefiting from the dynamically inferred measurement uncertainty. This increases the performance of the object-relative state estimation task compared to a fix-covariance approach. We conduct evaluations on synthetic data and real-world data to underline the benefits of aleatoric uncertainty inference for the object-relative state estimation task.</description>

      <title>Articulated Object Estimation in the Wild</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the 3D motion of articulated objects is essential in robotic scene understanding, mobile manipulation, and motion planning. Prior methods for articulation estimation have primarily focused on controlled settings, assuming either fixed camera viewpoints or direct observations of various object states, which tend to fail in more realistic unconstrained environments. In contrast, humans effortlessly infer articulation by watching others manipulate objects. Inspired by this, we introduce ArtiPoint, a novel estimation framework that can infer articulated object models under dynamic camera motion and partial observability. By combining deep point tracking with a factor graph optimization framework, ArtiPoint robustly estimates articulated part trajectories and articulation axes directly from raw RGB-D videos. To foster future research in this domain, we introduce Arti4D, the first ego-centric in-the-wild dataset that captures articulated object interactions at a scene level, accompanied by articulation labels and ground-truth camera poses. We benchmark ArtiPoint against a range of classical and learning-based baselines, demonstrating its superior performance on Arti4D. We make code and Arti4D publicly available at https://artipoint.cs.uni-freiburg.de.</description>

      <title>BM-CL: Bias Mitigation through the lens of Continual Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biases in machine learning pose significant challenges, particularly when models amplify disparities that affect disadvantaged groups. Traditional bias mitigation techniques often lead to a {\itshape leveling-down effect}, whereby improving outcomes of disadvantaged groups comes at the expense of reduced performance for advantaged groups. This study introduces Bias Mitigation through Continual Learning (BM-CL), a novel framework that leverages the principles of continual learning to address this trade-off. We postulate that mitigating bias is conceptually similar to domain-incremental continual learning, where the model must adjust to changing fairness conditions, improving outcomes for disadvantaged groups without forgetting the knowledge that benefits advantaged groups. Drawing inspiration from techniques such as Learning without Forgetting and Elastic Weight Consolidation, we reinterpret bias mitigation as a continual learning problem. This perspective allows models to incrementally balance fairness objectives, enhancing outcomes for disadvantaged groups while preserving performance for advantaged groups. Experiments on synthetic and real-world image datasets, characterized by diverse sources of bias, demonstrate that the proposed framework mitigates biases while minimizing the loss of original knowledge. Our approach bridges the fields of fairness and continual learning, offering a promising pathway for developing machine learning systems that are both equitable and effective.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR) experiences, a user's arms and hands can provide a convenient and tactile surface for touch input. Prior work has shown on-body input to have significant speed, accuracy, and ergonomic benefits over in-air interfaces, which are common today. In this work, we demonstrate high accuracy, bare hands (i.e., no special instrumentation of the user) skin input using just an RGB camera, like those already integrated into all modern XR headsets. Our results show this approach can be accurate, and robust across diverse lighting conditions, skin tones, and body motion (e.g., input while walking). Finally, our pipeline also provides rich input metadata including touch force, finger identification, angle of attack, and rotation. We believe these are the requisite technical ingredients to more fully unlock on-skin interfaces that have been well motivated in the HCI literature but have lacked robust and practical methods.</description>

      <title>HodgeFormer: Transformers for Learnable Operators on Triangular Meshes through Data-Driven Hodge Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Currently, prominent Transformer architectures applied on graphs and meshes for shape analysis tasks employ traditional attention layers that heavily utilize spectral features requiring costly eigenvalue decomposition-based methods. To encode the mesh structure, these methods derive positional embeddings, that heavily rely on eigenvalue decomposition based operations, e.g. on the Laplacian matrix, or on heat-kernel signatures, which are then concatenated to the input features. This paper proposes a novel approach inspired by the explicit construction of the Hodge Laplacian operator in Discrete Exterior Calculus as a product of discrete Hodge operators and exterior derivatives, i.e. $(L := \star_0^{-1} d_0^T \star_1 d_0)$. We adjust the Transformer architecture in a novel deep learning layer that utilizes the multi-head attention mechanism to approximate Hodge matrices $\star_0$, $\star_1$ and $\star_2$ and learn families of discrete operators $L$ that act on mesh vertices, edges and faces. Our approach results in a computationally-efficient architecture that achieves comparable performance in mesh segmentation and classification tasks, through a direct learning framework, while eliminating the need for costly eigenvalue decomposition operations or complex preprocessing operations.</description>

      <title>AI-Driven Marine Robotics: Emerging Trends in Underwater Perception and Ecosystem Monitoring</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Marine ecosystems face increasing pressure due to climate change, driving the need for scalable, AI-powered monitoring solutions. This paper examines the rapid emergence of underwater AI as a major research frontier and analyzes the factors that have transformed marine perception from a niche application into a catalyst for AI innovation. We identify three convergent drivers: environmental necessity for ecosystem-scale monitoring, democratization of underwater datasets through citizen science platforms, and researcher migration from saturated terrestrial computer vision domains. Our analysis reveals how unique underwater challenges - turbidity, cryptic species detection, expert annotation bottlenecks, and cross-ecosystem generalization - are driving fundamental advances in weakly supervised learning, open-set recognition, and robust perception under degraded conditions. We survey emerging trends in datasets, scene understanding and 3D reconstruction, highlighting the paradigm shift from passive observation toward AI-driven, targeted intervention capabilities. The paper demonstrates how underwater constraints are pushing the boundaries of foundation models, self-supervised learning, and perception, with methodological innovations that extend far beyond marine applications to benefit general computer vision, robotics, and environmental monitoring.</description>

      <title>AutoDrive-R$^2$: Incentivizing Reasoning and Self-Reflection Capacity for VLA Model in Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models in autonomous driving systems have recently demonstrated transformative potential by integrating multimodal perception with decision-making capabilities. However, the interpretability and coherence of the decision process and the plausibility of action sequences remain largely underexplored. To address these issues, we propose AutoDrive-R$^2$, a novel VLA framework that enhances both reasoning and self-reflection capabilities of autonomous driving systems through chain-of-thought (CoT) processing and reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, we first propose an innovative CoT dataset named nuScenesR$^2$-6K for supervised fine-tuning, which effectively builds cognitive bridges between input information and output trajectories through a four-step logical chain with self-reflection for validation. Moreover, to maximize both reasoning and self-reflection during the RL stage, we further employ the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm within a physics-grounded reward framework that incorporates spatial alignment, vehicle dynamic, and temporal smoothness criteria to ensure reliable and realistic trajectory planning. Extensive evaluation results across both nuScenes and Waymo datasets demonstrates the state-of-the-art performance and robust generalization capacity of our proposed method.</description>

      <title>Scale, Don't Fine-tune: Guiding Multimodal LLMs for Efficient Visual Place Recognition at Test-Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) has evolved from handcrafted descriptors to deep learning approaches, yet significant challenges remain. Current approaches, including Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), enhance semantic understanding but suffer from high computational overhead and limited cross-domain transferability when fine-tuned. To address these limitations, we propose a novel zero-shot framework employing Test-Time Scaling (TTS) that leverages MLLMs' vision-language alignment capabilities through Guidance-based methods for direct similarity scoring. Our approach eliminates two-stage processing by employing structured prompts that generate length-controllable JSON outputs. The TTS framework with Uncertainty-Aware Self-Consistency (UASC) enables real-time adaptation without additional training costs, achieving superior generalization across diverse environments. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in cross-domain VPR performance with up to 210$\times$ computational efficiency gains.</description>

      <title>GRMM: Real-Time High-Fidelity Gaussian Morphable Head Model with Learned Residuals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 3D Morphable Models (3DMMs) enable controllable facial geometry and expression editing for reconstruction, animation, and AR/VR, but traditional PCA-based mesh models are limited in resolution, detail, and photorealism. Neural volumetric methods improve realism but remain too slow for interactive use. Recent Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) based facial models achieve fast, high-quality rendering but still depend solely on a mesh-based 3DMM prior for expression control, limiting their ability to capture fine-grained geometry, expressions, and full-head coverage. We introduce GRMM, the first full-head Gaussian 3D morphable model that augments a base 3DMM with residual geometry and appearance components, additive refinements that recover high-frequency details such as wrinkles, fine skin texture, and hairline variations. GRMM provides disentangled control through low-dimensional, interpretable parameters (e.g., identity shape, facial expressions) while separately modelling residuals that capture subject- and expression-specific detail beyond the base model's capacity. Coarse decoders produce vertex-level mesh deformations, fine decoders represent per-Gaussian appearance, and a lightweight CNN refines rasterised images for enhanced realism, all while maintaining 75 FPS real-time rendering. To learn consistent, high-fidelity residuals, we present EXPRESS-50, the first dataset with 60 aligned expressions across 50 identities, enabling robust disentanglement of identity and expression in Gaussian-based 3DMMs. Across monocular 3D face reconstruction, novel-view synthesis, and expression transfer, GRMM surpasses state-of-the-art methods in fidelity and expression accuracy while delivering interactive real-time performance.</description>

      <title>Conditional-$t^3$VAE: Equitable Latent Space Allocation for Fair Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) with global priors mirror the training set's class frequency in latent space, underrepresenting tail classes and reducing generative fairness on imbalanced datasets. While $t^3$VAE improves robustness via heavy-tailed Student's t-distribution priors, it still allocates latent volume proportionally to the class frequency.In this work, we address this issue by explicitly enforcing equitable latent space allocation across classes. To this end, we propose Conditional-$t^3$VAE, which defines a per-class \mbox{Student's t} joint prior over latent and output variables, preventing dominance by majority classes. Our model is optimized using a closed-form objective derived from the $\gamma$-power divergence. Moreover, for class-balanced generation, we derive an equal-weight latent mixture of Student's t-distributions. On SVHN-LT, CIFAR100-LT, and CelebA, Conditional-$t^3$VAE consistently achieves lower FID scores than both $t^3$VAE and Gaussian-based VAE baselines, particularly under severe class imbalance. In per-class F1 evaluations, Conditional-$t^3$VAE also outperforms the conditional Gaussian VAE across all highly imbalanced settings. While Gaussian-based models remain competitive under mild imbalance ratio ($\rho \lesssim 3$), our approach substantially improves generative fairness and diversity in more extreme regimes.</description>

      <title>Efficient Pyramidal Analysis of Gigapixel Images on a Decentralized Modest Computer Cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Analyzing gigapixel images is recognized as computationally demanding. In this paper, we introduce PyramidAI, a technique for analyzing gigapixel images with reduced computational cost. The proposed approach adopts a gradual analysis of the image, beginning with lower resolutions and progressively concentrating on regions of interest for detailed examination at higher resolutions. We investigated two strategies for tuning the accuracy-computation performance trade-off when implementing the adaptive resolution selection, validated against the Camelyon16 dataset of biomedical images. Our results demonstrate that PyramidAI substantially decreases the amount of processed data required for analysis by up to 2.65x, while preserving the accuracy in identifying relevant sections on a single computer. To ensure democratization of gigapixel image analysis, we evaluated the potential to use mainstream computers to perform the computation by exploiting the parallelism potential of the approach. Using a simulator, we estimated the best data distribution and load balancing algorithm according to the number of workers. The selected algorithms were implemented and highlighted the same conclusions in a real-world setting. Analysis time is reduced from more than an hour to a few minutes using 12 modest workers, offering a practical solution for efficient large-scale image analysis.</description>

      <title>AppCopilot: Toward General, Accurate, Long-Horizon, and Efficient Mobile Agent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the raid evolution of large language models and multimodal foundation models, the mobile-agent landscape has proliferated without converging on the fundamental challenges. This paper identifies four core problems that must be solved for mobile agents to deliver practical, scalable impact: (1) generalization across tasks, modalities, apps, and devices; (2) accuracy, specifically precise on-screen interaction and click targeting; (3) long-horizon capability for sustained, multi-step goals; and (4) efficiency, specifically high-performance runtime on resource-constrained devices. We present AppCopilot, a multimodal, multi-agent, general-purpose on-device assistant that operates across applications and constitutes a full-stack, closed-loop system from data to deployment. AppCopilot operationalizes this position through an end-to-end autonomous pipeline spanning data collection, training, deployment, high-quality and efficient inference, and mobile application development. At the model layer, it integrates multimodal foundation models with robust Chinese-English support. At the reasoning and control layer, it combines chain-of-thought reasoning, hierarchical task planning and decomposition, and multi-agent collaboration. At the execution layer, it enables user personalization and experiential adaptation, voice interaction, function calling, cross-app and cross-device orchestration, and comprehensive mobile app support. The system design incorporates profiling-driven optimization for latency, memory, and energy across heterogeneous hardware. Empirically, AppCopilot achieves significant improvements along all four dimensions: stronger generalization, higher-precision on-screen actions, more reliable long-horizon task completion, and faster, more resource-efficient runtime.</description>

      <title>Unifi3D: A Study on 3D Representations for Generation and Reconstruction in a Common Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Following rapid advancements in text and image generation, research has increasingly shifted towards 3D generation. Unlike the well-established pixel-based representation in images, 3D representations remain diverse and fragmented, encompassing a wide variety of approaches such as voxel grids, neural radiance fields, signed distance functions, point clouds, or octrees, each offering distinct advantages and limitations. In this work, we present a unified evaluation framework designed to assess the performance of 3D representations in reconstruction and generation. We compare these representations based on multiple criteria: quality, computational efficiency, and generalization performance. Beyond standard model benchmarking, our experiments aim to derive best practices over all steps involved in the 3D generation pipeline, including preprocessing, mesh reconstruction, compression with autoencoders, and generation. Our findings highlight that reconstruction errors significantly impact overall performance, underscoring the need to evaluate generation and reconstruction jointly. We provide insights that can inform the selection of suitable 3D models for various applications, facilitating the development of more robust and application-specific solutions in 3D generation. The code for our framework is available at https://github.com/isl-org/unifi3d.</description>

      <title>Manipulation as in Simulation: Enabling Accurate Geometry Perception in Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern robotic manipulation primarily relies on visual observations in a 2D color space for skill learning but suffers from poor generalization. In contrast, humans, living in a 3D world, depend more on physical properties-such as distance, size, and shape-than on texture when interacting with objects. Since such 3D geometric information can be acquired from widely available depth cameras, it appears feasible to endow robots with similar perceptual capabilities. Our pilot study found that using depth cameras for manipulation is challenging, primarily due to their limited accuracy and susceptibility to various types of noise. In this work, we propose Camera Depth Models (CDMs) as a simple plugin on daily-use depth cameras, which take RGB images and raw depth signals as input and output denoised, accurate metric depth. To achieve this, we develop a neural data engine that generates high-quality paired data from simulation by modeling a depth camera's noise pattern. Our results show that CDMs achieve nearly simulation-level accuracy in depth prediction, effectively bridging the sim-to-real gap for manipulation tasks. Notably, our experiments demonstrate, for the first time, that a policy trained on raw simulated depth, without the need for adding noise or real-world fine-tuning, generalizes seamlessly to real-world robots on two challenging long-horizon tasks involving articulated, reflective, and slender objects, with little to no performance degradation. We hope our findings will inspire future research in utilizing simulation data and 3D information in general robot policies.</description>

      <title>UI-TARS-2 Technical Report: Advancing GUI Agent with Multi-Turn Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of autonomous agents for graphical user interfaces (GUIs) presents major challenges in artificial intelligence. While recent advances in native agent models have shown promise by unifying perception, reasoning, action, and memory through end-to-end learning, open problems remain in data scalability, multi-turn reinforcement learning (RL), the limitations of GUI-only operation, and environment stability. In this technical report, we present UI-TARS-2, a native GUI-centered agent model that addresses these challenges through a systematic training methodology: a data flywheel for scalable data generation, a stabilized multi-turn RL framework, a hybrid GUI environment that integrates file systems and terminals, and a unified sandbox platform for large-scale rollouts. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that UI-TARS-2 achieves significant improvements over its predecessor UI-TARS-1.5. On GUI benchmarks, it reaches 88.2 on Online-Mind2Web, 47.5 on OSWorld, 50.6 on WindowsAgentArena, and 73.3 on AndroidWorld, outperforming strong baselines such as Claude and OpenAI agents. In game environments, it attains a mean normalized score of 59.8 across a 15-game suite-roughly 60% of human-level performance-and remains competitive with frontier proprietary models (e.g., OpenAI o3) on LMGame-Bench. Additionally, the model can generalize to long-horizon information-seeking tasks and software engineering benchmarks, highlighting its robustness across diverse agent tasks. Detailed analyses of training dynamics further provide insights into achieving stability and efficiency in large-scale agent RL. These results underscore UI-TARS-2's potential to advance the state of GUI agents and exhibit strong generalization to real-world interactive scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.09677v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce Net2Brain, a graphical and command-line user interface toolbox for comparing the representational spaces of artificial deep neural networks (DNNs) and human brain recordings. While different toolboxes facilitate only single functionalities or only focus on a small subset of supervised image classification models, Net2Brain allows the extraction of activations of more than 600 DNNs trained to perform a diverse range of vision-related tasks (e.g semantic segmentation, depth estimation, action recognition, etc.), over both image and video datasets. The toolbox computes the representational dissimilarity matrices (RDMs) over those activations and compares them to brain recordings using representational similarity analysis (RSA), weighted RSA, both in specific ROIs and with searchlight search. In addition, it is possible to add a new data set of stimuli and brain recordings to the toolbox for evaluation. We demonstrate the functionality and advantages of Net2Brain with an example showcasing how it can be used to test hypotheses of cognitive computational neuroscience.</description>

      <title>Cross-Modal Adapter for Vision-Language Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.09623v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vision-language retrieval is an important multi-modal learning topic, where the goal is to retrieve the most relevant visual candidate for a given text query. Recently, pre-trained models, e.g., CLIP, show great potential on retrieval tasks. However, as pre-trained models are scaling up, fully fine-tuning them on donwstream retrieval datasets has a high risk of overfitting. Moreover, in practice, it would be costly to train and store a large model for each task. To overcome the above issues, we present a novel Cross-Modal Adapter for parameter-efficient transfer learning. Inspired by adapter-based methods, we adjust the pre-trained model with a few parameterization layers. However, there are two notable differences. First, our method is designed for the multi-modal domain. Secondly, it allows encoder-level implicit cross-modal interactions between vision and language encoders. Although surprisingly simple, our approach has three notable benefits: (1) reduces the vast majority of fine-tuned parameters, (2) saves training time, and (3) allows all the pre-trained parameters to be fixed, enabling the pre-trained model to be shared across datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, without bells and whistles, our approach outperforms adapter-based methods on image-text retrieval datasets (MSCOCO, Flickr30K) and video-text retrieval datasets (MSR-VTT, DiDeMo, and ActivityNet).</description>

      <title>OA-DET3D: Embedding Object Awareness as a General Plug-in for Multi-Camera 3D Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.05711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.05711v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent advance in multi-camera 3D object detection is featured by bird's-eye view (BEV) representation or object queries. However, the ill-posed transformation from image-plane view to 3D space inevitably causes feature clutter and distortion, making the objects blur into the background. To this end, we explore how to incorporate supplementary cues for differentiating objects in the transformed feature representation. Formally, we introduce OA-DET3D, a general plug-in module that improves 3D object detection by bringing object awareness into a variety of existing 3D object detection pipelines. Specifically, OA-DET3D boosts the representation of objects by leveraging object-centric depth information and foreground pseudo points. First, we use object-level supervision from the properties of each 3D bounding box to guide the network in learning the depth distribution. Next, we select foreground pixels using a 2D object detector and project them into 3D space for pseudo-voxel feature encoding. Finally, the object-aware depth features and pseudo-voxel features are incorporated into the BEV representation or query feature from the baseline model with a deformable attention mechanism. We conduct extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset and Argoverse 2 dataset to validate the merits of OA-DET3D. Our method achieves consistent improvements over the BEV-based baselines in terms of both average precision and comprehensive detection score.</description>

      <title>Multiscale Feature Learning Using Co-Tuplet Loss for Offline Handwritten Signature Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.00428v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Handwritten signature verification, crucial for legal and financial institutions, faces challenges including inter-writer similarity, intra-writer variations, and limited signature samples. To address these, we introduce the MultiScale Signature feature learning Network (MS-SigNet) with the co-tuplet loss, a novel metric learning loss designed for offline handwritten signature verification. MS-SigNet learns both global and regional signature features from multiple spatial scales, enhancing feature discrimination. This approach effectively distinguishes genuine signatures from skilled forgeries by capturing overall strokes and detailed local differences. The co-tuplet loss, focusing on multiple positive and negative examples, overcomes the limitations of typical metric learning losses by addressing inter-writer similarity and intra-writer variations and emphasizing informative examples. The code is available at https://github.com/ashleyfhh/MS-SigNet. We also present HanSig, a large-scale Chinese signature dataset to support robust system development for this language. The dataset is accessible at https://github.com/hsinmin/HanSig. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets in different languages demonstrate the promising performance of our method in comparison to state-of-the-art approaches.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.03525v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Achieving fully autonomous driving with enhanced safety and efficiency relies on vehicle-to-everything cooperative perception, which enables vehicles to share perception data, thereby enhancing situational awareness and overcoming the limitations of the sensing ability of individual vehicles. Vehicle-to-everything cooperative perception plays a crucial role in extending the perception range, increasing detection accuracy, and supporting more robust decision-making and control in complex environments. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of recent developments in vehicle-to-everything cooperative perception, introducing mathematical models that characterize the perception process under different collaboration strategies. Key techniques for enabling reliable perception sharing, such as agent selection, data alignment, and feature fusion, are examined in detail. In addition, major challenges are discussed, including differences in agents and models, uncertainty in perception outputs, and the impact of communication constraints such as transmission delay and data loss. The paper concludes by outlining promising research directions, including privacy-preserving artificial intelligence methods, collaborative intelligence, and integrated sensing frameworks to support future advancements in vehicle-to-everything cooperative perception.</description>

      <title>SequencePAR: Understanding Pedestrian Attributes via A Sequence Generation Paradigm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01640v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current pedestrian attribute recognition (PAR) algorithms use multi-label or multi-task learning frameworks with specific classification heads. These models often struggle with imbalanced data and noisy samples. Inspired by the success of generative models, we propose Sequence Pedestrian Attribute Recognition (SequencePAR), a novel sequence generation paradigm for PAR. SequencePAR extracts pedestrian features using a language-image pre-trained model and embeds the attribute set into query tokens guided by text prompts. A Transformer decoder generates human attributes by integrating visual features and attribute query tokens. The masked multi-head attention layer in the decoder prevents the model from predicting the next attribute during training. The extensive experiments on multiple PAR datasets validate the effectiveness of SequencePAR. Specifically, we achieve 84.92\%, 90.44\%, 90.73\%, and 90.46\% in accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on the PETA dataset. The source code and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/Event-AHU/OpenPAR.</description>

      <title>LvBench: A Benchmark for Long-form Video Understanding with Versatile Multi-modal Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04817v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite remarkable recent progress, existing long-form VideoQA datasets fall short of meeting the criteria for genuine long-form video understanding. This is primarily due to the use of short videos for question curation, and the reliance on limited-length sub-clips as clues to answer those questions. Meanwhile, previous datasets have limited focus on question type and modality. To remedy this, we introduce LvBench, a Long-form video understanding benchmark for versatile multi-modal question-answering. Our LvBench stands out from existing long-form VideoQA datasets through three key characteristics: 1) Extended temporal durations: We consider videos ranging from 70 seconds to 4 hours, covering single-scene, multi-scene, and full-scene contexts. This design accounts for both video and clue lengths, capturing diverse contextual dynamics. 2) Diverse question types and modalities: LvBench introduces six distinct question types that evaluate various perceptual and cognitive capabilities, utilizing both video frames and subtitles. 3) High-quality annotations: We employ rigorous manual labeling by human annotators. Our dataset comprises 20,061 question-answer pairs sourced from 100 carefully selected movies across diverse genres, annotated collaboratively by multiple individuals. Analysis involving various baselines reveals a consistent trend: the performance of all existing methods significantly deteriorates when video and clue length increases. We expect LvBench to serve as a valuable resource for future works on long-form video understanding.</description>

      <title>Supervised Embedded Methods for Hyperspectral Band Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11420v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hyperspectral Imaging (HSI) captures rich spectral information across contiguous wavelength bands, supporting applications in precision agriculture, environmental monitoring, and autonomous driving. However, its high dimensionality poses computational challenges, particularly in real-time or resource-constrained settings. While prior band selection methods attempt to reduce complexity, they often rely on separate preprocessing steps and lack alignment with downstream tasks. We propose two novel supervised, embedded methods for task-specific HSI band selection that integrate directly into deep learning models. By embedding band selection within the training pipeline, our methods eliminate the need for separate preprocessing and ensure alignment with the target task. Extensive experiments on three remote sensing benchmarks and an autonomous driving dataset show that our methods achieve state-of-the-art performance while selecting only a minimal number of bands. These results highlight the potential of efficient, task-specific HSI pipelines for practical deployment.</description>

      <title>DivCon: Divide and Conquer for Complex Numerical and Spatial Reasoning in Text-to-Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06400v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion-driven text-to-image (T2I) generation has achieved remarkable advancements in recent years. To further improve T2I models' capability in numerical and spatial reasoning, layout is employed as an intermedium to bridge large language models and layout-based diffusion models. However, these methods often rely on closed-source, large-scale LLMs for layout prediction, limiting accessibility and scalability. They also struggle with generating images from prompts with multiple objects and complicated spatial relationships. To tackle these challenges, we introduce a divide-and-conquer approach which decouples the generation task into multiple subtasks. First, the layout prediction stage is divided into numerical &amp; spatial reasoning and bounding box visual planning, enabling even lightweight LLMs to achieve layout accuracy comparable to large-scale models. Second, the layout-to-image generation stage is divided into two steps to synthesize objects from easy ones to difficult ones. Experiments are conducted on the HRS and NSR-1K benchmarks and our method outperforms previous approaches with notable margins. In addition, visual results and user study demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the perceptual quality, especially when generating multiple objects from complex textural prompts.</description>

      <title>SC-Diff: 3D Shape Completion with Latent Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12470v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel 3D shape completion framework that unifies multimodal conditioning, leveraging both 2D images and 3D partial scans through a latent diffusion model. Shapes are represented as Truncated Signed Distance Functions (TSDFs) and encoded into a discrete latent space jointly supervised by 2D and 3D cues, enabling efficient high-resolution processing while reducing GPU memory usage by 30\% compared to state-of-the-art methods. Our approach guides the generation process with flexible multimodal conditioning, ensuring consistent integration of 2D and 3D information from encoding to reconstruction. Our training strategy simulates realistic partial observations, avoiding assumptions about input structure and improving robustness in real-world scenarios. Leveraging our efficient latent space and multimodal conditioning, our model generalizes across object categories, outperforming class-specific models by 12\% and class-agnostic models by 47\% in $l_1$ reconstruction error, while producing more diverse, realistic, and high-fidelity completions than prior approaches.</description>

      <title>TwinLiteNet+: An Enhanced Multi-Task Segmentation Model for Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16958v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Semantic segmentation is a fundamental perception task in autonomous driving, particularly for identifying drivable areas and lane markings to enable safe navigation. However, most state-of-the-art (SOTA) models are computationally intensive and unsuitable for real-time deployment on resource-constrained embedded devices. In this paper, we introduce TwinLiteNet+, an enhanced multi-task segmentation model designed for real-time drivable area and lane segmentation with high efficiency. TwinLiteNet+ employs a hybrid encoder architecture that integrates stride-based dilated convolutions and depthwise separable dilated convolutions, balancing representational capacity and computational cost. To improve task-specific decoding, we propose two lightweight upsampling modules-Upper Convolution Block (UCB) and Upper Simple Block (USB)-alongside a Partial Class Activation Attention (PCAA) mechanism that enhances segmentation precision. The model is available in four configurations, ranging from the ultra-compact TwinLiteNet+_{Nano} (34K parameters) to the high-performance TwinLiteNet+_{Large} (1.94M parameters). On the BDD100K dataset, TwinLiteNet+_{Large} achieves 92.9% mIoU for drivable area segmentation and 34.2% IoU for lane segmentation-surpassing existing state-of-the-art models while requiring 11x fewer floating-point operations (FLOPs) for computation. Extensive evaluations on embedded devices demonstrate superior inference speed, quantization robustness (INT8/FP16), and energy efficiency, validating TwinLiteNet+ as a compelling solution for real-world autonomous driving systems. Code is available at https://github.com/chequanghuy/TwinLiteNetPlus.</description>

      <title>StylizedGS: Controllable Stylization for 3D Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05220v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As XR technology continues to advance rapidly, 3D generation and editing are increasingly crucial. Among these, stylization plays a key role in enhancing the appearance of 3D models. By utilizing stylization, users can achieve consistent artistic effects in 3D editing using a single reference style image, making it a user-friendly editing method. However, recent NeRF-based 3D stylization methods encounter efficiency issues that impact the user experience, and their implicit nature limits their ability to accurately transfer geometric pattern styles. Additionally, the ability for artists to apply flexible control over stylized scenes is considered highly desirable to foster an environment conducive to creative exploration. To address the above issues, we introduce StylizedGS, an efficient 3D neural style transfer framework with adaptable control over perceptual factors based on 3D Gaussian Splatting representation. We propose a filter-based refinement to eliminate floaters that affect the stylization effects in the scene reconstruction process. The nearest neighbor-based style loss is introduced to achieve stylization by fine-tuning the geometry and color parameters of 3DGS, while a depth preservation loss with other regularizations is proposed to prevent the tampering of geometry content. Moreover, facilitated by specially designed losses, StylizedGS enables users to control color, stylized scale, and regions during the stylization to possess customization capabilities. Our method achieves high-quality stylization results characterized by faithful brushstrokes and geometric consistency with flexible controls. Extensive experiments across various scenes and styles demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method concerning both stylization quality and inference speed.</description>

      <title>BRACTIVE: A Brain Activation Approach to Human Visual Brain Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18808v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The human brain is a highly efficient processing unit, and understanding how it works can inspire new algorithms and architectures in machine learning. In this work, we introduce a novel framework named Brain Activation Network (BRACTIVE), a transformer-based approach to studying the human visual brain. The primary objective of BRACTIVE is to align the visual features of subjects with their corresponding brain representations using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) signals. It enables us to identify the brain's Regions of Interest (ROIs) in the subjects. Unlike previous brain research methods, which can only identify ROIs for one subject at a time and are limited by the number of subjects, BRACTIVE automatically extends this identification to multiple subjects and ROIs. Our experiments demonstrate that BRACTIVE effectively identifies person-specific regions of interest, such as face and body-selective areas, aligning with neuroscience findings and indicating potential applicability to various object categories. More importantly, we found that leveraging human visual brain activity to guide deep neural networks enhances performance across various benchmarks. It encourages the potential of BRACTIVE in both neuroscience and machine intelligence studies.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents TE-NeXt, a novel and efficient architecture for Traversability Estimation (TE) from sparse LiDAR point clouds based on a residual convolution block. TE-NeXt block fuses notions of current trends such as attention mechanisms and 3D sparse convolutions. TE-NeXt aims to demonstrate high capacity for generalisation in a variety of urban and natural environments, using well-known and accessible datasets such as SemanticKITTI, Rellis-3D and SemanticUSL. Thus, the designed architecture ouperforms state-of-the-art methods in the problem of semantic segmentation, demonstrating better results in unstructured environments and maintaining high reliability and robustness in urbans environments, which leads to better abstraction. Implementation is available in a open repository to the scientific community with the aim of ensuring the reproducibility of results.</description>

      <title>Towards Human-Level 3D Relative Pose Estimation: Generalizable, Training-Free, with Single Reference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18453v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Humans can easily deduce the relative pose of a previously unseen object, without labeling or training, given only a single query-reference image pair. This is arguably achieved by incorporating i) 3D/2.5D shape perception from a single image, ii) render-and-compare simulation, and iii) rich semantic cue awareness to furnish (coarse) reference-query correspondence. Motivated by this, we propose a novel 3D generalizable relative pose estimation method by elaborating 3D/2.5D shape perception with a 2.5D shape from an RGB-D reference, fulfilling the render-and-compare paradigm with an off-the-shelf differentiable renderer, and leveraging the semantic cues from a pretrained model like DINOv2. Specifically, our differentiable renderer takes the 2.5D rotatable mesh textured by the RGB and the semantic maps (obtained by DINOv2 from the RGB input), then renders new RGB and semantic maps (with back-surface culling) under a novel rotated view. The refinement loss comes from comparing the rendered RGB and semantic maps with the query ones, back-propagating the gradients through the differentiable renderer to refine the 3D relative pose. As a result, \emph{our method can be readily applied to unseen objects, given only a single RGB-D reference, without labeling or training}. Extensive experiments on LineMOD, LM-O, and YCB-V show that our training-free method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art supervised methods, especially under the rigorous \texttt{Acc@5/10/15}$^\circ$ metrics and the challenging cross-dataset settings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01074v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new method for multimodal conditional 3D face geometry generation that allows user-friendly control over the output identity and expression via a number of different conditioning signals. Within a single model, we demonstrate 3D faces generated from artistic sketches, portrait photos, Canny edges, FLAME face model parameters, 2D face landmarks, or text prompts. Our approach is based on a diffusion process that generates 3D geometry in a 2D parameterized UV domain. Geometry generation passes each conditioning signal through a set of cross-attention layers (IP-Adapter), one set for each user-defined conditioning signal. The result is an easy-to-use 3D face generation tool that produces topology-consistent, high-quality geometry with fine-grain user control.</description>

      <title>FeatureSORT: Essential Features for Effective Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04249v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce FeatureSORT, a simple yet effective online multiple object tracker that reinforces the DeepSORT baseline with a redesigned detector and additional feature cues. In contrast to conventional detectors that only provide bounding boxes, our modified YOLOX architecture is extended to output multiple appearance attributes, including clothing color, clothing style, and motion direction, alongside the bounding boxes. These feature cues, together with a ReID network, form complementary embeddings that substantially improve association accuracy. Furthermore, we incorporate stronger post-processing strategies, such as global linking and Gaussian Smoothing Process interpolation, to handle missing associations and detections. During online tracking, we define a measurement-to-track distance function that jointly considers IoU, direction, color, style, and ReID similarity. This design enables FeatureSORT to maintain consistent identities through longer occlusions while reducing identity switches. Extensive experiments on standard MOT benchmarks demonstrate that FeatureSORT achieves state-of-the-art online performance, with MOTA scores of 79.7 on MOT16, 80.6 on MOT17, 77.9 on MOT20, and 92.2 on DanceTrack, underscoring the effectiveness of feature-enriched detection and modular post processing in advancing multi-object tracking.</description>

      <title>Muzzle-Based Cattle Identification System Using Artificial Intelligence (AI)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06096v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Absence of tamper-proof cattle identification technology was a significant problem preventing insurance companies from providing livestock insurance. This lack of technology had devastating financial consequences for marginal farmers as they did not have the opportunity to claim compensation for any unexpected events such as the accidental death of cattle in Bangladesh. Using machine learning and deep learning algorithms, we have solved the bottleneck of cattle identification by developing and introducing a muzzle-based cattle identification system. The uniqueness of cattle muzzles has been scientifically established, which resembles human fingerprints. This is the fundamental premise that prompted us to develop a cattle identification system that extracts the uniqueness of cattle muzzles. For this purpose, we collected 32,374 images from 826 cattle. Contrast-limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE) with sharpening filters was applied in the preprocessing steps to remove noise from images. We used the YOLO algorithm for cattle muzzle detection in the image and the FaceNet architecture to learn unified embeddings from muzzle images using squared $L_2$ distances. Our system performs with an accuracy of $96.489\%$, $F_1$ score of $97.334\%$, and a true positive rate (tpr) of $87.993\%$ at a remarkably low false positive rate (fpr) of $0.098\%$. This reliable and efficient system for identifying cattle can significantly advance livestock insurance and precision farming.</description>

      <title>Scalable Frame Sampling for Video Classification: A Semi-Optimal Policy Approach with Reduced Search Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05260v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a video with $T$ frames, frame sampling is a task to select $N \ll T$ frames, so as to maximize the performance of a fixed video classifier. Not just brute-force search, but most existing methods suffer from its vast search space of $\binom{T}{N}$, especially when $N$ gets large. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel perspective of reducing the search space from $O(T^N)$ to $O(T)$. Instead of exploring the entire $O(T^N)$ space, our proposed semi-optimal policy selects the top $N$ frames based on the independently estimated value of each frame using per-frame confidence, significantly reducing the computational complexity. We verify that our semi-optimal policy can efficiently approximate the optimal policy, particularly under practical settings. Additionally, through extensive experiments on various datasets and model architectures, we demonstrate that learning our semi-optimal policy ensures stable and high performance regardless of the size of $N$ and $T$.</description>

      <title>DivScene: Towards Open-Vocabulary Object Navigation with Large Vision Language Models in Diverse Scenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02730v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved significant progress in tasks like visual question answering and document understanding. However, their potential to comprehend embodied environments and navigate within them remains underexplored. In this work, we first study the challenge of open-vocabulary object navigation by introducing DivScene, a large-scale dataset with 4,614 houses across 81 scene types and 5,707 kinds of target objects. Our dataset provides a much greater diversity of target objects and scene types than existing datasets, enabling a comprehensive task evaluation. We evaluated various methods with LVLMs and LLMs on our dataset and found that current models still fall short of open-vocab object navigation ability. Then, we fine-tuned LVLMs to predict the next action with CoT explanations. We observe that LVLM's navigation ability can be improved substantially with only BFS-generated shortest paths without any human supervision, surpassing GPT-4o by over 20% in success rates.</description>

      <title>A low complexity contextual stacked ensemble-learning approach for pedestrian intent prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13039v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Walking as a form of active travel is essential in promoting sustainable transport. It is thus crucial to accurately predict pedestrian crossing intention and avoid collisions, especially with the advent of autonomous and advanced driver-assisted vehicles. Current research leverages computer vision and machine learning advances to predict near-misses; however, this often requires high computation power to yield reliable results. In contrast, this work proposes a low-complexity ensemble-learning approach that employs contextual data for predicting the pedestrian's intent for crossing. The pedestrian is first detected, and their image is then compressed using skeleton-ization, and contextual information is added into a stacked ensemble-learning approach. Our experiments on different datasets achieve similar pedestrian intent prediction performance as the state-of-the-art approaches with 99.7% reduction in computational complexity. Our source code and trained models will be released upon paper acceptance</description>

      <title>Synergistic Dual Spatial-aware Generation of Image-to-Text and Text-to-Image</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15312v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the visual spatial understanding (VSU) area, spatial image-to-text (SI2T) and spatial text-to-image (ST2I) are two fundamental tasks that appear in dual form. Existing methods for standalone SI2T or ST2I perform imperfectly in spatial understanding, due to the difficulty of 3D-wise spatial feature modeling. In this work, we consider modeling the SI2T and ST2I together under a dual learning framework. During the dual framework, we then propose to represent the 3D spatial scene features with a novel 3D scene graph (3DSG) representation that can be shared and beneficial to both tasks. Further, inspired by the intuition that the easier 3D$\to$image and 3D$\to$text processes also exist symmetrically in the ST2I and SI2T, respectively, we propose the Spatial Dual Discrete Diffusion (SD$^3$) framework, which utilizes the intermediate features of the 3D$\to$X processes to guide the hard X$\to$3D processes, such that the overall ST2I and SI2T will benefit each other. On the visual spatial understanding dataset VSD, our system outperforms the mainstream T2I and I2T methods significantly. Further in-depth analysis reveals how our dual learning strategy advances.</description>

      <title>OSMLoc: Single Image-Based Visual Localization in OpenStreetMap with Fused Geometric and Semantic Guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08665v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: OpenStreetMap (OSM), a rich and versatile source of volunteered geographic information (VGI), facilitates human self-localization and scene understanding by integrating nearby visual observations with vectorized map data. However, the disparity in modalities and perspectives poses a major challenge for effectively matching camera imagery with compact map representations, thereby limiting the full potential of VGI data in real-world localization applications.
  Inspired by the fact that the human brain relies on the fusion of geometric and semantic understanding for spatial localization tasks, we propose the OSMLoc in this paper. OSMLoc is a brain-inspired visual localization approach based on first-person-view images against the OSM maps. It integrates semantic and geometric guidance to significantly improve accuracy, robustness, and generalization capability. First, we equip the OSMLoc with the visual foundational model to extract powerful image features. Second, a geometry-guided depth distribution adapter is proposed to bridge the monocular depth estimation and camera-to-BEV transform. Thirdly, the semantic embeddings from the OSM data are utilized as auxiliary guidance for image-to-OSM feature matching. To validate the proposed OSMLoc, we collect a worldwide cross-area and cross-condition (CC) benchmark for extensive evaluation. Experiments on the MGL dataset, CC validation benchmark, and KITTI dataset have demonstrated the superiority of our method. Code, pre-trained models, CC validation benchmark, and additional results are available at: https://github.com/WHU-USI3DV/OSMLoc.</description>

      <title>ZoomEye: Enhancing Multimodal LLMs with Human-Like Zooming Capabilities through Tree-Based Image Exploration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16044v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in vision-language understanding. Recently, with the integration of test-time scaling techniques, these models have also shown strong potential in visual reasoning. However, most existing reasoning approaches remain text-level in nature: MLLMs are prompted to explore various combinations of textual tokens via their underlying language model, while the visual input remains fixed throughout the reasoning process. This paradigm limits the model's ability to fully exploit rich visual information, particularly when dealing with images containing numerous fine-grained elements. In such cases, vision-level reasoning becomes crucial - where models dynamically zoom into specific regions of the image to gather detailed visual cues necessary for accurate decision-making. In this paper, we propose Zoom Eye, a training-free, model-agnostic tree search algorithm tailored for vision-level reasoning. Zoom Eye treats an image as a hierarchical tree structure, where each child node represents a zoomed-in sub-region of its parent, and the root corresponds to the full image. The algorithm enables MLLMs to simulate human-like zooming behavior by navigating from root to leaf nodes in search of task-relevant visual evidence. We experiment on a series of high-resolution benchmarks and the results demonstrate that Zoom Eye consistently improves the performance of multiple MLLMs by a large margin (e.g., InternVL2.5-8B increases by 15.71% and 17.69% on HR-Bench) and also enables small 3-8B MLLMs to outperform strong large models such as GPT-4o.

      <title>EFTViT: Efficient Federated Training of Vision Transformers with Masked Images on Resource-Constrained Clients</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00334v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Federated learning research has recently shifted from Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to Vision Transformers (ViTs) due to their superior capacity. ViTs training demands higher computational resources due to the lack of 2D inductive biases inherent in CNNs. However, efficient federated training of ViTs on resource-constrained edge devices remains unexplored in the community. In this paper, we propose EFTViT, a hierarchical federated framework that leverages masked images to enable efficient, full-parameter training on resource-constrained edge devices, offering substantial benefits for learning on heterogeneous data. In general, we patchify images and randomly mask a portion of the patches, observing that excluding them from training has minimal impact on performance while substantially reducing computation costs and enhancing data content privacy protection. Specifically, EFTViT comprises a series of lightweight local modules and a larger global module, updated independently on clients and the central server, respectively. The local modules are trained on masked image patches, while the global module is trained on intermediate patch features uploaded from the local client, balanced through a proposed median sampling strategy to erase client data distribution privacy. We analyze the computational complexity and privacy protection of EFTViT. Extensive experiments on popular benchmarks show that EFTViT achieves up to 28.17% accuracy improvement, reduces local training computational cost by up to 2.8$\times$, and cuts local training time by up to 4.4$\times$ compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>OCR Hinders RAG: Evaluating the Cascading Impact of OCR on Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02592v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating external knowledge to reduce hallucinations and incorporate up-to-date information without retraining. As an essential part of RAG, external knowledge bases are commonly built by extracting structured data from unstructured PDF documents using Optical Character Recognition (OCR). However, given the imperfect prediction of OCR and the inherent non-uniform representation of structured data, knowledge bases inevitably contain various OCR noises. In this paper, we introduce OHRBench, the first benchmark for understanding the cascading impact of OCR on RAG systems. OHRBench includes 8,561 carefully selected unstructured document images from seven real-world RAG application domains, along with 8,498 Q&amp;A pairs derived from multimodal elements in documents, challenging existing OCR solutions used for RAG. To better understand OCR's impact on RAG systems, we identify two primary types of OCR noise: Semantic Noise and Formatting Noise and apply perturbation to generate a set of structured data with varying degrees of each OCR noise. Using OHRBench, we first conduct a comprehensive evaluation of current OCR solutions and reveal that none is competent for constructing high-quality knowledge bases for RAG systems. We then systematically evaluate the impact of these two noise types and demonstrate the trend relationship between the degree of OCR noise and RAG performance. Our OHRBench, including PDF documents, Q&amp;As, and the ground truth structured data are released at: https://github.com/opendatalab/OHR-Bench</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05548v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Realistic scene reconstruction in driving scenarios poses significant challenges due to fast-moving objects. Most existing methods rely on labor-intensive manual labeling of object poses to reconstruct dynamic objects in canonical space and move them based on these poses during rendering. While some approaches attempt to use 3D object trackers to replace manual annotations, the limited generalization of 3D trackers -- caused by the scarcity of large-scale 3D datasets -- results in inferior reconstructions in real-world settings. In contrast, 2D foundation models demonstrate strong generalization capabilities. To eliminate the reliance on 3D trackers and enhance robustness across diverse environments, we propose a stable object tracking module by leveraging associations from 2D deep trackers within a 3D object fusion strategy. We address inevitable tracking errors by further introducing a motion learning strategy in an implicit feature space that autonomously corrects trajectory errors and recovers missed detections. Experimental results on Waymo-NOTR and KITTI show that our method outperforms existing approaches. Our code will be released on https://lolrudy.github.io/No3DTrackSG/.</description>

Abstract: Despite the success of CNN models on a variety of Image classification and segmentation tasks, their extensive computational and storage demands pose considerable challenges for real-world deployment on resource-constrained devices. Quantization is one technique that aims to alleviate these large storage requirements and speed up the inference process by reducing the precision of model parameters to lower-bit representations. In this paper, we introduce a novel post-training quantization method for model weights. Our method finds optimal clipping thresholds and scaling factors along with mathematical guarantees that our method minimizes quantization noise. Empirical results on real-world datasets demonstrate that our quantization scheme significantly reduces model size and computational requirements while preserving model accuracy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09573v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sparse-view reconstruction models typically require precise camera poses, yet obtaining these parameters from sparse-view images remains challenging. We introduce FreeSplatter, a scalable feed-forward framework that generates high-quality 3D Gaussians from uncalibrated sparse-view images while estimating camera parameters within seconds. Our approach employs a streamlined transformer architecture where self-attention blocks facilitate information exchange among multi-view image tokens, decoding them into pixel-aligned 3D Gaussian primitives within a unified reference frame. This representation enables both high-fidelity 3D modeling and efficient camera parameter estimation using off-the-shelf solvers. We develop two specialized variants--for object-centric and scene-level reconstruction--trained on comprehensive datasets. Remarkably, FreeSplatter outperforms several pose-dependent Large Reconstruction Models (LRMs) by a notable margin while achieving comparable or even better pose estimation accuracy compared to state-of-the-art pose-free reconstruction approach MASt3R in challenging benchmarks. Beyond technical benchmarks, FreeSplatter streamlines text/image-to-3D content creation pipelines, eliminating the complexity of camera pose management while delivering exceptional visual fidelity.</description>

Abstract: We present a new method for reconstructing the appearance properties of human faces from a lightweight capture procedure in an unconstrained environment. Our method recovers the surface geometry, diffuse albedo, specular intensity and specular roughness from a monocular video containing a simple head rotation in-the-wild. Notably, we make no simplifying assumptions on the environment lighting, and we explicitly take visibility and occlusions into account. As a result, our method can produce facial appearance maps that approach the fidelity of studio-based multi-view captures, but with a far easier and cheaper procedure.</description>

      <title>VLM-AD: End-to-End Autonomous Driving through Vision-Language Model Supervision</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14446v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Human drivers rely on commonsense reasoning to navigate diverse and dynamic real-world scenarios. Existing end-to-end (E2E) autonomous driving (AD) models are typically optimized to mimic driving patterns observed in data, without capturing the underlying reasoning processes. This limitation constrains their ability to handle challenging driving scenarios. To close this gap, we propose VLM-AD, a method that leverages vision-language models (VLMs) as teachers to enhance training by providing additional supervision that incorporates unstructured reasoning information and structured action labels. Such supervision enhances the model's ability to learn richer feature representations that capture the rationale behind driving patterns. Importantly, our method does not require a VLM during inference, making it practical for real-time deployment. When integrated with state-of-the-art methods, VLM-AD achieves significant improvements in planning accuracy and reduced collision rates on the nuScenes dataset. It further improves route completion and driving scores under closed-loop evaluation, demonstrating its effectiveness in long-horizon, interactive driving scenarios and its potential for safe and reliable real-world deployment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15058v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Medical researchers and clinicians often need to perform novel segmentation tasks on a set of related images. Existing methods for segmenting a new dataset are either interactive, requiring substantial human effort for each image, or require an existing set of previously labeled images. We introduce a system, MultiverSeg, that enables practitioners to rapidly segment an entire new dataset without requiring access to any existing labeled data from that task or domain. Along with the image to segment, the model takes user interactions such as clicks, bounding boxes or scribbles as input, and predicts a segmentation. As the user segments more images, those images and segmentations become additional inputs to the model, providing context. As the context set of labeled images grows, the number of interactions required to segment each new image decreases. We demonstrate that MultiverSeg enables users to interactively segment new datasets efficiently, by amortizing the number of interactions per image to achieve an accurate segmentation. Compared to using a state-of-the-art interactive segmentation method, MultiverSeg reduced the total number of clicks by 36% and scribble steps by 25% to achieve 90% Dice on sets of images from unseen tasks. We release code and model weights at https://multiverseg.csail.mit.edu</description>

      <title>Compositional Generative Model of Unbounded 4D Cities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08983v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 3D scene generation has garnered growing attention in recent years and has made significant progress. Generating 4D cities is more challenging than 3D scenes due to the presence of structurally complex, visually diverse objects like buildings and vehicles, and heightened human sensitivity to distortions in urban environments. To tackle these issues, we propose CityDreamer4D, a compositional generative model specifically tailored for generating unbounded 4D cities. Our main insights are 1) 4D city generation should separate dynamic objects (e.g., vehicles) from static scenes (e.g., buildings and roads), and 2) all objects in the 4D scene should be composed of different types of neural fields for buildings, vehicles, and background stuff. Specifically, we propose Traffic Scenario Generator and Unbounded Layout Generator to produce dynamic traffic scenarios and static city layouts using a highly compact BEV representation. Objects in 4D cities are generated by combining stuff-oriented and instance-oriented neural fields for background stuff, buildings, and vehicles. To suit the distinct characteristics of background stuff and instances, the neural fields employ customized generative hash grids and periodic positional embeddings as scene parameterizations. Furthermore, we offer a comprehensive suite of datasets for city generation, including OSM, GoogleEarth, and CityTopia. The OSM dataset provides a variety of real-world city layouts, while the Google Earth and CityTopia datasets deliver large-scale, high-quality city imagery complete with 3D instance annotations. Leveraging its compositional design, CityDreamer4D supports a range of downstream applications, such as instance editing, city stylization, and urban simulation, while delivering state-of-the-art performance in generating realistic 4D cities.</description>

      <title>Multimodal LLMs Can Reason about Aesthetics in Zero-Shot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09012v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid technical progress of generative art (GenArt) has democratized the creation of visually appealing imagery. However, achieving genuine artistic impact - the kind that resonates with viewers on a deeper, more meaningful level - remains formidable as it requires a sophisticated aesthetic sensibility. This sensibility involves a multifaceted cognitive process extending beyond mere visual appeal, which is often overlooked by current computational methods. This paper pioneers an approach to capture this complex process by investigating how the reasoning capabilities of Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) can be effectively elicited to perform aesthetic judgment. Our analysis reveals a critical challenge: MLLMs exhibit a tendency towards hallucinations during aesthetic reasoning, characterized by subjective opinions and unsubstantiated artistic interpretations. We further demonstrate that these hallucinations can be suppressed by employing an evidence-based and objective reasoning process, as substantiated by our proposed baseline, ArtCoT. MLLMs prompted by this principle produce multifaceted, in-depth aesthetic reasoning that aligns significantly better with human judgment. These findings have direct applications in areas such as AI art tutoring and as reward models for image generation. Ultimately, we hope this work paves the way for AI systems that can truly understand, appreciate, and contribute to art that aligns with human aesthetic values.

      <title>BloomScene: Lightweight Structured 3D Gaussian Splatting for Crossmodal Scene Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10462v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the widespread use of virtual reality applications, 3D scene generation has become a new challenging research frontier. 3D scenes have highly complex structures and need to ensure that the output is dense, coherent, and contains all necessary structures. Many current 3D scene generation methods rely on pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models and monocular depth estimators. However, the generated scenes occupy large amounts of storage space and often lack effective regularisation methods, leading to geometric distortions. To this end, we propose BloomScene, a lightweight structured 3D Gaussian splatting for crossmodal scene generation, which creates diverse and high-quality 3D scenes from text or image inputs. Specifically, a crossmodal progressive scene generation framework is proposed to generate coherent scenes utilizing incremental point cloud reconstruction and 3D Gaussian splatting. Additionally, we propose a hierarchical depth prior-based regularization mechanism that utilizes multi-level constraints on depth accuracy and smoothness to enhance the realism and continuity of the generated scenes. Ultimately, we propose a structured context-guided compression mechanism that exploits structured hash grids to model the context of unorganized anchor attributes, which significantly eliminates structural redundancy and reduces storage overhead. Comprehensive experiments across multiple scenes demonstrate the significant potential and advantages of our framework compared with several baselines.</description>

      <title>Learning Visual Proxy for Compositional Zero-Shot Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13859v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) aims to recognize novel attribute-object compositions by leveraging knowledge from seen compositions. Current methods align textual prototypes with visual features via Vision-Language Models (VLMs), but suffer from two limitations: (1) modality gaps hinder the discrimination of semantically similar pairs, and (2) single-modal textual prototypes lack fine-grained visual cues. In this paper, we introduce Visual Proxy Learning, a method that reduces modality gaps and enhances compositional generalization. We initialize visual proxies for attributes, objects, and their compositions using text representations and optimize the visual space to capture fine-grained cues, improving visual representations. Additionally, we propose Cross-Modal Joint Learning (CMJL), which imposes cross-modal constraints between the text-image and fine-grained visual spaces, improving generalization for unseen compositions and discriminating similar pairs. Experiments show state-of-the-art performance in closed-world scenarios and competitive results in open-world settings across four CZSL benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach in compositional generalization.</description>

      <title>Temporal Preference Optimization for Long-Form Video Understanding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13919v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite significant advancements in video large multimodal models (video-LMMs), achieving effective temporal grounding in long-form videos remains a challenge for existing models. To address this limitation, we propose Temporal Preference Optimization (TPO), a novel post-training framework designed to enhance the temporal grounding capabilities of video-LMMs through preference learning. TPO adopts a self-training approach that enables models to differentiate between well-grounded and less accurate temporal responses by leveraging curated preference datasets at two granularities: localized temporal grounding, which focuses on specific video segments, and comprehensive temporal grounding, which captures extended temporal dependencies across entire video sequences. By optimizing on these preference datasets, TPO significantly enhances temporal understanding while reducing reliance on manually annotated data. Extensive experiments on three long-form video understanding benchmarks--LongVideoBench, MLVU, and Video-MME--demonstrate the effectiveness of TPO across two state-of-the-art video-LMMs. Notably, LLaVA-Video-TPO establishes itself as the leading 7B model on the Video-MME benchmark, underscoring the potential of TPO as a scalable and efficient solution for advancing temporal reasoning in long-form video understanding.

      <title>Vision without Images: End-to-End Computer Vision from Single Compressive Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15122v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Snapshot Compressed Imaging (SCI) offers high-speed, low-bandwidth, and energy-efficient image acquisition, but remains challenged by low-light and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. Moreover, practical hardware constraints in high-resolution sensors limit the use of large frame-sized masks, necessitating smaller, hardware-friendly designs. In this work, we present a novel SCI-based computer vision framework using pseudo-random binary masks of only 8$\times$8 in size for physically feasible implementations. At its core is CompDAE, a Compressive Denoising Autoencoder built on the STFormer architecture, designed to perform downstream tasks--such as edge detection and depth estimation--directly from noisy compressive raw pixel measurements without image reconstruction. CompDAE incorporates a rate-constrained training strategy inspired by BackSlash to promote compact, compressible models. A shared encoder paired with lightweight task-specific decoders enables a unified multi-task platform. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that CompDAE achieves state-of-the-art performance with significantly lower complexity, especially under ultra-low-light conditions where traditional CMOS and SCI pipelines fail.</description>

      <title>Exploring Primitive Visual Measurement Understanding and the Role of Output Format in Learning in Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15144v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work investigates the capabilities of current vision-language models (VLMs) in visual understanding and attribute measurement of primitive shapes using a benchmark focused on controlled 2D shape configurations with variations in spatial positioning, occlusion, rotation, size, and shape attributes such as type, quadrant, center-coordinates, rotation, occlusion status, and color as shown in Figure 1 and supplementary Figures S3-S81. We fine-tune state-of-the-art VLMs (2B-8B parameters) using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and validate them on multiple out-of-domain (OD) scenarios from our proposed benchmark. Our findings reveal that coherent sentence-based outputs outperform tuple formats, particularly in OD scenarios with large domain gaps. Additionally, we demonstrate that scaling numeric tokens during loss computation enhances numerical approximation capabilities, further improving performance on spatial and measurement tasks. These results highlight the importance of output format design, loss scaling strategies, and robust generalization techniques in enhancing the training and fine-tuning of VLMs, particularly for tasks requiring precise spatial approximations and strong OD generalization.</description>

      <title>Full-Head Segmentation of MRI with Abnormal Brain Anatomy: Model and Data Release</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18716v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Purpose: The goal of this work was to develop a deep network for whole-head segmentation including clinical MRIs with abnormal anatomy, and compile the first public benchmark dataset for this purpose. We collected 98 MRIs with volumetric segmentation labels for a diverse set of human subjects including normal, as well as abnormal anatomy in clinical cases of stroke and disorders of consciousness. Approach: Training labels were generated by manually correcting initial automated segmentations for skin/scalp, skull, CSF, gray matter, white matter, air cavity and extracephalic air. We developed a MultiAxial network consisting of three 2D U-Net that operate independently in sagittal, axial and coronal planes and are then combined to produce a single 3D segmentation. Results: The MultiAxial network achieved a test-set Dice scores of 0.88+-0.04 (median +- interquartile range) on whole head segmentation including gray and white matter. This compared to 0.86 +- 0.04 for Multipriors and 0.79 +- 0.10 for SPM12, two standard tools currently available for this task. The MultiAxial network gains in robustness by avoiding the need for coregistration with an atlas. It performed well in regions with abnormal anatomy and on images that have been de-identified. It enables more accurate and robust current flow modeling when incorporated into ROAST, a widely-used modeling toolbox for transcranial electric stimulation.Conclusions: We are releasing a new state-of-the-art tool for whole-head MRI segmentation in abnormal anatomy, along with the largest volume of labeled clinical head MRIs including labels for non-brain structures. Together the model and data may serve as a benchmark for future efforts.</description>

      <title>Event Camera Tuning for Detection Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18788v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the main challenges in unlocking the potential of neuromorphic cameras, also called ''event camera'', is the development of novel methods that solve the multi-variable problem of adjusting their biases parameters to accommodate a desired task. Actually, it is very difficult to find in the literature a systematic heuristic that solves the problem for any desired application. In this paper we present a tuning parameters heuristic for the biases of event cameras, for tasks that require small objects detection in staring scenarios. The main purpose of the heuristic is to squeeze the camera's potential, optimize its performance, and expand its detection capabilities as much as possible. In the presentation, we translate the experimental properties of event camera and systemic constrains into mathematical terms, and show, under certain assumptions and classical tools from functional analysis, how the multi-variable problem collapses into a two-parameter problem that can be solved experimentally. A main conclusion that will be demonstrated is that for certain desired signals, such as the one provided by an incandescent lamp powered by the periodic electrical grid, the optimal values of the camera are very far from the default values recommended by the manufacturer.</description>

      <title>DesCLIP: Robust Continual Learning via General Attribute Descriptions for VLM-Based Visual Recognition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00618v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Continual learning of vision-language models (VLMs) focuses on leveraging cross-modal pretrained knowledge to incrementally adapt to expanding downstream tasks and datasets, while tackling the challenge of knowledge forgetting. Existing research often focuses on connecting visual features with specific class text in downstream tasks, overlooking the latent relationships between general and specialized knowledge. Our findings reveal that forcing models to optimize inappropriate visual-text matches exacerbates forgetting of VLM's recognition ability. To tackle this issue, we propose DesCLIP, which leverages general attribute (GA) descriptions to guide the understanding of specific class objects, enabling VLMs to establish robust vision-GA-class trilateral associations rather than relying solely on vision-class connections. Specifically, we introduce a language assistant to generate concrete GA description candidates via proper request prompts. Then, an anchor-based embedding filter is designed to obtain highly relevant GA description embeddings, which are leveraged as the paired text embeddings for visual-textual instance matching, thereby tuning the visual encoder. Correspondingly, the class text embeddings are gradually calibrated to align with these shared GA description embeddings. Extensive experiments demonstrate the advancements and efficacy of our proposed method, with comprehensive empirical evaluations highlighting its superior performance in VLM-based recognition compared to existing continual learning methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00711v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Visual reasoning refers to the task of solving questions about visual information. Current visual reasoning methods typically employ pre-trained vision-language model (VLM) strategies or deep neural network approaches. However, existing efforts are constrained by limited reasoning interpretability, while hindering by the phenomenon of underspecification in the question text. Additionally, the absence of fine-grained visual knowledge limits the precise understanding of subject behavior in visual reasoning tasks. To address these issues, we propose VIKSER (Visual Knowledge-Driven Self-Reinforcing Reasoning Framework). Specifically, VIKSER, trained using knowledge distilled from large language models, extracts fine-grained visual knowledge with the assistance of visual relationship detection techniques. Subsequently, VIKSER utilizes fine-grained visual knowledge to paraphrase the question with underspecification. Additionally, we design a novel prompting method called Chain-of-Evidence (CoE), which leverages the power of "evidence for reasoning" to endow VIKSER with interpretable reasoning capabilities. Meanwhile, the integration of self-reflection technology empowers VIKSER with the ability to learn and improve from its mistakes. Experiments conducted on widely used datasets demonstrate that VIKSER achieves new state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in relevant tasks. Moreover, VIKSER achieves performance on par with leading proprietary models, such as the latest ChatGPT-5.</description>

      <title>RAMer: Reconstruction-based Adversarial Model for Multi-party Multi-modal Multi-label Emotion Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10435v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conventional Multi-modal multi-label emotion recognition (MMER) assumes complete access to visual, textual, and acoustic modalities. However, real-world multi-party settings often violate this assumption, as non-speakers frequently lack acoustic and textual inputs, leading to a significant degradation in model performance. Existing approaches also tend to unify heterogeneous modalities into a single representation, overlooking each modality's unique characteristics. To address these challenges, we propose RAMer (Reconstruction-based Adversarial Model for Emotion Recognition), which refines multi-modal representations by not only exploring modality commonality and specificity but crucially by leveraging reconstructed features, enhanced by contrastive learning, to overcome data incompleteness and enrich feature quality. RAMer also introduces a personality auxiliary task to complement missing modalities using modality-level attention, improving emotion reasoning. To further strengthen the model's ability to capture label and modality interdependency, we propose a stack shuffle strategy to enrich correlations between labels and modality-specific features. Experiments on three benchmarks, i.e., MEmoR, CMU-MOSEI, and $M^3ED$, demonstrate that RAMer achieves state-of-the-art performance in dyadic and multi-party MMER scenarios.</description>

      <title>Investigating and Enhancing Vision-Audio Capability in Omnimodal Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00059v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Omnimodal Large Language Models (OLLMs) have shown significant progress in integrating vision and text, but still struggle with integrating vision and audio, often exhibiting suboptimal performance when processing audio queries compared to text queries. This disparity is primarily due to insufficient alignment between vision and audio modalities during training, leading to inadequate attention to visual information when using audio queries. To mitigate this issue, we propose a Self-Knowledge Distillation (Self-KD) training method where the vision-text component of the OLLM serves as the teacher and the vision-audio component as the student. This enables the model to process audio in a manner analogous to its text processing. Our experimental results demonstrate that Self-KD is an effective method for enhancing the vision-audio capabilities of OLLMs by learning from the vision-text components, which subsequently improves the interaction between audio and images and results in improved performance on multimodal tasks.</description>

      <title>Removing Averaging: Personalized Lip-Sync Driven Characters Based on Identity Adapter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06397v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based lip-syncing generative models have demonstrated their ability to produce highly synchronized talking face videos for visual dubbing. Although these models excel at lip synchronization, they often struggle to maintain fine-grained control over facial details in generated images. In this work, we identify "lip averaging" phenomenon where the model fails to preserve subtle facial details when dubbing unseen in-the-wild videos. This issue arises because the commonly used UNet backbone primarily integrates audio features into visual representations in the latent space via cross-attention mechanisms and multi-scale fusion, but it struggles to retain fine-grained lip details in the generated faces. To address this issue, we propose UnAvgLip, which extracts identity embeddings from reference videos to generate highly faithful facial sequences while maintaining accurate lip synchronization. Specifically, our method comprises two primary components: (1) an Identity Perceiver module that encodes facial embeddings to align with conditioned audio features; and (2) an ID-CrossAttn module that injects facial embeddings into the generation process, enhancing model's capability of identity retention. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, at a modest training and inference cost, UnAvgLip effectively mitigates the "averaging" phenomenon in lip inpainting, significantly preserving unique facial characteristics while maintaining precise lip synchronization. Compared with the original approach, our method demonstrates significant improvements of 5% on the identity consistency metric and 2% on the SSIM metric across two benchmark datasets (HDTF and LRW).</description>

      <title>Does Acceleration Cause Hidden Instability in Vision Language Models? Uncovering Instance-Level Divergence Through a Large-Scale Empirical Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06794v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are powerful yet computationally intensive for widespread practical deployments. To address such challenge without costly re-training, post-training acceleration techniques like quantization and token reduction are extensively explored. However, current acceleration evaluations primarily target minimal overall performance degradation, overlooking a crucial question: does the accelerated model still give the same answers to the same questions as it did before acceleration? This is vital for stability-centered industrial applications where consistently correct answers for specific, known situations are paramount, such as in AI-based disease diagnosis. We systematically investigate this for accelerated VLMs, testing four leading models (LLaVA-1.5, LLaVA-Next, Qwen2-VL, Qwen2.5-VL) with eight acceleration methods on ten multi-modal benchmarks. Our findings are stark: despite minimal aggregate performance drops, accelerated models changed original answers up to 20% of the time. Critically, up to 6.5% of these changes converted correct answers to incorrect. Input perturbations magnified these inconsistencies, and the trend is confirmed by case studies with the medical VLM LLaVA-Med. This research reveals a significant oversight in VLM acceleration, stressing an urgent need for instance-level stability checks to ensure trustworthy real-world deployment.</description>

      <title>Certifiably Optimal Anisotropic Rotation Averaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07353v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rotation averaging is a key subproblem in applications of computer vision and robotics. Many methods for solving this problem exist, and there are also several theoretical results analyzing difficulty and optimality. However, one aspect that most of these have in common is a focus on the isotropic setting, where the intrinsic uncertainties in the measurements are not fully incorporated into the resulting optimization task. Recent empirical results suggest that moving to an anisotropic framework, where these uncertainties are explicitly included, can result in an improvement of solution quality. However, global optimization for rotation averaging has remained a challenge in this scenario. In this work we show how anisotropic costs can be incorporated in certifiably optimal rotation averaging. We also demonstrate how existing solvers, designed for isotropic situations, fail in the anisotropic setting. Finally, we propose a stronger relaxation and empirically show that it recovers global optima in all tested datasets and leads to more accurate reconstructions in almost all scenes.</description>

      <title>Pathology-Aware Adaptive Watermarking for Text-Driven Medical Image Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08346v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As recent text-conditioned diffusion models have enabled the generation of high-quality images, concerns over their potential misuse have also grown. This issue is critical in the medical domain, where text-conditioned generated medical images could enable insurance fraud or falsified records, highlighting the urgent need for reliable safeguards against unethical use. While watermarking techniques have emerged as a promising solution in general image domains, their direct application to medical imaging presents significant challenges. A key challenge is preserving fine-grained disease manifestations, as even minor distortions from a watermark may lead to clinical misinterpretation, which compromises diagnostic integrity. To overcome this gap, we present MedSign, a deep learning-based watermarking framework specifically designed for text-to-medical image synthesis, which preserves pathologically significant regions by adaptively adjusting watermark strength. Specifically, we generate a pathology localization map using cross-attention between medical text tokens and the diffusion denoising network, aggregating token-wise attention across layers, heads, and time steps. Leveraging this map, we optimize the LDM decoder to incorporate watermarking during image synthesis, ensuring cohesive integration while minimizing interference in diagnostically critical regions. Experimental results show that our MedSign preserves diagnostic integrity while ensuring watermark robustness, achieving state-of-the-art performance in image quality and detection accuracy on MIMIC-CXR and OIA-ODIR datasets.</description>

      <title>Generative Frame Sampler for Long Video Understanding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09146v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite recent advances in Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs), effectively understanding long-form videos remains a significant challenge. Perceiving lengthy videos containing thousands of frames poses substantial computational burden. To mitigate this issue, this paper introduces Generative Frame Sampler (GenS), a plug-and-play module integrated with VideoLLMs to facilitate efficient lengthy video perception. Built upon a lightweight VideoLLM, GenS leverages its inherent vision-language capabilities to identify question-relevant frames. To facilitate effective retrieval, we construct GenS-Video-150K, a large-scale video instruction dataset with dense frame relevance annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GenS consistently boosts the performance of various VideoLLMs, including open-source models (Qwen2-VL-7B, Aria-25B, VILA-40B, LLaVA-Video-7B/72B) and proprietary assistants (GPT-4o, Gemini). When equipped with GenS, open-source VideoLLMs achieve impressive state-of-the-art results on long-form video benchmarks: LLaVA-Video-72B reaches 66.8 (+4.3) on LongVideoBench and 77.0 (+2.7) on MLVU, while Aria obtains 39.2 on HourVideo surpassing the Gemini-1.5-pro by 1.9 points. We will release all datasets and models at https://generative-sampler.github.io.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Diffusion Sampling via Exploiting Local Transition Coherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09675v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Text-based diffusion models have made significant breakthroughs in generating high-quality images and videos from textual descriptions. However, the lengthy sampling time of the denoising process remains a significant bottleneck in practical applications. Previous methods either ignore the statistical relationships between adjacent steps or rely on attention or feature similarity between them, which often only works with specific network structures. To address this issue, we discover a new statistical relationship in the transition operator between adjacent steps, focusing on the relationship of the outputs from the network. This relationship does not impose any requirements on the network structure. Based on this observation, we propose a novel training-free acceleration method called LTC-Accel, which uses the identified relationship to estimate the current transition operator based on adjacent steps. Due to no specific assumptions regarding the network structure, LTC-Accel is applicable to almost all diffusion-based methods and orthogonal to almost all existing acceleration techniques, making it easy to combine with them. Experimental results demonstrate that LTC-Accel significantly speeds up sampling in text-to-image and text-to-video synthesis while maintaining competitive sample quality. Specifically, LTC-Accel achieves a speedup of 1.67-fold in Stable Diffusion v2 and a speedup of 1.55-fold in video generation models. When combined with distillation models, LTC-Accel achieves a remarkable 10-fold speedup in video generation, allowing real-time generation of more than 16FPS.</description>

      <title>Open-World Skill Discovery from Unsegmented Demonstrations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10684v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Learning skills in open-world environments is essential for developing agents capable of handling a variety of tasks by combining basic skills. Online demonstration videos are typically long but unsegmented, making them difficult to segment and label with skill identifiers. Unlike existing methods that rely on sequence sampling or human labeling, we have developed a self-supervised learning-based approach to segment these long videos into a series of semantic-aware and skill-consistent segments. Drawing inspiration from human cognitive event segmentation theory, we introduce Skill Boundary Detection (SBD), an annotation-free temporal video segmentation algorithm. SBD detects skill boundaries in a video by leveraging prediction errors from a pretrained unconditional action-prediction model. This approach is based on the assumption that a significant increase in prediction error indicates a shift in the skill being executed. We evaluated our method in Minecraft, a rich open-world simulator with extensive gameplay videos available online. Our SBD-generated segments improved the average performance of conditioned policies by 63.7% and 52.1% on short-term atomic skill tasks, and their corresponding hierarchical agents by 11.3% and 20.8% on long-horizon tasks. Our method can leverage the diverse YouTube videos to train instruction-following agents. The project page can be found in https://craftjarvis.github.io/SkillDiscovery.</description>

      <title>NuiScene: Exploring Efficient Generation of Unbounded Outdoor Scenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16375v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the task of generating expansive outdoor scenes, ranging from castles to high-rises. Unlike indoor scene generation, which has been a primary focus of prior work, outdoor scene generation presents unique challenges, including wide variations in scene heights and the need for a method capable of rapidly producing large landscapes. To address this, we propose an efficient approach that encodes scene chunks as uniform vector sets, offering better compression and performance than the spatially structured latents used in prior methods. Furthermore, we train an explicit outpainting model for unbounded generation, which improves coherence compared to prior resampling-based inpainting schemes while also speeding up generation by eliminating extra diffusion steps. To facilitate this task, we curate NuiScene43, a small but high-quality set of scenes, preprocessed for joint training. Notably, when trained on scenes of varying styles, our model can blend different environments, such as rural houses and city skyscrapers, within the same scene, highlighting the potential of our curation process to leverage heterogeneous scenes for joint training.</description>

      <title>VPO: Aligning Text-to-Video Generation Models with Prompt Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20491v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Video generation models have achieved remarkable progress in text-to-video tasks. These models are typically trained on text-video pairs with highly detailed and carefully crafted descriptions, while real-world user inputs during inference are often concise, vague, or poorly structured. This gap makes prompt optimization crucial for generating high-quality videos. Current methods often rely on large language models (LLMs) to refine prompts through in-context learning, but suffer from several limitations: they may distort user intent, omit critical details, or introduce safety risks. Moreover, they optimize prompts without considering the impact on the final video quality, which can lead to suboptimal results. To address these issues, we introduce VPO, a principled framework that optimizes prompts based on three core principles: harmlessness, accuracy, and helpfulness. The generated prompts faithfully preserve user intents and, more importantly, enhance the safety and quality of generated videos. To achieve this, VPO employs a two-stage optimization approach. First, we construct and refine a supervised fine-tuning (SFT) dataset based on principles of safety and alignment. Second, we introduce both text-level and video-level feedback to further optimize the SFT model with preference learning. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that VPO significantly improves safety, alignment, and video quality compared to baseline methods. Moreover, VPO shows strong generalization across video generation models. Furthermore, we demonstrate that VPO could outperform and be combined with RLHF methods on video generation models, underscoring the effectiveness of VPO in aligning video generation models. Our code and data are publicly available at https://github.com/thu-coai/VPO.</description>

      <title>Flip Learning: Weakly Supervised Erase to Segment Nodules in Breast Ultrasound</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20685v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate segmentation of nodules in both 2D breast ultrasound (BUS) and 3D automated breast ultrasound (ABUS) is crucial for clinical diagnosis and treatment planning. Therefore, developing an automated system for nodule segmentation can enhance user independence and expedite clinical analysis. Unlike fully-supervised learning, weakly-supervised segmentation (WSS) can streamline the laborious and intricate annotation process. However, current WSS methods face challenges in achieving precise nodule segmentation, as many of them depend on inaccurate activation maps or inefficient pseudo-mask generation algorithms. In this study, we introduce a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning-based WSS framework called Flip Learning, which relies solely on 2D/3D boxes for accurate segmentation. Specifically, multiple agents are employed to erase the target from the box to facilitate classification tag flipping, with the erased region serving as the predicted segmentation mask. The key contributions of this research are as follows: (1) Adoption of a superpixel/supervoxel-based approach to encode the standardized environment, capturing boundary priors and expediting the learning process. (2) Introduction of three meticulously designed rewards, comprising a classification score reward and two intensity distribution rewards, to steer the agents' erasing process precisely, thereby avoiding both under- and over-segmentation. (3) Implementation of a progressive curriculum learning strategy to enable agents to interact with the environment in a progressively challenging manner, thereby enhancing learning efficiency. Extensively validated on the large in-house BUS and ABUS datasets, our Flip Learning method outperforms state-of-the-art WSS methods and foundation models, and achieves comparable performance as fully-supervised learning algorithms.</description>

Abstract: Physical agility is a necessary skill in competitive table tennis, but by no means sufficient. Champions excel in this fast-paced and highly dynamic environment by anticipating their opponent's intent - buying themselves the necessary time to react. In this work, we take one step towards designing such an anticipatory agent. Previous works have developed systems capable of real-time table tennis gameplay, though they often do not leverage anticipation. Among the works that forecast opponent actions, their approaches are limited by dataset size and variety. Our paper contributes (1) a scalable system for reconstructing monocular video of table tennis matches in 3D and (2) an uncertainty-aware controller that anticipates opponent actions. We demonstrate in simulation that our policy improves the ball return rate against high-speed hits from 49.9% to 59.0% as compared to a baseline non-anticipatory policy.</description>

      <title>PS-ReID: Advancing Person Re-Identification and Precise Segmentation with Multimodal Retrieval</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21595v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Person re-identification (ReID) plays a critical role in applications such as security surveillance and criminal investigations. Most traditional image-based ReID methods face challenges including occlusions and lighting changes, while text provides complementary information to mitigate these issues. However, the integration of both image and text modalities remains underexplored. To address this gap, we propose {\bf PS-ReID}, a multimodal model that combines image and text inputs to enhance ReID performance. In contrast to existing ReID methods limited by cropped pedestrian images, our PS-ReID focuses on full-scene settings and introduces a multimodal ReID task that incorporates segmentation, enabling precise feature extraction of the queried individual, even under challenging conditions such as occlusion. To this end, our model adopts a dual-path asymmetric encoding scheme that explicitly separates query and target roles: the query branch captures identity-discriminative cues, while the target branch performs holistic scene reasoning. Additionally, a token-level ReID loss supervises identity-aware tokens, coupling retrieval and segmentation to yield masks that are both spatially precise and identity-consistent. To facilitate systematic evaluation, we construct M2ReID, currently the largest full-scene multimodal ReID dataset, with over 200K images and 4,894 identities, featuring multimodal queries and high-quality segmentation masks. Experimental results demonstrate that PS-ReID significantly outperforms unimodal query-based models in both ReID and segmentation tasks. The model excels in challenging real-world scenarios such as occlusion, low lighting, and background clutter, offering a robust and flexible solution for person retrieval and segmentation. All code, models, and datasets will be publicly available.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23958v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Melanoma is the most lethal form of skin cancer, with an increasing incidence rate worldwide. Analyzing histological images of melanoma by localizing and classifying tissues and cell nuclei is considered the gold standard method for diagnosis and treatment options for patients. While many computerized approaches have been proposed for automatic analysis, most perform tissue-based analysis and nuclei (cell)-based analysis as separate tasks, which might be suboptimal.
  In this work, using the PUMA challenge dataset, we propose a novel multi-stage deep learning approach by combining tissue and nuclei information in a unified framework based on the auto-context concept to perform segmentation and classification in histological images of melanoma. Through pre-training and further post-processing, our approach achieved second and first place rankings in the PUMA challenge, with average micro Dice tissue score and summed nuclei F1-score of 73.40% for Track 1 and 63.48% for Track 2, respectively. Furthermore, through a comprehensive ablation study and additional evaluation on an external dataset, we demonstrated the effectiveness of the framework components as well as the generalization capabilities of the proposed approach.

      <title>Leveraging Modality Tags for Enhanced Cross-Modal Video Retrieval</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01591v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Video retrieval requires aligning visual content with corresponding natural language descriptions. In this paper, we introduce Modality Auxiliary Concepts for Video Retrieval (MAC-VR), a novel approach that leverages modality-specific tags -- automatically extracted from foundation models -- to enhance video retrieval. We propose to align modalities in a latent space, along with learning and aligning auxiliary latent concepts derived from the features of a video and its corresponding caption. We introduce these auxiliary concepts to improve the alignment of visual and textual latent concepts, allowing concepts to be distinguished from one another.
  We conduct extensive experiments on six diverse datasets: two different splits of MSR-VTT, DiDeMo, TGIF, Charades and YouCook2. The experimental results consistently demonstrate that modality-specific tags improve cross-modal alignment, outperforming current state-of-the-art methods across three datasets and performing comparably or better across others.

More recently, vision transformers (ViTs) have gained popularity, using self-attention mechanisms to capture global dependencies, but lacking the inherent spatial localization of convolutions. Therefore, hybrid models combining CNNs and ViTs have been developed to combine the strengths of both architectures. However, such hybrid models are difficult to interpret, which hinders their application in medical imaging. In this work, we introduce an interpretable-by-design hybrid fully convolutional CNN-Transformer architecture for retinal disease detection. Unlike widely used post-hoc saliency methods for ViTs, our approach generates faithful and localized evidence maps that directly reflect the mode's decision process. We evaluated our method on two medical tasks focused on disease detection using color fundus images. Our model achieves state-of-the-art predictive performance compared to black-box and interpretable models and provides class-specific sparse evidence maps in a single forward pass.

Abstract: Enhancement of images from RGB cameras is of particular interest due to its wide range of ever-increasing applications such as medical imaging, satellite imaging, automated driving, etc. In autonomous driving, various techniques are used to enhance image quality under challenging lighting conditions. These include artificial augmentation to improve visibility in poor nighttime conditions, illumination-invariant imaging to reduce the impact of lighting variations, and shadow mitigation to ensure consistent image clarity in bright daylight. This paper proposes a pipeline for Shadow Erosion and Nighttime Adaptability in images for automated driving applications while preserving color and texture details. The Shadow Erosion and Nighttime Adaptability pipeline is compared to the widely used CLAHE technique and evaluated based on illumination uniformity and visual perception quality metrics. The results also demonstrate a significant improvement over CLAHE, enhancing a YOLO-based drivable area segmentation algorithm.</description>

      <title>Cognitive-Inspired Hierarchical Attention Fusion With Visual and Textual for Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation</title>

Abstract: Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation (CDSR) predicts user behavior by leveraging historical interactions across multiple domains, focusing on modeling cross-domain preferences through intra- and inter-sequence item relationships. Inspired by human cognitive processes, we propose Hierarchical Attention Fusion of Visual and Textual Representations (HAF-VT), a novel approach integrating visual and textual data to enhance cognitive modeling. Using the frozen CLIP model, we generate image and text embeddings, enriching item representations with multimodal data. A hierarchical attention mechanism jointly learns single-domain and cross-domain preferences, mimicking human information integration. Evaluated on four e-commerce datasets, HAF-VT outperforms existing methods in capturing cross-domain user interests, bridging cognitive principles with computational models and highlighting the role of multimodal data in sequential decision-making.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16064v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Latent diffusion models (LDMs) dominate high-quality image generation, yet integrating representation learning with generative modeling remains a challenge. We introduce a novel generative image modeling framework that seamlessly bridges this gap by leveraging a diffusion model to jointly model low-level image latents (from a variational autoencoder) and high-level semantic features (from a pretrained self-supervised encoder like DINO). Our latent-semantic diffusion approach learns to generate coherent image-feature pairs from pure noise, significantly enhancing both generative quality and training efficiency, all while requiring only minimal modifications to standard Diffusion Transformer architectures. By eliminating the need for complex distillation objectives, our unified design simplifies training and unlocks a powerful new inference strategy: Representation Guidance, which leverages learned semantics to steer and refine image generation. Evaluated in both conditional and unconditional settings, our method delivers substantial improvements in image quality and training convergence speed, establishing a new direction for representation-aware generative modeling.

      <title>Depth3DLane: Monocular 3D Lane Detection via Depth Prior Distillation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18325v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Monocular 3D lane detection is challenging due to the difficulty in capturing depth information from single-camera images. A common strategy involves transforming front-view (FV) images into bird's-eye-view (BEV) space through inverse perspective mapping (IPM), facilitating lane detection using BEV features. However, IPM's flat-ground assumption and loss of contextual information lead to inaccuracies in reconstructing 3D information, especially height. In this paper, we introduce a BEV-based framework to address these limitations and improve 3D lane detection accuracy. Our approach incorporates a Hierarchical Depth-Aware Head that provides multi-scale depth features, mitigating the flat-ground assumption by enhancing spatial awareness across varying depths. Additionally, we leverage Depth Prior Distillation to transfer semantic depth knowledge from a teacher model, capturing richer structural and contextual information for complex lane structures. To further refine lane continuity and ensure smooth lane reconstruction, we introduce a Conditional Random Field module that enforces spatial coherence in lane predictions. Extensive experiments validate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of z-axis error and outperforms other methods in the field in overall performance.

      <title>FedMVP: Federated Multimodal Visual Prompt Tuning for Vision-Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20860v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In federated learning, textual prompt tuning adapts Vision-Language Models (e.g., CLIP) by tuning lightweight input tokens (or prompts) on local client data, while keeping network weights frozen. After training, only the prompts are shared by the clients with the central server for aggregation. However, textual prompt tuning suffers from overfitting to known concepts, limiting its generalizability to unseen concepts. To address this limitation, we propose Multimodal Visual Prompt Tuning (FedMVP) that conditions the prompts on multimodal contextual information - derived from the input image and textual attribute features of a class. At the core of FedMVP is a PromptFormer module that synergistically aligns textual and visual features through a cross-attention mechanism. The dynamically generated multimodal visual prompts are then input to the frozen vision encoder of CLIP, and trained with a combination of CLIP similarity loss and a consistency loss. Extensive evaluation on 20 datasets, spanning three generalization settings, demonstrates that FedMVP not only preserves performance on in-distribution classes and domains, but also displays higher generalizability to unseen classes and domains, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by a notable margin of +1.57% - 2.26%.

      <title>Automated Parsing of Engineering Drawings for Structured Information Extraction Using a Fine-tuned Document Understanding Transformer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01530v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate extraction of key information from 2D engineering drawings is crucial for high-precision manufacturing. Manual extraction is time-consuming and error-prone, while traditional Optical Character Recognition (OCR) techniques often struggle with complex layouts and overlapping symbols, resulting in unstructured outputs. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel hybrid deep learning framework for structured information extraction by integrating an oriented bounding box (OBB) detection model with a transformer-based document parsing model (Donut). An in-house annotated dataset is used to train YOLOv11 for detecting nine key categories: Geometric Dimensioning and Tolerancing (GD&amp;T), General Tolerances, Measures, Materials, Notes, Radii, Surface Roughness, Threads, and Title Blocks. Detected OBBs are cropped into images and labeled to fine-tune Donut for structured JSON output. Fine-tuning strategies include a single model trained across all categories and category-specific models. Results show that the single model consistently outperforms category-specific ones across all evaluation metrics, achieving higher precision (94.77% for GD&amp;T), recall (100% for most), and F1 score (97.3%), while reducing hallucination (5.23%). The proposed framework improves accuracy, reduces manual effort, and supports scalable deployment in precision-driven industries.</description>

      <title>A Rate-Quality Model for Learned Video Coding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02720v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Learned video coding (LVC) has recently achieved superior coding performance. In this paper, we model the rate-quality (R-Q) relationship for learned video coding by a parametric function. We learn a neural network, termed RQNet, to characterize the relationship between the bitrate and quality level according to video content and coding context. The predicted (R,Q) results are further integrated with those from previously coded frames using the least-squares method to determine the parameters of our R-Q model on-the-fly. Compared to the conventional approaches, our method accurately estimates the R-Q relationship, enabling the online adaptation of model parameters to enhance both flexibility and precision. Experimental results show that our R-Q model achieves significantly smaller bitrate deviations than the baseline method on commonly used datasets with minimal additional complexity.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty-Aware Prototype Semantic Decoupling for Text-Based Person Search in Full Images</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03567v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Text-based pedestrian search (TBPS) in full images aims to locate a target pedestrian in untrimmed images using natural language descriptions. However, in complex scenes with multiple pedestrians, existing methods are limited by uncertainties in detection and matching, leading to degraded performance. To address this, we propose UPD-TBPS, a novel framework comprising three modules: Multi-granularity Uncertainty Estimation (MUE), Prototype-based Uncertainty Decoupling (PUD), and Cross-modal Re-identification (ReID). MUE conducts multi-granularity queries to identify potential targets and assigns confidence scores to reduce early-stage uncertainty. PUD leverages visual context decoupling and prototype mining to extract features of the target pedestrian described in the query. It separates and learns pedestrian prototype representations at both the coarse-grained cluster level and the fine-grained individual level, thereby reducing matching uncertainty. ReID evaluates candidates with varying confidence levels, improving detection and retrieval accuracy. Experiments on CUHK-SYSU-TBPS and PRW-TBPS datasets validate the effectiveness of our framework.</description>

Abstract: Recent advances in soccer understanding have demonstrated rapid progress, yet existing research predominantly focuses on isolated or narrow tasks. To bridge this gap, we propose a comprehensive framework for holistic soccer understanding. Concretely, we make the following contributions in this paper: (i) we construct SoccerWiki, the first large-scale multimodal soccer knowledge base, integrating rich domain knowledge about players, teams, referees, and venues to enable knowledge-driven reasoning; (ii) we present SoccerBench, the largest and most comprehensive soccer-specific benchmark, featuring around 10K multimodal (text, image, video) multi-choice QA pairs across 13 distinct tasks; (iii) we introduce SoccerAgent, a novel multi-agent system that decomposes complex soccer questions via collaborative reasoning, leveraging domain expertise from SoccerWiki and achieving robust performance; (iv) extensive evaluations and comparisons with representative MLLMs on SoccerBench highlight the superiority of our agentic system.</description>

      <title>A Large-scale Benchmark on Geological Fault Delineation Models: Domain Shift, Training Dynamics, Generalizability, Evaluation and Inferential Behavior</title>

Abstract: Machine learning has taken a critical role in seismic interpretation workflows, especially in fault delineation tasks. However, despite the recent proliferation of pretrained models and synthetic datasets, the field still lacks a systematic understanding of the generalizability limits of these models across seismic data representing diverse geologic, acquisition and processing settings. Distributional shifts between data sources, limitations in fine-tuning strategies and labeled data accessibility, and inconsistent evaluation protocols all remain major roadblocks to deploying reliable models in real-world exploration. In this paper, we present the first large-scale benchmarking study explicitly designed to provide guidelines for domain shift strategies in seismic interpretation. Our benchmark spans over 200 combinations of model architectures, datasets and training strategies, across three datasets (synthetic and real) including FaultSeg3D, CRACKS, and Thebe. We systematically assess pretraining, fine-tuning, and joint training under varying domain shifts. Our analysis shows that common fine-tuning practices can lead to catastrophic forgetting, especially when source and target datasets are disjoint, and that larger models such as Segformer are more robust than smaller architectures. We also find that domain adaptation methods outperform fine-tuning when shifts are large, yet underperform when domains are similar. Finally, we complement segmentation metrics with a novel analysis based on fault characteristic descriptors, revealing how models absorb structural biases from training datasets. Overall, we establish a robust experimental baseline that provides insights into tradeoffs in current fault delineation workflows and highlights directions for building more generalizable and interpretable models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10292v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Visual storytelling systems struggle to maintain character identity across frames and link actions to appropriate subjects, frequently leading to referential hallucinations. These issues can be addressed through grounding of characters, objects, and other entities on the visual elements. We propose StoryReasoning, a dataset containing 4,178 stories derived from 52,016 movie images, with both structured scene analyses and grounded stories. Each story maintains character and object consistency across frames while explicitly modeling multi-frame relationships through structured tabular representations. Our approach features cross-frame object re-identification using visual similarity and face recognition, chain-of-thought reasoning for explicit narrative modeling, and a grounding scheme that links textual elements to visual entities across multiple frames. We establish baseline performance by fine-tuning Qwen2.5-VL 7B, creating Qwen Storyteller, which performs end-to-end object detection, re-identification, and landmark detection while maintaining consistent object references throughout the story. Evaluation demonstrates a reduction from 4.06 to 3.56 (-12.3%) hallucinations on average per story and an improvement in creativity from 2.58 to 3.38 (+31.0%) when compared to a non-fine-tuned model.</description>

Abstract: Understanding and decoding brain activity into visual representations is a fundamental challenge at the intersection of neuroscience and artificial intelligence. While EEG visual decoding has shown promise due to its non-invasive, and low-cost nature, existing methods suffer from Hierarchical Neural Encoding Neglect (HNEN)-a critical limitation where flat neural representations fail to model the brain's hierarchical visual processing hierarchy. Inspired by the hierarchical organization of visual cortex, we propose ViEEG, a neuro-We further adopt hierarchical contrastive learning for EEG-CLIP representation alignment, enabling zero-shot object recognition. Extensive experiments on the THINGS-EEG dataset demonstrate that ViEEG significantly outperforms previous methods by a large margin in both subject-dependent and subject-independent settings. Results on the THINGS-MEG dataset further confirm ViEEG's generalization to different neural modalities. Our framework not only advances the performance frontier but also sets a new paradigm for EEG brain decoding. inspired framework that addresses HNEN. ViEEG decomposes each visual stimulus into three biologically aligned components-contour, foreground object, and contextual scene-serving as anchors for a three-stream EEG encoder. These EEG features are progressively integrated via cross-attention routing, simulating cortical information flow from low-level to high-level vision.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12620v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Advances in AI generative models facilitate super-realistic video synthesis, amplifying misinformation risks via social media and eroding trust in digital content. Several research works have explored new deepfake detection methods on AI-generated images to alleviate these risks. However, with the fast development of video generation models, such as Sora and WanX, there is currently a lack of large-scale, high-quality AI-generated video datasets for forgery detection. In addition, existing detection approaches predominantly treat the task as binary classification, lacking explainability in model decision-making and failing to provide actionable insights or guidance for the public. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{GenBuster-200K}, a large-scale AI-generated video dataset featuring 200K high-resolution video clips, diverse latest generative techniques, and real-world scenes. We further introduce \textbf{BusterX}, a novel AI-generated video detection and explanation framework leveraging multimodal large language model (MLLM) and reinforcement learning for authenticity determination and explainable rationale. To our knowledge, GenBuster-200K is the {\it \textbf{first}} large-scale, high-quality AI-generated video dataset that incorporates the latest generative techniques for real-world scenarios. BusterX is the {\it \textbf{first}} framework to integrate MLLM with reinforcement learning for explainable AI-generated video detection. Extensive comparisons with state-of-the-art methods and ablation studies validate the effectiveness and generalizability of BusterX. The code, models, and datasets will be released.</description>

      <title>RUSplatting: Robust 3D Gaussian Splatting for Sparse-View Underwater Scene Reconstruction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.15737v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reconstructing high-fidelity underwater scenes remains a challenging task due to light absorption, scattering, and limited visibility inherent in aquatic environments. This paper presents an enhanced Gaussian Splatting-based framework that improves both the visual quality and geometric accuracy of deep underwater rendering. We propose decoupled learning for RGB channels, guided by the physics of underwater attenuation, to enable more accurate colour restoration. To address sparse-view limitations and improve view consistency, we introduce a frame interpolation strategy with a novel adaptive weighting scheme. Additionally, we introduce a new loss function aimed at reducing noise while preserving edges, which is essential for deep-sea content. We also release a newly collected dataset, Submerged3D, captured specifically in deep-sea environments. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods with PSNR gains up to 1.90dB, delivering superior perceptual quality and robustness, and offering promising directions for marine robotics and underwater visual analytics. The code of RUSplatting is available at https://github.com/theflash987/RUSplatting and the dataset Submerged3D can be downloaded at https://zenodo.org/records/15482420.</description>

      <title>So-Fake: Benchmarking and Explaining Social Media Image Forgery Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18660v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in AI-powered generative models have enabled the creation of increasingly realistic synthetic images, posing significant risks to information integrity and public trust on social media platforms. While robust detection frameworks and diverse, large-scale datasets are essential to mitigate these risks, existing academic efforts remain limited in scope: current datasets lack the diversity, scale, and realism required for social media contexts, while detection methods struggle with generalization to unseen generative technologies. To bridge this gap, we introduce So-Fake-Set, a comprehensive social media-oriented dataset with over 2 million high-quality images, diverse generative sources, and photorealistic imagery synthesized using 35 state-of-the-art generative models. To rigorously evaluate cross-domain robustness, we establish a novel and large-scale (100K) out-of-domain benchmark (So-Fake-OOD) featuring synthetic imagery from commercial models explicitly excluded from the training distribution, creating a realistic testbed for evaluating real-world performance. Leveraging these resources, we present So-Fake-R1, an advanced vision-language framework that employs reinforcement learning for highly accurate forgery detection, precise localization, and explainable inference through interpretable visual rationales. Extensive experiments show that So-Fake-R1 outperforms the second-best method, with a 1.3% gain in detection accuracy and a 4.5% increase in localization IoU. By integrating a scalable dataset, a challenging OOD benchmark, and an advanced detection framework, this work establishes a new foundation for social media-centric forgery detection research. The code, models, and datasets will be released publicly.</description>

      <title>DiffDecompose: Layer-Wise Decomposition of Alpha-Composited Images via Diffusion Transformers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21541v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion models have recently motivated great success in many generation tasks like object removal. Nevertheless, existing image decomposition methods struggle to disentangle semi-transparent or transparent layer occlusions due to mask prior dependencies, static object assumptions, and the lack of datasets. In this paper, we delve into a novel task: Layer-Wise Decomposition of Alpha-Composited Images, aiming to recover constituent layers from single overlapped images under the condition of semi-transparent/transparent alpha layer non-linear occlusion. To address challenges in layer ambiguity, generalization, and data scarcity, we first introduce AlphaBlend, the first large-scale and high-quality dataset for transparent and semi-transparent layer decomposition, supporting six real-world subtasks (e.g., translucent flare removal, semi-transparent cell decomposition, glassware decomposition). Building on this dataset, we present DiffDecompose, a diffusion Transformer-based framework that learns the posterior over possible layer decompositions conditioned on the input image, semantic prompts, and blending type. Rather than regressing alpha mattes directly, DiffDecompose performs In-Context Decomposition, enabling the model to predict one or multiple layers without per-layer supervision, and introduces Layer Position Encoding Cloning to maintain pixel-level correspondence across layers. Extensive experiments on the proposed AlphaBlend dataset and public LOGO dataset verify the effectiveness of DiffDecompose. The code and dataset will be available upon paper acceptance. Our code will be available at: https://github.com/Wangzt1121/DiffDecompose.</description>

      <title>Can NeRFs See without Cameras?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22441v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have been remarkably successful at synthesizing novel views of 3D scenes by optimizing a volumetric scene function. This scene function models how optical rays bring color information from a 3D object to the camera pixels. Radio frequency (RF) or audio signals can also be viewed as a vehicle for delivering information about the environment to a sensor. However, unlike camera pixels, an RF/audio sensor receives a mixture of signals that contain many environmental reflections (also called "multipath"). Is it still possible to infer the environment using such multipath signals? We show that with redesign, NeRFs can be taught to learn from multipath signals, and thereby "see" the environment. As a grounding application, we aim to infer the indoor floorplan of a home from sparse WiFi measurements made at multiple locations inside the home. Although a difficult inverse problem, our implicitly learnt floorplans look promising, and enables forward applications, such as indoor signal prediction and basic ray tracing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01921v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Text-guided image editing has seen rapid progress in natural image domains, but its adaptation to medical imaging remains limited and lacks standardized evaluation. Clinically, such editing holds promise for simulating surgical outcomes, creating personalized teaching materials, and enhancing patient communication. To bridge this gap, we introduce MedEBench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating text-guided medical image editing. It consists of 1,182 clinically sourced image-prompt triplets spanning 70 tasks across 13 anatomical regions. MedEBench offers three key contributions: (1) a clinically relevant evaluation framework covering Editing Accuracy, Contextual Preservation, and Visual Quality, supported by detailed descriptions of expected change and ROI (Region of Interest) masks; (2) a systematic comparison of seven state-of-the-art models, revealing common failure patterns; and (3) a failure analysis protocol based on attention grounding, using IoU between attention maps and ROIs to identify mislocalization. MedEBench provides a solid foundation for developing and evaluating reliable, clinically meaningful medical image editing systems.

      <title>CarboFormer: A Lightweight Semantic Segmentation Architecture for Efficient Carbon Dioxide Detection Using Optical Gas Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05360v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Carbon dioxide (CO$_2$) emissions are critical indicators of both environmental impact and various industrial processes, including livestock management. We introduce CarboFormer, a lightweight semantic segmentation framework for Optical Gas Imaging (OGI), designed to detect and quantify CO$_2$ emissions across diverse applications. Our approach integrates an optimized encoder-decoder architecture with specialized multi-scale feature fusion and auxiliary supervision strategies to effectively model both local details and global relationships in gas plume imagery while achieving competitive accuracy with minimal computational overhead for resource-constrained environments. We contribute two novel datasets: (1) the Controlled Carbon Dioxide Release (CCR) dataset, which simulates gas leaks with systematically varied flow rates (10-100 SCCM), and (2) the Real Time Ankom (RTA) dataset, focusing on emissions from dairy cow rumen fluid in vitro experiments. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that CarboFormer achieves competitive performance with 84.88\% mIoU on CCR and 92.98\% mIoU on RTA, while maintaining computational efficiency with only 5.07M parameters and operating at 84.68 FPS. The model shows particular effectiveness in challenging low-flow scenarios and significantly outperforms other lightweight methods like SegFormer-B0 (83.36\% mIoU on CCR) and SegNeXt (82.55\% mIoU on CCR), making it suitable for real-time monitoring on resource-constrained platforms such as programmable drones. Our work advances both environmental sensing and precision livestock management by providing robust and efficient tools for CO$_2$ emission analysis.</description>

      <title>TriPSS: A Tri-Modal Keyframe Extraction Framework Using Perceptual, Structural, and Semantic Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05395v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficient keyframe extraction is critical for video summarization and retrieval, yet capturing the full semantic and visual richness of video content remains challenging. We introduce TriPSS, a tri-modal framework that integrates perceptual features from the CIELAB color space, structural embeddings from ResNet-50, and semantic context from frame-level captions generated by LLaMA-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct. These modalities are fused using principal component analysis to form compact multi-modal embeddings, enabling adaptive video segmentation via HDBSCAN clustering. A refinement stage incorporating quality assessment and duplicate filtering ensures the final keyframe set is both concise and semantically diverse. Evaluations on the TVSum20 and SumMe benchmarks show that TriPSS achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming both unimodal and prior multimodal approaches. These results highlight TriPSS' ability to capture complementary visual and semantic cues, establishing it as an effective solution for video summarization, retrieval, and large-scale multimedia understanding.</description>

      <title>Domain Adaptation for Big Data in Agricultural Image Analysis: A Comprehensive Review</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05972v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the wide application of computer vision in agriculture, image analysis has become the key to tasks such as crop health monitoring and pest detection. However, the significant domain shifts caused by environmental changes, different crop types, and diverse data acquisition methods seriously hinder the generalization ability of the model in cross-region, cross-season, and complex agricultural scenarios. This paper explores how domain adaptation (DA) techniques can address these challenges to improve cross-domain transferability in agricultural image analysis. DA is considered a promising solution in the case of limited labeled data, insufficient model adaptability, and dynamic changes in the field environment. This paper systematically reviews the latest advances in DA in agricultural images in recent years, focusing on application scenarios such as crop health monitoring, pest and disease detection, and fruit identification, in which DA methods have significantly improved cross-domain performance. We categorize DA methods into shallow learning and deep learning methods, including supervised, semi-supervised and unsupervised strategies, and pay special attention to the adversarial learning-based techniques that perform well in complex scenarios. In addition, this paper also reviews the main public datasets of agricultural images, and evaluates their advantages and limitations in DA research. Overall, this study provides a complete framework and some key insights that can be used as a reference for the research and development of domain adaptation methods in future agricultural vision tasks.</description>

      <title>MCA-Bench: A Multimodal Benchmark for Evaluating CAPTCHA Robustness Against VLM-based Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05982v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As automated attack techniques rapidly advance, CAPTCHAs remain a critical defense mechanism against malicious bots. However, existing CAPTCHA schemes encompass a diverse range of modalities -- from static distorted text and obfuscated images to interactive clicks, sliding puzzles, and logic-based questions -- yet the community still lacks a unified, large-scale, multimodal benchmark to rigorously evaluate their security robustness. To address this gap, we introduce MCA-Bench, a comprehensive and reproducible benchmarking suite that integrates heterogeneous CAPTCHA types into a single evaluation protocol. Leveraging a shared vision-language model backbone, we fine-tune specialized cracking agents for each CAPTCHA category, enabling consistent, cross-modal assessments. Extensive experiments reveal that MCA-Bench effectively maps the vulnerability spectrum of modern CAPTCHA designs under varied attack settings, and crucially offers the first quantitative analysis of how challenge complexity, interaction depth, and model solvability interrelate. Based on these findings, we propose three actionable design principles and identify key open challenges, laying the groundwork for systematic CAPTCHA hardening, fair benchmarking, and broader community collaboration. Datasets and code are available online.</description>

      <title>Compressed Feature Quality Assessment: Dataset and Baselines</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07412v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The widespread deployment of large models in resource-constrained environments has underscored the need for efficient transmission of intermediate feature representations. In this context, feature coding, which compresses features into compact bitstreams, becomes a critical component for scenarios involving feature transmission, storage, and reuse. However, this compression process inevitably introduces semantic degradation that is difficult to quantify with traditional metrics. To address this, we formalize the research problem of Compressed Feature Quality Assessment (CFQA), aiming to evaluate the semantic fidelity of compressed features. To advance CFQA research, we propose the first benchmark dataset, comprising 300 original features and 12000 compressed features derived from three vision tasks and four feature codecs. Task-specific performance degradation is provided as true semantic distortion for evaluating CFQA metrics. We systematically assess three widely used metrics -- MSE, cosine similarity, and Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) -- in terms of their ability to capture semantic degradation. Our findings demonstrate the representativeness of the proposed dataset while underscoring the need for more sophisticated metrics capable of measuring semantic distortion in compressed features. This work advances the field by establishing a foundational benchmark and providing a critical resource for the community to explore CFQA. To foster further research, we release the dataset and all associated source code at https://github.com/chansongoal/Compressed-Feature-Quality-Assessment.</description>

      <title>A Vision-Language Agent System for Compositional Reasoning with VLM-assisted Script and Executable Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07778v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The advancement in large language models (LLMs) and large vision models has fueled the rapid progress in multi-modal vision-text reasoning capabilities. However, existing vision-language models (VLMs) to date offer poor performance for compositional reasoning. This paper presents VLAgent, a vision-language agent system for vision-text compositional reasoning with three novel features. First, VLAgent leverages a pre-trained LLM with few-shot context learning to generate the planning script for each compositional reasoning task and provides a backend engine to generate and perform executable runtime, which maps the planning script into executable code using the VLAgent library for VLAgent executor. Second, VLAgent introduces the SS-parser, which identifies and corrects logic errors embedded in the LLM-generated planning script, to further enhance the quality of script-executable mapping. Third, VLAgent introduces the compositional reasoning output verifier, which validates and refines the output of complex compositional reasoning steps, by leveraging complementary reasoning techniques, e.g., ensemble learning and caption analysis. Extensive experiments are conducted on six visual benchmarks and compared to a dozen of the SoTA visual reasoning models. The results show that VLAgent outperforms existing representative approaches for compositional text-visual reasoning. Our code and datasets with outputs will be made available upon acceptance.</description>

      <title>DART: Differentiable Dynamic Adaptive Region Tokenizer for Vision Transformer and Mamba</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10390v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, non-convolutional models such as the Vision Transformer (ViT) and Vision Mamba (Vim) have achieved remarkable performance in computer vision tasks. However, their reliance on fixed-size patches often results in excessive encoding of background regions and omission of critical local details, especially when informative objects are sparsely distributed. To address this, we introduce a fully differentiable Dynamic Adaptive Region Tokenizer (DART), which adaptively partitions images into content-dependent patches of varying sizes. DART combines learnable region scores with piecewise differentiable quantile operations to allocate denser tokens to information-rich areas. Despite introducing only approximately 1 million (1M) additional parameters, DART improves accuracy by 2.1% on DeiT (ImageNet-1K). Unlike methods that uniformly increase token density to capture fine-grained details, DART offers a more efficient alternative, achieving 45% FLOPs reduction with superior performance. Extensive experiments on DeiT, Vim, and VideoMamba confirm that DART consistently enhances accuracy while incurring minimal or even reduced computational overhead. Code is available at https://github.com/HCPLab-SYSU/DART.</description>

      <title>STAGE: A Stream-Centric Generative World Model for Long-Horizon Driving-Scene Simulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13138v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The generation of temporally consistent, high-fidelity driving videos over extended horizons presents a fundamental challenge in autonomous driving world modeling. Existing approaches often suffer from error accumulation and feature misalignment due to inadequate decoupling of spatio-temporal dynamics and limited cross-frame feature propagation mechanisms. To address these limitations, we present STAGE (Streaming Temporal Attention Generative Engine), a novel auto-regressive framework that pioneers hierarchical feature coordination and multi-phase optimization for sustainable video synthesis. To achieve high-quality long-horizon driving video generation, we introduce Hierarchical Temporal Feature Transfer (HTFT) and a novel multi-stage training strategy. HTFT enhances temporal consistency between video frames throughout the video generation process by modeling the temporal and denoising process separately and transferring denoising features between frames. The multi-stage training strategy is to divide the training into three stages, through model decoupling and auto-regressive inference process simulation, thereby accelerating model convergence and reducing error accumulation. Experiments on the Nuscenes dataset show that STAGE has significantly surpassed existing methods in the long-horizon driving video generation task. In addition, we also explored STAGE's ability to generate unlimited-length driving videos. We generated 600 frames of high-quality driving videos on the Nuscenes dataset, which far exceeds the maximum length achievable by existing methods.</description>

      <title>DExNet: Combining Observations of Domain Adapted Critics for Leaf Disease Classification with Limited Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18173v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While deep learning-based architectures have been widely used for correctly detecting and classifying plant diseases, they require large-scale datasets to learn generalized features and achieve state-of-the-art performance. This poses a challenge for such models to obtain satisfactory performance in classifying leaf diseases with limited samples. This work proposes a few-shot learning framework, Domain-adapted Expert Network (DExNet), for plant disease classification that compensates for the lack of sufficient training data by combining observations of a number of expert critics. It starts with extracting the feature embeddings as 'observations' from nine 'critics' that are state-of-the-art pre-trained CNN-based architectures. These critics are 'domain adapted' using a publicly available leaf disease dataset having no overlapping classes with the specific downstream task of interest. The observations are then passed to the 'Feature Fusion Block' and finally to a classifier network consisting of Bi-LSTM layers. The proposed pipeline is evaluated on the 10 classes of tomato leaf images from the PlantVillage dataset, achieving promising accuracies of 89.06%, 92.46%, and 94.07%, respectively, for 5-shot, 10-shot, and 15-shot classification. Furthermore, an accuracy of 98.09+-0.7% has been achieved in 80-shot classification, which is only 1.2% less than state-of-the-art, allowing a 94.5% reduction in the training data requirement. The proposed pipeline also outperforms existing works on leaf disease classification with limited data in both laboratory and real-life conditions in single-domain, mixed-domain, and cross-domain scenarios.</description>

Abstract: Accurately reconstructing the 3D structure of tornadoes is critically important for understanding and preparing for this highly destructive weather phenomenon. While modern 3D scene reconstruction techniques, such as 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS), could provide a valuable tool for reconstructing the 3D structure of tornados, at present we are critically lacking a controlled tornado dataset with which to develop and validate these tools. In this work we capture and release a novel multiview dataset of a small lab-based tornado. We demonstrate one can effectively reconstruct and visualize the 3D structure of this tornado using 3DGS.</description>

      <title>VSRM: A Robust Mamba-Based Framework for Video Super-Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22762v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Video super-resolution remains a major challenge in low-level vision tasks. To date, CNN- and Transformer-based methods have delivered impressive results. However, CNNs are limited by local receptive fields, while Transformers struggle with quadratic complexity, posing challenges for processing long sequences in VSR. Recently, Mamba has drawn attention for its long-sequence modeling, linear complexity, and large receptive fields. In this work, we propose VSRM, a novel \textbf{V}ideo \textbf{S}uper-\textbf{R}esolution framework that leverages the power of \textbf{M}amba. VSRM introduces Spatial-to-Temporal Mamba and Temporal-to-Spatial Mamba blocks to extract long-range spatio-temporal features and enhance receptive fields efficiently. To better align adjacent frames, we propose Deformable Cross-Mamba Alignment module. This module utilizes a deformable cross-mamba mechanism to make the compensation stage more dynamic and flexible, preventing feature distortions. Finally, we minimize the frequency domain gaps between reconstructed and ground-truth frames by proposing a simple yet effective Frequency Charbonnier-like loss that better preserves high-frequency content and enhances visual quality. Through extensive experiments, VSRM achieves state-of-the-art results on diverse benchmarks, establishing itself as a solid foundation for future research.</description>

      <title>LOD-GS: Level-of-Detail-Sensitive 3D Gaussian Splatting for Detail Conserved Anti-Aliasing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00554v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite the advancements in quality and efficiency achieved by 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) in 3D scene rendering, aliasing artifacts remain a persistent challenge. Existing approaches primarily rely on low-pass filtering to mitigate aliasing. However, these methods are not sensitive to the sampling rate, often resulting in under-filtering and over-smoothing renderings. To address this limitation, we propose LOD-GS, a Level-of-Detail-sensitive filtering framework for Gaussian Splatting, which dynamically predicts the optimal filtering strength for each 3D Gaussian primitive. Specifically, we introduce a set of basis functions to each Gaussian, which take the sampling rate as input to model appearance variations, enabling sampling-rate-sensitive filtering. These basis function parameters are jointly optimized with the 3D Gaussian in an end-to-end manner. The sampling rate is influenced by both focal length and camera distance. However, existing methods and datasets rely solely on down-sampling to simulate focal length changes for anti-aliasing evaluation, overlooking the impact of camera distance. To enable a more comprehensive assessment, we introduce a new synthetic dataset featuring objects rendered at varying camera distances. Extensive experiments on both public datasets and our newly collected dataset demonstrate that our method achieves SOTA rendering quality while effectively eliminating aliasing. The code and dataset have been open-sourced.</description>

      <title>NOCTIS: Novel Object Cyclic Threshold based Instance Segmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01463v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Instance segmentation of novel objects instances in RGB images, given some example images for each object, is a well known problem in computer vision. Designing a model general enough to be employed for all kinds of novel objects without (re-) training has proven to be a difficult task. To handle this, we present a new training-free framework, called: Novel Object Cyclic Threshold based Instance Segmentation (NOCTIS). NOCTIS integrates two pre-trained models: Grounded-SAM 2 for object proposals with precise bounding boxes and corresponding segmentation masks; and DINOv2 for robust class and patch embeddings, due to its zero-shot capabilities. Internally, the proposal-object matching is realized by determining an object matching score based on the similarity of the class embeddings and the average maximum similarity of the patch embeddings with a new cyclic thresholding (CT) mechanism that mitigates unstable matches caused by repetitive textures or visually similar patterns. Beyond CT, NOCTIS introduces: (i) an appearance score that is unaffected by object selection bias; (ii) the usage of the average confidence of the proposals bounding box and mask as a scoring component; and (iii) an RGB-only pipeline that performs even better than RGB-D ones. We empirically show that NOCTIS, without further training/fine tuning, attains state-of-the-art results regarding the mean AP score, w.r.t. the best RGB and RGB-D methods on the seven core datasets of the BOP 2023 challenge for the "Model-based 2D segmentation of unseen objects" task.</description>

      <title>IC-Custom: Diverse Image Customization via In-Context Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01926v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Image customization, a crucial technique for industrial media production, aims to generate content that is consistent with reference images. However, current approaches conventionally separate image customization into position-aware and position-free customization paradigms and lack a universal framework for diverse customization, limiting their applications across various scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we propose IC-Custom, a unified framework that seamlessly integrates position-aware and position-free image customization through in-context learning. IC-Custom concatenates reference images with target images to a polyptych, leveraging DiT's multi-modal attention mechanism for fine-grained token-level interactions. We introduce the In-context Multi-Modal Attention (ICMA) mechanism with learnable task-oriented register tokens and boundary-aware positional embeddings to enable the model to correctly handle different task types and distinguish various inputs in polyptych configurations. To bridge the data gap, we carefully curated a high-quality dataset of 12k identity-consistent samples with 8k from real-world sources and 4k from high-quality synthetic data, avoiding the overly glossy and over-saturated synthetic appearance. IC-Custom supports various industrial applications, including try-on, accessory placement, furniture arrangement, and creative IP customization. Extensive evaluations on our proposed ProductBench and the publicly available DreamBench demonstrate that IC-Custom significantly outperforms community workflows, closed-source models, and state-of-the-art open-source approaches. IC-Custom achieves approximately 73% higher human preference across identity consistency, harmonicity, and text alignment metrics, while training only 0.4% of the original model parameters.

      <description>arXiv:2507.05063v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Biomedical datasets are often constrained by stringent privacy requirements and frequently suffer from severe class imbalance. These two aspects hinder the development of accurate machine learning models. While generative AI offers a promising solution, producing synthetic images of sufficient quality for training robust classifiers remains challenging. This work addresses the classification of individual white blood cells, a critical task in diagnosing hematological malignancies such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We introduce CytoDiff, a stable diffusion model fine-tuned with LoRA weights and guided by few-shot samples that generates high-fidelity synthetic white blood cell images. Our approach demonstrates substantial improvements in classifier performance when training data is limited. Using a small, highly imbalanced real dataset, the addition of 5,000 synthetic images per class improved ResNet classifier accuracy from 27\% to 78\% (+51\%). Similarly, CLIP-based classification accuracy increased from 62\% to 77\% (+15\%). These results establish synthetic image generation as a valuable tool for biomedical machine learning, enhancing data coverage and facilitating secure data sharing while preserving patient privacy.

      <title>Driving as a Diagnostic Tool: Scenario-based Cognitive Assessment in Older Drivers from Driving Video</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05463v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce scenario-based cognitive status identification in older drivers from naturalistic driving videos, leveraging large vision models. In recent times, cognitive decline including Dementia and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), is often underdiagnosed due to the time-consuming and costly nature of current diagnostic methods. By analyzing real-world driving behavior captured through in-vehicle sensors, this study aims to extract "digital fingerprints" that correlate with functional decline and clinical features of dementia. Moreover, modern large vision models can draw meaningful insights from everyday driving patterns across different roadway scenarios to early detect cognitive decline. We propose a framework that uses large vision models and naturalistic driving videos to analyze driver behavior, identify cognitive status and predict disease progression. We leverage the strong relationship between real-world driving behavior as an observation of the current cognitive status of the drivers where the vehicle can be utilized as a "diagnostic tool". Our method identifies early warning signs of functional impairment, contributing to proactive intervention strategies. This work enhances early detection and supports the development of scalable, non-invasive monitoring systems to mitigate the growing societal and economic burden of cognitive decline in the aging population.</description>

      <title>Discontinuity-aware Normal Integration for Generic Central Camera Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06075v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recovering a 3D surface from its surface normal map, a problem known as normal integration, is a key component for photometric shape reconstruction techniques such as shape-from-shading and photometric stereo. The vast majority of existing approaches for normal integration handle only implicitly the presence of depth discontinuities and are limited to orthographic or ideal pinhole cameras. In this paper, we propose a novel formulation that allows modeling discontinuities explicitly and handling generic central cameras. Our key idea is based on a local planarity assumption, that we model through constraints between surface normals and ray directions. Compared to existing methods, our approach more accurately approximates the relation between depth and surface normals, achieves state-of-the-art results on the standard normal integration benchmark, and is the first to directly handle generic central camera models.</description>

      <title>HiM2SAM: Enhancing SAM2 with Hierarchical Motion Estimation and Memory Optimization towards Long-term Tracking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07603v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents enhancements to the SAM2 framework for video object tracking task, addressing challenges such as occlusions, background clutter, and target reappearance. We introduce a hierarchical motion estimation strategy, combining lightweight linear prediction with selective non-linear refinement to improve tracking accuracy without requiring additional training. In addition, we optimize the memory bank by distinguishing long-term and short-term memory frames, enabling more reliable tracking under long-term occlusions and appearance changes. Experimental results show consistent improvements across different model scales. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on LaSOT and LaSOText with the large model, achieving 9.6% and 7.2% relative improvements in AUC over the original SAM2, and demonstrates even larger relative gains on smaller models, highlighting the effectiveness of our trainless, low-overhead improvements for boosting long-term tracking performance.

      <title>SpatialViz-Bench: An MLLM Benchmark for Spatial Visualization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07610v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Humans can directly imagine and manipulate visual images in their minds, a capability known as spatial visualization. While multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) support imagination-based reasoning, spatial visualization remains insufficiently evaluated, typically embedded within broader mathematical and logical assessments. Existing evaluations often rely on IQ tests or math competitions that may overlap with training data, compromising assessment reliability. To this end, we introduce SpatialViz-Bench, a comprehensive multi-modal benchmark for spatial visualization with 12 tasks across 4 sub-abilities, comprising 1,180 automatically generated problems. Our evaluation of 33 state-of-the-art MLLMs not only reveals wide performance variations and demonstrates the benchmark's strong discriminative power, but also uncovers counter-intuitive findings: models show difficulty perception misaligned with human intuition, exhibit dramatic 2Dto-3D performance cliffs, default to formulaic derivation over visualization, and paradoxically suffer performance degradation from Chain-of-Thought prompting in open-source models. Through statistical and qualitative analysis of error types, SpatialViz-Bench demonstrates that state-of-the-art MLLMs continue to exhibit deficiencies in spatial visualization tasks, thereby addressing a significant lacuna in the field. The benchmark data and evaluation code are publicly available.</description>

      <title>Simplifying Traffic Anomaly Detection with Video Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09338v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent methods for ego-centric Traffic Anomaly Detection (TAD) often rely on complex multi-stage or multi-representation fusion architectures, yet it remains unclear whether such complexity is necessary. Recent findings in visual perception suggest that foundation models, enabled by advanced pre-training, allow simple yet flexible architectures to outperform specialized designs. Therefore, in this work, we investigate an architecturally simple encoder-only approach using plain Video Vision Transformers (Video ViTs) and study how pre-training enables strong TAD performance. We find that: (i) advanced pre-training enables simple encoder-only models to match or even surpass the performance of specialized state-of-the-art TAD methods, while also being significantly more efficient; (ii) although weakly- and fully-supervised pre-training are advantageous on standard benchmarks, we find them less effective for TAD. Instead, self-supervised Masked Video Modeling (MVM) provides the strongest signal; and (iii) Domain-Adaptive Pre-Training (DAPT) on unlabeled driving videos further improves downstream performance, without requiring anomalous examples. Our findings highlight the importance of pre-training and show that effective, efficient, and scalable TAD models can be built with minimal architectural complexity. We release our code, domain-adapted encoders, and fine-tuned models to support future work: https://github.com/tue-mps/simple-tad.</description>

      <title>Memory-Efficient Personalization of Text-to-Image Diffusion Models via Selective Optimization Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10029v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Memory-efficient personalization is critical for adapting text-to-image diffusion models while preserving user privacy and operating within the limited computational resources of edge devices. To this end, we propose a selective optimization framework that adaptively chooses between backpropagation on low-resolution images (BP-low) and zeroth-order optimization on high-resolution images (ZO-high), guided by the characteristics of the diffusion process. As observed in our experiments, BP-low efficiently adapts the model to target-specific features, but suffers from structural distortions due to resolution mismatch. Conversely, ZO-high refines high-resolution details with minimal memory overhead but faces slow convergence when applied without prior adaptation. By complementing both methods, our framework leverages BP-low for effective personalization while using ZO-high to maintain structural consistency, achieving memory-efficient and high-quality fine-tuning. To maximize the efficacy of both BP-low and ZO-high, we introduce a timestep-aware probabilistic function that dynamically selects the appropriate optimization strategy based on diffusion timesteps. This function mitigates the overfitting from BP-low at high timesteps, where structural information is critical, while ensuring ZO-high is applied more effectively as training progresses. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance while significantly reducing memory consumption, enabling scalable, high-quality on-device personalization without increasing inference latency.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12964v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wrist pathologies are frequently observed, particularly among children who constitute the majority of fracture cases. Computer vision presents a promising avenue, contingent upon the availability of extensive datasets, a notable challenge in medical imaging. Therefore, reliance solely on one modality, such as images, proves inadequate, especially in an era of diverse and plentiful data types. This study addresses the problem using a multifaceted approach: framing it as a fine-grained recognition task, fusing patient metadata with X-rays, and leveraging weights from a separate fine-grained dataset rather than from a coarse-grained dataset like ImageNet. Unlike prior work, this is the first application of metadata integration for wrist pathology recognition. Our results show that combining fine-grained transformer approach, fine-grained pre-training, and metadata integration improves diagnostic accuracy by 2% on small custom curated dataset and over 10% on a larger fracture dataset.</description>

      <title>GPI-Net: Gestalt-Guided Parallel Interaction Network via Orthogonal Geometric Consistency for Robust Point Cloud Registration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14452v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The accurate identification of high-quality correspondences is a prerequisite task in feature-based point cloud registration. However, it is extremely challenging to handle the fusion of local and global features due to feature redundancy and complex spatial relationships. Given that Gestalt principles provide key advantages in analyzing local and global relationships, we propose a novel Gestalt-guided Parallel Interaction Network via orthogonal geometric consistency (GPI-Net) in this paper. It utilizes Gestalt principles to facilitate complementary communication between local and global information. Specifically, we introduce an orthogonal integration strategy to optimally reduce redundant information and generate a more compact global structure for high-quality correspondences. To capture geometric features in correspondences, we leverage a Gestalt Feature Attention (GFA) block through a hybrid utilization of self-attention and cross-attention mechanisms. Furthermore, to facilitate the integration of local detail information into the global structure, we design an innovative Dual-path Multi-Granularity parallel interaction aggregation (DMG) block to promote information exchange across different granularities. Extensive experiments on various challenging tasks demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed GPI-Net in comparison to existing methods. The code will be released at https://github.com/gwk429/GPI-Net.</description>

      <title>Part Segmentation of Human Meshes via Multi-View Human Parsing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18655v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in point cloud deep learning have led to models that achieve high per-part labeling accuracy on large-scale point clouds, using only the raw geometry of unordered point sets. In parallel, the field of human parsing focuses on predicting body part and clothing/accessory labels from images. This work aims to bridge these two domains by enabling per-vertex semantic segmentation of large-scale human meshes. To achieve this, a pseudo-ground truth labeling pipeline is developed for the Thuman2.1 dataset: meshes are first aligned to a canonical pose, segmented from multiple viewpoints, and the resulting point-level labels are then backprojected onto the original mesh to produce per-point pseudo ground truth annotations. Subsequently, a novel, memory-efficient sampling strategy is introduced, a windowed iterative farthest point sampling (FPS) with space-filling curve-based serialization to effectively downsample the point clouds. This is followed by a purely geometric segmentation using PointTransformer, enabling semantic parsing of human meshes without relying on texture information. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed approach.

      <title>Detecting Visual Information Manipulation Attacks in Augmented Reality: A Multimodal Semantic Reasoning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20356v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The virtual content in augmented reality (AR) can introduce misleading or harmful information, leading to semantic misunderstandings or user errors. In this work, we focus on visual information manipulation (VIM) attacks in AR, where virtual content changes the meaning of real-world scenes in subtle but impactful ways. We introduce a taxonomy that categorizes these attacks into three formats: character, phrase, and pattern manipulation, and three purposes: information replacement, information obfuscation, and extra wrong information. Based on the taxonomy, we construct a dataset, AR-VIM, which consists of 452 raw-AR video pairs spanning 202 different scenes, each simulating a real-world AR scenario. To detect the attacks in the dataset, we propose a multimodal semantic reasoning framework, VIM-Sense. It combines the language and visual understanding capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) with optical character recognition (OCR)-based textual analysis. VIM-Sense achieves an attack detection accuracy of 88.94% on AR-VIM, consistently outperforming vision-only and text-only baselines. The system achieves an average attack detection latency of 7.07 seconds in a simulated video processing framework and 7.17 seconds in a real-world evaluation conducted on a mobile Android AR application.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22369v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classroom behavior monitoring is a critical aspect of educational research, with significant implications for student engagement and learning outcomes. Recent advancements in Visual Question Answering (VQA) models offer promising tools for automatically analyzing complex classroom interactions from video recordings. In this paper, we investigate the applicability of several state-of-the-art open-source VQA models, including LLaMA2, LLaMA3, QWEN3, and NVILA, in the context of classroom behavior analysis. To facilitate rigorous evaluation, we introduce our BAV-Classroom-VQA dataset derived from real-world classroom video recordings at the Banking Academy of Vietnam. We present the methodology for data collection, annotation, and benchmark the performance of the selected VQA models on this dataset. Our initial experimental results demonstrate that all four models achieve promising performance levels in answering behavior-related visual questions, showcasing their potential in future classroom analytics and intervention systems.</description>

      <title>Exploiting Diffusion Prior for Task-driven Image Restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22459v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Task-driven image restoration (TDIR) has recently emerged to address performance drops in high-level vision tasks caused by low-quality (LQ) inputs. Previous TDIR methods struggle to handle practical scenarios in which images are degraded by multiple complex factors, leaving minimal clues for restoration. This motivates us to leverage the diffusion prior, one of the most powerful natural image priors. However, while the diffusion prior can help generate visually plausible results, using it to restore task-relevant details remains challenging, even when combined with recent TDIR methods. To address this, we propose EDTR, which effectively harnesses the power of diffusion prior to restore task-relevant details. Specifically, we propose directly leveraging useful clues from LQ images in the diffusion process by generating from pixel-error-based pre-restored LQ images with mild noise added. Moreover, we employ a small number of denoising steps to prevent the generation of redundant details that dilute crucial task-related information. We demonstrate that our method effectively utilizes diffusion prior for TDIR, significantly enhancing task performance and visual quality across diverse tasks with multiple complex degradations.</description>

      <title>Beyond Gloss: A Hand-Centric Framework for Gloss-Free Sign Language Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23575v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sign Language Translation (SLT) is a challenging task that requires bridging the modality gap between visual and linguistic information while capturing subtle variations in hand shapes and movements. To address these challenges, we introduce \textbf{BeyondGloss}, a novel gloss-free SLT framework that leverages the spatio-temporal reasoning capabilities of Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs). Since existing VideoLLMs struggle to model long videos in detail, we propose a novel approach to generate fine-grained, temporally-aware textual descriptions of hand motion. A contrastive alignment module aligns these descriptions with video features during pre-training, encouraging the model to focus on hand-centric temporal dynamics and distinguish signs more effectively. To further enrich hand-specific representations, we distill fine-grained features from HaMeR. Additionally, we apply a contrastive loss between sign video representations and target language embeddings to reduce the modality gap in pre-training. \textbf{BeyondGloss} achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Phoenix14T and CSL-Daily benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed framework. We will release the code upon acceptance of the paper.</description>

      <title>TNet: Terrace Convolutional Decoder Network for Remote Sensing Image Semantic Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04061v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In remote sensing, most segmentation networks adopt the UNet architecture, often incorporating modules such as Transformers or Mamba to enhance global-local feature interactions within decoder stages. However, these enhancements typically focus on intra-scale relationships and neglect the global contextual dependencies across multiple resolutions. To address this limitation, we introduce the Terrace Convolutional Decoder Network (TNet), a simple yet effective architecture that leverages only convolution and addition operations to progressively integrate low-resolution features (rich in global context) into higher-resolution features (rich in local details) across decoding stages. This progressive fusion enables the model to learn spatially-aware convolutional kernels that naturally blend global and local information in a stage-wise manner. We implement TNet with a ResNet-18 encoder (TNet-R) and evaluate it on three benchmark datasets. TNet-R achieves competitive performance with a mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU) of 85.35\% on ISPRS Vaihingen, 87.05\% on ISPRS Potsdam, and 52.19\% on LoveDA, while maintaining high computational efficiency. Code is publicly available.</description>

      <title>MSC: A Marine Wildlife Video Dataset with Grounded Segmentation and Clip-Level Captioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04549v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Marine videos present significant challenges for video understanding due to the dynamics of marine objects and the surrounding environment, camera motion, and the complexity of underwater scenes. Existing video captioning datasets, typically focused on generic or human-centric domains, often fail to generalize to the complexities of the marine environment and gain insights about marine life. To address these limitations, we propose a two-stage marine object-oriented video captioning pipeline. We introduce a comprehensive video understanding benchmark that leverages the triplets of video, text, and segmentation masks to facilitate visual grounding and captioning, leading to improved marine video understanding and analysis, and marine video generation. Additionally, we highlight the effectiveness of video splitting in order to detect salient object transitions in scene changes, which significantly enrich the semantics of captioning content. Our dataset and code have been released at https://msc.hkustvgd.com.</description>

      <title>CF3: Compact and Fast 3D Feature Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05254v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has begun incorporating rich information from 2D foundation models. However, most approaches rely on a bottom-up optimization process that treats raw 2D features as ground truth, incurring increased computational costs. We propose a top-down pipeline for constructing compact and fast 3D Gaussian feature fields, namely, CF3. We first perform a fast weighted fusion of multi-view 2D features with pre-trained Gaussians. This approach enables training a per-Gaussian autoencoder directly on the lifted features, instead of training autoencoders in the 2D domain. As a result, the autoencoder better aligns with the feature distribution. More importantly, we introduce an adaptive sparsification method that optimizes the Gaussian attributes of the feature field while pruning and merging the redundant Gaussians, constructing an efficient representation with preserved geometric details. Our approach achieves a competitive 3D feature field using as little as 5% of the Gaussians compared to Feature-3DGS.</description>

      <title>ACD-CLIP: Decoupling Representation and Dynamic Fusion for Zero-Shot Anomaly Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07819v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle with Zero-Shot Anomaly Detection (ZSAD) due to a critical adaptation gap: they lack the local inductive biases required for dense prediction and employ inflexible feature fusion paradigms. We address these limitations through an Architectural Co-Design framework that jointly refines feature representation and cross-modal fusion. Our method proposes a parameter-efficient Convolutional Low-Rank Adaptation (Conv-LoRA) adapter to inject local inductive biases for fine-grained representation, and introduces a Dynamic Fusion Gateway (DFG) that leverages visual context to adaptively modulate text prompts, enabling a powerful bidirectional fusion. Extensive experiments on diverse industrial and medical benchmarks demonstrate superior accuracy and robustness, validating that this synergistic co-design is critical for robustly adapting foundation models to dense perception tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09632v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper-to-video task converts a research paper into a structured video abstract, distilling key concepts, methods, and conclusions into an accessible, well-organized format. While state-of-the-art video generation models demonstrate potential, they are constrained by limited context windows, rigid video duration constraints, limited stylistic diversity, and an inability to represent domain-specific knowledge. To address these limitations, we introduce Preacher, the first paper-to-video agentic system. Preacher employs a topdown approach to decompose, summarize, and reformulate the paper, followed by bottom-up video generation, synthesizing diverse video segments into a coherent abstract. To align cross-modal representations, we define key scenes and introduce a Progressive Chain of Thought (P-CoT) for granular, iterative planning. Preacher successfully generates high-quality video abstracts across five research fields, demonstrating expertise beyond current video generation models.

      <description>arXiv:2508.09926v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cell detection, segmentation and classification are essential for analyzing tumor microenvironments (TME) on hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) slides. Existing methods suffer from poor performance on understudied cell types (rare or not present in public datasets) and limited cross-domain generalization. To address these shortcomings, we introduce HistoPLUS, a state-of-the-art model for cell analysis, trained on a novel curated pan-cancer dataset of 108,722 nuclei covering 13 cell types. In external validation across 4 independent cohorts, HistoPLUS outperforms current state-of-the-art models in detection quality by 5.2% and overall F1 classification score by 23.7%, while using 5x fewer parameters. Notably, HistoPLUS unlocks the study of 7 understudied cell types and brings significant improvements on 8 of 13 cell types. Moreover, we show that HistoPLUS robustly transfers to two oncology indications unseen during training. To support broader TME biomarker research, we release the model weights and inference code at https://github.com/owkin/histoplus/.</description>

      <title>SocialTrack: Multi-Object Tracking in Complex Urban Traffic Scenes Inspired by Social Behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12777v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As a key research direction in the field of multi-object tracking (MOT), UAV-based multi-object tracking has significant application value in the analysis and understanding of urban intelligent transportation systems. However, in complex UAV perspectives, challenges such as small target scale variations, occlusions, nonlinear crossing motions, and motion blur severely hinder the stability of multi-object tracking. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel multi-object tracking framework, SocialTrack, aimed at enhancing the tracking accuracy and robustness of small targets in complex urban traffic environments. The specialized small-target detector enhances the detection performance by employing a multi-scale feature enhancement mechanism. The Velocity Adaptive Cubature Kalman Filter (VACKF) improves the accuracy of trajectory prediction by incorporating a velocity dynamic modeling mechanism. The Group Motion Compensation Strategy (GMCS) models social group motion priors to provide stable state update references for low-quality tracks, significantly improving the target association accuracy in complex dynamic environments. Furthermore, the Spatio-Temporal Memory Prediction (STMP) leverages historical trajectory information to predict the future state of low-quality tracks, effectively mitigating identity switching issues. Extensive experiments on the UAVDT and MOT17 datasets demonstrate that SocialTrack outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods across several key metrics. Significant improvements in MOTA and IDF1, among other core performance indicators, highlight its superior robustness and adaptability. Additionally, SocialTrack is highly modular and compatible, allowing for seamless integration with existing trackers to further enhance performance.</description>

      <title>FLAIR: Frequency- and Locality-Aware Implicit Neural Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13544v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) leverage neural networks to map coordinates to corresponding signals, enabling continuous and compact representations. This paradigm has driven significant advances in various vision tasks. However, existing INRs lack frequency selectivity, spatial localization, and sparse representations, leading to an over-reliance on redundant signal components. Consequently, they exhibit spectral bias, tending to learn low-frequency components early while struggling to capture fine high-frequency details. To address these issues, we propose FLAIR (Frequency- and Locality-Aware Implicit Neural Representations), which incorporates two key innovations. The first is RC-GAUSS, a novel activation designed for explicit frequency selection and spatial localization under the constraints of the time-frequency uncertainty principle (TFUP). The second is Wavelet-Energy-Guided Encoding (WEGE), which leverages the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) to compute energy scores and explicitly guide frequency information to the network. Our method consistently outperforms existing INRs in 2D image representation and restoration, as well as 3D reconstruction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13602v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the growing demand for short videos and personalized content, automated Video Log (Vlog) generation has become a key direction in multimodal content creation. Existing methods mostly rely on predefined scripts, lacking dynamism and personal expression. Therefore, there is an urgent need for an automated Vlog generation approach that enables effective multimodal collaboration and high personalization. To this end, we propose PersonaVlog, an automated multimodal stylized Vlog generation framework that can produce personalized Vlogs featuring videos, background music, and inner monologue speech based on a given theme and reference image. Specifically, we propose a multi-agent collaboration framework based on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). This framework efficiently generates high-quality prompts for multimodal content creation based on user input, thereby improving the efficiency and creativity of the process. In addition, we incorporate a feedback and rollback mechanism that leverages MLLMs to evaluate and provide feedback on generated results, thereby enabling iterative self-correction of multimodal content. We also propose ThemeVlogEval, a theme-based automated benchmarking framework that provides standardized metrics and datasets for fair evaluation. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the significant advantages and potential of our framework over several baselines, highlighting its effectiveness and great potential for generating automated Vlogs.</description>

      <title>TPA: Temporal Prompt Alignment for Fetal Congenital Heart Defect Classification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15298v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Congenital heart defect (CHD) detection in ultrasound videos is hindered by image noise and probe positioning variability. While automated methods can reduce operator dependence, current machine learning approaches often neglect temporal information, limit themselves to binary classification, and do not account for prediction calibration. We propose Temporal Prompt Alignment (TPA), a method leveraging foundation image-text model and prompt-aware contrastive learning to classify fetal CHD on cardiac ultrasound videos. TPA extracts features from each frame of video subclips using an image encoder, aggregates them with a trainable temporal extractor to capture heart motion, and aligns the video representation with class-specific text prompts via a margin-hinge contrastive loss. To enhance calibration for clinical reliability, we introduce a Conditional Variational Autoencoder Style Modulation (CVAESM) module, which learns a latent style vector to modulate embeddings and quantifies classification uncertainty. Evaluated on a private dataset for CHD detection and on a large public dataset, EchoNet-Dynamic, for systolic dysfunction, TPA achieves state-of-the-art macro F1 scores of 85.40% for CHD diagnosis, while also reducing expected calibration error by 5.38% and adaptive ECE by 6.8%. On EchoNet-Dynamic's three-class task, it boosts macro F1 by 4.73% (from 53.89% to 58.62%). Temporal Prompt Alignment (TPA) is a framework for fetal congenital heart defect (CHD) classification in ultrasound videos that integrates temporal modeling, prompt-aware contrastive learning, and uncertainty quantification.</description>

      <title>DIO: Refining Mutual Information and Causal Chain to Enhance Machine Abstract Reasoning Ability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15387v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite the outstanding performance of current deep learning models across various domains, their fundamental bottleneck in abstract reasoning remains unresolved. To address this challenge, the academic community has introduced Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPM) problems as an authoritative benchmark for evaluating the abstract reasoning capabilities of deep learning algorithms, with a focus on core intelligence dimensions such as abstract reasoning, pattern recognition, and complex problem-solving. Therefore, this paper centers on solving RPM problems, aiming to contribute to enhancing the abstract reasoning abilities of machine intelligence. Firstly, this paper adopts a ``causal chain modeling'' perspective to systematically analyze the complete causal chain in RPM tasks: image $\rightarrow$ abstract attributes $\rightarrow$ progressive attribute patterns $\rightarrow$ pattern consistency $\rightarrow$ correct answer. Based on this analysis, the network architecture of the baseline model DIO is designed. However, experiments reveal that the optimization objective formulated for DIO, namely maximizing the variational lower bound of mutual information between the context and the correct option, fails to enable the model to genuinely acquire the predefined human reasoning logic. This is attributed to two main reasons: the tightness of the lower bound significantly impacts the effectiveness of mutual information maximization, and mutual information, as a statistical measure, does not capture the causal relationship between subjects and objects. To overcome these limitations, this paper progressively proposes three improvement methods:</description>

      <title>Aligning Moments in Time using Video Queries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15439v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Video-to-video moment retrieval (Vid2VidMR) is the task of localizing unseen events or moments in a target video using a query video. This task poses several challenges, such as the need for semantic frame-level alignment and modeling complex dependencies between query and target videos. To tackle this challenging problem, we introduce MATR (Moment Alignment TRansformer), a transformer-based model designed to capture semantic context as well as the temporal details necessary for precise moment localization. MATR conditions target video representations on query video features using dual-stage sequence alignment that encodes the required correlations and dependencies. These representations are then used to guide foreground/background classification and boundary prediction heads, enabling the model to accurately identify moments in the target video that semantically match with the query video. Additionally, to provide a strong task-specific initialization for MATR, we propose a self-supervised pre-training technique that involves training the model to localize random clips within videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MATR achieves notable performance improvements of 13.1% in R@1 and 8.1% in mIoU on an absolute scale compared to state-of-the-art methods on the popular ActivityNet-VRL dataset. Additionally, on our newly proposed dataset, SportsMoments, MATR shows a 14.7% gain in R@1 and a 14.4% gain in mIoU on an absolute scale over strong baselines.</description>

      <title>Structuring GUI Elements through Vision Language Models: Towards Action Space Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16271v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have emerged as pivotal tools in enhancing human-computer interaction. In this paper we focus on the application of MLLMs in the field of graphical user interface (GUI) elements structuring, where they assist in processing user instructions based on screen contents. Despite the promise of MLLMs, their performance in precisely generating UI element coordinates, a critical aspect of GUI understanding, is hindered by the nature of next-token prediction training. This challenge arises from the semantic void surrounding numerical UI coordinates in language representation spaces, necessitating a substantial and diverse dataset to bolster visual module capabilities. To address these limitations, we introduce an IoU-Augmented Maximum Likelihood (IAML) training paradigm. Specifically, our approach involves a novel pipeline for IoU-based coordinate sampling to augment the training data, which considers the proximity to ground truth coordinates. This data augmentation strategy is then employed to fine-tune MLLMs under the IAML paradigm, which is designed to mitigate the exposure bias problem inherent in traditional maximum likelihood estimation. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the superior performance of our IAML training approach over traditional training paradigms.</description>

      <title>MSNav: Zero-Shot Vision-and-Language Navigation with Dynamic Memory and LLM Spatial Reasoning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16654v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) requires an agent to interpret natural language instructions and navigate complex environments. Current approaches often adopt a "black-box" paradigm, where a single Large Language Model (LLM) makes end-to-end decisions. However, it is plagued by critical vulnerabilities, including poor spatial reasoning, weak cross-modal grounding, and memory overload in long-horizon tasks. To systematically address these issues, we propose Memory Spatial Navigation(MSNav), a framework that fuses three modules into a synergistic architecture, which transforms fragile inference into a robust, integrated intelligence. MSNav integrates three modules: Memory Module, a dynamic map memory module that tackles memory overload through selective node pruning, enhancing long-range exploration; Spatial Module, a module for spatial reasoning and object relationship inference that improves endpoint recognition; and Decision Module, a module using LLM-based path planning to execute robust actions. Powering Spatial Module, we also introduce an Instruction-Object-Space (I-O-S) dataset and fine-tune the Qwen3-4B model into Qwen-Spatial (Qwen-Sp), which outperforms leading commercial LLMs in object list extraction, achieving higher F1 and NDCG scores on the I-O-S test set. Extensive experiments on the Room-to-Room (R2R) and REVERIE datasets demonstrate MSNav's state-of-the-art performance with significant improvements in Success Rate (SR) and Success weighted by Path Length (SPL).</description>

      <title>Contrastive Prompt Clustering for Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17009v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) with image-level labels has gained attention for its cost-effectiveness. Most existing methods emphasize inter-class separation, often neglecting the shared semantics among related categories and lacking fine-grained discrimination. To address this, we propose Contrastive Prompt Clustering (CPC), a novel WSSS framework. CPC exploits Large Language Models (LLMs) to derive category clusters that encode intrinsic inter-class relationships, and further introduces a class-aware patch-level contrastive loss to enforce intra-class consistency and inter-class separation. This hierarchical design leverages clusters as coarse-grained semantic priors while preserving fine-grained boundaries, thereby reducing confusion among visually similar categories. Experiments on PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO 2014 demonstrate that CPC surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods in WSSS.</description>

      <title>CoViPAL: Layer-wise Contextualized Visual Token Pruning for Large Vision-Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17243v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) process multimodal inputs consisting of text tokens and vision tokens extracted from images or videos. Due to the rich visual information, a single image can generate thousands of vision tokens, leading to high computational costs during the prefilling stage and significant memory overhead during decoding. Existing methods attempt to prune redundant vision tokens, revealing substantial redundancy in visual representations. However, these methods often struggle in shallow layers due to the lack of sufficient contextual information. We argue that many visual tokens are inherently redundant even in shallow layers and can be safely and effectively pruned with appropriate contextual signals. In this work, we propose CoViPAL, a layer-wise contextualized visual token pruning method that employs a Plug-and-Play Pruning Module (PPM) to predict and remove redundant vision tokens before they are processed by the LVLM. The PPM is lightweight, model-agnostic, and operates independently of the LVLM architecture, ensuring seamless integration with various models. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that CoViPAL outperforms training-free pruning methods under equal token budgets and surpasses training-based methods with comparable supervision. CoViPAL offers a scalable and efficient solution to improve inference efficiency in LVLMs without compromising accuracy.</description>

      <title>Lightweight Joint Optimization of General-Purpose Vision-Language Models and Retrievers for Medical Diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17394v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Clinical decision-making often involves interpreting images (e.g., radiology) for making diagnoses. Retrieving relevant visual information from medical literature and hospital records could enhance diagnostic accuracy. In this paper, we develop a model in which a multimodal retriever is jointly optimized with an LVLM for medical diagnosis, unlike standard RAG where LVLM error signal is not propagated down to the retriever. We show that using only general-purpose backbones, with only lightweight fine-tuning, our model is able to achieve competitive results with medically-pretrained models across clinical multi-label classification and visual question answering tasks. In a novel analysis, we additionally find that in many cases different top retrieved images each lead to different predictions for a given target, and that these cases are empirically challenging for all models, even for non-retrieval models. Our joint retrieval optimization significantly improves these challenging cases over standard RAG. However, oracle analysis reveals that while the correct diagnosis is frequently achievable using one of the top retrieved images, in practice there is a large performance gap from the oracle, and rerankers using frontier LVLMs do not close this gap -- leaving ample room for improvement by future methods. Code will be made publicly available.</description>

      <title>Investigating Domain Gaps for Indoor 3D Object Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17439v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As a fundamental task for indoor scene understanding, 3D object detection has been extensively studied, and the accuracy on indoor point cloud data has been substantially improved. However, existing researches have been conducted on limited datasets, where the training and testing sets share the same distribution. In this paper, we consider the task of adapting indoor 3D object detectors from one dataset to another, presenting a comprehensive benchmark with ScanNet, SUN RGB-D and 3D Front datasets, as well as our newly proposed large-scale datasets ProcTHOR-OD and ProcFront generated by a 3D simulator. Since indoor point cloud datasets are collected and constructed in different ways, the object detectors are likely to overfit to specific factors within each dataset, such as point cloud quality, bounding box layout and instance features. We conduct experiments across datasets on different adaptation scenarios including synthetic-to-real adaptation, point cloud quality adaptation, layout adaptation and instance feature adaptation, analyzing the impact of different domain gaps on 3D object detectors. We also introduce several approaches to improve adaptation performances, providing baselines for domain adaptive indoor 3D object detection, hoping that future works may propose detectors with stronger generalization ability across domains.

      <title>EventTracer: Fast Path Tracing-based Event Stream Rendering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18071v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Simulating event streams from 3D scenes has become a common practice in event-based vision research, as it meets the demand for large-scale, high temporal frequency data without setting up expensive hardware devices or undertaking extensive data collections. Yet existing methods in this direction typically work with noiseless RGB frames that are costly to render, and therefore they can only achieve a temporal resolution equivalent to 100-300 FPS, far lower than that of real-world event data. In this work, we propose EventTracer, a path tracing-based rendering pipeline that simulates high-fidelity event sequences from complex 3D scenes in an efficient and physics-aware manner. Specifically, we speed up the rendering process via low sample-per-pixel (SPP) path tracing, and train a lightweight event spiking network to denoise the resulting RGB videos into realistic event sequences. To capture the physical properties of event streams, the network is equipped with a bipolar leaky integrate-and-fired (BiLIF) spiking unit and trained with a bidirectional earth mover distance (EMD) loss. Our EventTracer pipeline runs at a speed of about 4 minutes per second of 720p video, and it inherits the merit of accurate spatiotemporal modeling from its path tracing backbone. We show in two downstream tasks that EventTracer captures better scene details and demonstrates a greater similarity to real-world event data than other event simulators, which establishes it as a promising tool for creating large-scale event-RGB datasets at a low cost, narrowing the sim-to-real gap in event-based vision, and boosting various application scenarios such as robotics, autonomous driving, and VRAR.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18695v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) plays a pivotal role in various applications, including smart surveillance, healthcare, assistive technologies, sports analytics, etc. However, HAR systems still face critical challenges, including high computational costs, redundant features, and limited scalability in real-time scenarios. An optimized hybrid deep learning framework is introduced that integrates a customized InceptionV3, an LSTM architecture, and a novel ensemble-based feature selection strategy. The proposed framework first extracts spatial descriptors using the customized InceptionV3 model, which captures multilevel contextual patterns, region homogeneity, and fine-grained localization cues. The temporal dependencies across frames are then modeled using LSTMs to effectively encode motion dynamics. Finally, an ensemble-based genetic algorithm with Adaptive Dynamic Fitness Sharing and Attention (ADFSA) is employed to select a compact and optimized feature set by dynamically balancing objectives such as accuracy, redundancy, uniqueness, and complexity reduction. Consequently, the selected feature subsets, which are both diverse and discriminative, enable various lightweight machine learning classifiers to achieve accurate and robust HAR in heterogeneous environments. Experimental results on the robust UCF-YouTube dataset, which presents challenges such as occlusion, cluttered backgrounds, motion dynamics, and poor illumination, demonstrate good performance. The proposed approach achieves 99.65% recognition accuracy, reduces features to as few as 7, and enhances inference time. The lightweight and scalable nature of the HAR system supports real-time deployment on edge devices such as Raspberry Pi, enabling practical applications in intelligent, resource-aware environments, including public safety, assistive technology, and autonomous monitoring systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18733v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) generative modeling is driving significant innovations across industrial applications. Recent works have shown remarkable progress in creating solid models from various inputs such as point clouds, meshes, and text descriptions. However, these methods fundamentally diverge from traditional industrial workflows that begin with 2D engineering drawings. The automatic generation of parametric CAD models from these 2D vector drawings remains underexplored despite being a critical step in engineering design. To address this gap, our key insight is to reframe CAD generation as a sequence-to-sequence learning problem where vector drawing primitives directly inform the generation of parametric CAD operations, preserving geometric precision and design intent throughout the transformation process. We propose Drawing2CAD, a framework with three key technical components: a network-friendly vector primitive representation that preserves precise geometric information, a dual-decoder transformer architecture that decouples command type and parameter generation while maintaining precise correspondence, and a soft target distribution loss function accommodating inherent flexibility in CAD parameters. To train and evaluate Drawing2CAD, we create CAD-VGDrawing, a dataset of paired engineering drawings and parametric CAD models, and conduct thorough experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/lllssc/Drawing2CAD.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19944v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding and reasoning over text within visual contexts poses a significant challenge for Vision-Language Models (VLMs), given the complexity and diversity of real-world scenarios. To address this challenge, text-rich Visual Question Answering (VQA) datasets and benchmarks have emerged for high-resource languages like English. However, a critical gap persists for low-resource languages such as Korean, where the lack of comprehensive benchmarks hinders robust model evaluation and comparison. To bridge this gap, we introduce KRETA, a benchmark for Korean Reading and rEasoning in Text-rich VQA Attuned to diverse visual contexts. KRETA facilitates an in-depth evaluation of both visual text understanding and reasoning capabilities, while also supporting a multifaceted assessment across 15 domains and 26 image types. Additionally, we introduce a semi-automated VQA generation pipeline specifically optimized for text-rich settings, leveraging refined stepwise image decomposition and a rigorous seven-metric evaluation protocol to ensure data quality. While KRETA is tailored for Korean, we hope our adaptable and extensible pipeline will facilitate the development of similar benchmarks in other languages, thereby accelerating multilingual VLM research. The code and dataset for KRETA are available at https://github.com/tabtoyou/KRETA.</description>

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP enable zero-shot classification by aligning images and text in a shared embedding space, offering advantages for defense applications with scarce labeled data. However, CLIP's robustness in challenging military environments, with partial occlusion and degraded signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), remains underexplored. We investigate CLIP variants' robustness to occlusion using a custom dataset of 18 military vehicle classes and evaluate using Normalized Area Under the Curve (NAUC) across occlusion percentages. Four key insights emerge: (1) Transformer-based CLIP models consistently outperform CNNs, (2) fine-grained, dispersed occlusions degrade performance more than larger contiguous occlusions, (3) despite improved accuracy, performance of linear-probed models sharply drops at around 35% occlusion, (4) by finetuning the model's backbone, this performance drop occurs at more than 60% occlusion. These results underscore the importance of occlusion-specific augmentations during training and the need for further exploration into patch-level sensitivity and architectural resilience for real-world deployment of CLIP.</description>

      <title>FusionCounting: Robust visible-infrared image fusion guided by crowd counting via multi-task learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20817v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Visible and infrared image fusion (VIF) is an important multimedia task in computer vision. Most VIF methods focus primarily on optimizing fused image quality. Recent studies have begun incorporating downstream tasks, such as semantic segmentation and object detection, to provide semantic guidance for VIF. However, semantic segmentation requires extensive annotations, while object detection, despite reducing annotation efforts compared with segmentation, faces challenges in highly crowded scenes due to overlapping bounding boxes and occlusion. Moreover, although RGB-T crowd counting has gained increasing attention in recent years, no studies have integrated VIF and crowd counting into a unified framework. To address these challenges, we propose FusionCounting, a novel multi-task learning framework that integrates crowd counting into the VIF process. Crowd counting provides a direct quantitative measure of population density with minimal annotation, making it particularly suitable for dense scenes. Our framework leverages both input images and population density information in a mutually beneficial multi-task design. To accelerate convergence and balance tasks contributions, we introduce a dynamic loss function weighting strategy. Furthermore, we incorporate adversarial training to enhance the robustness of both VIF and crowd counting, improving the model's stability and resilience to adversarial attacks. Experimental results on public datasets demonstrate that FusionCounting not only enhances image fusion quality but also achieves superior crowd counting performance.</description>

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) equipped with step-by-step thinking capabilities have demonstrated remarkable performance on complex reasoning problems. However, this thinking process is redundant for simple problems solvable without complex reasoning. To address this inefficiency, we propose R-4B, an auto-thinking MLLM, which can adaptively decide when to think based on problem complexity. The central idea of R-4B is to empower the model with both thinking and non-thinking capabilities using bi-mode annealing, and apply Bi-mode Policy Optimization (BPO) to improve the model's accuracy in determining whether to activate the thinking process. Specifically, we first train the model on a carefully curated dataset spanning various topics, which contains samples from both thinking and non-thinking modes. Then it undergoes a second phase of training under an improved GRPO framework, where the policy model is forced to generate responses from both modes for each input query. Experimental results show that R-4B achieves state-of-the-art performance across 25 challenging benchmarks. It outperforms Qwen2.5-VL-7B in most tasks and achieves performance comparable to larger models such as Kimi-VL-A3B-Thinking-2506 (16B) on reasoning-intensive benchmarks with lower computational cost.</description>

      <title>ELV-Halluc: Benchmarking Semantic Aggregation Hallucinations in Long Video Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21496v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Video multimodal large language models (Video-MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in video understanding. However, they remain vulnerable to hallucination-producing content inconsistent with or unrelated to video inputs. Previous video hallucination benchmarks primarily focus on short-videos. They attribute hallucinations to factors such as strong language priors, missing frames, or vision-language biases introduced by the visual encoder. While these causes indeed account for most hallucinations in short videos, they still oversimplify the cause of hallucinations. Sometimes, models generate incorrect outputs but with correct frame-level semantics. We refer to this type of hallucination as Semantic Aggregation Hallucination (SAH), which arises during the process of aggregating frame-level semantics into event-level semantic groups. Given that SAH becomes particularly critical in long videos due to increased semantic complexity across multiple events, it is essential to separate and thoroughly investigate the causes of this type of hallucination. To address the above issues, we introduce ELV-Halluc, the first benchmark dedicated to long-video hallucination, enabling a systematic investigation of SAH. Our experiments confirm the existence of SAH and show that it increases with semantic complexity. Additionally, we find that models are more prone to SAH on rapidly changing semantics. Moreover, we discuss potential approaches to mitigate SAH. We demonstrate that positional encoding strategy contributes to alleviating SAH, and further adopt DPO strategy to enhance the model's ability to distinguish semantics within and across events. To support this, we curate a dataset of 8K adversarial data pairs and achieve improvements on both ELV-Halluc and Video-MME, including a substantial 27.7% reduction in SAH ratio.</description>

      <title>XVertNet: Unsupervised Contrast Enhancement of Vertebral Structures with Dynamic Self-Tuning Guidance and Multi-Stage Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.03983v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chest X-rays remain the primary diagnostic tool in emergency medicine, yet their limited ability to capture fine anatomical details can result in missed or delayed diagnoses. To address this, we introduce XVertNet, a novel deep-learning framework designed to enhance vertebral structure visualization in X-ray images significantly. Our framework introduces two key innovations: (1) An unsupervised learning architecture that eliminates reliance on manually labeled training data a persistent bottleneck in medical imaging, and (2) a dynamic self-tuned internal guidance mechanism featuring an adaptive feedback loop for real-time image optimization. Extensive validation across four major public datasets revealed that XVertNet outperforms state-of-the-art enhancement methods, as demonstrated by improvements in entropy scores, Tenengrad criterion values, the local phase coherence sharpness index (LPC-SI), and thetone mapped image quality index (TMQI). Furthermore, clinical validation conducted with two board-certified radiologists confirmed that the enhanced images enabled more sensitive detection of subtle vertebral fractures and degenerative changes. The unsupervised nature of XVertNet facilitates immediate clinical deployment without requiring additional training overhead. This innovation represents a transformative advancement in emergency radiology, providing a scalable and time-efficient solution to enhance diagnostic accuracy in high-pressure clinical environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.11091v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quadratic complexity of dot-product attention introduced in Transformer remains a fundamental bottleneck impeding the progress of foundation models toward unbounded context lengths. Addressing this challenge, we introduce the Deep Tensor Network, a new architectural framework that fundamentally reformulates attention by unifying the expressive power of tensor algebra with neural network design. Our approach moves beyond both conventional dot-product attention and subsequent linear-time approximations to capture higher-order statistical dependencies. We introduce two core operators derived from this framework: \emph{Tensor Attention}, which models complex token-mixing via data-dependent polynomial kernels, and Tensor Interaction, a novel mechanism for adaptive channel-mixing. We demonstrate that these operators are powered by second-order summaries that entirely bypass the formation of $n \times n$ matrices, enabling a causality-preserving streaming implementation with $O(d^2)$ per-token updates and $O(d^2)$ state. This efficiency rivals that of modern State Space Models while retaining an attention-like formulation. The Deep Tensor Network thus provides a principled and powerful new class of building blocks for next-generation sequence models, bridging the gap between scalable computation and rich, expressive interaction modeling.</description>

      <title>Redesigning Traffic Signs to Mitigate Machine-Learning Patch Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04660v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traffic-Sign Recognition (TSR) is a critical safety component for autonomous driving. Unfortunately, however, past work has highlighted the vulnerability of TSR models to physical-world attacks, through low-cost, easily deployable adversarial patches leading to misclassification. To mitigate these threats, most defenses focus on altering the training process or modifying the inference procedure. Still, while these approaches improve adversarial robustness, TSR remains susceptible to attacks attaining substantial success rates.
  To further the adversarial robustness of TSR, this work offers a novel approach that redefines traffic-sign designs to create signs that promote robustness while remaining interpretable to humans. Our framework takes three inputs: (1) A traffic-sign standard along with modifiable features and associated constraints; (2) A state-of-the-art adversarial training method; and (3) A function for efficiently synthesizing realistic traffic-sign images. Using these user-defined inputs, the framework emits an optimized traffic-sign standard such that traffic signs generated per this standard enable training TSR models with increased adversarial robustness.
  We evaluate the effectiveness of our framework via a concrete implementation, where we allow modifying the pictograms (i.e., symbols) and colors of traffic signs. The results show substantial improvements in robustness -- with gains of up to 16.33%--24.58% in robust accuracy over state-of-the-art methods -- while benign accuracy is even improved. Importantly, a user study also confirms that the redesigned traffic signs remain easily recognizable and to human observers. Overall, the results highlight that carefully redesigning traffic signs can significantly enhance TSR system robustness without compromising human interpretability.</description>

      <title>A Survey on Vision-Language-Action Models for Embodied AI</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14093v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Embodied AI is widely recognized as a key element of artificial general intelligence because it involves controlling embodied agents to perform tasks in the physical world. Building on the success of large language models and vision-language models, a new category of multimodal models -- referred to as vision-language-action models (VLAs) -- has emerged to address language-conditioned robotic tasks in embodied AI by leveraging their distinct ability to generate actions. In recent years, a myriad of VLAs have been developed, making it imperative to capture the rapidly evolving landscape through a comprehensive survey. To this end, we present the first survey on VLAs for embodied AI. This work provides a detailed taxonomy of VLAs, organized into three major lines of research. The first line focuses on individual components of VLAs. The second line is dedicated to developing control policies adept at predicting low-level actions. The third line comprises high-level task planners capable of decomposing long-horizon tasks into a sequence of subtasks, thereby guiding VLAs to follow more general user instructions. Furthermore, we provide an extensive summary of relevant resources, including datasets, simulators, and benchmarks. Finally, we discuss the challenges faced by VLAs and outline promising future directions in embodied AI. We have created a project associated with this survey, which is available at https://github.com/yueen-ma/Awesome-VLA.</description>

      <title>Advancing Grounded Multimodal Named Entity Recognition via LLM-Based Reformulation and Box-Based Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07268v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Grounded Multimodal Named Entity Recognition (GMNER) task aims to identify named entities, entity types and their corresponding visual regions. GMNER task exhibits two challenging attributes: 1) The tenuous correlation between images and text on social media contributes to a notable proportion of named entities being ungroundable. 2) There exists a distinction between coarse-grained noun phrases used in similar tasks (e.g., phrase localization) and fine-grained named entities. In this paper, we propose RiVEG, a unified framework that reformulates GMNER into a joint MNER-VE-VG task by leveraging large language models (LLMs) as connecting bridges. This reformulation brings two benefits: 1) It enables us to optimize the MNER module for optimal MNER performance and eliminates the need to pre-extract region features using object detection methods, thus naturally addressing the two major limitations of existing GMNER methods. 2) The introduction of Entity Expansion Expression module and Visual Entailment (VE) module unifies Visual Grounding (VG) and Entity Grounding (EG). This endows the proposed framework with unlimited data and model scalability. Furthermore, to address the potential ambiguity stemming from the coarse-grained bounding box output in GMNER, we further construct the new Segmented Multimodal Named Entity Recognition (SMNER) task and corresponding Twitter-SMNER dataset aimed at generating fine-grained segmentation masks, and experimentally demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of using box prompt-based Segment Anything Model (SAM) to empower any GMNER model with the ability to accomplish the SMNER task. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RiVEG significantly outperforms SoTA methods on four datasets across the MNER, GMNER, and SMNER tasks.</description>

      <title>FlairGPT: Repurposing LLMs for Interior Designs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04648v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interior design involves the careful selection and arrangement of objects to create an aesthetically pleasing, functional, and harmonized space that aligns with the client's design brief. This task is particularly challenging, as a successful design must not only incorporate all the necessary objects in a cohesive style, but also ensure they are arranged in a way that maximizes accessibility, while adhering to a variety of affordability and usage considerations. Data-driven solutions have been proposed, but these are typically room- or domain-specific and lack explainability in their design design considerations used in producing the final layout. In this paper, we investigate if large language models (LLMs) can be directly utilized for interior design. While we find that LLMs are not yet capable of generating complete layouts, they can be effectively leveraged in a structured manner, inspired by the workflow of interior designers. By systematically probing LLMs, we can reliably generate a list of objects along with relevant constraints that guide their placement. We translate this information into a design layout graph, which is then solved using an off-the-shelf constrained optimization setup to generate the final layouts. We benchmark our algorithm in various design configurations against existing LLM-based methods and human designs, and evaluate the results using a variety of quantitative and qualitative metrics along with user studies. In summary, we demonstrate that LLMs, when used in a structured manner, can effectively generate diverse high-quality layouts, making them a viable solution for creating large-scale virtual scenes.

      <title>Universal Vessel Segmentation for Multi-Modality Retinal Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06987v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We identify two major limitations in the existing studies on retinal vessel segmentation: (1) Most existing works are restricted to one modality, i.e, the Color Fundus (CF). However, multi-modality retinal images are used every day in the study of retina and diagnosis of retinal diseases, and the study of vessel segmentation on the other modalities is scarce; (2) Even though a few works extended their experiments to limited new modalities such as the Multi-Color Scanning Laser Ophthalmoscopy (MC), these works still require finetuning a separate model for the new modality. The finetuning will require extra training data, which is difficult to acquire. In this work, we present a novel universal vessel segmentation model (UVSM) for multi-modality retinal images. Not only do we perform the study on a much wider range of modalities, but we also propose a universal model to segment the vessels in all these commonly-used modalities. Despite being much more versatile comparing with existing methods, our universal model still demonstrates comparable performance with the state-of-the-art finetuned methods. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that achieves modality-agnostic retinal vessel segmentation and also the first work that studies retinal vessel segmentation in some novel modalities.</description>

      <title>Harnessing Vision Models for Time Series Analysis: A Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08869v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time series analysis has witnessed the inspiring development from traditional autoregressive models, deep learning models, to recent Transformers and Large Language Models (LLMs). Efforts in leveraging vision models for time series analysis have also been made along the way but are less visible to the community due to the predominant research on sequence modeling in this domain. However, the discrepancy between continuous time series and the discrete token space of LLMs, and the challenges in explicitly modeling the correlations of variates in multivariate time series have shifted some research attentions to the equally successful Large Vision Models (LVMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs). To fill the blank in the existing literature, this survey discusses the advantages of vision models over LLMs in time series analysis. It provides a comprehensive and in-depth overview of the existing methods, with dual views of detailed taxonomy that answer the key research questions including how to encode time series as images and how to model the imaged time series for various tasks. Additionally, we address the challenges in the pre- and post-processing steps involved in this framework and outline future directions to further advance time series analysis with vision models.</description>

      <title>Shortcut Learning Susceptibility in Vision Classifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09150v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Shortcut learning, where machine learning models exploit spurious correlations in data instead of capturing meaningful features, poses a significant challenge to building robust and generalizable models. This phenomenon is prevalent across various machine learning applications, including vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition, where models may find unintended cues that minimize training loss but fail to capture the underlying structure of the data. Vision classifiers based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), and Vision Transformers (ViTs) leverage distinct architectural principles to process spatial and structural information, making them differently susceptible to shortcut learning. In this study, we systematically evaluate these architectures by introducing deliberate shortcuts into the dataset that are correlated with class labels both positionally and via intensity, creating a controlled setup to assess whether models rely on these artificial cues or learn actual distinguishing features. We perform both quantitative evaluation by training on the shortcut-modified dataset and testing on two different test sets-one containing the same shortcuts and another without them-to determine the extent of reliance on shortcuts. Additionally, qualitative evaluation is performed using network inversion-based reconstruction techniques to analyze what the models internalize in their weights, aiming to reconstruct the training data as perceived by the classifiers. Further, we evaluate susceptibility to shortcut learning across different learning rates. Our analysis reveals that CNNs at lower learning rates tend to be more reserved against entirely picking up shortcut features, while ViTs, particularly those without positional encodings, almost entirely ignore the distinctive image features in the presence of shortcuts.</description>

      <title>Sim-to-Real Reinforcement Learning for Vision-Based Dexterous Manipulation on Humanoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20396v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning generalizable robot manipulation policies, especially for complex multi-fingered humanoids, remains a significant challenge. Existing approaches primarily rely on extensive data collection and imitation learning, which are expensive, labor-intensive, and difficult to scale. Sim-to-real reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising alternative, but has mostly succeeded in simpler state-based or single-hand setups. How to effectively extend this to vision-based, contact-rich bimanual manipulation tasks remains an open question. In this paper, we introduce a practical sim-to-real RL recipe that trains a humanoid robot to perform three challenging dexterous manipulation tasks: grasp-and-reach, box lift and bimanual handover. Our method features an automated real-to-sim tuning module, a generalized reward formulation based on contact and object goals, a divide-and-conquer policy distillation framework, and a hybrid object representation strategy with modality-specific augmentation. We demonstrate high success rates on unseen objects and robust, adaptive policy behaviors -- highlighting that vision-based dexterous manipulation via sim-to-real RL is not only viable, but also scalable and broadly applicable to real-world humanoid manipulation tasks.</description>

      <title>Bridging Synthetic-to-Real Gaps: Frequency-Aware Perturbation and Selection for Single-shot Multi-Parametric Mapping Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03475v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data-centric artificial intelligence (AI) has remarkably advanced medical imaging, with emerging methods using synthetic data to address data scarcity while introducing synthetic-to-real gaps. Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) shows promise in ground truth-scarce tasks, but its application in reconstruction remains underexplored. Although multiple overlapping-echo detachment (MOLED) achieves ultra-fast multi-parametric reconstruction, extending its application to various clinical scenarios, the quality suffers from deficiency in mitigating the domain gap, difficulty in maintaining structural integrity, and inadequacy in ensuring mapping accuracy. To resolve these issues, we proposed frequency-aware perturbation and selection (FPS), comprising Wasserstein distance-modulated frequency-aware perturbation (WDFP) and hierarchical frequency-aware selection network (HFSNet), which integrates frequency-aware adaptive selection (FAS), compact FAS (cFAS) and feature-aware architecture integration (FAI). Specifically, perturbation activates domain-invariant feature learning within uncertainty, while selection refines optimal solutions within perturbation, establishing a robust and closed-loop learning pathway. Extensive experiments on synthetic data, along with diverse real clinical cases from 5 healthy volunteers, 94 ischemic stroke patients, and 46 meningioma patients, demonstrate the superiority and clinical applicability of FPS. Furthermore, FPS is applied to diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), underscoring its versatility and potential for broader medical applications.

Abstract: Cloth manipulation is challenging due to its highly complex dynamics, near-infinite degrees of freedom, and frequent self-occlusions, which complicate both state estimation and dynamics modeling. Inspired by recent advances in generative models, we hypothesize that these expressive models can effectively capture intricate cloth configurations and deformation patterns from data. Therefore, we propose a diffusion-based generative approach for both perception and dynamics modeling. Specifically, we formulate state estimation as reconstructing full cloth states from partial observations and dynamics modeling as predicting future states given the current state and robot actions. Leveraging a transformer-based diffusion model, our method achieves accurate state reconstruction and reduces long-horizon dynamics prediction errors by an order of magnitude compared to prior approaches. We integrate our dynamics models with model predictive control and show that our framework enables effective cloth folding on real robotic systems, demonstrating the potential of generative models for deformable object manipulation under partial observability and complex dynamics.</description>

      <title>SALT: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning via Singular Value Adaptation with Low-Rank Transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16055v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The complex nature of medical image segmentation calls for models that are specifically designed to capture detailed, domain-specific features. Large foundation models offer considerable flexibility, yet the cost of fine-tuning these models remains a significant barrier. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), efficiently update model weights with low-rank matrices but may suffer from underfitting when the chosen rank is insufficient to capture domain-specific nuances. Conversely, full-rank Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) based methods provide comprehensive updates by modifying all singular values, yet they often lack flexibility and exhibit variable performance across datasets. We propose SALT (Singular Value Adaptation with Low-Rank Transformation), a method that selectively adapts the most influential singular values using trainable scale and shift parameters while complementing this with a low-rank update for the remaining subspace. This hybrid approach harnesses the advantages of both LoRA and SVD, enabling effective adaptation without relying on increasing model size or depth. Evaluated on 5 challenging medical datasets, ranging from as few as 20 samples to 1000, SALT outperforms state-of-the-art PEFT (LoRA and SVD) by 2% to 5% in Dice with only 3.9% trainable parameters, demonstrating robust adaptation even in low-resource settings.

      <title>Optimizing Breast Cancer Detection in Mammograms: A Comprehensive Study of Transfer Learning, Resolution Reduction, and Multi-View Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19945</link>

Abstract: Mammography, an X-ray-based imaging technique, plays a crucial role in the early detection of breast cancer. Its accuracy heavily depends on expert radiologists, making it essential to minimize interpretation errors. To support radiologists, various computer-aided detection and diagnostic methods have been proposed, increasingly leveraging advancements in artificial intelligence and machine learning. Over recent years, mammogram analysis has evolved significantly - from early patch-based classifiers, which examine only localized regions of images, to full-image classifiers, and later towards multi-view systems that simultaneously integrate multiple perspectives of the mammographic exam for enhanced accuracy. Despite this progression, critical questions remain, such as whether multi-view systems consistently outperform single-view approaches. In this paper, we systematically evaluate and compare the effectiveness of single-view and multi-view mammogram classification techniques. Our research introduces models that achieve superior performance relative to existing state-of-the-art approaches in both single-view and two-view classification scenarios. Furthermore, our findings provide valuable insights into optimal model architectures and effective transfer learning strategies, paving the way for more accurate and efficient mammogram interpretation.

      <title>Network Inversion for Generating Confidently Classified Counterfeits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20187v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In vision classification, generating inputs that elicit confident predictions is key to understanding model behavior and reliability, especially under adversarial or out-of-distribution (OOD) conditions. While traditional adversarial methods rely on perturbing existing inputs to fool a model, they are inherently input-dependent and often fail to ensure both high confidence and meaningful deviation from the training data. In this work, we extend network inversion techniques to generate Confidently Classified Counterfeits (CCCs), synthetic samples that are confidently classified by the model despite being significantly different from the training distribution and independent of any specific input. We alter inversion technique by replacing soft vector conditioning with one-hot class conditioning and introducing a Kullback-Leibler divergence loss between the one-hot label and the classifier's output distribution. CCCs offer a model-centric perspective on confidence, revealing that models can assign high confidence to entirely synthetic, out-of-distribution inputs. This challenges the core assumption behind many OOD detection techniques based on thresholding prediction confidence, which assume that high-confidence outputs imply in-distribution data, and highlights the need for more robust uncertainty estimation in safety-critical applications.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Mixture Flow Matching Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05304v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models approximate the denoising distribution as a Gaussian and predict its mean, whereas flow matching models reparameterize the Gaussian mean as flow velocity. However, they underperform in few-step sampling due to discretization error and tend to produce over-saturated colors under classifier-free guidance (CFG). To address these limitations, we propose a novel Gaussian mixture flow matching (GMFlow) model: instead of predicting the mean, GMFlow predicts dynamic Gaussian mixture (GM) parameters to capture a multi-modal flow velocity distribution, which can be learned with a KL divergence loss. We demonstrate that GMFlow generalizes previous diffusion and flow matching models where a single Gaussian is learned with an $L_2$ denoising loss. For inference, we derive GM-SDE/ODE solvers that leverage analytic denoising distributions and velocity fields for precise few-step sampling. Furthermore, we introduce a novel probabilistic guidance scheme that mitigates the over-saturation issues of CFG and improves image generation quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GMFlow consistently outperforms flow matching baselines in generation quality, achieving a Precision of 0.942 with only 6 sampling steps on ImageNet 256$\times$256.</description>

      <title>Micro-splatting: Multistage Isotropy-informed Covariance Regularization Optimization for High-Fidelity 3D Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05740v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-fidelity 3D Gaussian Splatting methods excel at capturing fine textures but often overlook model compactness, resulting in massive splat counts, bloated memory, long training, and complex post-processing. We present Micro-Splatting: Two-Stage Adaptive Growth and Refinement, a unified, in-training pipeline that preserves visual detail while drastically reducing model complexity without any post-processing or auxiliary neural modules. In Stage I (Growth), we introduce a trace-based covariance regularization to maintain near-isotropic Gaussians, mitigating low-pass filtering in high-frequency regions and improving spherical-harmonic color fitting. We then apply gradient-guided adaptive densification that subdivides splats only in visually complex regions, leaving smooth areas sparse. In Stage II (Refinement), we prune low-impact splats using a simple opacity-scale importance score and merge redundant neighbors via lightweight spatial and feature thresholds, producing a lean yet detail-rich model. On four object-centric benchmarks, Micro-Splatting reduces splat count and model size by up to 60% and shortens training by 20%, while matching or surpassing state-of-the-art PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS in real-time rendering. These results demonstrate that Micro-Splatting delivers both compactness and high fidelity in a single, efficient, end-to-end framework.</description>

      <title>FreqSelect: Frequency-Aware fMRI-to-Image Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12552v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reconstructing natural images from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data remains a core challenge in natural decoding due to the mismatch between the richness of visual stimuli and the noisy, low resolution nature of fMRI signals. While recent two-stage models, combining deep variational autoencoders (VAEs) with diffusion models, have advanced this task, they treat all spatial-frequency components of the input equally. This uniform treatment forces the model to extract meaning features and suppress irrelevant noise simultaneously, limiting its effectiveness. We introduce FreqSelect, a lightweight, adaptive module that selectively filters spatial-frequency bands before encoding. By dynamically emphasizing frequencies that are most predictive of brain activity and suppressing those that are uninformative, FreqSelect acts as a content-aware gate between image features and natural data. It integrates seamlessly into standard very deep VAE-diffusion pipelines and requires no additional supervision. Evaluated on the Natural Scenes dataset, FreqSelect consistently improves reconstruction quality across both low- and high-level metrics. Beyond performance gains, the learned frequency-selection patterns offer interpretable insights into how different visual frequencies are represented in the brain. Our method generalizes across subjects and scenes, and holds promise for extension to other neuroimaging modalities, offering a principled approach to enhancing both decoding accuracy and neuroscientific interpretability.</description>

      <title>Fine-tuning Quantized Neural Networks with Zeroth-order Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13430v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As the size of large language models grows exponentially, GPU memory has become a bottleneck for adapting these models to downstream tasks. In this paper, we aim to push the limits of memory-efficient training by minimizing memory usage on model weights, gradients, and optimizer states, within a unified framework. Our idea is to eliminate both gradients and optimizer states using zeroth-order optimization, which approximates gradients by perturbing weights during forward passes to identify gradient directions. To minimize memory usage on weights, we employ model quantization, e.g., converting from bfloat16 to int4. However, directly applying zeroth-order optimization to quantized weights is infeasible due to the precision gap between discrete weights and continuous gradients, which would otherwise require de-quantization and re-quantization. To overcome this challenge, we propose Quantized Zeroth-order Optimization (QZO), a simple yet effective approach that perturbs the continuous quantization scale for gradient estimation and uses a directional derivative clipping method to stabilize training. QZO is orthogonal to both scalar-based and codebook-based post-training quantization methods. Compared to full-parameter fine-tuning in 16 bits, QZO can reduce the total memory cost by more than 18$\times$ for 4-bit LLMs, and enables fine-tuning Llama-2-13B within a single 24GB GPU. Code will be released publicly.</description>

      <title>A versatile foundation model for cine cardiac magnetic resonance image analysis tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00679v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Here we present a versatile foundation model that can perform a range of clinically-relevant image analysis tasks, including segmentation, landmark localisation, diagnosis, and prognostication. A multi-view convolution-transformer masked autoencoder, named as CineMA, was trained on 15 million cine images from 74,916 subjects. The model was validated on multiple image analysis tasks and compared to existing models on &gt;4,500 images from eight independent datasets with diverse population characteristics, representing the largest benchmark study for cine CMR so far. CineMA consistently outperformed conventional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in delineating ventricular boundaries and estimating ejection fraction, a key measure of cardiac function. The improved performance was preserved, even when the model only used half of fine-tuning data. CineMA also surpassed CNNs in disease detection and matched their performance in long-axis function measurement. Interestingly, we found that CineMA can also detect cardiac changes in systemic diseases, such as diabetes, hypertension and cancer, and can also predict mortality. Finally, we assessed model fairness and demonstrated consistent model performance across demographic subgroups. These findings highlight CineMA's accuracy, learning efficiency, adaptability, and fairness, underscoring its potential as a foundation model for automated cardiac image analysis to support clinical workflow and cardiovascular research. All training and inference code and models are made publicly available at https://github.com/mathpluscode/CineMA.</description>

      <title>DT-UFC: Universal Large Model Feature Coding via Peaky-to-Balanced Distribution Transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16495v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Like image coding in visual data transmission, feature coding is essential for the distributed deployment of large models by significantly reducing transmission and storage burden. However, prior studies have mostly targeted task- or model-specific scenarios, leaving the challenge of universal feature coding across diverse large models largely unexplored. In this paper, we present the first systematic study on universal feature coding for large models. The key challenge lies in the inherently diverse and distributionally incompatible nature of features extracted from different models. For example, features from DINOv2 exhibit highly peaky, concentrated distributions, while those from Stable Diffusion 3 (SD3) are more dispersed and uniform. This distributional heterogeneity severely hampers both compression efficiency and cross-model generalization. To address this, we propose a learned peaky-to-balanced distribution transformation, which reshapes highly skewed feature distributions into a common, balanced target space. This transformation is non-uniform, data-driven, and plug-and-play, enabling effective alignment of heterogeneous distributions without modifying downstream codecs. With this alignment, a universal codec trained on the balanced target distribution can effectively generalize to features from different models and tasks. We validate our approach on three representative large models (LLaMA3, DINOv2, and SD3) across multiple tasks and modalities. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves notable improvements in both compression efficiency and cross-model generalization over task-specific baselines.

      <title>LLM-Enhanced Multimodal Fusion for Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17966v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation (CDSR) predicts user behavior by leveraging historical interactions across multiple domains, focusing on modeling cross-domain preferences and capturing both intra- and inter-sequence item relationships. We propose LLM-Enhanced Multimodal Fusion for Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation (LLM-EMF), a novel and advanced approach that enhances textual information with Large Language Models (LLM) knowledge and significantly improves recommendation performance through the fusion of visual and textual data. Using the frozen CLIP model, we generate image and text embeddings, thereby enriching item representations with multimodal data. A multiple attention mechanism jointly learns both single-domain and cross-domain preferences, effectively capturing and understanding complex user interests across diverse domains. Evaluations conducted on four e-commerce datasets demonstrate that LLM-EMF consistently outperforms existing methods in modeling cross-domain user preferences, thereby highlighting the effectiveness of multimodal data integration and its advantages in enhancing sequential recommendation systems. Our source code will be released.</description>

      <title>Towards Efficient and Accurate Spiking Neural Networks via Adaptive Bit Allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23717v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-bit spiking neural networks (SNNs) have recently become a heated research spot, pursuing energy-efficient and high-accurate AI. However, with more bits involved, the associated memory and computation demands escalate to the point where the performance improvements become disproportionate. Based on the insight that different layers demonstrate different importance and extra bits could be wasted and interfering, this paper presents an adaptive bit allocation strategy for direct-trained SNNs, achieving fine-grained layer-wise allocation of memory and computation resources. Thus, SNN's efficiency and accuracy can be improved. Specifically, we parametrize the temporal lengths and the bit widths of weights and spikes, and make them learnable and controllable through gradients. To address the challenges caused by changeable bit widths and temporal lengths, we propose the refined spiking neuron, which can handle different temporal lengths, enable the derivation of gradients for temporal lengths, and suit spike quantization better. In addition, we theoretically formulate the step-size mismatch problem of learnable bit widths, which may incur severe quantization errors to SNN, and accordingly propose the step-size renewal mechanism to alleviate this issue. Experiments on various datasets, including the static CIFAR and ImageNet datasets and the dynamic CIFAR-DVS, DVS-GESTURE, and SHD datasets, demonstrate that our methods can reduce the overall memory and computation cost while achieving higher accuracy. Particularly, our SEWResNet-34 can achieve a 2.69% accuracy gain and 4.16x lower bit budgets over the advanced baseline work on ImageNet. This work will be open-sourced.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20746v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spiking neural networks offer low energy consumption due to their event-driven nature. Beyond binary spike outputs, their intrinsic floating-point dynamics merit greater attention. Neuronal threshold levels and reset modes critically determine spike count and timing. Hard reset cause information loss, while soft reset apply uniform treatment to neurons. To address these issues, we design an adaptive reset neuron that establishes relationships between inputs, outputs, and reset, while integrating a simple yet effective threshold adjustment strategy. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves excellent performance while maintaining lower energy consumption. In particular, it attains state-of-the-art accuracy on Tiny-ImageNet and CIFAR10-DVS. Codes are available at https://github.com/2ephyrus/AR-LIF.</description>

      <title>RISE: Enhancing VLM Image Annotation with Self-Supervised Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13229v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle with complex image annotation tasks, such as emotion classification and context-driven object detection, which demand sophisticated reasoning. Standard Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) focuses solely on annotation outcomes, ignoring underlying rationales, while Visual Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (Visual-RFT) produces inconsistent Chains of Thought (CoTs) due to the absence of high-quality, verified CoTs during pre-training. We introduce RISE (Reason-Inspire-Strengthen-Expertise), a two-stage framework to overcome these limitations. In the Reason stage (RISE-CoT), a reinforcement learning-driven "annotation-reasoning-annotation" closed-loop generates visually grounded, logically consistent CoTs by verifying their ability to reconstruct original annotations without direct leakage. The Inspire and Strengthen stage (RISE-R1) leverages a high-quality CoT subset, filtered by RISE-CoT rewards, for supervised fine-tuning, followed by reinforcement fine-tuning to produce interpretable reasoning and accurate annotations, achieving Expertise in complex visual tasks.

      <title>Fine-grained Image Quality Assessment for Perceptual Image Restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14475v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent years have witnessed remarkable achievements in perceptual image restoration (IR), creating an urgent demand for accurate image quality assessment (IQA), which is essential for both performance comparison and algorithm optimization. Unfortunately, the existing IQA metrics exhibit inherent weakness for IR task, particularly when distinguishing fine-grained quality differences among restored images. To address this dilemma, we contribute the first-of-its-kind fine-grained image quality assessment dataset for image restoration, termed FGRestore, comprising 18,408 restored images across six common IR tasks. Beyond conventional scalar quality scores, FGRestore was also annotated with 30,886 fine-grained pairwise preferences. Based on FGRestore, a comprehensive benchmark was conducted on the existing IQA metrics, which reveal significant inconsistencies between score-based IQA evaluations and the fine-grained restoration quality. Motivated by these findings, we further propose FGResQ, a new IQA model specifically designed for image restoration, which features both coarse-grained score regression and fine-grained quality ranking. Extensive experiments and comparisons demonstrate that FGResQ significantly outperforms state-of-the-art IQA metrics. Codes and model weights have been released in https://pxf0429.github.io/FGResQ/</description>

      <title>Efficient and Privacy-Protecting Background Removal for 2D Video Streaming using iPhone 15 Pro Max LiDAR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20250v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) technology in consumer-grade mobile devices can be used as a replacement for traditional background removal and compositing techniques. Unlike approaches such as chroma keying and trained AI models, LiDAR's depth information is independent of subject lighting, and performs equally well in low-light and well-lit environments. We integrate the LiDAR and color cameras on the iPhone 15 Pro Max with GPU-based image processing. We use Apple's SwiftUI and Swift frameworks for user interface and backend development, and Metal Shader Language (MSL) for realtime image enhancement at the standard iPhone streaming frame rate of 60 frames per second. The only meaningful limitations of the technology are the streaming bandwidth of the depth data, which currently reduces the depth map resolution to 320x240, and any pre-existing limitations of the LiDAR IR laser to reflect accurate depth from some materials. If the LiDAR resolution on a mobile device like the iPhone can be improved to match the color image resolution, LiDAR could feasibly become the preeminent method of background removal for video applications and photography.</description>

      <title>SPGrasp: Spatiotemporal Prompt-driven Grasp Synthesis in Dynamic Scenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20547v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Real-time interactive grasp synthesis for dynamic objects remains challenging as existing methods fail to achieve low-latency inference while maintaining promptability. To bridge this gap, we propose SPGrasp (spatiotemporal prompt-driven dynamic grasp synthesis), a novel framework extending segment anything model v2 (SAMv2) for video stream grasp estimation. Our core innovation integrates user prompts with spatiotemporal context, enabling real-time interaction with end-to-end latency as low as 59 ms while ensuring temporal consistency for dynamic objects. In benchmark evaluations, SPGrasp achieves instance-level grasp accuracies of 90.6% on OCID and 93.8% on Jacquard. On the challenging GraspNet-1Billion dataset under continuous tracking, SPGrasp achieves 92.0% accuracy with 73.1 ms per-frame latency, representing a 58.5% reduction compared to the prior state-of-the-art promptable method RoG-SAM while maintaining competitive accuracy. Real-world experiments involving 13 moving objects demonstrate a 94.8% success rate in interactive grasping scenarios. These results confirm SPGrasp effectively resolves the latency-interactivity trade-off in dynamic grasp synthesis.</description>

      <title>Mitosis detection in domain shift scenarios: a Mamba-based approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21033v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mitosis detection in histopathology images plays a key role in tumor assessment. Although machine learning algorithms could be exploited for aiding physicians in accurately performing such a task, these algorithms suffer from significative performance drop when evaluated on images coming from domains that are different from the training ones. In this work, we propose a Mamba-based approach for mitosis detection under domain shift, inspired by the promising performance demonstrated by Mamba in medical imaging segmentation tasks. Specifically, our approach exploits a VM-UNet architecture for carrying out the addressed task, as well as stain augmentation operations for further improving model robustness against domain shift. Our approach has been submitted to the track 1 of the MItosis DOmain Generalization (MIDOG) challenge. Preliminary experiments, conducted on the MIDOG++ dataset, show large room for improvement for the proposed method.</description>

      <title>A multi-task neural network for atypical mitosis recognition under domain shift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21035v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recognizing atypical mitotic figures in histopathology images allows physicians to correctly assess tumor aggressiveness. Although machine learning models could be exploited for automatically performing such a task, under domain shift these models suffer from significative performance drops. In this work, an approach based on multi-task learning is proposed for addressing this problem. By exploiting auxiliary tasks, correlated to the main classification task, the proposed approach, submitted to the track 2 of the MItosis DOmain Generalization (MIDOG) challenge, aims to aid the model to focus only on the object to classify, ignoring the domain varying background of the image. The proposed approach shows promising performance in a preliminary evaluation conducted on three distinct datasets, i.e., the MIDOG 2025 Atypical Training Set, the Ami-Br dataset, as well as the preliminary test set of the MIDOG25 challenge.</description>
