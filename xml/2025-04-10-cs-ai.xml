      <title>EduPlanner: LLM-Based Multi-Agent Systems for Customized and Intelligent Instructional Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced smart education in the Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) era. A promising application lies in the automatic generalization of instructional design for curriculum and learning activities, focusing on two key aspects: (1) Customized Generation: generating niche-targeted teaching content based on students' varying learning abilities and states, and (2) Intelligent Optimization: iteratively optimizing content based on feedback from learning effectiveness or test scores. Currently, a single large LLM cannot effectively manage the entire process, posing a challenge for designing intelligent teaching plans. To address these issues, we developed EduPlanner, an LLM-based multi-agent system comprising an evaluator agent, an optimizer agent, and a question analyst, working in adversarial collaboration to generate customized and intelligent instructional design for curriculum and learning activities. Taking mathematics lessons as our example, EduPlanner employs a novel Skill-Tree structure to accurately model the background mathematics knowledge of student groups, personalizing instructional design for curriculum and learning activities according to students' knowledge levels and learning abilities. Additionally, we introduce the CIDDP, an LLM-based five-dimensional evaluation module encompassing clarity, Integrity, Depth, Practicality, and Pertinence, to comprehensively assess mathematics lesson plan quality and bootstrap intelligent optimization. Experiments conducted on the GSM8K and Algebra datasets demonstrate that EduPlanner excels in evaluating and optimizing instructional design for curriculum and learning activities. Ablation studies further validate the significance and effectiveness of each component within the framework. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/Zc0812/Edu_Planner</description>

      <title>Interactive Explanations for Reinforcement-Learning Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As reinforcement learning methods increasingly amass accomplishments, the need for comprehending their solutions becomes more crucial. Most explainable reinforcement learning (XRL) methods generate a static explanation depicting their developers' intuition of what should be explained and how. In contrast, literature from the social sciences proposes that meaningful explanations are structured as a dialog between the explainer and the explainee, suggesting a more active role for the user and her communication with the agent. In this paper, we present ASQ-IT -- an interactive explanation system that presents video clips of the agent acting in its environment based on queries given by the user that describe temporal properties of behaviors of interest. Our approach is based on formal methods: queries in ASQ-IT's user interface map to a fragment of Linear Temporal Logic over finite traces (LTLf), which we developed, and our algorithm for query processing is based on automata theory. User studies show that end-users can understand and formulate queries in ASQ-IT and that using ASQ-IT assists users in identifying faulty agent behaviors.</description>

      <title>Reasoning Models Know When They're Right: Probing Hidden States for Self-Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reasoning models have achieved remarkable performance on tasks like math and logical reasoning thanks to their ability to search during reasoning. However, they still suffer from overthinking, often performing unnecessary reasoning steps even after reaching the correct answer. This raises the question: can models evaluate the correctness of their intermediate answers during reasoning? In this work, we study whether reasoning models encode information about answer correctness through probing the model's hidden states. The resulting probe can verify intermediate answers with high accuracy and produces highly calibrated scores. Additionally, we find models' hidden states encode correctness of future answers, enabling early prediction of the correctness before the intermediate answer is fully formulated. We then use the probe as a verifier to decide whether to exit reasoning at intermediate answers during inference, reducing the number of inference tokens by 24\% without compromising performance. These findings confirm that reasoning models do encode a notion of correctness yet fail to exploit it, revealing substantial untapped potential to enhance their efficiency.</description>

      <title>Prism: Dynamic and Flexible Benchmarking of LLMs Code Generation with Monte Carlo Tree Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has outpaced traditional evaluation methods. Static benchmarks fail to capture the depth and breadth of LLM capabilities and eventually become obsolete, while most dynamic approaches either rely too heavily on LLM-based evaluation or remain constrained by predefined test sets. We introduce Prism, a flexible, dynamic benchmarking framework designed for comprehensive LLM assessment. Prism builds on three key components: (1) a tree-based state representation that models evaluation as a Markov Decision Process, (2) a Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm adapted to uncover challenging evaluation scenarios, and (3) a multi-agent evaluation pipeline that enables simultaneous assessment of diverse capabilities. To ensure robust evaluation, Prism integrates structural measurements of tree exploration patterns with performance metrics across difficulty levels, providing detailed diagnostics of error patterns, test coverage, and solution approaches. Through extensive experiments on five state-of-the-art LLMs, we analyze how model architecture and scale influence code generation performance across varying task difficulties. Our results demonstrate Prism's effectiveness as a dynamic benchmark that evolves with model advancements while offering deeper insights into their limitations.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing availability of large-scale datasets has fueled rapid progress across many scientific fields, creating unprecedented opportunities for research and discovery while posing significant analytical challenges. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and AI agents have opened new possibilities for human-AI collaboration, offering powerful tools to navigate this complex research landscape. In this paper, we introduce SciSciGPT, an open-source, prototype AI collaborator that uses the science of science as a testbed to explore the potential of LLM-powered research tools. SciSciGPT automates complex workflows, supports diverse analytical approaches, accelerates research prototyping and iteration, and facilitates reproducibility. Through case studies, we demonstrate its ability to streamline a wide range of empirical and analytical research tasks while highlighting its broader potential to advance research. We further propose an LLM Agent capability maturity model for human-AI collaboration, envisioning a roadmap to further improve and expand upon frameworks like SciSciGPT. As AI capabilities continue to evolve, frameworks like SciSciGPT may play increasingly pivotal roles in scientific research and discovery, unlocking further opportunities. At the same time, these new advances also raise critical challenges, from ensuring transparency and ethical use to balancing human and AI contributions. Addressing these issues may shape the future of scientific inquiry and inform how we train the next generation of scientists to thrive in an increasingly AI-integrated research ecosystem.</description>

      <title>Continual Learning of Multiple Cognitive Functions with Brain-inspired Temporal Development Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cognitive functions in current artificial intelligence networks are tied to the exponential increase in network scale, whereas the human brain can continuously learn hundreds of cognitive functions with remarkably low energy consumption. This advantage is in part due to the brain cross-regional temporal development mechanisms, where the progressive formation, reorganization, and pruning of connections from basic to advanced regions, facilitate knowledge transfer and prevent network redundancy. Inspired by these, we propose the Continual Learning of Multiple Cognitive Functions with Brain-inspired Temporal Development Mechanism(TD-MCL), enabling cognitive enhancement from simple to complex in Perception-Motor-Interaction(PMI) multiple cognitive task scenarios. The TD-MCL model proposes the sequential evolution of long-range connections between different cognitive modules to promote positive knowledge transfer, while using feedback-guided local connection inhibition and pruning to effectively eliminate redundancies in previous tasks, reducing energy consumption while preserving acquired knowledge. Experiments show that the proposed method can achieve continual learning capabilities while reducing network scale, without introducing regularization, replay, or freezing strategies, and achieving superior accuracy on new tasks compared to direct learning. The proposed method shows that the brain's developmental mechanisms offer a valuable reference for exploring biologically plausible, low-energy enhancements of general cognitive abilities.</description>

      <title>StayLTC: A Cost-Effective Multimodal Framework for Hospital Length of Stay Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of Length of Stay (LOS) in hospitals is crucial for improving healthcare services, resource management, and cost efficiency. This paper presents StayLTC, a multimodal deep learning framework developed to forecast real-time hospital LOS using Liquid Time-Constant Networks (LTCs). LTCs, with their continuous-time recurrent dynamics, are evaluated against traditional models using structured data from Electronic Health Records (EHRs) and clinical notes. Our evaluation, conducted on the MIMIC-III dataset, demonstrated that LTCs significantly outperform most of the other time series models, offering enhanced accuracy, robustness, and efficiency in resource utilization. Additionally, LTCs demonstrate a comparable performance in LOS prediction compared to time series large language models, while requiring significantly less computational power and memory, underscoring their potential to advance Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks in healthcare.</description>

      <title>Automated Archival Descriptions with Federated Intelligence of LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enforcing archival standards requires specialized expertise, and manually creating metadata descriptions for archival materials is a tedious and error-prone task. This work aims at exploring the potential of agentic AI and large language models (LLMs) in addressing the challenges of implementing a standardized archival description process. To this end, we introduce an agentic AI-driven system for automated generation of high-quality metadata descriptions of archival materials. We develop a federated optimization approach that unites the intelligence of multiple LLMs to construct optimal archival metadata. We also suggest methods to overcome the challenges associated with using LLMs for consistent metadata generation. To evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of our techniques, we conducted extensive experiments using a real-world dataset of archival materials, which covers a variety of document types and data formats. The evaluation results demonstrate the feasibility of our techniques and highlight the superior performance of the federated optimization approach compared to single-model solutions in metadata quality and reliability.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive review of AI-driven prognostics for State of Health (SoH) prediction in lithium-ion batteries. We compare the effectiveness of various AI algorithms, including FFNN, LSTM, and BiLSTM, across multiple datasets (CALCE, NASA, UDDS) and scenarios (e.g., varying temperatures and driving conditions). Additionally, we analyze the factors influencing SoH fluctuations, such as temperature and charge-discharge rates, and validate our findings through simulations. The results demonstrate that BiLSTM achieves the highest accuracy, with an average RMSE reduction of 15% compared to LSTM, highlighting its robustness in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>From Superficial to Deep: Integrating External Knowledge for Follow-up Question Generation Using Knowledge Graph and LLM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a conversational system, dynamically generating follow-up questions based on context can help users explore information and provide a better user experience. Humans are usually able to ask questions that involve some general life knowledge and demonstrate higher order cognitive skills. However, the questions generated by existing methods are often limited to shallow contextual questions that are uninspiring and have a large gap to the human level. In this paper, we propose a three-stage external knowledge-enhanced follow-up question generation method, which generates questions by identifying contextual topics, constructing a knowledge graph (KG) online, and finally combining these with a large language model to generate the final question. The model generates information-rich and exploratory follow-up questions by introducing external common sense knowledge and performing a knowledge fusion operation. Experiments show that compared to baseline models, our method generates questions that are more informative and closer to human questioning levels while maintaining contextual relevance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural Fields (NF) have gained prominence as a versatile framework for complex data representation. This work unveils a new problem setting termed \emph{Meta-Continual Learning of Neural Fields} (MCL-NF) and introduces a novel strategy that employs a modular architecture combined with optimization-based meta-learning. Focused on overcoming the limitations of existing methods for continual learning of neural fields, such as catastrophic forgetting and slow convergence, our strategy achieves high-quality reconstruction with significantly improved learning speed. We further introduce Fisher Information Maximization loss for neural radiance fields (FIM-NeRF), which maximizes information gains at the sample level to enhance learning generalization, with proved convergence guarantee and generalization bound. We perform extensive evaluations across image, audio, video reconstruction, and view synthesis tasks on six diverse datasets, demonstrating our method's superiority in reconstruction quality and speed over existing MCL and CL-NF approaches. Notably, our approach attains rapid adaptation of neural fields for city-scale NeRF rendering with reduced parameter requirement.</description>

      <title>Are Generative AI Agents Effective Personalized Financial Advisors?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language model-based agents are becoming increasingly popular as a low-cost mechanism to provide personalized, conversational advice, and have demonstrated impressive capabilities in relatively simple scenarios, such as movie recommendations. But how do these agents perform in complex high-stakes domains, where domain expertise is essential and mistakes carry substantial risk? This paper investigates the effectiveness of LLM-advisors in the finance domain, focusing on three distinct challenges: (1) eliciting user preferences when users themselves may be unsure of their needs, (2) providing personalized guidance for diverse investment preferences, and (3) leveraging advisor personality to build relationships and foster trust. Via a lab-based user study with 64 participants, we show that LLM-advisors often match human advisor performance when eliciting preferences, although they can struggle to resolve conflicting user needs. When providing personalized advice, the LLM was able to positively influence user behavior, but demonstrated clear failure modes. Our results show that accurate preference elicitation is key, otherwise, the LLM-advisor has little impact, or can even direct the investor toward unsuitable assets. More worryingly, users appear insensitive to the quality of advice being given, or worse these can have an inverse relationship. Indeed, users reported a preference for and increased satisfaction as well as emotional trust with LLMs adopting an extroverted persona, even though those agents provided worse advice.</description>

      <title>Agent Guide: A Simple Agent Behavioral Watermarking Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing deployment of intelligent agents in digital ecosystems, such as social media platforms, has raised significant concerns about traceability and accountability, particularly in cybersecurity and digital content protection. Traditional large language model (LLM) watermarking techniques, which rely on token-level manipulations, are ill-suited for agents due to the challenges of behavior tokenization and information loss during behavior-to-action translation. To address these issues, we propose Agent Guide, a novel behavioral watermarking framework that embeds watermarks by guiding the agent's high-level decisions (behavior) through probability biases, while preserving the naturalness of specific executions (action). Our approach decouples agent behavior into two levels, behavior (e.g., choosing to bookmark) and action (e.g., bookmarking with specific tags), and applies watermark-guided biases to the behavior probability distribution. We employ a z-statistic-based statistical analysis to detect the watermark, ensuring reliable extraction over multiple rounds. Experiments in a social media scenario with diverse agent profiles demonstrate that Agent Guide achieves effective watermark detection with a low false positive rate. Our framework provides a practical and robust solution for agent watermarking, with applications in identifying malicious agents and protecting proprietary agent systems.</description>

      <title>Systematic Parameter Decision in Approximate Model Counting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel approach to determining the internal parameters of the hashing-based approximate model counting algorithm $\mathsf{ApproxMC}$. In this problem, the chosen parameter values must ensure that $\mathsf{ApproxMC}$ is Probably Approximately Correct (PAC), while also making it as efficient as possible. The existing approach to this problem relies on heuristics; in this paper, we solve this problem by formulating it as an optimization problem that arises from generalizing $\mathsf{ApproxMC}$'s correctness proof to arbitrary parameter values.
  Our approach separates the concerns of algorithm soundness and optimality, allowing us to address the former without the need for repetitive case-by-case argumentation, while establishing a clear framework for the latter. Furthermore, after reduction, the resulting optimization problem takes on an exceptionally simple form, enabling the use of a basic search algorithm and providing insight into how parameter values affect algorithm performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our optimized parameters improve the runtime performance of the latest $\mathsf{ApproxMC}$ by a factor of 1.6 to 2.4, depending on the error tolerance.</description>

      <title>AEGIS: Human Attention-based Explainable Guidance for Intelligent Vehicle Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Improving decision-making capabilities in Autonomous Intelligent Vehicles (AIVs) has been a heated topic in recent years. Despite advancements, training machines to capture regions of interest for comprehensive scene understanding, like human perception and reasoning, remains a significant challenge. This study introduces a novel framework, Human Attention-based Explainable Guidance for Intelligent Vehicle Systems (AEGIS). AEGIS utilizes human attention, converted from eye-tracking, to guide reinforcement learning (RL) models to identify critical regions of interest for decision-making.

      <title>Representing Normative Regulations in OWL DL for Automated Compliance Checking Supported by Text Annotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compliance checking is the process of determining whether a regulated entity adheres to these regulations. Currently, compliance checking is predominantly manual, requiring significant time and highly skilled experts, while still being prone to errors caused by the human factor. Various approaches have been explored to automate compliance checking, however, representing regulations in OWL DL language which enables compliance checking through OWL reasoning has not been adopted. In this work, we propose an annotation schema and an algorithm that transforms text annotations into machine-interpretable OWL DL code. The proposed approach is validated through a proof-of-concept implementation applied to examples from the building construction domain.</description>

      <title>Information-Theoretic Reward Decomposition for Generalizable RLHF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A generalizable reward model is crucial in Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) as it enables correctly evaluating unseen prompt-response pairs. However, existing reward models lack this ability, as they are typically trained by increasing the reward gap between chosen and rejected responses, while overlooking the prompts that the responses are conditioned on. Consequently, when the trained reward model is evaluated on prompt-response pairs that lie outside the data distribution, neglecting the effect of prompts may result in poor generalization of the reward model. To address this issue, we decompose the reward value into two independent components: prompt-free reward and prompt-related reward. Prompt-free reward represents the evaluation that is determined only by responses, while the prompt-related reward reflects the reward that derives from both the prompt and the response. We extract these two components from an information-theoretic perspective, which requires no extra models. Subsequently, we propose a new reward learning algorithm by prioritizing data samples based on their prompt-free reward values. Through toy examples, we demonstrate that the extracted prompt-free and prompt-related rewards effectively characterize two parts of the reward model. Further, standard evaluations show that our method improves both the alignment performance and the generalization capability of the reward model.</description>

      <title>Leanabell-Prover: Posttraining Scaling in Formal Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in automated theorem proving (ATP) through LLMs have highlighted the potential of formal reasoning with Lean 4 codes. However, ATP has not yet be revolutionized by the recent posttraining scaling as demonstrated by Open AI O1/O3 and Deepseek R1. In this work, we investigate the entire posttraining of ATP, aiming to align it with breakthroughs in reasoning models in natural languages.To begin, we continual train current ATP models with a hybrid dataset, which consists of numerous statement-proof pairs, and additional data aimed at incorporating cognitive behaviors that emulate human reasoning and hypothesis refinement. Next, we explore reinforcement learning with the use of outcome reward returned by Lean 4 compiler. Through our designed continual training and reinforcement learning processes, we have successfully improved existing formal provers, including both DeepSeek-Prover-v1.5 and Goedel-Prover, achieving state-of-the-art performance in the field of whole-proof generation. For example, we achieve a 59.8% pass rate (pass@32) on MiniF2F. This is an on-going project and we will progressively update our findings, release our data and training details.</description>

      <title>Decentralizing AI Memory: SHIMI, a Semantic Hierarchical Memory Index for Scalable Agent Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and vector-based search have become foundational tools for memory in AI systems, yet they struggle with abstraction, scalability, and semantic precision - especially in decentralized environments. We present SHIMI (Semantic Hierarchical Memory Index), a unified architecture that models knowledge as a dynamically structured hierarchy of concepts, enabling agents to retrieve information based on meaning rather than surface similarity. SHIMI organizes memory into layered semantic nodes and supports top-down traversal from abstract intent to specific entities, offering more precise and explainable retrieval. Critically, SHIMI is natively designed for decentralized ecosystems, where agents maintain local memory trees and synchronize them asynchronously across networks. We introduce a lightweight sync protocol that leverages Merkle-DAG summaries, Bloom filters, and CRDT-style conflict resolution to enable partial synchronization with minimal overhead. Through benchmark experiments and use cases involving decentralized agent collaboration, we demonstrate SHIMI's advantages in retrieval accuracy, semantic fidelity, and scalability - positioning it as a core infrastructure layer for decentralized cognitive systems.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI agents are autonomous systems that can execute specific tasks based on predefined programming. Here, we present SkillFlow, a modular, technology-agnostic framework that allows agents to expand their functionality in an ad-hoc fashion by acquiring new skills from their environment or other agents. We present a theoretical model that examines under which conditions this framework would be beneficial, and we then explore SkillFlow's ability to accelerate task completion and lead to lower cumulative costs in a real-world application, namely scheduling agents for calendar events. We demonstrate that within a few iterations, SkillFlow leads to considerable (24.8%, p-value = $6.4\times10^{-3}$) gains in time and cost, especially when the communication cost is high. Finally, we draw analogies from well-studied biological systems and compare this framework to that of lateral gene transfer, a significant process of adaptation and evolution in novel environments.</description>

      <title>TxGemma: Efficient and Agentic LLMs for Therapeutics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Therapeutic development is a costly and high-risk endeavor that is often plagued by high failure rates. To address this, we introduce TxGemma, a suite of efficient, generalist large language models (LLMs) capable of therapeutic property prediction as well as interactive reasoning and explainability. Unlike task-specific models, TxGemma synthesizes information from diverse sources, enabling broad application across the therapeutic development pipeline. The suite includes 2B, 9B, and 27B parameter models, fine-tuned from Gemma-2 on a comprehensive dataset of small molecules, proteins, nucleic acids, diseases, and cell lines. Across 66 therapeutic development tasks, TxGemma achieved superior or comparable performance to the state-of-the-art generalist model on 64 (superior on 45), and against state-of-the-art specialist models on 50 (superior on 26). Fine-tuning TxGemma models on therapeutic downstream tasks, such as clinical trial adverse event prediction, requires less training data than fine-tuning base LLMs, making TxGemma suitable for data-limited applications. Beyond these predictive capabilities, TxGemma features conversational models that bridge the gap between general LLMs and specialized property predictors. These allow scientists to interact in natural language, provide mechanistic reasoning for predictions based on molecular structure, and engage in scientific discussions. Building on this, we further introduce Agentic-Tx, a generalist therapeutic agentic system powered by Gemini 2.5 that reasons, acts, manages diverse workflows, and acquires external domain knowledge. Agentic-Tx surpasses prior leading models on the Humanity's Last Exam benchmark (Chemistry &amp; Biology) with 52.3% relative improvement over o3-mini (high) and 26.7% over o3-mini (high) on GPQA (Chemistry) and excels with improvements of 6.3% (ChemBench-Preference) and 2.4% (ChemBench-Mini) over o3-mini (high).</description>

      <title>FEABench: Evaluating Language Models on Multiphysics Reasoning Ability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building precise simulations of the real world and invoking numerical solvers to answer quantitative problems is an essential requirement in engineering and science. We present FEABench, a benchmark to evaluate the ability of large language models (LLMs) and LLM agents to simulate and solve physics, mathematics and engineering problems using finite element analysis (FEA). We introduce a comprehensive evaluation scheme to investigate the ability of LLMs to solve these problems end-to-end by reasoning over natural language problem descriptions and operating COMSOL Multiphysics$^\circledR$, an FEA software, to compute the answers. We additionally design a language model agent equipped with the ability to interact with the software through its Application Programming Interface (API), examine its outputs and use tools to improve its solutions over multiple iterations. Our best performing strategy generates executable API calls 88% of the time. LLMs that can successfully interact with and operate FEA software to solve problems such as those in our benchmark would push the frontiers of automation in engineering. Acquiring this capability would augment LLMs' reasoning skills with the precision of numerical solvers and advance the development of autonomous systems that can tackle complex problems in the real world.

      <title>When Reasoning Meets Compression: Benchmarking Compressed Large Reasoning Models on Complex Reasoning Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent open-source large reasoning models (LRMs) exhibit strong performance on complex reasoning tasks, but their large parameter count makes them prohibitively expensive for individuals. The compression of large language models (LLMs) offers an effective solution to reduce cost of computational resources. However, systematic studies on the performance of compressed LLMs in complex reasoning tasks, especially for LRMs, are lacking. Most works on quantization and pruning focus on preserving language modeling performance, while existing distillation works do not comprehensively benchmark student models based on reasoning difficulty or compression impact on knowledge and reasoning. In this paper, we benchmark compressed DeepSeek-R1 models on four different reasoning datasets (AIME 2024, FOLIO, Temporal Sequences of BIG-Bench Hard, and MuSiQue), ranging from mathematical to multihop reasoning, using quantization, distillation, and pruning methods. We benchmark 2.51-, 1.73-, and 1.58-bit R1 models that adopt dynamic quantization. We also benchmark distilled R1 models that are based on LLaMA or Qwen and run SparseGPT on them to obtain various sparsity levels. Studying the performance and behavior of compressed LRMs, we report their performance scores and test-time compute (number of tokens spent on each question). Notably, using MuSiQue, we find that parameter count has a much greater impact on LRMs' knowledge memorization than on their reasoning capability, which can inform the choice of compression techniques. Through our empirical analysis of test-time compute, we find that shorter model outputs generally achieve better performance than longer ones across several benchmarks for both R1 and its compressed variants, highlighting the need for more concise reasoning chains.</description>

      <title>Toward Total Recall: Enhancing FAIRness through AI-Driven Metadata Standardization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current metadata often suffer from incompleteness, inconsistency, and incorrect formatting, hindering effective data reuse and discovery. Using GPT-4 and a metadata knowledge base (CEDAR), we devised a method that standardizes metadata in scientific data sets, ensuring the adherence to community standards. The standardization process involves correcting and refining metadata entries to conform to established guidelines, significantly improving search performance and recall metrics. The investigation uses BioSample and GEO repositories to demonstrate the impact of these enhancements, showcasing how standardized metadata lead to better retrieval outcomes. The average recall improves significantly, rising from 17.65\% with the baseline raw datasets of BioSample and GEO to 62.87\% with our proposed metadata standardization pipeline. This finding highlights the transformative impact of integrating advanced AI models with structured metadata curation tools in achieving more effective and reliable data retrieval.</description>

      <title>IterQR: An Iterative Framework for LLM-based Query Rewrite in e-Commercial Search System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The essence of modern e-Commercial search system lies in matching user's intent and available candidates depending on user's query, providing personalized and precise service. However, user's query may be incorrect due to ambiguous input and typo, leading to inaccurate search. These cases may be released by query rewrite: modify query to other representation or expansion. However, traditional query rewrite replies on static rewrite vocabulary, which is manually established meanwhile lacks interaction with both domain knowledge in e-Commercial system and common knowledge in the real world. In this paper, with the ability to generate text content of Large Language Models (LLMs), we provide an iterative framework to generate query rewrite. The framework incorporates a 3-stage procedure in each iteration: Rewrite Generation with domain knowledge by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and query understanding by Chain-of-Thoughts (CoT); Online Signal Collection with automatic positive rewrite update; Post-training of LLM with multi task objective to generate new rewrites. Our work (named as IterQR) provides a comprehensive framework to generate \textbf{Q}uery \textbf{R}ewrite with both domain / real-world knowledge. It automatically update and self-correct the rewrites during \textbf{iter}ations. \method{} has been deployed in Meituan Delivery's search system (China's leading food delivery platform), providing service for users with significant improvement.</description>

      <title>Towards Adaptive Memory-Based Optimization for Enhanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), by integrating non-parametric knowledge from external knowledge bases into models, has emerged as a promising approach to enhancing response accuracy while mitigating factual errors and hallucinations. This method has been widely applied in tasks such as Question Answering (QA). However, existing RAG methods struggle with open-domain QA tasks because they perform independent retrieval operations and directly incorporate the retrieved information into generation without maintaining a summarizing memory or using adaptive retrieval strategies, leading to noise from redundant information and insufficient information integration. To address these challenges, we propose Adaptive memory-based optimization for enhanced RAG (Amber) for open-domain QA tasks, which comprises an Agent-based Memory Updater, an Adaptive Information Collector, and a Multi-granular Content Filter, working together within an iterative memory updating paradigm. Specifically, Amber integrates and optimizes the language model's memory through a multi-agent collaborative approach, ensuring comprehensive knowledge integration from previous retrieval steps. It dynamically adjusts retrieval queries and decides when to stop retrieval based on the accumulated knowledge, enhancing retrieval efficiency and effectiveness. Additionally, it reduces noise by filtering irrelevant content at multiple levels, retaining essential information to improve overall model performance. We conduct extensive experiments on several open-domain QA datasets, and the results demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of our method and its components. The source code is available \footnote{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Amber-B203/}.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Quantitative Language for Generative Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative recommendation has emerged as a promising paradigm aiming at directly generating the identifiers of the target candidates. Most existing methods attempt to leverage prior knowledge embedded in Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) to improve the recommendation performance. However, they often fail to accommodate the differences between the general linguistic knowledge of PLMs and the specific needs of recommendation systems. Moreover, they rarely consider the complementary knowledge between the multimodal information of items, which represents the multi-faceted preferences of users. To facilitate efficient recommendation knowledge transfer, we propose a novel approach called Multimodal Quantitative Language for Generative Recommendation (MQL4GRec). Our key idea is to transform items from different domains and modalities into a unified language, which can serve as a bridge for transferring recommendation knowledge. Specifically, we first introduce quantitative translators to convert the text and image content of items from various domains into a new and concise language, known as quantitative language, with all items sharing the same vocabulary. Then, we design a series of quantitative language generation tasks to enrich quantitative language with semantic information and prior knowledge. Finally, we achieve the transfer of recommendation knowledge from different domains and modalities to the recommendation task through pre-training and fine-tuning. We evaluate the effectiveness of MQL4GRec through extensive experiments and comparisons with existing methods, achieving improvements over the baseline by 11.18\%, 14.82\%, and 7.95\% on the NDCG metric across three different datasets, respectively.</description>

      <title>Scale Up Composed Image Retrieval Learning via Modification Text Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) aims to search an image of interest using a combination of a reference image and modification text as the query. Despite recent advancements, this task remains challenging due to limited training data and laborious triplet annotation processes. To address this issue, this paper proposes to synthesize the training triplets to augment the training resource for the CIR problem. Specifically, we commence by training a modification text generator exploiting large-scale multimodal models and scale up the CIR learning throughout both the pretraining and fine-tuning stages. During pretraining, we leverage the trained generator to directly create Modification Text-oriented Synthetic Triplets(MTST) conditioned on pairs of images. For fine-tuning, we first synthesize reverse modification text to connect the target image back to the reference image. Subsequently, we devise a two-hop alignment strategy to incrementally close the semantic gap between the multimodal pair and the target image. We initially learn an implicit prototype utilizing both the original triplet and its reversed version in a cycle manner, followed by combining the implicit prototype feature with the modification text to facilitate accurate alignment with the target image. Extensive experiments validate the efficacy of the generated triplets and confirm that our proposed methodology attains competitive recall on both the CIRR and FashionIQ benchmarks.</description>

      <title>On Synthesizing Data for Context Attribution in Question Answering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Question Answering (QA) accounts for a significant portion of LLM usage "in the wild". However, LLMs sometimes produce false or misleading responses, also known as "hallucinations". Therefore, grounding the generated answers in contextually provided information -- i.e., providing evidence for the generated text -- is paramount for LLMs' trustworthiness. Providing this information is the task of context attribution. In this paper, we systematically study LLM-based approaches for this task, namely we investigate (i) zero-shot inference, (ii) LLM ensembling, and (iii) fine-tuning of small LMs on synthetic data generated by larger LLMs. Our key contribution is SynQA: a novel generative strategy for synthesizing context attribution data. Given selected context sentences, an LLM generates QA pairs that are supported by these sentences. This leverages LLMs' natural strengths in text generation while ensuring clear attribution paths in the synthetic training data. We show that the attribution data synthesized via SynQA is highly effective for fine-tuning small LMs for context attribution in different QA tasks and domains. Finally, with a user study, we validate the usefulness of small LMs (fine-tuned on synthetic data from SynQA) in context attribution for QA.</description>

      <title>Efficient Multi-Task Learning via Generalist Recommender</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) is a common machine learning technique that allows the model to share information across different tasks and improve the accuracy of recommendations for all of them. Many existing MTL implementations suffer from scalability issues as the training and inference performance can degrade with the increasing number of tasks, which can limit production use case scenarios for MTL-based recommender systems. Inspired by the recent advances of large language models, we developed an end-to-end efficient and scalable Generalist Recommender (GRec). GRec takes comprehensive data signals by utilizing NLP heads, parallel Transformers, as well as a wide and deep structure to process multi-modal inputs. These inputs are then combined and fed through a newly proposed task-sentence level routing mechanism to scale the model capabilities on multiple tasks without compromising performance. Offline evaluations and online experiments show that GRec significantly outperforms our previous recommender solutions. GRec has been successfully deployed on one of the largest telecom websites and apps, effectively managing high volumes of online traffic every day.</description>

      <title>Predictive Modeling: BIM Command Recommendation Based on Large-scale Usage Logs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The adoption of Building Information Modeling (BIM) and model-based design within the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) industry has been hindered by the perception that using BIM authoring tools demands more effort than conventional 2D drafting. To enhance design efficiency, this paper proposes a BIM command recommendation framework that predicts the optimal next actions in real-time based on users' historical interactions. We propose a comprehensive filtering and enhancement method for large-scale raw BIM log data and introduce a novel command recommendation model. Our model builds upon the state-of-the-art Transformer backbones originally developed for large language models (LLMs), incorporating a custom feature fusion module, dedicated loss function, and targeted learning strategy. In a case study, the proposed method is applied to over 32 billion rows of real-world log data collected globally from the BIM authoring software Vectorworks. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can learn universal and generalizable modeling patterns from anonymous user interaction sequences across different countries, disciplines, and projects. When generating recommendations for the next command, our approach achieves a Recall@10 of approximately 84%.</description>

      <title>VALUE: Value-Aware Large Language Model for Query Rewriting via Weighted Trie in Sponsored Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the realm of sponsored search advertising, matching advertisements with the search intent of a user's query is crucial. Query-to-bidwords(i.e. bidding keywords) rewriting is a vital technique that has garnered significant attention. Recently, with the prevalence of LLMs, generative retrieval methods have proven effective in producing high-relevance rewrites. However, we have identified a significant limitation in existing approaches: While fine-tuning LLMs for specific domains enhances semantic relevance, these models have no perception of the intrinsic value of their generated outputs, such as commercial value. Therefore, after SFT, a RLHF phase is often employed to address this issue. Nevertheless, traditional preference alignment methods often face challenges in aligning fine-grained values and are susceptible to overfitting, which diminishes the effectiveness and quality of the generated results. To address these challenges, we propose VALUE(Value-Aware Large language model for qUery rewriting via wEighted trie), the first framework that ensures the generation of high-value and highly relevant bidwords. Our approach utilizes weighted trie, an innovative modification of the traditional trie data structure. By modulating the LLM's output probability distribution with value information from the trie during decoding process, we constrain the generation space and guide the trajectory of text production. Offline experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in semantic matching and preference alignment, showing a remarkable improvement in the value attribute by more than fivefold. Online A/B tests further revealed that our Revenue Per Mille (RPM) metric increased by 1.64%. VALUE has been deployed on our advertising system since October 2024 and served the Double Eleven promotions, the biggest shopping carnival in China.</description>

      <title>Multi-Perspective Attention Mechanism for Bias-Aware Sequential Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the era of advancing information technology, recommender systems have emerged as crucial tools for dealing with information overload. However, traditional recommender systems still have limitations in capturing the dynamic evolution of user behavior. To better understand and predict user behavior, especially taking into account the complexity of temporal evolution, sequential recommender systems have gradually become the focus of research. Currently, many sequential recommendation algorithms ignore the amplification effects of prevalent biases, which leads to recommendation results being susceptible to the Matthew Effect. Additionally, it will impose limitations on the recommender system's ability to deeply perceive and capture the dynamic shifts in user preferences, thereby diminishing the extent of its recommendation reach. To address this issue effectively, we propose a recommendation system based on sequential information and attention mechanism called Multi-Perspective Attention Bias Sequential Recommendation (MABSRec). Firstly, we reconstruct user sequences into three short types and utilize graph neural networks for item weighting. Subsequently, an adaptive multi-bias perspective attention module is proposed to enhance the accuracy of recommendations. Experimental results show that the MABSRec model exhibits significant advantages in all evaluation metrics, demonstrating its excellent performance in the sequence recommendation task.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Retrieval for Hallucination Mitigation in Large Language Models: A Comparative Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in language comprehension and generation but are prone to hallucinations, producing factually incorrect or unsupported outputs. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems address this issue by grounding LLM responses with external knowledge. This study evaluates the relationship between retriever effectiveness and hallucination reduction in LLMs using three retrieval approaches: sparse retrieval based on BM25 keyword search, dense retrieval using semantic search with Sentence Transformers, and a proposed hybrid retrieval module. The hybrid module incorporates query expansion and combines the results of sparse and dense retrievers through a dynamically weighted Reciprocal Rank Fusion score. Using the HaluBench dataset, a benchmark for hallucinations in question answering tasks, we assess retrieval performance with metrics such as mean average precision and normalised discounted cumulative gain, focusing on the relevance of the top three retrieved documents. Results show that the hybrid retriever achieves better relevance scores, outperforming both sparse and dense retrievers. Further evaluation of LLM-generated answers against ground truth using metrics such as accuracy, hallucination rate, and rejection rate reveals that the hybrid retriever achieves the highest accuracy on fails, the lowest hallucination rate, and the lowest rejection rate. These findings highlight the hybrid retriever's ability to enhance retrieval relevance, reduce hallucination rates, and improve LLM reliability, emphasising the importance of advanced retrieval techniques in mitigating hallucinations and improving response accuracy.</description>

      <title>Unequal Opportunities: Examining the Bias in Geographical Recommendations by Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have made them a popular information-seeking tool among end users. However, the statistical training methods for LLMs have raised concerns about their representation of under-represented topics, potentially leading to biases that could influence real-world decisions and opportunities. These biases could have significant economic, social, and cultural impacts as LLMs become more prevalent, whether through direct interactions--such as when users engage with chatbots or automated assistants--or through their integration into third-party applications (as agents), where the models influence decision-making processes and functionalities behind the scenes. Our study examines the biases present in LLMs recommendations of U.S. cities and towns across three domains: relocation, tourism, and starting a business. We explore two key research questions: (i) How similar LLMs responses are, and (ii) How this similarity might favor areas with certain characteristics over others, introducing biases. We focus on the consistency of LLMs responses and their tendency to over-represent or under-represent specific locations. Our findings point to consistent demographic biases in these recommendations, which could perpetuate a ``rich-get-richer'' effect that widens existing economic disparities.</description>

      <title>Not someone, but something: Rethinking trust in the age of medical AI</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes embedded in healthcare, trust in medical decision-making is changing fast. This opinion paper argues that trust in AI isn't a simple transfer from humans to machines -- it's a dynamic, evolving relationship that must be built and maintained. Rather than debating whether AI belongs in medicine, this paper asks: what kind of trust must AI earn, and how? Drawing from philosophy, bioethics, and system design, it explores the key differences between human trust and machine reliability -- emphasizing transparency, accountability, and alignment with the values of care. It argues that trust in AI shouldn't rely on mimicking empathy or intuition, but on thoughtful design, responsible deployment, and clear moral responsibility. The goal is a balanced view -- one that avoids blind optimism and reflexive fear. Trust in AI must be treated not as a given, but as something to be earned over time.</description>

      <title>When is using AI the rational choice? The importance of counterfactuals in AI deployment decisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decisions to deploy AI capabilities are often driven by counterfactuals - a comparison of decisions made using AI to decisions that would have been made if the AI were not used. Counterfactual misses, which are poor decisions that are attributable to using AI, may have disproportionate disutility to AI deployment decision makers. Counterfactual hits, which are good decisions attributable to AI usage, may provide little benefit beyond the benefit of better decisions. This paper explores how to include counterfactual outcomes into usage decision expected utility assessments. Several properties emerge when counterfactuals are explicitly included. First, there are many contexts where the expected utility of AI usage is positive for intended beneficiaries and strongly negative for stakeholders and deployment decision makers. Second, high levels of complementarity, where differing AI and user assessments are merged beneficially, often leads to substantial disutility for stakeholders. Third, apparently small changes in how users interact with an AI capability can substantially impact stakeholder utility. Fourth, cognitive biases such as expert overconfidence and hindsight bias exacerbate the perceived frequency of costly counterfactual misses. The expected utility assessment approach presented here is intended to help AI developers and deployment decision makers to navigate the subtle but substantial impact of counterfactuals so as to better ensure that beneficial AI capabilities are used.</description>

      <title>Level Generation with Constrained Expressive Range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Expressive range analysis is a visualization-based technique used to evaluate the performance of generative models, particularly in game level generation. It typically employs two quantifiable metrics to position generated artifacts on a 2D plot, offering insight into how content is distributed within a defined metric space. In this work, we use the expressive range of a generator as the conceptual space of possible creations. Inspired by the quality diversity paradigm, we explore this space to generate levels. To do so, we use a constraint-based generator that systematically traverses and generates levels in this space. To train the constraint-based generator we use different tile patterns to learn from the initial example levels. We analyze how different patterns influence the exploration of the expressive range. Specifically, we compare the exploration process based on time, the number of successful and failed sample generations, and the overall interestingness of the generated levels. Unlike typical quality diversity approaches that rely on random generation and hope to get good coverage of the expressive range, this approach systematically traverses the grid ensuring more coverage. This helps create unique and interesting game levels while also improving our understanding of the generator's strengths and limitations.</description>

      <title>Improving Early Prediction of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus with ECG-DiaNet: A Multimodal Neural Network Leveraging Electrocardiogram and Clinical Risk Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) remains a global health challenge, underscoring the need for early and accurate risk prediction. This study presents ECG-DiaNet, a multimodal deep learning model that integrates electrocardiogram (ECG) features with clinical risk factors (CRFs) to enhance T2DM onset prediction. Using data from Qatar Biobank (QBB), we trained and validated models on a development cohort (n=2043) and evaluated performance on a longitudinal test set (n=395) with five-year follow-up. ECG-DiaNet outperformed unimodal ECG-only and CRF-only models, achieving a higher AUROC (0.845 vs 0.8217) than the CRF-only model, with statistical significance (DeLong p&lt;0.001). Reclassification metrics further confirmed improvements: Net Reclassification Improvement (NRI=0.0153) and Integrated Discrimination Improvement (IDI=0.0482). Risk stratification into low-, medium-, and high-risk groups showed ECG-DiaNet achieved superior positive predictive value (PPV) in high-risk individuals. The model's reliance on non-invasive and widely available ECG signals supports its feasibility in clinical and community health settings. By combining cardiac electrophysiology and systemic risk profiles, ECG-DiaNet addresses the multifactorial nature of T2DM and supports precision prevention. These findings highlight the value of multimodal AI in advancing early detection and prevention strategies for T2DM, particularly in underrepresented Middle Eastern populations.</description>

Abstract: Three-factor learning rules in Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have emerged as a crucial extension to traditional Hebbian learning and Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity (STDP), incorporating neuromodulatory signals to improve adaptation and learning efficiency. These mechanisms enhance biological plausibility and facilitate improved credit assignment in artificial neural systems. This paper takes a view on this topic from a machine learning perspective, providing an overview of recent advances in three-factor learning, discusses theoretical foundations, algorithmic implementations, and their relevance to reinforcement learning and neuromorphic computing. In addition, we explore interdisciplinary approaches, scalability challenges, and potential applications in robotics, cognitive modeling, and AI systems. Finally, we highlight key research gaps and propose future directions for bridging the gap between neuroscience and artificial intelligence.</description>

      <title>MASS: MoErging through Adaptive Subspace Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Model merging has recently emerged as a lightweight alternative to ensembling, combining multiple fine-tuned models into a single set of parameters with no additional training overhead. Yet, existing merging methods fall short of matching the full accuracy of separately fine-tuned endpoints. We present MASS (MoErging through Adaptive Subspace Selection), a new approach that closes this gap by unifying multiple fine-tuned models while retaining near state-of-the-art performance across tasks. Building on the low-rank decomposition of per-task updates, MASS stores only the most salient singular components for each task and merges them into a shared model. At inference time, a non-parametric, data-free router identifies which subspace (or combination thereof) best explains an input's intermediate features and activates the corresponding task-specific block. This procedure is fully training-free and introduces only a two-pass inference overhead plus a ~2 storage factor compared to a single pretrained model, irrespective of the number of tasks. We evaluate MASS on CLIP-based image classification using ViT-B-16, ViT-B-32 and ViT-L-14 for benchmarks of 8, 14 and 20 tasks respectively, establishing a new state-of-the-art. Most notably, MASS recovers up to ~98% of the average accuracy of individual fine-tuned models, making it a practical alternative to ensembling at a fraction of the storage cost.</description>

      <title>AROMA: Autonomous Rank-one Matrix Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As large language models continue to grow in size, parameter-efficient fine-tuning has become increasingly crucial. While low-rank adaptation (LoRA) offers a solution through low-rank updates, its static rank allocation may yield suboptimal results. Adaptive low-rank adaptation (AdaLoRA) improves this with dynamic allocation but remains sensitive to initial and target rank configurations. We introduce AROMA, a framework that automatically constructs layer-specific updates by iteratively building up rank-one components with very few trainable parameters that gradually diminish to zero. Unlike existing methods that employ rank reduction mechanisms, AROMA introduces a dual-loop architecture for rank growth. The inner loop extracts information from each rank-one subspace, while the outer loop determines the number of rank-one subspaces, i.e., the optimal rank. We reset optimizer states to maintain subspace independence. AROMA significantly reduces parameters compared to LoRA and AdaLoRA while achieving superior performance on natural language understanding and commonsense reasoning tasks, offering new insights into adaptive parameter-efficient fine-tuning. The code is available at \href{https://github.com/ShuDun23/AROMA}{AROMA}.</description>

Abstract: Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) are predominantly tailored for graphs displaying homophily, where similar nodes connect, but often fail on heterophilic graphs. The strategy of adopting distinct approaches to learn from homophilic and heterophilic components in node-level tasks has been widely discussed and proven effective both theoretically and experimentally. However, in graph-level tasks, research on this topic remains notably scarce. Addressing this gap, our research conducts an analysis on graphs with nodes' category ID available, distinguishing intra-category and inter-category components as embodiment of homophily and heterophily, respectively. We find while GCNs excel at extracting information within categories, they frequently capture noise from inter-category components. Consequently, it is crucial to employ distinct learning strategies for intra- and inter-category elements. To alleviate this problem, we separately learn the intra- and inter-category parts by a combination of an intra-category convolution (IntraNet) and an inter-category high-pass graph convolution (InterNet). Our IntraNet is supported by sophisticated graph preprocessing steps and a novel category-based graph readout function. For the InterNet, we utilize a high-pass filter to amplify the node disparities, enhancing the recognition of details in the high-frequency components. The proposed approach, DivGNN, combines the IntraNet and InterNet with a gated mechanism and substantially improves classification performance on graph-level tasks, surpassing traditional GNN baselines in effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Thanos: A Block-wise Pruning Algorithm for Efficient Large Language Model Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents Thanos, a novel weight-pruning algorithm designed to reduce the memory footprint and enhance the computational efficiency of large language models (LLMs) by removing redundant weights while maintaining accuracy. Thanos introduces a block-wise pruning strategy with adaptive masks that dynamically adjust to weight importance, enabling flexible sparsity patterns and structured formats, such as $n:m$ sparsity, optimized for hardware acceleration. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that Thanos achieves state-of-the-art performance in structured pruning and outperforms existing methods in unstructured pruning. By providing an efficient and adaptable approach to model compression, Thanos offers a practical solution for deploying large models in resource-constrained environments.</description>

      <title>Hyperflows: Pruning Reveals the Importance of Weights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Network pruning is used to reduce inference latency and power consumption in large neural networks. However, most existing methods struggle to accurately assess the importance of individual weights due to their inherent interrelatedness, leading to poor performance, especially at extreme sparsity levels. We introduce Hyperflows, a dynamic pruning approach that estimates each weight's importance by observing the network's gradient response to the weight's removal. A global pressure term continuously drives all weights toward pruning, with those critical for accuracy being automatically regrown based on their flow, the aggregated gradient signal when they are absent. We explore the relationship between final sparsity and pressure, deriving power-law equations similar to those found in neural scaling laws. Empirically, we demonstrate state-of-the-art results with ResNet-50 and VGG-19 on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100.</description>

      <title>Non-linear Phillips Curve for India: Evidence from Explainable Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The conventional linear Phillips curve model, while widely used in policymaking, often struggles to deliver accurate forecasts in the presence of structural breaks and inherent nonlinearities. This paper addresses these limitations by leveraging machine learning methods within a New Keynesian Phillips Curve framework to forecast and explain headline inflation in India, a major emerging economy. Our analysis demonstrates that machine learning-based approaches significantly outperform standard linear models in forecasting accuracy. Moreover, by employing explainable machine learning techniques, we reveal that the Phillips curve relationship in India is highly nonlinear, characterized by thresholds and interaction effects among key variables. Headline inflation is primarily driven by inflation expectations, followed by past inflation and the output gap, while supply shocks, except rainfall, exert only a marginal influence. These findings highlight the ability of machine learning models to improve forecast accuracy and uncover complex, nonlinear dynamics in inflation data, offering valuable insights for policymakers.</description>

      <title>Achieving binary weight and activation for LLMs using Post-Training Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantizing large language models (LLMs) to 1-bit precision significantly reduces computational costs, but existing quantization techniques suffer from noticeable performance degradation when using weight and activation precisions below 4 bits (W4A4). In this paper, we propose a post-training quantization framework with W(1+1)A(1*4) configuration, where weights are quantized to 1 bit with an additional 1 bit for fine-grain grouping and activations are quantized to 1 bit with a 4-fold increase in the number of channels. For weight quantization, we propose utilizing Hessian-aware fine-grained grouping along with an EM-based quantization scheme. For activation quantization, we decompose INT4-quantized activations into a 4 * INT1 format equivalently and simultaneously smooth the scaling factors based on quantization errors, which further reduces the quantization errors in activations. Our method surpasses state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLM quantization baselines on W2A4 across multiple tasks, pushing the boundaries of existing LLM quantization methods toward fully binarized models.</description>

      <title>DyTTP: Trajectory Prediction with Normalization-Free Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate trajectory prediction is a cornerstone for the safe operation of autonomous driving systems, where understanding the dynamic behavior of surrounding agents is crucial. Transformer-based architectures have demonstrated significant promise in capturing complex spatio-temporality dependencies. However, their reliance on normalization layers can lead to computation overhead and training instabilities. In this work, we present a two-fold approach to address these challenges. First, we integrate DynamicTanh (DyT), which is the latest method to promote transformers, into the backbone, replacing traditional layer normalization. This modification simplifies the network architecture and improves the stability of the inference. We are the first work to deploy the DyT to the trajectory prediction task. Complementing this, we employ a snapshot ensemble strategy to further boost trajectory prediction performance. Using cyclical learning rate scheduling, multiple model snapshots are captured during a single training run. These snapshots are then aggregated via simple averaging at inference time, allowing the model to benefit from diverse hypotheses without incurring substantial additional computational cost. Extensive experiments on Argoverse datasets demonstrate that our combined approach significantly improves prediction accuracy, inference speed and robustness in diverse driving scenarios. This work underscores the potential of normalization-free transformer designs augmented with lightweight ensemble techniques in advancing trajectory forecasting for autonomous vehicles.</description>

      <title>Find A Winning Sign: Sign Is All We Need to Win the Lottery</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (LTH) posits the existence of a sparse subnetwork (a.k.a. winning ticket) that can generalize comparably to its over-parameterized counterpart when trained from scratch. The common approach to finding a winning ticket is to preserve the original strong generalization through Iterative Pruning (IP) and transfer information useful for achieving the learned generalization by applying the resulting sparse mask to an untrained network. However, existing IP methods still struggle to generalize their observations beyond ad-hoc initialization and small-scale architectures or datasets, or they bypass these challenges by applying their mask to trained weights instead of initialized ones. In this paper, we demonstrate that the parameter sign configuration plays a crucial role in conveying useful information for generalization to any randomly initialized network. Through linear mode connectivity analysis, we observe that a sparse network trained by an existing IP method can retain its basin of attraction if its parameter signs and normalization layer parameters are preserved. To take a step closer to finding a winning ticket, we alleviate the reliance on normalization layer parameters by preventing high error barriers along the linear path between the sparse network trained by our method and its counterpart with initialized normalization layer parameters. Interestingly, across various architectures and datasets, we observe that any randomly initialized network can be optimized to exhibit low error barriers along the linear path to the sparse network trained by our method by inheriting its sparsity and parameter sign information, potentially achieving performance comparable to the original.

Abstract: The use of AI in legal analysis and prediction (LegalAI) has gained widespread attention, with past research focusing on retrieval-based methods and fine-tuning large models. However, these approaches often require large datasets and underutilize the capabilities of modern large language models (LLMs). In this paper, inspired by the debate phase of real courtroom trials, we propose a novel legal judgment prediction model based on the Debate-Feedback architecture, which integrates LLM multi-agent debate and reliability evaluation models. Unlike traditional methods, our model achieves significant improvements in efficiency by minimizing the need for large historical datasets, thus offering a lightweight yet robust solution. Comparative experiments show that it outperforms several general-purpose and domain-specific legal models, offering a dynamic reasoning process and a promising direction for future LegalAI research.</description>

      <title>Of All StrIPEs: Investigating Structure-informed Positional Encoding for Efficient Music Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While music remains a challenging domain for generative models like Transformers, a two-pronged approach has recently proved successful: inserting musically-relevant structural information into the positional encoding (PE) module and using kernel approximation techniques based on Random Fourier Features (RFF) to lower the computational cost from quadratic to linear. Yet, it is not clear how such RFF-based efficient PEs compare with those based on rotation matrices, such as Rotary Positional Encoding (RoPE). In this paper, we present a unified framework based on kernel methods to analyze both families of efficient PEs. We use this framework to develop a novel PE method called RoPEPool, capable of extracting causal relationships from temporal sequences. Using RFF-based PEs and rotation-based PEs, we demonstrate how seemingly disparate PEs can be jointly studied by considering the content-context interactions they induce. For empirical validation, we use a symbolic music generation task, namely, melody harmonization. We show that RoPEPool, combined with highly-informative structural priors, outperforms all methods.</description>

      <title>A Nature-Inspired Colony of Artificial Intelligence System with Fast, Detailed, and Organized Learner Agents for Enhancing Diversity and Quality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The concepts of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and multi-agent systems are two important areas of research in artificial intelligence (AI). In this paper, we present an approach that builds a CNN-based colony of AI agents to serve as a single system and perform multiple tasks (e.g., predictions or classifications) in an environment. The proposed system impersonates the natural environment of a biological system, like an ant colony or a human colony. The proposed colony of AI that is defined as a role-based system uniquely contributes to accomplish tasks in an environment by incorporating AI agents that are fast learners, detailed learners, and organized learners. These learners can enhance their localized learning and their collective decisions as a single system of colony of AI agents. This approach also enhances the diversity and quality of the colony of AI with the help of Genetic Algorithms and their crossover and mutation mechanisms. The evolution of fast, detailed, and organized learners in the colony of AI is achieved by introducing a unique one-to-one mapping between these learners and the pretrained VGG16, VGG19, and ResNet50 models, respectively. This role-based approach creates two parent-AI agents using the AI models through the processes, called the intra- and inter-marriage of AI, so that they can share their learned knowledge (weights and biases) based on a probabilistic rule and produce diversified child-AI agents to perform new tasks. This process will form a colony of AI that consists of families of multi-model and mixture-model AI agents to improve diversity and quality. Simulations show that the colony of AI, built using the VGG16, VGG19, and ResNet50 models, can provide a single system that generates child-AI agents of excellent predictive performance, ranging between 82% and 95% of F1-scores, to make diversified collective and quality decisions on a task.</description>

      <title>GARF: Learning Generalizable 3D Reassembly for Real-World Fractures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 3D reassembly is a challenging spatial intelligence task with broad applications across scientific domains. While large-scale synthetic datasets have fueled promising learning-based approaches, their generalizability to different domains is limited. Critically, it remains uncertain whether models trained on synthetic datasets can generalize to real-world fractures where breakage patterns are more complex. To bridge this gap, we propose GARF, a generalizable 3D reassembly framework for real-world fractures. GARF leverages fracture-aware pretraining to learn fracture features from individual fragments, with flow matching enabling precise 6-DoF alignments. At inference time, we introduce one-step preassembly, improving robustness to unseen objects and varying numbers of fractures. In collaboration with archaeologists, paleoanthropologists, and ornithologists, we curate Fractura, a diverse dataset for vision and learning communities, featuring real-world fracture types across ceramics, bones, eggshells, and lithics. Comprehensive experiments have shown our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic and real-world datasets, achieving 82.87\% lower rotation error and 25.15\% higher part accuracy. This sheds light on training on synthetic data to advance real-world 3D puzzle solving, demonstrating its strong generalization across unseen object shapes and diverse fracture types.</description>

      <title>The Role of Environment Access in Agnostic Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study Reinforcement Learning (RL) in environments with large state spaces, where function approximation is required for sample-efficient learning. Departing from a long history of prior work, we consider the weakest possible form of function approximation, called agnostic policy learning, where the learner seeks to find the best policy in a given class $\Pi$, with no guarantee that $\Pi$ contains an optimal policy for the underlying task. Although it is known that sample-efficient agnostic policy learning is not possible in the standard online RL setting without further assumptions, we investigate the extent to which this can be overcome with stronger forms of access to the environment. Specifically, we show that: 1. Agnostic policy learning remains statistically intractable when given access to a local simulator, from which one can reset to any previously seen state. This result holds even when the policy class is realizable, and stands in contrast to a positive result of [MFR24] showing that value-based learning under realizability is tractable with local simulator access. 2. Agnostic policy learning remains statistically intractable when given online access to a reset distribution with good coverage properties over the state space (the so-called $\mu$-reset setting). We also study stronger forms of function approximation for policy learning, showing that PSDP [BKSN03] and CPI [KL02] provably fail in the absence of policy completeness. 3. On a positive note, agnostic policy learning is statistically tractable for Block MDPs with access to both of the above reset models. We establish this via a new algorithm that carefully constructs a policy emulator: a tabular MDP with a small state space that approximates the value functions of all policies $\pi \in \Pi$. These values are approximated without any explicit value function class.</description>

Abstract: Efficient scheduling remains a critical challenge in various domains, requiring solutions to complex NP-hard optimization problems to achieve optimal resource allocation and maximize productivity. In this paper, we introduce a framework called Transformer-Based Task Scheduling System (TRATSS), designed to address the intricacies of single agent scheduling in graph-based environments. By integrating the latest advancements in reinforcement learning and transformer architecture, TRATSS provides a novel system that outputs optimized task scheduling decisions while dynamically adapting to evolving task requirements and resource availability. Leveraging the self-attention mechanism in transformers, TRATSS effectively captures complex task dependencies, thereby providing solutions with enhanced resource utilization and task completion efficiency. Experimental evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate TRATSS's effectiveness in providing high-quality solutions to scheduling problems that involve multiple action profiles.</description>

      <title>SoK: Frontier AI's Impact on the Cybersecurity Landscape</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As frontier AI advances rapidly, understanding its impact on cybersecurity and inherent risks is essential to ensuring safe AI evolution (e.g., guiding risk mitigation and informing policymakers). While some studies review AI applications in cybersecurity, none of them comprehensively discuss AI's future impacts or provide concrete recommendations for navigating its safe and secure usage. This paper presents an in-depth analysis of frontier AI's impact on cybersecurity and establishes a systematic framework for risk assessment and mitigation. To this end, we first define and categorize the marginal risks of frontier AI in cybersecurity and then systemically analyze the current and future impacts of frontier AI in cybersecurity, qualitatively and quantitatively. We also discuss why frontier AI likely benefits attackers more than defenders in the short term from equivalence classes, asymmetry, and economic impact. Next, we explore frontier AI's impact on future software system development, including enabling complex hybrid systems while introducing new risks. Based on our findings, we provide security recommendations, including constructing fine-grained benchmarks for risk assessment, designing AI agents for defenses, building security mechanisms and provable defenses for hybrid systems, enhancing pre-deployment security testing and transparency, and strengthening defenses for users. Finally, we present long-term research questions essential for understanding AI's future impacts and unleashing its defensive capabilities.</description>

      <title>Fast Controlled Generation from Language Models with Adaptive Weighted Rejection Sampling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dominant approach to generating from language models subject to some constraint is locally constrained decoding (LCD), incrementally sampling tokens at each time step such that the constraint is never violated. Typically, this is achieved through token masking: looping over the vocabulary and excluding non-conforming tokens. There are two important problems with this approach. (i) Evaluating the constraint on every token can be prohibitively expensive -- LM vocabularies often exceed $100,000$ tokens. (ii) LCD can distort the global distribution over strings, sampling tokens based only on local information, even if they lead down dead-end paths. This work introduces a new algorithm that addresses both these problems. First, to avoid evaluating a constraint on the full vocabulary at each step of generation, we propose an adaptive rejection sampling algorithm that typically requires orders of magnitude fewer constraint evaluations. Second, we show how this algorithm can be extended to produce low-variance, unbiased estimates of importance weights at a very small additional cost -- estimates that can be soundly used within previously proposed sequential Monte Carlo algorithms to correct for the myopic behavior of local constraint enforcement. Through extensive empirical evaluation in text-to-SQL, molecular synthesis, goal inference, pattern matching, and JSON domains, we show that our approach is superior to state-of-the-art baselines, supporting a broader class of constraints and improving both runtime and performance. Additional theoretical and empirical analyses show that our method's runtime efficiency is driven by its dynamic use of computation, scaling with the divergence between the unconstrained and constrained LM, and as a consequence, runtime improvements are greater for better models.</description>

      <title>PreSumm: Predicting Summarization Performance Without Summarizing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite recent advancements in automatic summarization, state-of-the-art models do not summarize all documents equally well, raising the question: why? While prior research has extensively analyzed summarization models, little attention has been given to the role of document characteristics in influencing summarization performance. In this work, we explore two key research questions. First, do documents exhibit consistent summarization quality across multiple systems? If so, can we predict a document's summarization performance without generating a summary? We answer both questions affirmatively and introduce PreSumm, a novel task in which a system predicts summarization performance based solely on the source document. Our analysis sheds light on common properties of documents with low PreSumm scores, revealing that they often suffer from coherence issues, complex content, or a lack of a clear main theme. In addition, we demonstrate PreSumm's practical utility in two key applications: improving hybrid summarization workflows by identifying documents that require manual summarization and enhancing dataset quality by filtering outliers and noisy documents. Overall, our findings highlight the critical role of document properties in summarization performance and offer insights into the limitations of current systems that could serve as the basis for future improvements.</description>

      <title>Safe Automated Refactoring for Efficient Migration of Imperative Deep Learning Programs to Graph Execution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficiency is essential to support responsiveness w.r.t. ever-growing datasets, especially for Deep Learning (DL) systems. DL frameworks have traditionally embraced deferred execution-style DL code -- supporting symbolic, graph-based Deep Neural Network (DNN) computation. While scalable, such development is error-prone, non-intuitive, and difficult to debug. Consequently, more natural, imperative DL frameworks encouraging eager execution have emerged at the expense of run-time performance. Though hybrid approaches aim for the "best of both worlds," using them effectively requires subtle considerations to make code amenable to safe, accurate, and efficient graph execution. We present an automated refactoring approach that assists developers in specifying whether their otherwise eagerly-executed imperative DL code could be reliably and efficiently executed as graphs while preserving semantics. The approach, based on a novel imperative tensor analysis, automatically determines when it is safe and potentially advantageous to migrate imperative DL code to graph execution. The approach is implemented as a PyDev Eclipse IDE plug-in that integrates the WALA Ariadne analysis framework and evaluated on 19 Python projects consisting of 132.05 KLOC. We found that 326 of 766 candidate functions (42.56%) were refactorable, and an average speedup of 2.16 on performance tests was observed. The results indicate that the approach is useful in optimizing imperative DL code to its full potential.</description>

      <title>A Behavior-Based Knowledge Representation Improves Prediction of Players' Moves in Chess by 25%</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting player behavior in strategic games, especially complex ones like chess, presents a significant challenge. The difficulty arises from several factors. First, the sheer number of potential outcomes stemming from even a single position, starting from the initial setup, makes forecasting a player's next move incredibly complex. Second, and perhaps even more challenging, is the inherent unpredictability of human behavior. Unlike the optimized play of engines, humans introduce a layer of variability due to differing playing styles and decision-making processes. Each player approaches the game with a unique blend of strategic thinking, tactical awareness, and psychological tendencies, leading to diverse and often unexpected actions. This stylistic variation, combined with the capacity for creativity and even irrational moves, makes predicting human play difficult. Chess, a longstanding benchmark of artificial intelligence research, has seen significant advancements in tools and automation. Engines like Deep Blue, AlphaZero, and Stockfish can defeat even the most skilled human players. However, despite their exceptional ability to outplay top-level grandmasters, predicting the moves of non-grandmaster players, who comprise most of the global chess community -- remains complicated for these engines. This paper proposes a novel approach combining expert knowledge with machine learning techniques to predict human players' next moves. By applying feature engineering grounded in domain expertise, we seek to uncover the patterns in the moves of intermediate-level chess players, particularly during the opening phase of the game. Our methodology offers a promising framework for anticipating human behavior, advancing both the fields of AI and human-computer interaction.</description>

      <title>GraphPINE: Graph Importance Propagation for Interpretable Drug Response Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Explainability is necessary for many tasks in biomedical research. Recent explainability methods have focused on attention, gradient, and Shapley value. These do not handle data with strong associated prior knowledge and fail to constrain explainability results based on known relationships between predictive features.
  We propose GraphPINE, a graph neural network (GNN) architecture leveraging domain-specific prior knowledge to initialize node importance optimized during training for drug response prediction. Typically, a manual post-prediction step examines literature (i.e., prior knowledge) to understand returned predictive features. While node importance can be obtained for gradient and attention after prediction, node importance from these methods lacks complementary prior knowledge; GraphPINE seeks to overcome this limitation. GraphPINE differs from other GNN gating methods by utilizing an LSTM-like sequential format. We introduce an importance propagation layer that unifies 1) updates for feature matrix and node importance and 2) uses GNN-based graph propagation of feature values. This initialization and updating mechanism allows for informed feature learning and improved graph representation.
  We apply GraphPINE to cancer drug response prediction using drug screening and gene data collected for over 5,000 gene nodes included in a gene-gene graph with a drug-target interaction (DTI) graph for initial importance. The gene-gene graph and DTIs were obtained from curated sources and weighted by article count discussing relationships between drugs and genes. GraphPINE achieves a PR-AUC of 0.894 and ROC-AUC of 0.796 across 952 drugs. Code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/GraphPINE-40DE.</description>

      <title>Large-Scale Classification of Shortwave Communication Signals with Machine Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a deep learning approach to the classification of 160 shortwave radio signals. It addresses the typical challenges of the shortwave spectrum, which are the large number of different signal types, the presence of various analog modulations and ionospheric propagation. As a classifier a deep convolutional neural network is used, that is trained to recognize 160 typical shortwave signal classes. The approach is blind and therefore does not require preknowledge or special preprocessing of the signal and no manual design of discriminative features for each signal class. The network is trained on a large number of synthetically generated signals and high quality recordings. Finally, the network is evaluated on real-world radio signals obtained from globally deployed receiver hardware and achieves up to 90% accuracy for an observation time of only 1 second.</description>

      <title>Deep Reinforcement Learning Algorithms for Option Hedging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamic hedging is a financial strategy that consists in periodically transacting one or multiple financial assets to offset the risk associated with a correlated liability. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms have been used to find optimal solutions to dynamic hedging problems by framing them as sequential decision-making problems. However, most previous work assesses the performance of only one or two DRL algorithms, making an objective comparison across algorithms difficult. In this paper, we compare the performance of eight DRL algorithms in the context of dynamic hedging; Monte Carlo Policy Gradient (MCPG), Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), along with four variants of Deep Q-Learning (DQL) and two variants of Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG). Two of these variants represent a novel application to the task of dynamic hedging. In our experiments, we use the Black-Scholes delta hedge as a baseline and simulate the dataset using a GJR-GARCH(1,1) model. Results show that MCPG, followed by PPO, obtain the best performance in terms of the root semi-quadratic penalty. Moreover, MCPG is the only algorithm to outperform the Black-Scholes delta hedge baseline with the allotted computational budget, possibly due to the sparsity of rewards in our environment.</description>

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel integration of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhanced Large Language Models (LLMs) with Extended Reality (XR) technologies to address knowledge transfer challenges in industrial environments. The proposed system embeds domain-specific industrial knowledge into XR environments through a natural language interface, enabling hands-free, context-aware expert guidance for workers. We present the architecture of the proposed system consisting of an LLM Chat Engine with dynamic tool orchestration and an XR application featuring voice-driven interaction. Performance evaluation of various chunking strategies, embedding models, and vector databases reveals that semantic chunking, balanced embedding models, and efficient vector stores deliver optimal performance for industrial knowledge retrieval. The system's potential is demonstrated through early implementation in multiple industrial use cases, including robotic assembly, smart infrastructure maintenance, and aerospace component servicing. Results indicate potential for enhancing training efficiency, remote assistance capabilities, and operational guidance in alignment with Industry 5.0's human-centric and resilient approach to industrial development.</description>

      <title>FORCE: Feature-Oriented Representation with Clustering and Explanation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning about underlying patterns in data using latent unobserved structures to improve the accuracy of predictive models has become an active avenue of deep learning research. Most approaches cluster the original features to capture certain latent structures. However, the information gained in the process can often be implicitly derived by sufficiently complex models. Thus, such approaches often provide minimal benefits. We propose a SHAP (Shapley Additive exPlanations) based supervised deep learning framework FORCE which relies on two-stage usage of SHAP values in the neural network architecture, (i) an additional latent feature to guide model training, based on clustering SHAP values, and (ii) initiating an attention mechanism within the architecture using latent information. This approach gives a neural network an indication about the effect of unobserved values that modify feature importance for an observation. The proposed framework is evaluated on three real life datasets. Our results demonstrate that FORCE led to dramatic improvements in overall performance as compared to networks that did not incorporate the latent feature and attention framework (e.g., F1 score for presence of heart disease 0.80 vs 0.72). Using cluster assignments and attention based on SHAP values guides deep learning, enhancing latent pattern learning and overall discriminative capability.</description>

      <title>Towards Efficient Real-Time Video Motion Transfer via Generative Time Series Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a deep learning framework designed to significantly optimize bandwidth for motion-transfer-enabled video applications, including video conferencing, virtual reality interactions, health monitoring systems, and vision-based real-time anomaly detection. To capture complex motion effectively, we utilize the First Order Motion Model (FOMM), which encodes dynamic objects by detecting keypoints and their associated local affine transformations. These keypoints are identified using a self-supervised keypoint detector and arranged into a time series corresponding to the successive frames. Forecasting is performed on these keypoints by integrating two advanced generative time series models into the motion transfer pipeline, namely the Variational Recurrent Neural Network (VRNN) and the Gated Recurrent Unit with Normalizing Flow (GRU-NF). The predicted keypoints are subsequently synthesized into realistic video frames using an optical flow estimator paired with a generator network, thereby facilitating accurate video forecasting and enabling efficient, low-frame-rate video transmission. We validate our results across three datasets for video animation and reconstruction using the following metrics: Mean Absolute Error, Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture Embedding Distance, Structural Similarity Index, and Average Pair-wise Displacement. Our results confirm that by utilizing the superior reconstruction property of the Variational Autoencoder, the VRNN integrated FOMM excels in applications involving multi-step ahead forecasts such as video conferencing. On the other hand, by leveraging the Normalizing Flow architecture for exact likelihood estimation, and enabling efficient latent space sampling, the GRU-NF based FOMM exhibits superior capabilities for producing diverse future samples while maintaining high visual quality for tasks like real-time video-based anomaly detection.</description>

      <title>Path Database Guidance for Motion Planning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One approach to using prior experience in robot motion planning is to store solutions to previously seen problems in a database of paths. Methods that use such databases are characterized by how they query for a path and how they use queries given a new problem. In this work we present a new method, Path Database Guidance (PDG), which innovates on existing work in two ways. First, we use the database to compute a heuristic for determining which nodes of a search tree to expand, in contrast to prior work which generally pastes the (possibly transformed) queried path or uses it to bias a sampling distribution. We demonstrate that this makes our method more easily composable with other search methods by dynamically interleaving exploration according to a baseline algorithm with exploitation of the database guidance. Second, in contrast to other methods that treat the database as a single fixed prior, our database (and thus our queried heuristic) updates as we search the implicitly defined robot configuration space. We experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of PDG in a variety of explicitly defined environment distributions in simulation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) acquire vast knowledge during pre-training, they often lack domain-specific, new, or niche information. Continual pre-training (CPT) attempts to address this gap but suffers from catastrophic forgetting and inefficiencies in low-data regimes. We introduce Knowledge-Instruct, a novel approach to efficiently inject knowledge from limited corpora through pure instruction-tuning. By generating information-dense synthetic instruction data, it effectively integrates new knowledge while preserving general reasoning and instruction-following abilities. Knowledge-Instruct demonstrates superior factual memorization, minimizes catastrophic forgetting, and remains scalable by leveraging synthetic data from relatively small language models. Additionally, it enhances contextual understanding, including complex multi-hop reasoning, facilitating integration with retrieval systems. We validate its effectiveness across diverse benchmarks, including Companies, a new dataset that we release to measure knowledge injection capabilities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nearest neighbour search over dense vector collections has important applications in information retrieval, retrieval augmented generation (RAG), and content ranking. Performing efficient search over large vector collections is a well studied problem with many existing approaches and open source implementations. However, most state-of-the-art systems are generally targeted towards scenarios using large servers with an abundance of memory, static vector collections that are not updatable, and nearest neighbour search in isolation of other search criteria. We present Micro Nearest Neighbour (MicroNN), an embedded nearest-neighbour vector search engine designed for scalable similarity search in low-resource environments. MicroNN addresses the problem of on-device vector search for real-world workloads containing updates and hybrid search queries that combine nearest neighbour search with structured attribute filters. In this scenario, memory is highly constrained and disk-efficient index structures and algorithms are required, as well as support for continuous inserts and deletes. MicroNN is an embeddable library that can scale to large vector collections with minimal resources. MicroNN is used in production and powers a wide range of vector search use-cases on-device. MicroNN takes less than 7 ms to retrieve the top-100 nearest neighbours with 90% recall on publicly available million-scale vector benchmark while using ~10 MB of memory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce SoundVista, a method to generate the ambient sound of an arbitrary scene at novel viewpoints. Given a pre-acquired recording of the scene from sparsely distributed microphones, SoundVista can synthesize the sound of that scene from an unseen target viewpoint. The method learns the underlying acoustic transfer function that relates the signals acquired at the distributed microphones to the signal at the target viewpoint, using a limited number of known recordings. Unlike existing works, our method does not require constraints or prior knowledge of sound source details. Moreover, our method efficiently adapts to diverse room layouts, reference microphone configurations and unseen environments. To enable this, we introduce a visual-acoustic binding module that learns visual embeddings linked with local acoustic properties from panoramic RGB and depth data. We first leverage these embeddings to optimize the placement of reference microphones in any given scene. During synthesis, we leverage multiple embeddings extracted from reference locations to get adaptive weights for their contribution, conditioned on target viewpoint. We benchmark the task on both publicly available data and real-world settings. We demonstrate significant improvements over existing methods.</description>

      <title>TW-CRL: Time-Weighted Contrastive Reward Learning for Efficient Inverse Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Episodic tasks in Reinforcement Learning (RL) often pose challenges due to sparse reward signals and high-dimensional state spaces, which hinder efficient learning. Additionally, these tasks often feature hidden "trap states" -- irreversible failures that prevent task completion but do not provide explicit negative rewards to guide agents away from repeated errors. To address these issues, we propose Time-Weighted Contrastive Reward Learning (TW-CRL), an Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) framework that leverages both successful and failed demonstrations. By incorporating temporal information, TW-CRL learns a dense reward function that identifies critical states associated with success or failure. This approach not only enables agents to avoid trap states but also encourages meaningful exploration beyond simple imitation of expert trajectories. Empirical evaluations on navigation tasks and robotic manipulation benchmarks demonstrate that TW-CRL surpasses state-of-the-art methods, achieving improved efficiency and robustness.</description>

      <title>Finding Fantastic Experts in MoEs: A Unified Study for Expert Dropping Strategies and Observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sparsely activated Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE) has shown promise in scaling up the learning capacity of neural networks. However, vanilla SMoEs have issues such as expert redundancy and heavy memory requirements, making them inefficient and non-scalable, especially for resource-constrained scenarios. Expert-level sparsification of SMoEs involves pruning the least important experts to address these limitations. In this work, we aim to address three questions: (1) What is the best recipe to identify the least knowledgeable subset of experts that can be dropped with minimal impact on performance? (2) How should we perform expert dropping (one-shot or iterative), and what correction measures can we undertake to minimize its drastic impact on SMoE subnetwork capabilities? (3) What capabilities of full-SMoEs are severely impacted by the removal of the least dominant experts, and how can we recover them? Firstly, we propose MoE Experts Compression Suite (MC-Suite), which is a collection of some previously explored and multiple novel recipes to provide a comprehensive benchmark for estimating expert importance from diverse perspectives, as well as unveil numerous valuable insights for SMoE experts. Secondly, unlike prior works with a one-shot expert pruning approach, we explore the benefits of iterative pruning with the re-estimation of the MC-Suite criterion. Moreover, we introduce the benefits of task-agnostic fine-tuning as a correction mechanism during iterative expert dropping, which we term MoE Lottery Subnetworks. Lastly, we present an experimentally validated conjecture that, during expert dropping, SMoEs' instruction-following capabilities are predominantly hurt, which can be restored to a robust level subject to external augmentation of instruction-following capabilities using k-shot examples and supervised fine-tuning.</description>

      <title>Multi-fidelity Reinforcement Learning Control for Complex Dynamical Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Controlling instabilities in complex dynamical systems is challenging in scientific and engineering applications. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has seen promising results for applications in different scientific applications. The many-query nature of control tasks requires multiple interactions with real environments of the underlying physics. However, it is usually sparse to collect from the experiments or expensive to simulate for complex dynamics. Alternatively, controlling surrogate modeling could mitigate the computational cost issue. However, a fast and accurate learning-based model by offline training makes it very hard to get accurate pointwise dynamics when the dynamics are chaotic. To bridge this gap, the current work proposes a multi-fidelity reinforcement learning (MFRL) framework that leverages differentiable hybrid models for control tasks, where a physics-based hybrid model is corrected by limited high-fidelity data. We also proposed a spectrum-based reward function for RL learning. The effect of the proposed framework is demonstrated on two complex dynamics in physics. The statistics of the MFRL control result match that computed from many-query evaluations of the high-fidelity environments and outperform other SOTA baselines.</description>

      <title>Class Imbalance Correction for Improved Universal Lesion Detection and Tagging in CT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radiologists routinely detect and size lesions in CT to stage cancer and assess tumor burden. To potentially aid their efforts, multiple lesion detection algorithms have been developed with a large public dataset called DeepLesion (32,735 lesions, 32,120 CT slices, 10,594 studies, 4,427 patients, 8 body part labels). However, this dataset contains missing measurements and lesion tags, and exhibits a severe imbalance in the number of lesions per label category. In this work, we utilize a limited subset of DeepLesion (6\%, 1331 lesions, 1309 slices) containing lesion annotations and body part label tags to train a VFNet model to detect lesions and tag them. We address the class imbalance by conducting three experiments: 1) Balancing data by the body part labels, 2) Balancing data by the number of lesions per patient, and 3) Balancing data by the lesion size. In contrast to a randomly sampled (unbalanced) data subset, our results indicated that balancing the body part labels always increased sensitivity for lesions &gt;= 1cm for classes with low data quantities (Bone: 80\% vs. 46\%, Kidney: 77\% vs. 61\%, Soft Tissue: 70\% vs. 60\%, Pelvis: 83\% vs. 76\%). Similar trends were seen for three other models tested (FasterRCNN, RetinaNet, FoveaBox). Balancing data by lesion size also helped the VFNet model improve recalls for all classes in contrast to an unbalanced dataset. We also provide a structured reporting guideline for a ``Lesions'' subsection to be entered into the ``Findings'' section of a radiology report. To our knowledge, we are the first to report the class imbalance in DeepLesion, and have taken data-driven steps to address it in the context of joint lesion detection and tagging.</description>

      <title>FactGuard: Leveraging Multi-Agent Systems to Generate Answerable and Unanswerable Questions for Enhanced Long-Context LLM Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extractive reading comprehension systems are designed to locate the correct answer to a question within a given text. However, a persistent challenge lies in ensuring these models maintain high accuracy in answering questions while reliably recognizing unanswerable queries. Despite significant advances in large language models (LLMs) for reading comprehension, this issue remains critical, particularly as the length of supported contexts continues to expand. To address this challenge, we propose an innovative data augmentation methodology grounded in a multi-agent collaborative framework. Unlike traditional methods, such as the costly human annotation process required for datasets like SQuAD 2.0, our method autonomously generates evidence-based question-answer pairs and systematically constructs unanswerable questions. Using this methodology, we developed the FactGuard-Bench dataset, which comprises 25,220 examples of both answerable and unanswerable question scenarios, with context lengths ranging from 8K to 128K. Experimental evaluations conducted on seven popular LLMs reveal that even the most advanced models achieve only 61.79% overall accuracy. Furthermore, we emphasize the importance of a model's ability to reason about unanswerable questions to avoid generating plausible but incorrect answers. By implementing efficient data selection and generation within the multi-agent collaborative framework, our method significantly reduces the traditionally high costs associated with manual annotation and provides valuable insights for the training and optimization of LLMs.</description>

      <title>FedEFC: Federated Learning Using Enhanced Forward Correction Against Noisy Labels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a powerful framework for privacy-preserving distributed learning. It enables multiple clients to collaboratively train a global model without sharing raw data. However, handling noisy labels in FL remains a major challenge due to heterogeneous data distributions and communication constraints, which can severely degrade model performance. To address this issue, we propose FedEFC, a novel method designed to tackle the impact of noisy labels in FL. FedEFC mitigates this issue through two key techniques: (1) prestopping, which prevents overfitting to mislabeled data by dynamically halting training at an optimal point, and (2) loss correction, which adjusts model updates to account for label noise. In particular, we develop an effective loss correction tailored to the unique challenges of FL, including data heterogeneity and decentralized training. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical analysis, leveraging the composite proper loss property, to demonstrate that the FL objective function under noisy label distributions can be aligned with the clean label distribution. Extensive experimental results validate the effectiveness of our approach, showing that it consistently outperforms existing FL techniques in mitigating the impact of noisy labels, particularly under heterogeneous data settings (e.g., achieving up to 41.64% relative performance improvement over the existing loss correction method).</description>

      <title>Technical Report: Full Version of Analyzing and Optimizing Perturbation of DP-SGD Geometrically</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) has become a prevalent privacy model in a wide range of machine learning tasks, especially after the debut of DP-SGD. However, DP-SGD, which directly perturbs gradients in the training iterations, fails to mitigate the negative impacts of noise on gradient direction. As a result, DP-SGD is often inefficient. Although various solutions (e.g., clipping to reduce the sensitivity of gradients and amplifying privacy bounds to save privacy budgets) are proposed to trade privacy for model efficiency, the root cause of its inefficiency is yet unveiled.
  In this work, we first generalize DP-SGD and theoretically derive the impact of DP noise on the training process. Our analysis reveals that, in terms of a perturbed gradient, only the noise on direction has eminent impact on the model efficiency while that on magnitude can be mitigated by optimization techniques, i.e., fine-tuning gradient clipping and learning rate. Besides, we confirm that traditional DP introduces biased noise on the direction when adding unbiased noise to the gradient itself. Overall, the perturbation of DP-SGD is actually sub-optimal from a geometric perspective. Motivated by this, we design a geometric perturbation strategy GeoDP within the DP framework, which perturbs the direction and the magnitude of a gradient, respectively. By directly reducing the noise on the direction, GeoDP mitigates the negative impact of DP noise on model efficiency with the same DP guarantee. Extensive experiments on two public datasets (i.e., MNIST and CIFAR-10), one synthetic dataset and three prevalent models (i.e., Logistic Regression, CNN and ResNet) confirm the effectiveness and generality of our strategy.</description>

      <title>Reasoning Towards Fairness: Mitigating Bias in Language Models through Reasoning-Guided Fine-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in large-scale generative language models have shown that reasoning capabilities can significantly improve model performance across a variety of tasks. However, the impact of reasoning on a model's ability to mitigate stereotypical responses remains largely underexplored. In this work, we investigate the crucial relationship between a model's reasoning ability and fairness, and ask whether improved reasoning capabilities can mitigate harmful stereotypical responses, especially those arising due to shallow or flawed reasoning. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of multiple open-source LLMs, and find that larger models with stronger reasoning abilities exhibit substantially lower stereotypical bias on existing fairness benchmarks. Building on this insight, we introduce ReGiFT -- Reasoning Guided Fine-Tuning, a novel approach that extracts structured reasoning traces from advanced reasoning models and infuses them into models that lack such capabilities. We use only general-purpose reasoning and do not require any fairness-specific supervision for bias mitigation. Notably, we see that models fine-tuned using ReGiFT not only improve fairness relative to their non-reasoning counterparts but also outperform advanced reasoning models on fairness benchmarks. We also analyze how variations in the correctness of the reasoning traces and their length influence model fairness and their overall performance. Our findings highlight that enhancing reasoning capabilities is an effective, fairness-agnostic strategy for mitigating stereotypical bias caused by reasoning flaws.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Long-term investing was previously seen as requiring human judgment. With the advent of generative artificial intelligence (AI) systems, automated systematic long-term investing is now feasible. In this paper, we present DBOT, a system whose goal is to reason about valuation like Aswath Damodaran, who is a unique expert in the investment arena in terms of having published thousands of valuations on companies in addition to his numerous writings on the topic, which provide ready training data for an AI system. DBOT can value any publicly traded company. DBOT can also be back-tested, making its behavior and performance amenable to scientific inquiry. We compare DBOT to its analytic parent, Damodaran, and highlight the research challenges involved in raising its current capability to that of Damodaran's. Finally, we examine the implications of DBOT-like AI agents for the financial industry, especially how they will impact the role of human analysts in valuation.</description>

      <title>Lattice: Learning to Efficiently Compress the Memory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Attention mechanisms have revolutionized sequence learning but suffer from quadratic computational complexity. This paper introduces Lattice, a novel recurrent neural network (RNN) mechanism that leverages the inherent low-rank structure of K-V matrices to efficiently compress the cache into a fixed number of memory slots, achieving sub-quadratic complexity. We formulate this compression as an online optimization problem and derive a dynamic memory update rule based on a single gradient descent step. The resulting recurrence features a state- and input-dependent gating mechanism, offering an interpretable memory update process. The core innovation is the orthogonal update: each memory slot is updated exclusively with information orthogonal to its current state hence incorporation of only novel, non-redundant data, which minimizes the interference with previously stored information. The experimental results show that Lattice achieves the best perplexity compared to all baselines across diverse context lengths, with performance improvement becoming more pronounced as the context length increases.</description>

      <title>Nes2Net: A Lightweight Nested Architecture for Foundation Model Driven Speech Anti-spoofing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speech foundation models have significantly advanced various speech-related tasks by providing exceptional representation capabilities. However, their high-dimensional output features often create a mismatch with downstream task models, which typically require lower-dimensional inputs. A common solution is to apply a dimensionality reduction (DR) layer, but this approach increases parameter overhead, computational costs, and risks losing valuable information. To address these issues, we propose Nested Res2Net (Nes2Net), a lightweight back-end architecture designed to directly process high-dimensional features without DR layers. The nested structure enhances multi-scale feature extraction, improves feature interaction, and preserves high-dimensional information. We first validate Nes2Net on CtrSVDD, a singing voice deepfake detection dataset, and report a 22% performance improvement and an 87% back-end computational cost reduction over the state-of-the-art baseline. Additionally, extensive testing across four diverse datasets: ASVspoof 2021, ASVspoof 5, PartialSpoof, and In-the-Wild, covering fully spoofed speech, adversarial attacks, partial spoofing, and real-world scenarios, consistently highlights Nes2Net's superior robustness and generalization capabilities. The code package and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/Liu-Tianchi/Nes2Net.</description>

      <title>Towards Smarter Hiring: Are Zero-Shot and Few-Shot Pre-trained LLMs Ready for HR Spoken Interview Transcript Analysis?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05683v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This research paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the performance of prominent pre-trained large language models (LLMs), including GPT-4 Turbo, GPT-3.5 Turbo, text-davinci-003, text-babbage-001, text-curie-001, text-ada-001, llama-2-7b-chat, llama-2-13b-chat, and llama-2-70b-chat, in comparison to expert human evaluators in providing scores, identifying errors, and offering feedback and improvement suggestions to candidates during mock HR (Human Resources) interviews. We introduce a dataset called HURIT (Human Resource Interview Transcripts), which comprises 3,890 HR interview transcripts sourced from real-world HR interview scenarios. Our findings reveal that pre-trained LLMs, particularly GPT-4 Turbo and GPT-3.5 Turbo, exhibit commendable performance and are capable of producing evaluations comparable to those of expert human evaluators. Although these LLMs demonstrate proficiency in providing scores comparable to human experts in terms of human evaluation metrics, they frequently fail to identify errors and offer specific actionable advice for candidate performance improvement in HR interviews. Our research suggests that the current state-of-the-art pre-trained LLMs are not fully conducive for automatic deployment in an HR interview assessment. Instead, our findings advocate for a human-in-the-loop approach, to incorporate manual checks for inconsistencies and provisions for improving feedback quality as a more suitable strategy.</description>

      <title>TARO: Timestep-Adaptive Representation Alignment with Onset-Aware Conditioning for Synchronized Video-to-Audio Synthesis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces Timestep-Adaptive Representation Alignment with Onset-Aware Conditioning (TARO), a novel framework for high-fidelity and temporally coherent video-to-audio synthesis. Built upon flow-based transformers, which offer stable training and continuous transformations for enhanced synchronization and audio quality, TARO introduces two key innovations: (1) Timestep-Adaptive Representation Alignment (TRA), which dynamically aligns latent representations by adjusting alignment strength based on the noise schedule, ensuring smooth evolution and improved fidelity, and (2) Onset-Aware Conditioning (OAC), which integrates onset cues that serve as sharp event-driven markers of audio-relevant visual moments to enhance synchronization with dynamic visual events. Extensive experiments on the VGGSound and Landscape datasets demonstrate that TARO outperforms prior methods, achieving relatively 53\% lower Frechet Distance (FD), 29% lower Frechet Audio Distance (FAD), and a 97.19% Alignment Accuracy, highlighting its superior audio quality and synchronization precision.</description>

      <title>kNN-SVC: Robust Zero-Shot Singing Voice Conversion with Additive Synthesis and Concatenation Smoothness Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robustness is critical in zero-shot singing voice conversion (SVC). This paper introduces two novel methods to strengthen the robustness of the kNN-VC framework for SVC. First, kNN-VC's core representation, WavLM, lacks harmonic emphasis, resulting in dull sounds and ringing artifacts. To address this, we leverage the bijection between WavLM, pitch contours, and spectrograms to perform additive synthesis, integrating the resulting waveform into the model to mitigate these issues. Second, kNN-VC overlooks concatenative smoothness, a key perceptual factor in SVC. To enhance smoothness, we propose a new distance metric that filters out unsuitable kNN candidates and optimize the summing weights of the candidates during inference. Although our techniques are built on the kNN-VC framework for implementation convenience, they are broadly applicable to general concatenative neural synthesis models. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of these modifications in achieving robust SVC. Demo: http://knnsvc.com Code: https://github.com/SmoothKen/knn-svc</description>

      <title>STRIVE: A Think &amp; Improve Approach with Iterative Refinement for Enhancing Question Quality Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automatically assessing question quality is crucial for educators as it saves time, ensures consistency, and provides immediate feedback for refining teaching materials. We propose a novel methodology called STRIVE (Structured Thinking and Refinement with multiLLMs for Improving Verified Question Estimation) using a series of Large Language Models (LLMs) for automatic question evaluation. This approach aims to improve the accuracy and depth of question quality assessment, ultimately supporting diverse learners and enhancing educational practices. The method estimates question quality in an automated manner by generating multiple evaluations based on the strengths and weaknesses of the provided question and then choosing the best solution generated by the LLM. Then the process is improved by iterative review and response with another LLM until the evaluation metric values converge. This sophisticated method of evaluating question quality improves the estimation of question quality by automating the task of question quality evaluation. Correlation scores show that using this proposed method helps to improve correlation with human judgments compared to the baseline method. Error analysis shows that metrics like relevance and appropriateness improve significantly relative to human judgments by using STRIVE.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models Enhanced Hyperbolic Space Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have attracted significant attention in recommender systems for their excellent world knowledge capabilities. However, existing methods that rely on Euclidean space struggle to capture the rich hierarchical information inherent in textual and semantic data, which is essential for capturing user preferences. The geometric properties of hyperbolic space offer a promising solution to address this issue. Nevertheless, integrating LLMs-based methods with hyperbolic space to effectively extract and incorporate diverse hierarchical information is non-trivial. To this end, we propose a model-agnostic framework, named HyperLLM, which extracts and integrates hierarchical information from both structural and semantic perspectives. Structurally, HyperLLM uses LLMs to generate multi-level classification tags with hierarchical parent-child relationships for each item. Then, tag-item and user-item interactions are jointly learned and aligned through contrastive learning, thereby providing the model with clear hierarchical information. Semantically, HyperLLM introduces a novel meta-optimized strategy to extract hierarchical information from semantic embeddings and bridge the gap between the semantic and collaborative spaces for seamless integration. Extensive experiments show that HyperLLM significantly outperforms recommender systems based on hyperbolic space and LLMs, achieving performance improvements of over 40%. Furthermore, HyperLLM not only improves recommender performance but also enhances training stability, highlighting the critical role of hierarchical information in recommender systems.</description>

      <title>Architecture independent generalization bounds for overparametrized deep ReLU networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that overparametrized neural networks are able to generalize with a test error that is independent of the level of overparametrization, and independent of the Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) dimension. We prove explicit bounds that only depend on the metric geometry of the test and training sets, on the regularity properties of the activation function, and on the operator norms of the weights and norms of biases. For overparametrized deep ReLU networks with a training sample size bounded by the input space dimension, we explicitly construct zero loss minimizers without use of gradient descent, and prove that the generalization error is independent of the network architecture.</description>

      <title>Rank-Then-Score: Enhancing Large Language Models for Automated Essay Scoring</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) achieve remarkable success across a variety of tasks. However, their potential in the domain of Automated Essay Scoring (AES) remains largely underexplored. Moreover, compared to English data, the methods for Chinese AES is not well developed. In this paper, we propose Rank-Then-Score (RTS), a fine-tuning framework based on large language models to enhance their essay scoring capabilities. Specifically, we fine-tune the ranking model (Ranker) with feature-enriched data, and then feed the output of the ranking model, in the form of a candidate score set, with the essay content into the scoring model (Scorer) to produce the final score. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets, HSK and ASAP, demonstrate that RTS consistently outperforms the direct prompting (Vanilla) method in terms of average QWK across all LLMs and datasets, and achieves the best performance on Chinese essay scoring using the HSK dataset.</description>

      <title>DDT: Decoupled Diffusion Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion transformers have demonstrated remarkable generation quality, albeit requiring longer training iterations and numerous inference steps. In each denoising step, diffusion transformers encode the noisy inputs to extract the lower-frequency semantic component and then decode the higher frequency with identical modules. This scheme creates an inherent optimization dilemma: encoding low-frequency semantics necessitates reducing high-frequency components, creating tension between semantic encoding and high-frequency decoding. To resolve this challenge, we propose a new \textbf{\color{ddt}D}ecoupled \textbf{\color{ddt}D}iffusion \textbf{\color{ddt}T}ransformer~(\textbf{\color{ddt}DDT}), with a decoupled design of a dedicated condition encoder for semantic extraction alongside a specialized velocity decoder. Our experiments reveal that a more substantial encoder yields performance improvements as model size increases. For ImageNet $256\times256$, Our DDT-XL/2 achieves a new state-of-the-art performance of {1.31 FID}~(nearly $4\times$ faster training convergence compared to previous diffusion transformers). For ImageNet $512\times512$, Our DDT-XL/2 achieves a new state-of-the-art FID of 1.28. Additionally, as a beneficial by-product, our decoupled architecture enhances inference speed by enabling the sharing self-condition between adjacent denoising steps. To minimize performance degradation, we propose a novel statistical dynamic programming approach to identify optimal sharing strategies.</description>

      <title>Unraveling Human-AI Teaming: A Review and Outlook</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is advancing at an unprecedented pace, with clear potential to enhance decision-making and productivity. Yet, the collaborative decision-making process between humans and AI remains underdeveloped, often falling short of its transformative possibilities. This paper explores the evolution of AI agents from passive tools to active collaborators in human-AI teams, emphasizing their ability to learn, adapt, and operate autonomously in complex environments. This paradigm shifts challenges traditional team dynamics, requiring new interaction protocols, delegation strategies, and responsibility distribution frameworks. Drawing on Team Situation Awareness (SA) theory, we identify two critical gaps in current human-AI teaming research: the difficulty of aligning AI agents with human values and objectives, and the underutilization of AI's capabilities as genuine team members. Addressing these gaps, we propose a structured research outlook centered on four key aspects of human-AI teaming: formulation, coordination, maintenance, and training. Our framework highlights the importance of shared mental models, trust-building, conflict resolution, and skill adaptation for effective teaming. Furthermore, we discuss the unique challenges posed by varying team compositions, goals, and complexities. This paper provides a foundational agenda for future research and practical design of sustainable, high-performing human-AI teams.</description>

      <title>Temporal Dynamic Embedding for Irregularly Sampled Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In several practical applications, particularly healthcare, clinical data of each patient is individually recorded in a database at irregular intervals as required. This causes a sparse and irregularly sampled time series, which makes it difficult to handle as a structured representation of the prerequisites of neural network models. We therefore propose temporal dynamic embedding (TDE), which enables neural network models to receive data that change the number of variables over time. TDE regards each time series variable as an embedding vector evolving over time, instead of a conventional fixed structured representation, which causes a critical missing problem. For each time step, TDE allows for the selective adoption and aggregation of only observed variable subsets and represents the current status of patient based on current observations. The experiment was conducted on three clinical datasets: PhysioNet 2012, MIMIC-III, and PhysioNet 2019. The TDE model performed competitively or better than the imputation-based baseline and several recent state-of-the-art methods with reduced training runtime.</description>

      <title>A Lightweight Multi-Module Fusion Approach for Korean Character Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05770v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is essential in applications such as document processing, license plate recognition, and intelligent surveillance. However, existing OCR models often underperform in real-world scenarios due to irregular text layouts, poor image quality, character variability, and high computational costs.
  This paper introduces SDA-Net (Stroke-Sensitive Attention and Dynamic Context Encoding Network), a lightweight and efficient architecture designed for robust single-character recognition. SDA-Net incorporates: (1) a Dual Attention Mechanism to enhance stroke-level and spatial feature extraction; (2) a Dynamic Context Encoding module that adaptively refines semantic information using a learnable gating mechanism; (3) a U-Net-inspired Feature Fusion Strategy for combining low-level and high-level features; and (4) a highly optimized lightweight backbone that reduces memory and computational demands.
  Experimental results show that SDA-Net achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on challenging OCR benchmarks, with significantly faster inference, making it well-suited for deployment in real-time and edge-based OCR systems.</description>

      <title>Transferable Mask Transformer: Cross-domain Semantic Segmentation with Region-adaptive Transferability Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05774v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in Vision Transformers (ViTs) have set new benchmarks in semantic segmentation. However, when adapting pretrained ViTs to new target domains, significant performance degradation often occurs due to distribution shifts, resulting in suboptimal global attention. Since self-attention mechanisms are inherently data-driven, they may fail to effectively attend to key objects when source and target domains exhibit differences in texture, scale, or object co-occurrence patterns. While global and patch-level domain adaptation methods provide partial solutions, region-level adaptation with dynamically shaped regions is crucial due to spatial heterogeneity in transferability across different image areas. We present Transferable Mask Transformer (TMT), a novel region-level adaptation framework for semantic segmentation that aligns cross-domain representations through spatial transferability analysis. TMT consists of two key components: (1) An Adaptive Cluster-based Transferability Estimator (ACTE) that dynamically segments images into structurally and semantically coherent regions for localized transferability assessment, and (2) A Transferable Masked Attention (TMA) module that integrates region-specific transferability maps into ViTs' attention mechanisms, prioritizing adaptation in regions with low transferability and high semantic uncertainty. Comprehensive evaluations across 20 cross-domain pairs demonstrate TMT's superiority, achieving an average 2% MIoU improvement over vanilla fine-tuning and a 1.28% increase compared to state-of-the-art baselines. The source code will be publicly available.</description>

      <title>MDK12-Bench: A Multi-Discipline Benchmark for Evaluating Reasoning in Multimodal Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal reasoning, which integrates language and visual cues into problem solving and decision making, is a fundamental aspect of human intelligence and a crucial step toward artificial general intelligence. However, the evaluation of multimodal reasoning capabilities in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) remains inadequate. Most existing reasoning benchmarks are constrained by limited data size, narrow domain coverage, and unstructured knowledge distribution. To close these gaps, we introduce MDK12-Bench, a multi-disciplinary benchmark assessing the reasoning capabilities of MLLMs via real-world K-12 examinations. Spanning six disciplines (math, physics, chemistry, biology, geography, and information science), our benchmark comprises 140K reasoning instances across diverse difficulty levels from primary school to 12th grade. It features 6,827 instance-level knowledge point annotations based on a well-organized knowledge structure, detailed answer explanations, difficulty labels and cross-year partitions, providing a robust platform for comprehensive evaluation. Additionally, we present a novel dynamic evaluation framework to mitigate data contamination issues by bootstrapping question forms, question types, and image styles during evaluation. Extensive experiment on MDK12-Bench reveals the significant limitation of current MLLMs in multimodal reasoning. The findings on our benchmark provide insights into the development of the next-generation models. Our data and codes are available at https://github.com/LanceZPF/MDK12.</description>

      <title>Video Flow as Time Series: Discovering Temporal Consistency and Variability for VideoQA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Video Question Answering (VideoQA) is a complex video-language task that demands a sophisticated understanding of both visual content and temporal dynamics. Traditional Transformer-style architectures, while effective in integrating multimodal data, often simplify temporal dynamics through positional encoding and fail to capture non-linear interactions within video sequences. In this paper, we introduce the Temporal Trio Transformer (T3T), a novel architecture that models time consistency and time variability. The T3T integrates three key components: Temporal Smoothing (TS), Temporal Difference (TD), and Temporal Fusion (TF). The TS module employs Brownian Bridge for capturing smooth, continuous temporal transitions, while the TD module identifies and encodes significant temporal variations and abrupt changes within the video content. Subsequently, the TF module synthesizes these temporal features with textual cues, facilitating a deeper contextual understanding and response accuracy. The efficacy of the T3T is demonstrated through extensive testing on multiple VideoQA benchmark datasets. Our results underscore the importance of a nuanced approach to temporal modeling in improving the accuracy and depth of video-based question answering.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 3D spatial understanding is essential in real-world applications such as robotics, autonomous vehicles, virtual reality, and medical imaging. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs), having demonstrated remarkable success across various domains, have been leveraged to enhance 3D understanding tasks, showing potential to surpass traditional computer vision methods. In this survey, we present a comprehensive review of methods integrating LLMs with 3D spatial understanding. We propose a taxonomy that categorizes existing methods into three branches: image-based methods deriving 3D understanding from 2D visual data, point cloud-based methods working directly with 3D representations, and hybrid modality-based methods combining multiple data streams. We systematically review representative methods along these categories, covering data representations, architectural modifications, and training strategies that bridge textual and 3D modalities. Finally, we discuss current limitations, including dataset scarcity and computational challenges, while highlighting promising research directions in spatial perception, multi-modal fusion, and real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Parasite: A Steganography-based Backdoor Attack Framework for Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, the diffusion model has gained significant attention as one of the most successful image generation models, which can generate high-quality images by iteratively sampling noise. However, recent studies have shown that diffusion models are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, allowing attackers to enter input data containing triggers to activate the backdoor and generate their desired output. Existing backdoor attack methods primarily focused on target noise-to-image and text-to-image tasks, with limited work on backdoor attacks in image-to-image tasks. Furthermore, traditional backdoor attacks often rely on a single, conspicuous trigger to generate a fixed target image, lacking concealability and flexibility. To address these limitations, we propose a novel backdoor attack method called "Parasite" for image-to-image tasks in diffusion models, which not only is the first to leverage steganography for triggers hiding, but also allows attackers to embed the target content as a backdoor trigger to achieve a more flexible attack. "Parasite" as a novel attack method effectively bypasses existing detection frameworks to execute backdoor attacks. In our experiments, "Parasite" achieved a 0 percent backdoor detection rate against the mainstream defense frameworks. In addition, in the ablation study, we discuss the influence of different hiding coefficients on the attack results. You can find our code at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Parasite-1715/.</description>

      <title>Human Activity Recognition using RGB-Event based Sensors: A Multi-modal Heat Conduction Model and A Benchmark Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) primarily relied on traditional RGB cameras to achieve high-performance activity recognition. However, the challenging factors in real-world scenarios, such as insufficient lighting and rapid movements, inevitably degrade the performance of RGB cameras. To address these challenges, biologically inspired event cameras offer a promising solution to overcome the limitations of traditional RGB cameras. In this work, we rethink human activity recognition by combining the RGB and event cameras. The first contribution is the proposed large-scale multi-modal RGB-Event human activity recognition benchmark dataset, termed HARDVS 2.0, which bridges the dataset gaps. It contains 300 categories of everyday real-world actions with a total of 107,646 paired videos covering various challenging scenarios. Inspired by the physics-informed heat conduction model, we propose a novel multi-modal heat conduction operation framework for effective activity recognition, termed MMHCO-HAR. More in detail, given the RGB frames and event streams, we first extract the feature embeddings using a stem network. Then, multi-modal Heat Conduction blocks are designed to fuse the dual features, the key module of which is the multi-modal Heat Conduction Operation layer. We integrate RGB and event embeddings through a multi-modal DCT-IDCT layer while adaptively incorporating the thermal conductivity coefficient via FVEs into this module. After that, we propose an adaptive fusion module based on a policy routing strategy for high-performance classification. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently performs well, validating its effectiveness and robustness.

      <title>Mind the Trojan Horse: Image Prompt Adapter Enabling Scalable and Deceptive Jailbreaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, the Image Prompt Adapter (IP-Adapter) has been increasingly integrated into text-to-image diffusion models (T2I-DMs) to improve controllability. However, in this paper, we reveal that T2I-DMs equipped with the IP-Adapter (T2I-IP-DMs) enable a new jailbreak attack named the hijacking attack. We demonstrate that, by uploading imperceptible image-space adversarial examples (AEs), the adversary can hijack massive benign users to jailbreak an Image Generation Service (IGS) driven by T2I-IP-DMs and mislead the public to discredit the service provider. Worse still, the IP-Adapter's dependency on open-source image encoders reduces the knowledge required to craft AEs. Extensive experiments verify the technical feasibility of the hijacking attack. In light of the revealed threat, we investigate several existing defenses and explore combining the IP-Adapter with adversarially trained models to overcome existing defenses' limitations.

      <title>Momentum Boosted Episodic Memory for Improving Learning in Long-Tailed RL Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms assume the distribution of the data to be uniform or mostly uniform. However, this is not the case with most real-world applications like autonomous driving or in nature where animals roam. Some experiences are encountered frequently, and most of the remaining experiences occur rarely; the resulting distribution is called Zipfian. Taking inspiration from the theory of complementary learning systems, an architecture for learning from Zipfian distributions is proposed where important long tail trajectories are discovered in an unsupervised manner. The proposal comprises an episodic memory buffer containing a prioritised memory module to ensure important rare trajectories are kept longer to address the Zipfian problem, which needs credit assignment to happen in a sample efficient manner. The experiences are then reinstated from episodic memory and given weighted importance forming the trajectory to be executed. Notably, the proposed architecture is modular, can be incorporated in any RL architecture and yields improved performance in multiple Zipfian tasks over traditional architectures. Our method outperforms IMPALA by a significant margin on all three tasks and all three evaluation metrics (Zipfian, Uniform, and Rare Accuracy) and also gives improvements on most Atari environments that are considered challenging</description>

      <title>PathGPT: Leveraging Large Language Models for Personalized Route Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The proliferation of GPS enabled devices has led to the accumulation of a substantial corpus of historical trajectory data. By leveraging these data for training machine learning models,researchers have devised novel data-driven methodologies that address the personalized route recommendation (PRR) problem. In contrast to conventional algorithms such as Dijkstra shortest path algorithm,these novel algorithms possess the capacity to discern and learn patterns within the data,thereby facilitating the generation of more personalized paths. However,once these models have been trained,their application is constrained to the generation of routes that align with their training patterns. This limitation renders them less adaptable to novel scenarios and the deployment of multiple machine learning models might be necessary to address new possible scenarios,which can be costly as each model must be trained separately. Inspired by recent advances in the field of Large Language Models (LLMs),we leveraged their natural language understanding capabilities to develop a unified model to solve the PRR problem while being seamlessly adaptable to new scenarios without additional training. To accomplish this,we combined the extensive knowledge LLMs acquired during training with further access to external hand-crafted context information,similar to RAG (Retrieved Augmented Generation) systems,to enhance their ability to generate paths according to user-defined requirements. Extensive experiments on different datasets show a considerable uplift in LLM performance on the PRR problem.</description>

      <title>Physics-aware generative models for turbulent fluid flows through energy-consistent stochastic interpolants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative models have demonstrated remarkable success in domains such as text, image, and video synthesis. In this work, we explore the application of generative models to fluid dynamics, specifically for turbulence simulation, where classical numerical solvers are computationally expensive. We propose a novel stochastic generative model based on stochastic interpolants, which enables probabilistic forecasting while incorporating physical constraints such as energy stability and divergence-freeness. Unlike conventional stochastic generative models, which are often agnostic to underlying physical laws, our approach embeds energy consistency by making the parameters of the stochastic interpolant learnable coefficients. We evaluate our method on a benchmark turbulence problem - Kolmogorov flow - demonstrating superior accuracy and stability over state-of-the-art alternatives such as autoregressive conditional diffusion models (ACDMs) and PDE-Refiner. Furthermore, we achieve stable results for significantly longer roll-outs than standard stochastic interpolants. Our results highlight the potential of physics-aware generative models in accelerating and enhancing turbulence simulations while preserving fundamental conservation properties.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Coreference Resolution with Pretrained Language Models: Bridging the Gap Between Syntax and Semantics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models have made significant advancements in various natural language processing tasks, including coreference resolution. However, traditional methods often fall short in effectively distinguishing referential relationships due to a lack of integration between syntactic and semantic information. This study introduces an innovative framework aimed at enhancing coreference resolution by utilizing pretrained language models. Our approach combines syntax parsing with semantic role labeling to accurately capture finer distinctions in referential relationships. By employing state-of-the-art pretrained models to gather contextual embeddings and applying an attention mechanism for fine-tuning, we improve the performance of coreference tasks. Experimental results across diverse datasets show that our method surpasses conventional coreference resolution systems, achieving notable accuracy in disambiguating references. This development not only improves coreference resolution outcomes but also positively impacts other natural language processing tasks that depend on precise referential understanding.</description>

      <title>Towards an AI-Driven Video-Based American Sign Language Dictionary: Exploring Design and Usage Experience with Learners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Searching for unfamiliar American Sign Language (ASL) signs is challenging for learners because, unlike spoken languages, they cannot type a text-based query to look up an unfamiliar sign. Advances in isolated sign recognition have enabled the creation of video-based dictionaries, allowing users to submit a video and receive a list of the closest matching signs. Previous HCI research using Wizard-of-Oz prototypes has explored interface designs for ASL dictionaries. Building on these studies, we incorporate their design recommendations and leverage state-of-the-art sign-recognition technology to develop an automated video-based dictionary. We also present findings from an observational study with twelve novice ASL learners who used this dictionary during video-comprehension and question-answering tasks. Our results address human-AI interaction challenges not covered in previous WoZ research, including recording and resubmitting signs, unpredictable outputs, system latency, and privacy concerns. These insights offer guidance for designing and deploying video-based ASL dictionary systems.</description>

      <title>Turin3D: Evaluating Adaptation Strategies under Label Scarcity in Urban LiDAR Segmentation with Semi-Supervised Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 3D semantic segmentation plays a critical role in urban modelling, enabling detailed understanding and mapping of city environments. In this paper, we introduce Turin3D: a new aerial LiDAR dataset for point cloud semantic segmentation covering an area of around 1.43 km2 in the city centre of Turin with almost 70M points. We describe the data collection process and compare Turin3D with others previously proposed in the literature. We did not fully annotate the dataset due to the complexity and time-consuming nature of the process; however, a manual annotation process was performed on the validation and test sets, to enable a reliable evaluation of the proposed techniques. We first benchmark the performances of several point cloud semantic segmentation models, trained on the existing datasets, when tested on Turin3D, and then improve their performances by applying a semi-supervised learning technique leveraging the unlabelled training set. The dataset will be publicly available to support research in outdoor point cloud segmentation, with particular relevance for self-supervised and semi-supervised learning approaches given the absence of ground truth annotations for the training set.</description>

      <title>PRIMEDrive-CoT: A Precognitive Chain-of-Thought Framework for Uncertainty-Aware Object Interaction in Driving Scene Scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Driving scene understanding is a critical real-world problem that involves interpreting and associating various elements of a driving environment, such as vehicles, pedestrians, and traffic signals. Despite advancements in autonomous driving, traditional pipelines rely on deterministic models that fail to capture the probabilistic nature and inherent uncertainty of real-world driving. To address this, we propose PRIMEDrive-CoT, a novel uncertainty-aware model for object interaction and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in driving scenarios. In particular, our approach combines LiDAR-based 3D object detection with multi-view RGB references to ensure interpretable and reliable scene understanding. Uncertainty and risk assessment, along with object interactions, are modelled using Bayesian Graph Neural Networks (BGNNs) for probabilistic reasoning under ambiguous conditions. Interpretable decisions are facilitated through CoT reasoning, leveraging object dynamics and contextual cues, while Grad-CAM visualizations highlight attention regions. Extensive evaluations on the DriveCoT dataset demonstrate that PRIMEDrive-CoT outperforms state-of-the-art CoT and risk-aware models.</description>

      <title>Uncovering Fairness through Data Complexity as an Early Indicator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fairness constitutes a concern within machine learning (ML) applications. Currently, there is no study on how disparities in classification complexity between privileged and unprivileged groups could influence the fairness of solutions, which serves as a preliminary indicator of potential unfairness. In this work, we investigate this gap, specifically, we focus on synthetic datasets designed to capture a variety of biases ranging from historical bias to measurement and representational bias to evaluate how various complexity metrics differences correlate with group fairness metrics. We then apply association rule mining to identify patterns that link disproportionate complexity differences between groups with fairness-related outcomes, offering data-centric indicators to guide bias mitigation. Our findings are also validated by their application in real-world problems, providing evidence that quantifying group-wise classification complexity can uncover early indicators of potential fairness challenges. This investigation helps practitioners to proactively address bias in classification tasks.</description>

      <title>CKGAN: Training Generative Adversarial Networks Using Characteristic Kernel Integral Probability Metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose CKGAN, a novel generative adversarial network (GAN) variant based on an integral probability metrics framework with characteristic kernel (CKIPM). CKIPM, as a distance between two probability distributions, is designed to optimize the lowerbound of the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, and thus can be used to train GANs. CKGAN mitigates the notorious problem of mode collapse by mapping the generated images back to random noise. To save the effort of selecting the kernel function manually, we propose a soft selection method to automatically learn a characteristic kernel function. The experimental evaluation conducted on a set of synthetic and real image benchmarks (MNIST, CelebA, etc.) demonstrates that CKGAN generally outperforms other MMD-based GANs. The results also show that at the cost of moderately more training time, the automatically selected kernel function delivers very close performance to the best of manually fine-tuned one on real image benchmarks and is able to improve the performances of other MMD-based GANs.</description>

      <title>Temporal Alignment-Free Video Matching for Few-shot Action Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Few-Shot Action Recognition (FSAR) aims to train a model with only a few labeled video instances. A key challenge in FSAR is handling divergent narrative trajectories for precise video matching. While the frame- and tuple-level alignment approaches have been promising, their methods heavily rely on pre-defined and length-dependent alignment units (e.g., frames or tuples), which limits flexibility for actions of varying lengths and speeds. In this work, we introduce a novel TEmporal Alignment-free Matching (TEAM) approach, which eliminates the need for temporal units in action representation and brute-force alignment during matching. Specifically, TEAM represents each video with a fixed set of pattern tokens that capture globally discriminative clues within the video instance regardless of action length or speed, ensuring its flexibility. Furthermore, TEAM is inherently efficient, using token-wise comparisons to measure similarity between videos, unlike existing methods that rely on pairwise comparisons for temporal alignment. Additionally, we propose an adaptation process that identifies and removes common information across classes, establishing clear boundaries even between novel categories. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of TEAM. Codes are available at github.com/leesb7426/TEAM.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has raised concerns about cultural bias, fairness, and their applicability in diverse linguistic and underrepresented regional contexts. To enhance and benchmark the capabilities of LLMs, there is a need to develop large-scale resources focused on multilingual, local, and cultural contexts. In this study, we propose a framework, NativQA, that can seamlessly construct large-scale, culturally and regionally aligned QA datasets in native languages. The framework utilizes user-defined seed queries and leverages search engines to collect location-specific, everyday information. It has been evaluated across 39 locations in 24 countries and in 7 languages, ranging from extremely low-resource to high-resource languages, which resulted over 300K Question Answer (QA) pairs. The developed resources can be used for LLM benchmarking and further fine-tuning. The framework has been made publicly available for the community (https://gitlab.com/nativqa/nativqa-framework).</description>

      <title>Optuna vs Code Llama: Are LLMs a New Paradigm for Hyperparameter Tuning?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optimal hyperparameter selection is critical for maximizing neural network performance, especially as models grow in complexity. This work investigates the viability of using large language models (LLMs) for hyperparameter optimization by employing a fine-tuned version of Code Llama. Through parameter-efficient fine-tuning using LoRA, we adapt the LLM to generate accurate and efficient hyperparameter recommendations tailored to diverse neural network architectures. Unlike traditional methods such as Optuna, which rely on exhaustive trials, the proposed approach achieves competitive or superior results in terms of Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) while significantly reducing computational overhead. Our approach highlights that LLM-based optimization not only matches state-of-the-art methods like Tree-structured Parzen Estimators but also accelerates the tuning process. This positions LLMs as a promising alternative to conventional optimization techniques, particularly for rapid experimentation. Furthermore, the ability to generate hyperparameters in a single inference step makes this method particularly well-suited for resource-constrained environments such as edge devices and mobile applications, where computational efficiency is paramount. The results confirm that LLMs, beyond their efficiency, offer substantial time savings and comparable stability, underscoring their value in advancing machine learning workflows. All generated hyperparameters are included in the LEMUR Neural Network (NN) Dataset, which is publicly available and serves as an open-source benchmark for hyperparameter optimization research.</description>

      <title>The Hall of AI Fears and Hopes: Comparing the Views of AI Influencers and those of Members of the U.S. Public Through an Interactive Platform</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AI development is shaped by academics and industry leaders - let us call them ``influencers'' - but it is unclear how their views align with those of the public. To address this gap, we developed an interactive platform that served as a data collection tool for exploring public views on AI, including their fears, hopes, and overall sense of hopefulness. We made the platform available to 330 participants representative of the U.S. population in terms of age, sex, ethnicity, and political leaning, and compared their views with those of 100 AI influencers identified by Time magazine. The public fears AI getting out of control, while influencers emphasize regulation, seemingly to deflect attention from their alleged focus on monetizing AI's potential. Interestingly, the views of AI influencers from underrepresented groups such as women and people of color often differ from the views of underrepresented groups in the public.</description>

Abstract: Masked language modeling, which is a task to predict a randomly masked word in the input text, is an efficient language representation learning method. Masked language modeling ignores various words which people can think of for filling in the masked position and calculates the loss with a single word. Especially when the input text is short, the entropy of the word distribution that can fill in the masked position can be high. This may cause the model to be overconfident in the single answer. To address this issue, we propose a novel confidence regularizer that controls regularizing strength dynamically by the input text length. Experiments with GLUE and SQuAD datasets showed that our method achieves better accuracy and lower expected calibration error.</description>

      <title>MCAT: Visual Query-Based Localization of Standard Anatomical Clips in Fetal Ultrasound Videos Using Multi-Tier Class-Aware Token Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate standard plane acquisition in fetal ultrasound (US) videos is crucial for fetal growth assessment, anomaly detection, and adherence to clinical guidelines. However, manually selecting standard frames is time-consuming and prone to intra- and inter-sonographer variability. Existing methods primarily rely on image-based approaches that capture standard frames and then classify the input frames across different anatomies. This ignores the dynamic nature of video acquisition and its interpretation. To address these challenges, we introduce Multi-Tier Class-Aware Token Transformer (MCAT), a visual query-based video clip localization (VQ-VCL) method, to assist sonographers by enabling them to capture a quick US sweep. By then providing a visual query of the anatomy they wish to analyze, MCAT returns the video clip containing the standard frames for that anatomy, facilitating thorough screening for potential anomalies. We evaluate MCAT on two ultrasound video datasets and a natural image VQ-VCL dataset based on Ego4D. Our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 10% and 13% mIoU on the ultrasound datasets and by 5.35% mIoU on the Ego4D dataset, using 96% fewer tokens. MCAT's efficiency and accuracy have significant potential implications for public health, especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where it may enhance prenatal care by streamlining standard plane acquisition, simplifying US-based screening, diagnosis and allowing sonographers to examine more patients.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The vast majority of Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) methods with completeness guarantees require planning full horizon paths. However, planning full horizon paths can take too long and be impractical in real-world applications. Instead, real-time planning and execution, which only allows the planner a finite amount of time before executing and replanning, is more practical for real world multi-agent systems. Several methods utilize real-time planning schemes but none are provably complete, which leads to livelock or deadlock. Our main contribution is to show the first Real-Time MAPF method with provable completeness guarantees. We do this by leveraging LaCAM (Okumura 2023) in an incremental fashion. Our results show how we can iteratively plan for congested environments with a cutoff time of milliseconds while still maintaining the same success rate as full horizon LaCAM. We also show how it can be used with a single-step learned MAPF policy. The proposed Real-Time LaCAM also provides us with a general mechanism for using iterative constraints for completeness in future real-time MAPF algorithms.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty-Aware Hybrid Machine Learning in Virtual Sensors for Vehicle Sideslip Angle Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precise vehicle state estimation is crucial for safe and reliable autonomous driving. The number of measurable states and their precision offered by the onboard vehicle sensor system are often constrained by cost. For instance, measuring critical quantities such as the Vehicle Sideslip Angle (VSA) poses significant commercial challenges using current optical sensors. This paper addresses these limitations by focusing on the development of high-performance virtual sensors to enhance vehicle state estimation for active safety. The proposed Uncertainty-Aware Hybrid Learning (UAHL) architecture integrates a machine learning model with vehicle motion models to estimate VSA directly from onboard sensor data. A key aspect of the UAHL architecture is its focus on uncertainty quantification for individual model estimates and hybrid fusion. These mechanisms enable the dynamic weighting of uncertainty-aware predictions from machine learning and vehicle motion models to produce accurate and reliable hybrid VSA estimates. This work also presents a novel dataset named Real-world Vehicle State Estimation Dataset (ReV-StED), comprising synchronized measurements from advanced vehicle dynamic sensors. The experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method for VSA estimation, highlighting UAHL as a promising architecture for advancing virtual sensors and enhancing active safety in autonomous vehicles.</description>

      <title>A Multimedia Analytics Model for the Foundation Model Era</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid advances in Foundation Models and agentic Artificial Intelligence are transforming multimedia analytics by enabling richer, more sophisticated interactions between humans and analytical systems. Existing conceptual models for visual and multimedia analytics, however, do not adequately capture the complexity introduced by these powerful AI paradigms. To bridge this gap, we propose a comprehensive multimedia analytics model specifically designed for the foundation model era. Building upon established frameworks from visual analytics, multimedia analytics, knowledge generation, analytic task definition, mixed-initiative guidance, and human-in-the-loop reinforcement learning, our model emphasizes integrated human-AI teaming based on visual analytics agents from both technical and conceptual perspectives. Central to the model is a seamless, yet explicitly separable, interaction channel between expert users and semi-autonomous analytical processes, ensuring continuous alignment between user intent and AI behavior. The model addresses practical challenges in sensitive domains such as intelligence analysis, investigative journalism, and other fields handling complex, high-stakes data. We illustrate through detailed case studies how our model facilitates deeper understanding and targeted improvement of multimedia analytics solutions. By explicitly capturing how expert users can optimally interact with and guide AI-powered multimedia analytics systems, our conceptual framework sets a clear direction for system design, comparison, and future research.</description>

      <title>ARLO: A Tailorable Approach for Transforming Natural Language Software Requirements into Architecture using LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Software requirements expressed in natural language (NL) frequently suffer from verbosity, ambiguity, and inconsistency. This creates a range of challenges, including selecting an appropriate architecture for a system and assessing different architectural alternatives. Relying on human expertise to accomplish the task of mapping NL requirements to architecture is time-consuming and error-prone. This paper proposes ARLO, an approach that automates this task by leveraging (1) a set of NL requirements for a system, (2) an existing standard that specifies architecturally relevant software quality attributes, and (3) a readily available Large Language Model (LLM). Specifically, ARLO determines the subset of NL requirements for a given system that is architecturally relevant and maps that subset to a tailorable matrix of architectural choices. ARLO applies integer linear programming on the architectural-choice matrix to determine the optimal architecture for the current requirements. We demonstrate ARLO's efficacy using a set of real-world examples. We highlight ARLO's ability (1) to trace the selected architectural choices to the requirements and (2) to isolate NL requirements that exert a particular influence on a system's architecture. This allows the identification, comparative assessment, and exploration of alternative architectural choices based on the requirements and constraints expressed therein.</description>

      <title>Navigating the Rabbit Hole: Emergent Biases in LLM-Generated Attack Narratives Targeting Mental Health Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been shown to demonstrate imbalanced biases against certain groups. However, the study of unprovoked targeted attacks by LLMs towards at-risk populations remains underexplored. Our paper presents three novel contributions: (1) the explicit evaluation of LLM-generated attacks on highly vulnerable mental health groups; (2) a network-based framework to study the propagation of relative biases; and (3) an assessment of the relative degree of stigmatization that emerges from these attacks. Our analysis of a recently released large-scale bias audit dataset reveals that mental health entities occupy central positions within attack narrative networks, as revealed by a significantly higher mean centrality of closeness (p-value = 4.06e-10) and dense clustering (Gini coefficient = 0.7). Drawing from sociological foundations of stigmatization theory, our stigmatization analysis indicates increased labeling components for mental health disorder-related targets relative to initial targets in generation chains. Taken together, these insights shed light on the structural predilections of large language models to heighten harmful discourse and highlight the need for suitable approaches for mitigation.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to detect F0 through Convolutional Neural Networks and image processing techniques to directly estimate pitch from spectrogram images. Our new approach demonstrates a very good detection accuracy; a total of 92% of predicted pitch contours have strong or moderate correlations to the true pitch contours. Furthermore, the experimental comparison between our new approach and other state-of-the-art CNN methods reveals that our approach can enhance the detection rate by approximately 5% across various Signal-to-Noise Ratio conditions.</description>

      <title>Multi-Modality Sensing in mmWave Beamforming for Connected Vehicles Using Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Beamforming techniques are considered as essential parts to compensate severe path losses in millimeter-wave (mmWave) communications. In particular, these techniques adopt large antenna arrays and formulate narrow beams to obtain satisfactory received powers. However, performing accurate beam alignment over narrow beams for efficient link configuration by traditional standard defined beam selection approaches, which mainly rely on channel state information and beam sweeping through exhaustive searching, imposes computational and communications overheads. And, such resulting overheads limit their potential use in vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications involving highly dynamic scenarios. In comparison, utilizing out-of-band contextual information, such as sensing data obtained from sensor devices, provides a better alternative to reduce overheads. This paper presents a deep learning-based solution for utilizing the multi-modality sensing data for predicting the optimal beams having sufficient mmWave received powers so that the best V2I and V2V line-of-sight links can be ensured proactively. The proposed solution has been tested on real-world measured mmWave sensing and communication data, and the results show that it can achieve up to 98.19% accuracies while predicting top-13 beams. Correspondingly, when compared to existing been sweeping approach, the beam sweeping searching space and time overheads are greatly shortened roughly by 79.67% and 91.89%, respectively which confirm a promising solution for beamforming in mmWave enabled communications.</description>

      <title>A Self-Supervised Framework for Space Object Behaviour Characterisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Foundation Models, pre-trained on large unlabelled datasets before task-specific fine-tuning, are increasingly being applied to specialised domains. Recent examples include ClimaX for climate and Clay for satellite Earth observation, but a Foundation Model for Space Object Behavioural Analysis has not yet been developed. As orbital populations grow, automated methods for characterising space object behaviour are crucial for space safety. We present a Space Safety and Sustainability Foundation Model focusing on space object behavioural analysis using light curves (LCs). We implemented a Perceiver-Variational Autoencoder (VAE) architecture, pre-trained with self-supervised reconstruction and masked reconstruction on 227,000 LCs from the MMT-9 observatory. The VAE enables anomaly detection, motion prediction, and LC generation. We fine-tuned the model for anomaly detection &amp; motion prediction using two independent LC simulators (CASSANDRA and GRIAL respectively), using CAD models of boxwing, Sentinel-3, SMOS, and Starlink platforms. Our pre-trained model achieved a reconstruction error of 0.01%, identifying potentially anomalous light curves through reconstruction difficulty. After fine-tuning, the model scored 88% and 82% accuracy, with 0.90 and 0.95 ROC AUC scores respectively in both anomaly detection and motion mode prediction (sun-pointing, spin, etc.). Analysis of high-confidence anomaly predictions on real data revealed distinct patterns including characteristic object profiles and satellite glinting. Here, we demonstrate how self-supervised learning can simultaneously enable anomaly detection, motion prediction, and synthetic data generation from rich representations learned in pre-training. Our work therefore supports space safety and sustainability through automated monitoring and simulation capabilities.</description>

      <title>WoundAmbit: Bridging State-of-the-Art Semantic Segmentation and Real-World Wound Care</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chronic wounds affect a large population, particularly the elderly and diabetic patients, who often exhibit limited mobility and co-existing health conditions. Automated wound monitoring via mobile image capture can reduce in-person physician visits by enabling remote tracking of wound size. Semantic segmentation is key to this process, yet wound segmentation remains underrepresented in medical imaging research. To address this, we benchmark state-of-the-art deep learning models from general-purpose vision, medical imaging, and top methods from public wound challenges. For fair comparison, we standardize training, data augmentation, and evaluation, conducting cross-validationto minimize partitioning bias. We also assess real-world deployment aspects, including generalization to an out-of-distribution wound dataset, computational efficiency, and interpretability. Additionally, we propose a reference object-based approach to convert AI-generated masks into clinically relevant wound size estimates, and evaluate this, along with mask quality, for the best models based on physician assessments. Overall, the transformer-based TransNeXt showed the highest levels of generalizability. Despite variations in inference times, all models processed at least one image per second on the CPU, which is deemed adequate for the intended application. Interpretability analysis typically revealed prominent activations in wound regions, emphasizing focus on clinically relevant features. Expert evaluation showed high mask approval for all analyzed models, with VWFormer and ConvNeXtS backbone performing the best. Size retrieval accuracy was similar across models, and predictions closely matched expert annotations. Finally, we demonstrate how our AI-driven wound size estimation framework, WoundAmbit, can be integrated into a custom telehealth system. Our code will be made available on GitHub upon publication.</description>

      <title>Heuristic Methods are Good Teachers to Distill MLPs for Graph Link Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Link prediction is a crucial graph-learning task with applications including citation prediction and product recommendation. Distilling Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) teachers into Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) students has emerged as an effective approach to achieve strong performance and reducing computational cost by removing graph dependency. However, existing distillation methods only use standard GNNs and overlook alternative teachers such as specialized model for link prediction (GNN4LP) and heuristic methods (e.g., common neighbors). This paper first explores the impact of different teachers in GNN-to-MLP distillation. Surprisingly, we find that stronger teachers do not always produce stronger students: MLPs distilled from GNN4LP can underperform those distilled from simpler GNNs, while weaker heuristic methods can teach MLPs to near-GNN performance with drastically reduced training costs. Building on these insights, we propose Ensemble Heuristic-Distilled MLPs (EHDM), which eliminates graph dependencies while effectively integrating complementary signals via a gating mechanism. Experiments on ten datasets show an average 7.93% improvement over previous GNN-to-MLP approaches with 1.95-3.32 times less training time, indicating EHDM is an efficient and effective link prediction method.</description>

Yet there is a lack of surveys and comparative evaluations that critically analyze, summarize and assess the performance of existing methods. In this paper, we provide an overview of the state of the art in this continuously evolving field. The survey sheds light on the motivational reasons for pursuing classifiers selection through meta-learning. In this regard, Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) is usually treated as an ASP problem under the umbrella of the democratization of machine learning. Accordingly, AutoML makes machine learning techniques accessible to domain scientists who are interested in applying advanced analytics but lack the required expertise. It can ease the task of manually selecting ML algorithms and tuning related hyperparameters. We comprehensively discuss the different phases of classifiers selection based on a generic framework that is formed as an outcome of reviewing prior works. Subsequently, we propose a benchmark knowledge base of 4 millions previously learned models and present extensive comparative evaluations of the prominent methods for classifiers selection based on 08 classification algorithms and 400 benchmark datasets. The comparative study quantitatively assesses the performance of algorithms selection methods along while emphasizing the strengths and limitations of existing studies.</description>

      <title>From 128K to 4M: Efficient Training of Ultra-Long Context Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Long-context capabilities are essential for a wide range of applications, including document and video understanding, in-context learning, and inference-time scaling, all of which require models to process and reason over long sequences of text and multimodal data. In this work, we introduce a efficient training recipe for building ultra-long context LLMs from aligned instruct model, pushing the boundaries of context lengths from 128K to 1M, 2M, and 4M tokens. Our approach leverages efficient continued pretraining strategies to extend the context window and employs effective instruction tuning to maintain the instruction-following and reasoning abilities. Our UltraLong-8B, built on Llama3.1-Instruct with our recipe, achieves state-of-the-art performance across a diverse set of long-context benchmarks. Importantly, models trained with our approach maintain competitive performance on standard benchmarks, demonstrating balanced improvements for both long and short context tasks. We further provide an in-depth analysis of key design choices, highlighting the impacts of scaling strategies and data composition. Our findings establish a robust framework for efficiently scaling context lengths while preserving general model capabilities. We release all model weights at: https://ultralong.github.io/.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Federated Domain Generalization with Style Sharing: A Formal Modeling and Convergence Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Much of the federated learning (FL) literature focuses on settings where local dataset statistics remain the same between training and testing time. Recent advances in domain generalization (DG) aim to use data from source (training) domains to train a model that generalizes well to data from unseen target (testing) domains. In this paper, we are motivated by two major gaps in existing work on FL and DG: (1) the lack of formal mathematical analysis of DG objectives and training processes; and (2) DG research in FL being limited to the conventional star-topology architecture. Addressing the second gap, we develop $\textit{Decentralized Federated Domain Generalization with Style Sharing}$ ($\texttt{StyleDDG}$), a fully decentralized DG algorithm designed to allow devices in a peer-to-peer network to achieve DG based on sharing style information inferred from their datasets. Additionally, we fill the first gap by providing the first systematic approach to mathematically analyzing style-based DG training optimization. We cast existing centralized DG algorithms within our framework, and employ their formalisms to model $\texttt{StyleDDG}$. Based on this, we obtain analytical conditions under which a sub-linear convergence rate of $\texttt{StyleDDG}$ can be obtained. Through experiments on two popular DG datasets, we demonstrate that $\texttt{StyleDDG}$ can obtain significant improvements in accuracy across target domains with minimal added communication overhead compared to decentralized gradient methods that do not employ style sharing.</description>

      <title>GOLLuM: Gaussian Process Optimized LLMs -- Reframing LLM Finetuning through Bayesian Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can encode complex relationships in their latent spaces, yet harnessing them for optimization under uncertainty remains challenging. We address this gap with a novel architecture that reframes LLM finetuning as Gaussian process (GP) marginal likelihood optimization via deep kernel methods. We introduce LLM-based deep kernels, jointly optimized with GPs to preserve the benefits of both - LLMs to provide a rich and flexible input space for Bayesian optimization and - GPs to model this space with predictive uncertainty for more efficient sampling. Applied to Buchwald-Hartwig reaction optimization, our method nearly doubles the discovery rate of high-performing reactions compared to static LLM embeddings (from 24% to 43% coverage of the top 5% reactions in just 50 optimization iterations). We also observe a 14% improvement over domain-specific representations without requiring specialized features. Extensive empirical evaluation across 19 benchmarks - ranging from general chemistry to reaction and molecular property optimization - demonstrates our method's robustness, generality, and consistent improvements across: (1) tasks, (2) LLM architectures (encoder, decoder, encoder-decoder), (3) pretraining domains (chemistry-related or general-purpose) and (4) hyperparameter settings (tuned once on a single dataset). Finally, we explain these improvements: joint LLM-GP optimization through marginal likelihood implicitly performs contrastive learning, aligning representations to produce (1) better-structured embedding spaces, (2) improved uncertainty calibration, and (3) more efficient sampling - without requiring any external loss. This work provides both practical advances in sample-efficient optimization and insights into what makes effective Bayesian optimization.</description>

      <title>Faster Reinforcement Learning by Freezing Slow States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.00922v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study infinite horizon Markov decision processes (MDPs) with "fast-slow" structure, where some state variables evolve rapidly ("fast states") while others change more gradually ("slow states"). Such structure is common in real-world problems where sequential decisions need to be made at high frequencies over long horizons, where slowly evolving information also influences optimal decisions. Examples include inventory control under slowly changing demand, or dynamic pricing with gradually shifting consumer behavior. Modeling the problem at the natural decision frequency leads to MDPs with discount factors close to one, making them computationally challenging. We propose a novel approximation strategy that "freezes" slow states during a phase of lower-level planning, solving finite-horizon MDPs conditioned on a fixed slow state, and then applying value iteration to an auxiliary upper-level MDP that evolves on a slower timescale. Freezing states for short periods of time leads to easier-to-solve lower-level problems, while a slower upper-level timescale allows for a more favorable discount factor. On the theoretical side, we analyze the regret incurred by our frozen-state approach, which leads to simple insights on how to trade off computational budget versus regret. Empirically, we demonstrate that frozen-state methods produce high-quality policies with significantly less computation, and we show that simply omitting slow states is often a poor heuristic.</description>

      <title>Causal Order: The Key to Leveraging Imperfect Experts in Causal Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.15117v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been used as experts to infer causal graphs, often by repeatedly applying a pairwise prompt that asks about the causal relationship of each variable pair. However, such experts, including human domain experts, cannot distinguish between direct and indirect effects given a pairwise prompt. Therefore, instead of the graph, we propose that causal order be used as a more stable output interface for utilizing expert knowledge. Even when querying a perfect expert with a pairwise prompt, we show that the inferred graph can have significant errors whereas the causal order is always correct. In practice, however, LLMs are imperfect experts and we find that pairwise prompts lead to multiple cycles. Hence, we propose the triplet method, a novel querying strategy that introduces an auxiliary variable for every variable pair and instructs the LLM to avoid cycles within this triplet. It then uses a voting-based ensemble method that results in higher accuracy and fewer cycles while ensuring cost efficiency. Across multiple real-world graphs, such a triplet-based method yields a more accurate order than the pairwise prompt, using both LLMs and human annotators. The triplet method enhances robustness by repeatedly querying an expert with different auxiliary variables, enabling smaller models like Phi-3 and Llama-3 8B Instruct to surpass GPT-4 with pairwise prompting. For practical usage, we show how the expert-provided causal order from the triplet method can be used to reduce error in downstream graph discovery and effect inference tasks.</description>

      <title>DrugAgent: Multi-Agent Large Language Model-Based Reasoning for Drug-Target Interaction Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13378v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Advancements in large language models (LLMs) allow them to address diverse questions using human-like interfaces. Still, limitations in their training prevent them from answering accurately in scenarios that could benefit from multiple perspectives. Multi-agent systems allow the resolution of questions to enhance result consistency and reliability. While drug-target interaction (DTI) prediction is important for drug discovery, existing approaches face challenges due to complex biological systems and the lack of interpretability needed for clinical applications. DrugAgent is a multi-agent LLM system for DTI prediction that combines multiple specialized perspectives with transparent reasoning. Our system adapts and extends existing multi-agent frameworks by (1) applying coordinator-based architecture to the DTI domain, (2) integrating domain-specific data sources, including ML predictions, knowledge graphs, and literature evidence, and (3) incorporating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and ReAct (Reason+Act) frameworks for transparent DTI reasoning. We conducted comprehensive experiments using a kinase inhibitor dataset, where our multi-agent LLM method outperformed the non-reasoning multi-agent model (GPT-4o mini) by 45% in F1 score (0.514 vs 0.355). Through ablation studies, we demonstrated the contributions of each agent, with the AI agent being the most impactful, followed by the KG agent and search agent. Most importantly, our approach provides detailed, human-interpretable reasoning for each prediction by combining evidence from multiple sources - a critical feature for biomedical applications where understanding the rationale behind predictions is essential for clinical decision-making and regulatory compliance.

      <title>Bi-Factorial Preference Optimization: Balancing Safety-Helpfulness in Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15313v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on human preferences, typically through reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), has proven successful in enhancing their capabilities. However, ensuring the safety of LLMs during fine-tuning remains a critical concern, and mitigating the potential conflicts in safety and helpfulness is costly in RLHF. To address this issue, we propose a supervised learning framework called Bi-Factorial Preference Optimization (BFPO), which re-parameterizes a joint RLHF objective of both safety and helpfulness into a single supervised learning objective. In supervised optimization, a labeling function is used to capture the global preferences ranking to balance both safety and helpfulness. To evaluate BFPO, we develop a benchmark that includes comprehensive discriminative and generative tasks for helpfulness and harmlessness. The results indicate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches in both safety and helpfulness. Moreover, BFPO achieves the same level of safety as methods that heavily rely on human labor with less than 10\% of the computational resources and human prompting and annotation process. The training recipes can be found here: https://github.com/wx-zhang/bfpo.</description>

      <title>StateAct: Enhancing LLM Base Agents via Self-prompting and State-tracking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02810v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as autonomous agents, tackling tasks from robotics to web navigation. Their performance depends on the underlying base agent. Existing methods, however, struggle with long-context reasoning and goal adherence. We introduce StateAct, a novel and efficient base agent that enhances decision-making through (1) self-prompting, which reinforces task goals at every step, and (2) chain-of-states, an extension of chain-of-thought that tracks state information over time. StateAct outperforms ReAct, the previous best base agent, by over 10% on Alfworld, 30% on Textcraft, and 7% on Webshop across multiple frontier LLMs. We also demonstrate that StateAct can be used as a drop-in replacement for ReAct with advanced LLM agent methods such as test-time scaling, yielding an additional 12% gain on Textcraft. By improving efficiency and long-range reasoning without requiring additional training or retrieval, StateAct provides a scalable foundation for LLM agents. We open source our code to support further research at https://github.com/ai-nikolai/stateact .</description>

      <title>Inverse Attention Agents for Multi-Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21794v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A major challenge for Multi-Agent Systems is enabling agents to adapt dynamically to diverse environments in which opponents and teammates may continually change. Agents trained using conventional methods tend to excel only within the confines of their training cohorts; their performance drops significantly when confronting unfamiliar agents. To address this shortcoming, we introduce Inverse Attention Agents that adopt concepts from the Theory of Mind (ToM) implemented algorithmically using an attention mechanism trained in an end-to-end manner. Crucial to determining the final actions of these agents, the weights in their attention model explicitly represent attention to different goals. We furthermore propose an inverse attention network that deduces the ToM of agents based on observations and prior actions. The network infers the attentional states of other agents, thereby refining the attention weights to adjust the agent's final action. We conduct experiments in a continuous environment, tackling demanding tasks encompassing cooperation, competition, and a blend of both. They demonstrate that the inverse attention network successfully infers the attention of other agents, and that this information improves agent performance. Additional human experiments show that, compared to baseline agent models, our inverse attention agents exhibit superior cooperation with humans and better emulate human behaviors.</description>

      <title>Is Best-of-N the Best of Them? Coverage, Scaling, and Optimality in Inference-Time Alignment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21878v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inference-time computation offers a powerful axis for scaling the performance of language models. However, naively increasing computation in techniques like Best-of-N sampling can lead to performance degradation due to reward hacking. Toward a theoretical understanding of how to best leverage additional computation, we focus on inference-time alignment, which we formalize as the problem of improving the quality of responses drawn from a pre-trained policy, given a prompt of interest and access to an imperfect reward model. We analyze the performance of inference-time alignment algorithms in terms of (i) response quality, and (ii) compute, and provide new results that highlight the importance of the pre-trained policy's coverage over high-quality responses for performance and compute scaling:
  1. We show that Best-of-$N$ alignment with an ideal choice for $N$ can achieve optimal performance under stringent notions of coverage, but provably suffers from reward hacking when $N$ is large, and fails to achieve tight guarantees under more realistic coverage conditions.
  2. We introduce $\texttt{InferenceTimePessimism}$, a new algorithm which mitigates reward hacking through deliberate use of inference-time compute, implementing the principle of pessimism in the face of uncertainty via rejection sampling; we prove that its performance is optimal and does not degrade with $N$, meaning it is scaling-monotonic.
  We complement our theoretical results with an experimental evaluation that demonstrate the benefits of $\texttt{InferenceTimePessimism}$ across a variety of tasks and models.</description>

      <title>Recitation over Reasoning: How Cutting-Edge Language Models Can Fail on Elementary School-Level Reasoning Problems?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00509v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid escalation from elementary school-level to frontier problems of the difficulty for LLM benchmarks in recent years have weaved a miracle for researchers that we are only inches away from surpassing human intelligence. However, is the LLMs' remarkable reasoning ability indeed comes from true intelligence by human standards, or are they simply reciting solutions witnessed during training at an Internet level? To study this problem, we propose RoR-Bench, a novel, multi-modal benchmark for detecting LLM's recitation behavior when asked simple reasoning problems but with conditions subtly shifted, and conduct empirical analysis on our benchmark. Surprisingly, we found existing cutting-edge LLMs unanimously exhibits extremely severe recitation behavior; by changing one phrase in the condition, top models such as OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1 can suffer $60\%$ performance loss on elementary school-level arithmetic and reasoning problems. Such findings are a wake-up call to the LLM community that compels us to re-evaluate the true intelligence level of cutting-edge LLMs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04346v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Social media is a rich source of real-world data that captures valuable patient experience information for pharmacovigilance. However, mining data from unstructured and noisy social media content remains a challenging task. We present a systematic framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to extract medication side effects from social media and organize them into a knowledge graph (KG). We apply this framework to semaglutide for weight loss using data from Reddit. Using the constructed knowledge graph, we perform comprehensive analyses to investigate reported side effects across different semaglutide brands over time. These findings are further validated through comparison with adverse events reported in the FAERS database, providing important patient-centered insights into semaglutide's side effects that complement its safety profile and current knowledge base of semaglutide for both healthcare professionals and patients. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of using LLMs to transform social media data into structured KGs for pharmacovigilance.</description>

      <title>HypRL: Reinforcement Learning of Control Policies for Hyperproperties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04675v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of learning control policies for complex tasks whose requirements are given by a hyperproperty. The use of hyperproperties is motivated by their significant power to formally specify requirements of multi-agent systems as well as those that need expressiveness in terms of multiple execution traces (e.g., privacy and fairness). Given a Markov decision process M with unknown transitions (representing the environment) and a HyperLTL formula $\varphi$, our approach first employs Skolemization to handle quantifier alternations in $\varphi$. We introduce quantitative robustness functions for HyperLTL to define rewards of finite traces of M with respect to $\varphi$. Finally, we utilize a suitable reinforcement learning algorithm to learn (1) a policy per trace quantifier in $\varphi$, and (2) the probability distribution of transitions of M that together maximize the expected reward and, hence, probability of satisfaction of $\varphi$ in M. We present a set of case studies on (1) safety-preserving multi-agent path planning, (2) fairness in resource allocation, and (3) the post-correspondence problem (PCP).</description>

      <title>VAPO: Efficient and Reliable Reinforcement Learning for Advanced Reasoning Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05118v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present VAPO, Value-based Augmented Proximal Policy Optimization framework for reasoning models., a novel framework tailored for reasoning models within the value-based paradigm. Benchmarked the AIME 2024 dataset, VAPO, built on the Qwen 32B pre-trained model, attains a state-of-the-art score of $\mathbf{60.4}$. In direct comparison under identical experimental settings, VAPO outperforms the previously reported results of DeepSeek-R1-Zero-Qwen-32B and DAPO by more than 10 points. The training process of VAPO stands out for its stability and efficiency. It reaches state-of-the-art performance within a mere 5,000 steps. Moreover, across multiple independent runs, no training crashes occur, underscoring its reliability. This research delves into long chain-of-thought (long-CoT) reasoning using a value-based reinforcement learning framework. We pinpoint three key challenges that plague value-based methods: value model bias, the presence of heterogeneous sequence lengths, and the sparsity of reward signals. Through systematic design, VAPO offers an integrated solution that effectively alleviates these challenges, enabling enhanced performance in long-CoT reasoning tasks.</description>

      <title>Generating Usage-related Questions for Preference Elicitation in Conversational Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.13463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.13463v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A key distinguishing feature of conversational recommender systems over traditional recommender systems is their ability to elicit user preferences using natural language. Currently, the predominant approach to preference elicitation is to ask questions directly about items or item attributes. Users searching for recommendations may not have deep knowledge of the available options in a given domain. As such, they might not be aware of key attributes or desirable values for them. However, in many settings, talking about the planned use of items does not present any difficulties, even for those that are new to a domain. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to preference elicitation by asking implicit questions based on item usage. As one of the main contributions of this work, we develop a multi-stage data annotation protocol using crowdsourcing, to create a high-quality labeled training dataset. Another main contribution is the development of four models for the question generation task: two template-based baseline models and two neural text-to-text models. The template-based models use heuristically extracted common patterns found in the training data, while the neural models use the training data to learn to generate questions automatically. Using common metrics from machine translation for automatic evaluation, we show that our approaches are effective in generating elicitation questions, even with limited training data. We further employ human evaluation for comparing the generated questions using both pointwise and pairwise evaluation designs. We find that the human evaluation results are consistent with the automatic ones, allowing us to draw conclusions about the quality of the generated questions with certainty. Finally, we provide a detailed analysis of cases where the models show their limitations.</description>

      <title>Neural Architecture Search: Two Constant Shared Weights Initialisations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.04406v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the last decade, zero-cost metrics have gained prominence in neural architecture search (NAS) due to their ability to evaluate architectures without training. These metrics are significantly faster and less computationally expensive than traditional NAS methods and provide insights into neural architectures' internal workings. This paper introduces epsinas, a novel zero-cost NAS metric that assesses architecture potential using two constant shared weight initialisations and the statistics of their outputs. We show that the dispersion of raw outputs, normalised by their average magnitude, strongly correlates with trained accuracy. This effect holds across image classification and language tasks on NAS-Bench-101, NAS-Bench-201, and NAS-Bench-NLP. Our method requires no data labels, operates on a single minibatch, and eliminates the need for gradient computation, making it independent of training hyperparameters, loss metrics, and human annotations. It evaluates a network in a fraction of a GPU second and integrates seamlessly into existing NAS frameworks.

      <title>Frequency maps reveal the correlation between Adversarial Attacks and Implicit Bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.15203v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite their impressive performance in classification tasks, neural networks are known to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks, subtle perturbations of the input data designed to deceive the model. In this work, we investigate the correlation between these perturbations and the implicit bias of neural networks trained with gradient-based algorithms. To this end, we analyse a representation of the network's implicit bias through the lens of the Fourier transform. Specifically, we identify unique fingerprints of implicit bias and adversarial attacks by calculating the minimal, essential frequencies needed for accurate classification of each image, as well as the frequencies that drive misclassification in its adversarially perturbed counterpart. This approach enables us to uncover and analyse the correlation between these essential frequencies, providing a precise map of how the network's biases align or contrast with the frequency components exploited by adversarial attacks. To this end, among other methods, we use a newly introduced technique capable of detecting nonlinear correlations between high-dimensional datasets. Our results provide empirical evidence that the network bias in Fourier space and the target frequencies of adversarial attacks are highly correlated and suggest new potential strategies for adversarial defence.</description>

      <title>Can GPT models Follow Human Summarization Guidelines? A Study for Targeted Communication Goals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16810v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the ability of GPT models (ChatGPT, GPT-4 and GPT-4o) to generate dialogue summaries that adhere to human guidelines. Our evaluation involved experimenting with various prompts to guide the models in complying with guidelines on two datasets: DialogSum (English social conversations) and DECODA (French call center interactions). Human evaluation, based on summarization guidelines, served as the primary assessment method, complemented by extensive quantitative and qualitative analyses. Our findings reveal a preference for GPT-generated summaries over those from task-specific pre-trained models and reference summaries, highlighting GPT models' ability to follow human guidelines despite occasionally producing longer outputs and exhibiting divergent lexical and structural alignment with references. The discrepancy between ROUGE, BERTScore, and human evaluation underscores the need for more reliable automatic evaluation metrics.</description>

      <title>Ising on the Graph: Task-specific Graph Subsampling via the Ising Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10206v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reducing a graph while preserving its overall properties is an important problem with many applications. Typically, reduction approaches either remove edges (sparsification) or merge nodes (coarsening) in an unsupervised way with no specific downstream task in mind. In this paper, we present an approach for subsampling graph structures using an Ising model defined on either the nodes or edges and learning the external magnetic field of the Ising model using a graph neural network. Our approach is task-specific as it can learn how to reduce a graph for a specific downstream task in an end-to-end fashion without requiring a differentiable loss function for the task. We showcase the versatility of our approach on four distinct applications: image segmentation, explainability for graph classification, 3D shape sparsification, and sparse approximate matrix inverse determination.</description>

      <title>A Survey on Federated Unlearning: Challenges and Opportunities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02437v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL), introduced in 2017, facilitates collaborative learning between non-trusting parties with no need for the parties to explicitly share their data among themselves. This allows training models on user data while respecting privacy regulations such as GDPR and CPRA. However, emerging privacy requirements may mandate model owners to be able to \emph{forget} some learned data, e.g., when requested by data owners or law enforcement. This has given birth to an active field of research called \emph{machine unlearning}. In the context of FL, many techniques developed for unlearning in centralized settings are not trivially applicable! This is due to the unique differences between centralized and distributed learning, in particular, interactivity, stochasticity, heterogeneity, and limited accessibility in FL. In response, a recent line of work has focused on developing unlearning mechanisms tailored to FL.
  This SoK paper aims to take a deep look at the \emph{federated unlearning} literature, with the goal of identifying research trends and challenges in this emerging field. By carefully categorizing papers published on FL unlearning (since 2020), we aim to pinpoint the unique complexities of federated unlearning, highlighting limitations on directly applying centralized unlearning methods. We compare existing federated unlearning methods regarding influence removal and performance recovery, compare their threat models and assumptions, and discuss their implications and limitations. For instance, we analyze the experimental setup of FL unlearning studies from various perspectives, including data heterogeneity and its simulation, the datasets used for demonstration, and evaluation metrics. Our work aims to offer insights and suggestions for future research on federated unlearning.</description>

      <title>An In-depth Evaluation of Large Language Models in Sentence Simplification with Error-based Human Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04963v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have used both automatic metrics and human evaluations to assess the simplification abilities of LLMs. However, the suitability of existing evaluation methodologies for LLMs remains in question. First, the suitability of current automatic metrics on LLMs' simplification evaluation is still uncertain. Second, current human evaluation approaches in sentence simplification often fall into two extremes: they are either too superficial, failing to offer a clear understanding of the models' performance, or overly detailed, making the annotation process complex and prone to inconsistency, which in turn affects the evaluation's reliability. To address these problems, this study provides in-depth insights into LLMs' performance while ensuring the reliability of the evaluation. We design an error-based human annotation framework to assess the LLMs' simplification capabilities. We select both closed-source and open-source LLMs, including GPT-4, Qwen2.5-72B, and Llama-3.2-3B. We believe that these models offer a representative selection across large, medium, and small sizes of LLMs. Results show that GPT-4 generally generates fewer erroneous simplification outputs compared to the current state-of-the-art. However, LLMs have their limitations, as seen in GPT-4's struggles with lexical paraphrasing. Results show that LLMs generally generate fewer erroneous simplification outputs compared to the previous state-of-the-art. However, LLMs have their limitations, as seen in GPT-4's and Qwen2.5-72B's struggle with lexical paraphrasing. Furthermore, we conduct meta-evaluations on widely used automatic metrics using our human annotations. We find that these metrics lack sufficient sensitivity to assess the overall high-quality simplifications, particularly those generated by high-performance LLMs.</description>

      <title>CodeEditorBench: Evaluating Code Editing Capability of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03543v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) for code are rapidly evolving, with code editing emerging as a critical capability. We introduce CodeEditorBench, an evaluation framework designed to rigorously assess the performance of LLMs in code editing tasks, including debugging, translating, polishing, and requirement switching. Unlike existing benchmarks focusing solely on code generation, CodeEditorBench emphasizes real-world scenarios and practical aspects of software development. We curate diverse coding challenges and scenarios from five sources, covering various programming languages, complexity levels, and editing tasks. Evaluation of 19 LLMs reveals that closed-source models (particularly Gemini-Ultra and GPT-4), outperform open-source models in CodeEditorBench, highlighting differences in model performance based on problem types and prompt sensitivities. CodeEditorBench aims to catalyze advancements in LLMs by providing a robust platform for assessing code editing capabilities. We will release all prompts and datasets to enable the community to expand the dataset and benchmark emerging LLMs. By introducing CodeEditorBench, we contribute to the advancement of LLMs in code editing and provide a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners.</description>

      <title>Comparing Apples to Oranges: LLM-powered Multimodal Intention Prediction in an Object Categorization Task</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08424v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Human intention-based systems enable robots to perceive and interpret user actions to interact with humans and adapt to their behavior proactively. Therefore, intention prediction is pivotal in creating a natural interaction with social robots in human-designed environments. In this paper, we examine using Large Language Models (LLMs) to infer human intention in a collaborative object categorization task with a physical robot. We propose a novel multimodal approach that integrates user non-verbal cues, like hand gestures, body poses, and facial expressions, with environment states and user verbal cues to predict user intentions in a hierarchical architecture. Our evaluation of five LLMs shows the potential for reasoning about verbal and non-verbal user cues, leveraging their context-understanding and real-world knowledge to support intention prediction while collaborating on a task with a social robot.

      <title>Model Extrapolation Expedites Alignment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16792v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given the high computational cost of preference alignment training of large language models (LLMs), exploring efficient methods to reduce the training overhead remains an important and compelling research problem. Motivated by the observation that alignment training typically involves only small parameter changes without injecting new knowledge into models, we propose a straightforward method called ExPO (model extrapolation) to expedite LLMs' alignment with human preferences. Given a partially-trained model and its initial SFT checkpoint, ExPO improves the implicit optimization objective of alignment training by simply amplifying the parameter change based on a first-order approximation, without any additional training overhead. Through controlled experiments, we demonstrate that ExPO boosts a DPO model trained with only 20% steps to outperform the fully-trained one. Moreover, we show that ExPO notably improves existing open-source LLMs (ranging from 1.8B to 70B parameters) on the leading AlpacaEval 2.0 and MT-Bench benchmarks, which highlights ExPO's broader utility in efficiently enhancing LLM alignment.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Sub-Optimal Data for Human-in-the-Loop Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00746v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To create useful reinforcement learning (RL) agents, step zero is to design a suitable reward function that captures the nuances of the task. However, reward engineering can be a difficult and time-consuming process. Instead, human-in-the-loop RL methods hold the promise of learning reward functions from human feedback. Despite recent successes, many of the human-in-the-loop RL methods still require numerous human interactions to learn successful reward functions. To improve the feedback efficiency of human-in-the-loop RL methods (i.e., require less human interaction), this paper introduces Sub-optimal Data Pre-training, SDP, an approach that leverages reward-free, sub-optimal data to improve scalar- and preference-based RL algorithms. In SDP, we start by pseudo-labeling all low-quality data with the minimum environment reward. Through this process, we obtain reward labels to pre-train our reward model without requiring human labeling or preferences. This pre-training phase provides the reward model a head start in learning, enabling it to recognize that low-quality transitions should be assigned low rewards. Through extensive experiments with both simulated and human teachers, we find that SDP can at least meet, but often significantly improve, state of the art human-in-the-loop RL performance across a variety of simulated robotic tasks.</description>

      <title>GenoTEX: An LLM Agent Benchmark for Automated Gene Expression Data Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15341v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in machine learning have significantly improved the identification of disease-associated genes from gene expression datasets. However, these processes often require extensive expertise and manual effort, limiting their scalability. Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have shown promise in automating these tasks due to their increasing problem-solving abilities. To support the evaluation and development of such methods, we introduce GenoTEX, a benchmark dataset for the automated analysis of gene expression data. GenoTEX provides analysis code and results for solving a wide range of gene-trait association problems, encompassing dataset selection, preprocessing, and statistical analysis, in a pipeline that follows computational genomics standards. The benchmark includes expert-curated annotations from bioinformaticians to ensure accuracy and reliability. To provide baselines for these tasks, we present GenoAgent, a team of LLM-based agents that adopt a multi-step programming workflow with flexible self-correction, to collaboratively analyze gene expression datasets. Our experiments demonstrate the potential of LLM-based methods in analyzing genomic data, while error analysis highlights the challenges and areas for future improvement. We propose GenoTEX as a promising resource for benchmarking and enhancing automated methods for gene expression data analysis. The benchmark is available at https://github.com/Liu-Hy/GenoTEX.</description>

      <title>Automated radiotherapy treatment planning guided by GPT-4Vision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15609</link>

Abstract: Objective: Radiotherapy treatment planning is a time-consuming and potentially subjective process that requires the iterative adjustment of model parameters to balance multiple conflicting objectives. Recent advancements in frontier Artificial Intelligence (AI) models offer promising avenues for addressing the challenges in planning and clinical decision-making. This study introduces GPT-RadPlan, an automated treatment planning framework that integrates radiation oncology knowledge with the reasoning capabilities of large multi-modal models, such as GPT-4Vision (GPT-4V) from OpenAI.
  Approach: Via in-context learning, we incorporate clinical requirements and a few (3 in our experiments) approved clinical plans with their optimization settings, enabling GPT-4V to acquire treatment planning domain knowledge. The resulting GPT-RadPlan system is integrated into our in-house inverse treatment planning system through an application programming interface (API). For a given patient, GPT-RadPlan acts as both plan evaluator and planner, first assessing dose distributions and dose-volume histograms (DVHs), and then providing textual feedback on how to improve the plan to match the physician's requirements. In this manner, GPT-RadPlan iteratively refines the plan by adjusting planning parameters, such as weights and dose objectives, based on its suggestions.
  Main results: The efficacy of the automated planning system is showcased across 17 prostate cancer and 13 head and neck cancer VMAT plans with prescribed doses of 70.2 Gy and 72 Gy, respectively, where we compared GPT-RadPlan results to clinical plans produced by human experts. In all cases, GPT-RadPlan either outperformed or matched the clinical plans, demonstrating superior target coverage and reducing organ-at-risk doses by 5 Gy on average (15 percent for prostate and 10-15 percent for head and neck).</description>

      <title>CATBench: A Compiler Autotuning Benchmarking Suite for Black-box Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17811v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bayesian optimization is a powerful method for automating tuning of compilers. The complex landscape of autotuning provides a myriad of rarely considered structural challenges for black-box optimizers, and the lack of standardized benchmarks has limited the study of Bayesian optimization within the domain. To address this, we present CATBench, a comprehensive benchmarking suite that captures the complexities of compiler autotuning, ranging from discrete, conditional, and permutation parameter types to known and unknown binary constraints, as well as both multi-fidelity and multi-objective evaluations. The benchmarks in CATBench span a range of machine learning-oriented computations, from tensor algebra to image processing and clustering, and uses state-of-the-art compilers, such as TACO and RISE/ELEVATE. CATBench offers a unified interface for evaluating Bayesian optimization algorithms, promoting reproducibility and innovation through an easy-to-use, fully containerized setup of both surrogate and real-world compiler optimization tasks. We validate CATBench on several state-of-the-art algorithms, revealing their strengths and weaknesses and demonstrating the suite's potential for advancing both Bayesian optimization and compiler autotuning research.</description>

      <title>Large Language Model Enhanced Knowledge Representation Learning: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00936v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Knowledge Representation Learning (KRL) is crucial for enabling applications of symbolic knowledge from Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to downstream tasks by projecting knowledge facts into vector spaces. Despite their effectiveness in modeling KG structural information, KRL methods are suffering from the sparseness of KGs. The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) built on the Transformer architecture presents promising opportunities for enhancing KRL by incorporating textual information to address information sparsity in KGs. LLM-enhanced KRL methods, including three key approaches, encoder-based methods that leverage detailed contextual information, encoder-decoder-based methods that utilize a unified Seq2Seq model for comprehensive encoding and decoding, and decoder-based methods that utilize extensive knowledge from large corpora, have significantly advanced the effectiveness and generalization of KRL in addressing a wide range of downstream tasks. This work provides a broad overview of downstream tasks while simultaneously identifying emerging research directions in these evolving domains.</description>

      <title>MobilePortrait: Real-Time One-Shot Neural Head Avatars on Mobile Devices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05712v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing neural head avatars methods have achieved significant progress in the image quality and motion range of portrait animation. However, these methods neglect the computational overhead, and to the best of our knowledge, none is designed to run on mobile devices. This paper presents MobilePortrait, a lightweight one-shot neural head avatars method that reduces learning complexity by integrating external knowledge into both the motion modeling and image synthesis, enabling real-time inference on mobile devices. Specifically, we introduce a mixed representation of explicit and implicit keypoints for precise motion modeling and precomputed visual features for enhanced foreground and background synthesis. With these two key designs and using simple U-Nets as backbones, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance with less than one-tenth the computational demand. It has been validated to reach speeds of over 100 FPS on mobile devices and support both video and audio-driven inputs.</description>

      <title>CAPM: Fast and Robust Verification on Maxpool-based CNN via Dual Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09550v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study uses CAPM (Convex Adversarial Polytope for Maxpool-based CNN) to improve the verified bound for general purpose maxpool-based convolutional neural networks (CNNs) under bounded norm adversarial perturbations. The maxpool function is decomposed as a series of ReLU functions to extend the convex relaxation technique to maxpool functions, by which the verified bound can be efficiently computed through a dual network. The experimental results demonstrate that this technique allows the state-of-the-art verification precision for maxpool-based CNNs and involves a much lower computational cost than current verification methods, such as DeepZ, DeepPoly and PRIMA. This method is also applicable to large-scale CNNs, which previous studies show to be often computationally prohibitively expensive. Under certain circumstances, CAPM is 40-times, 20-times or twice as fast and give a significantly higher verification bound (CAPM 98% vs. PRIMA 76%/DeepPoly 73%/DeepZ 8%) as compared to PRIMA/DeepPoly/DeepZ. Furthermore, we additionally present the time complexity of our algorithm as $O(W^2NK)$, where $W$ is the maximum width of the neural network, $N$ is the number of neurons, and $K$ is the size of the maxpool layer's kernel.</description>

      <title>NutriBench: A Dataset for Evaluating Large Language Models on Nutrition Estimation from Meal Descriptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12843v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate nutrition estimation helps people make informed dietary choices and is essential in the prevention of serious health complications. We present NutriBench, the first publicly available natural language meal description nutrition benchmark. NutriBench consists of 11,857 meal descriptions generated from real-world global dietary intake data. The data is human-verified and annotated with macro-nutrient labels, including carbohydrates, proteins, fats, and calories. We conduct an extensive evaluation of NutriBench on the task of carbohydrate estimation, testing twelve leading Large Language Models (LLMs), including GPT-4o, Llama3.1, Qwen2, Gemma2, and OpenBioLLM models, using standard, Chain-of-Thought and Retrieval-Augmented Generation strategies. Additionally, we present a study involving professional nutritionists, finding that LLMs can provide comparable but significantly faster estimates. Finally, we perform a real-world risk assessment by simulating the effect of carbohydrate predictions on the blood glucose levels of individuals with diabetes. Our work highlights the opportunities and challenges of using LLMs for nutrition estimation, demonstrating their potential to aid professionals and laypersons and improve health outcomes. Our benchmark is publicly available at: https://mehak126.github.io/nutribench.html</description>

      <title>POGEMA: A Benchmark Platform for Cooperative Multi-Agent Pathfinding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14931v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has recently excelled in solving challenging cooperative and competitive multi-agent problems in various environments, typically involving a small number of agents and full observability. Moreover, a range of crucial robotics-related tasks, such as multi-robot pathfinding, which have traditionally been approached with classical non-learnable methods (e.g., heuristic search), are now being suggested for solution using learning-based or hybrid methods. However, in this domain, it remains difficult, if not impossible, to conduct a fair comparison between classical, learning-based, and hybrid approaches due to the lack of a unified framework that supports both learning and evaluation. To address this, we introduce POGEMA, a comprehensive set of tools that includes a fast environment for learning, a problem instance generator, a collection of predefined problem instances, a visualization toolkit, and a benchmarking tool for automated evaluation. We also introduce and define an evaluation protocol that specifies a range of domain-related metrics, computed based on primary evaluation indicators (such as success rate and path length), enabling a fair multi-fold comparison. The results of this comparison, which involves a variety of state-of-the-art MARL, search-based, and hybrid methods, are presented.</description>

      <title>Toward Cost-efficient Adaptive Clinical Trials in Knee Osteoarthritis with Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02349v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common musculoskeletal disease, with knee OA (KOA) being one of the leading causes of disability and a significant economic burden. Predicting KOA progression is crucial for improving patient outcomes, optimizing healthcare resources, studying the disease, and developing new treatments. The latter application particularly requires one to understand the disease progression in order to collect the most informative data at the right time. Existing methods, however, are limited by their static nature and their focus on individual joints, leading to suboptimal predictive performance and downstream utility. Our study proposes a new method that allows to dynamically monitor patients rather than individual joints with KOA using a novel Active Sensing (AS) approach powered by Reinforcement Learning (RL). Our key idea is to directly optimize for the downstream task by training an agent that maximizes informative data collection while minimizing overall costs. Our RL-based method leverages a specially designed reward function to monitor disease progression across multiple body parts, employs multimodal deep learning, and requires no human input during testing. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art models, paving the way for the next generation of KOA trials.</description>

      <title>ND-SDF: Learning Normal Deflection Fields for High-Fidelity Indoor Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12598v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural implicit reconstruction via volume rendering has demonstrated its effectiveness in recovering dense 3D surfaces. However, it is non-trivial to simultaneously recover meticulous geometry and preserve smoothness across regions with differing characteristics. To address this issue, previous methods typically employ geometric priors, which are often constrained by the performance of the prior models. In this paper, we propose ND-SDF, which learns a Normal Deflection field to represent the angular deviation between the scene normal and the prior normal. Unlike previous methods that uniformly apply geometric priors on all samples, introducing significant bias in accuracy, our proposed normal deflection field dynamically learns and adapts the utilization of samples based on their specific characteristics, thereby improving both the accuracy and effectiveness of the model. Our method not only obtains smooth weakly textured regions such as walls and floors but also preserves the geometric details of complex structures. In addition, we introduce a novel ray sampling strategy based on the deflection angle to facilitate the unbiased rendering process, which significantly improves the quality and accuracy of intricate surfaces, especially on thin structures. Consistent improvements on various challenging datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method.</description>

      <title>Large Language Model for Patent Concept Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00092v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In traditional innovation practices, concept and IP generation are often iteratively integrated. Both processes demand an intricate understanding of advanced technical domain knowledge. Existing large language models (LLMs), while possessing massive pre-trained knowledge, often fall short in the innovative concept generation due to a lack of specialized knowledge necessary for the generation. To bridge this critical gap, we propose a novel knowledge finetuning (KFT) framework to endow LLM-based AI with the ability to autonomously mine, understand, and apply domain-specific knowledge and concepts for invention generation, i.e., concept and patent generation together. Our proposed PatentGPT integrates knowledge injection pre-training (KPT), domain-specific supervised finetuning (SFT), and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Extensive evaluation shows that PatentGPT significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art models on patent-related benchmark tests. Our method not only provides new insights into data-driven innovation but also paves a new path to fine-tune LLMs for applications in the context of technology. We also discuss the managerial and policy implications of AI-generating inventions in the future.</description>

      <title>MAPF-GPT: Imitation Learning for Multi-Agent Pathfinding at Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00134v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF) is a problem that generally requires finding collision-free paths for multiple agents in a shared environment. Solving MAPF optimally, even under restrictive assumptions, is NP-hard, yet efficient solutions for this problem are critical for numerous applications, such as automated warehouses and transportation systems. Recently, learning-based approaches to MAPF have gained attention, particularly those leveraging deep reinforcement learning. Typically, such learning-based MAPF solvers are augmented with additional components like single-agent planning or communication. Orthogonally, in this work we rely solely on imitation learning that leverages a large dataset of expert MAPF solutions and transformer-based neural network to create a foundation model for MAPF called MAPF-GPT. The latter is capable of generating actions without additional heuristics or communication. MAPF-GPT demonstrates zero-shot learning abilities when solving the MAPF problems that are not present in the training dataset. We show that MAPF-GPT notably outperforms the current best-performing learnable MAPF solvers on a diverse range of problem instances and is computationally efficient during inference.</description>

Abstract: Recent advances in state-space model architectures have shown great promise for efficient sequence modeling, but challenges remain in balancing computational efficiency with model expressiveness. We propose the Flash STU architecture, a hybrid model that interleaves spectral state space model layers with sliding window attention, enabling scalability to billions of parameters for language modeling while maintaining a near-linear time complexity. We evaluate the Flash STU and its variants on diverse sequence prediction tasks, including linear dynamical systems, robotics control, and language modeling. We find that, given a fixed parameter budget, the Flash STU architecture consistently outperforms the Transformer and other leading state-space models such as S4 and Mamba-2.</description>

      <title>DiVA-DocRE: A Discriminative and Voice-Aware Paradigm for Document-Level Relation Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13717v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The remarkable capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in text comprehension and generation have revolutionized Information Extraction (IE). One such advancement is in Document-level Relation Triplet Extraction (DocRTE), a critical task in information systems that aims to extract entities and their semantic relationships from documents. However, existing methods are primarily designed for Sentence level Relation Triplet Extraction (SentRTE), which typically handles a limited set of relations and triplet facts within a single sentence. Additionally, some approaches treat relations as candidate choices integrated into prompt templates, resulting in inefficient processing and suboptimal performance when determining the relation elements in triplets. To address these limitations, we introduce a Discriminative and Voice Aware Paradigm DiVA. DiVA involves only two steps: performing document-level relation extraction (DocRE) and then identifying the subject object entities based on the relation. No additional processing is required simply input the document to directly obtain the triplets. This streamlined process more accurately reflects real-world scenarios for triplet extraction. Our innovation lies in transforming DocRE into a discriminative task, where the model pays attention to each relation and to the often overlooked issue of active vs. passive voice within the triplet. Our experiments on the Re-DocRED and DocRED datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art results for the DocRTE task.</description>

      <title>GSON: A Group-based Social Navigation Framework with Large Multimodal Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18084v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the increasing presence of service robots and autonomous vehicles in human environments, navigation systems need to evolve beyond simple destination reach to incorporate social awareness. This paper introduces GSON, a novel group-based social navigation framework that leverages Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to enhance robots' social perception capabilities. Our approach uses visual prompting to enable zero-shot extraction of social relationships among pedestrians and integrates these results with robust pedestrian detection and tracking pipelines to overcome the inherent inference speed limitations of LMMs. The planning system incorporates a mid-level planner that sits between global path planning and local motion planning, effectively preserving both global context and reactive responsiveness while avoiding disruption of the predicted social group. We validate GSON through extensive real-world mobile robot navigation experiments involving complex social scenarios such as queuing, conversations, and photo sessions. Comparative results show that our system significantly outperforms existing navigation approaches in minimizing social perturbations while maintaining comparable performance on traditional navigation metrics.</description>

Abstract: Robot learning approaches such as behavior cloning and reinforcement learning have shown great promise in synthesizing robot skills from human demonstrations in specific environments. However, these approaches often require task-specific demonstrations or designing complex simulation environments, which limits the development of generalizable and robust policies for unseen real-world settings. Recent advances in the use of foundation models for robotics (e.g., LLMs, VLMs) have shown great potential in enabling systems to understand the semantics in the world from large-scale internet data. However, it remains an open challenge to use this knowledge to enable robotic systems to understand the underlying dynamics of the world, to generalize policies across different tasks, and to adapt policies to new environments. To alleviate these limitations, we propose an agentic framework for robot self-guidance and self-improvement, which consists of a set of role-specialized conversational agents, such as a high-level advisor, a grounding agent, a monitoring agent, and a robotic agent. Our framework iteratively grounds a base robot policy to relevant objects in the environment and uses visuomotor cues to shift the action distribution of the policy to more desirable states, online, while remaining agnostic to the subjective configuration of a given robot hardware platform. We demonstrate that our approach can effectively guide manipulation policies to achieve significantly higher success rates, both in simulation and in real-world experiments, without the need for additional human demonstrations or extensive exploration.

      <title>Scaling Laws for Predicting Downstream Performance in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08527v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Precise estimation of downstream performance in large language models (LLMs) prior to training is essential for guiding their development process. Scaling laws analysis utilizes the statistics of a series of significantly smaller sampling language models (LMs) to predict the performance of the target LLM. For downstream performance prediction, the critical challenge lies in the emergent abilities in LLMs that occur beyond task-specific computational thresholds. In this work, we focus on the pre-training loss as a more computation-efficient metric for performance estimation. Our two-stage approach FLP consists of first estimating a function that maps computational resources (e.g., FLOPs) to the pre-training Loss using a series of fully-converged sampling models, followed by mapping the pre-training loss to downstream task Performance using the intermediate models with emerged performance. In our experiments, this FLP solution accurately predicts the performance of LLMs with 7B and 13B parameters using a series of sampling LMs up to 3B, achieving error margins of 5% and 10%, respectively, and significantly outperforming the FLOPs-to-Performance approach. Further, we present FLP-M, a fundamental approach for performance prediction that addresses the practical need to integrate datasets from multiple sources during pre-training. FLP-M extends the power law analytical function to predict domain-specific pre-training loss based on FLOPs across data sources, and employs a two-layer neural network to model the non-linear relationship between multiple domain-specific loss and downstream performance. By utilizing a 3B LLM trained on a specific ratio and a series of smaller sampling LMs, FLP-M can effectively forecast the performance of 3B and 7B LLMs across various data mixtures for most benchmarks within 10% error margins.</description>

      <title>Compute-Constrained Data Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16208v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data selection can reduce the amount of training data needed to finetune LLMs; however, the efficacy of data selection scales directly with its compute. Motivated by the practical challenge of compute-constrained finetuning, we consider the setting in which both the cost of selecting data and training are budgeted for. We first formalize the problem of data selection with a cost-aware utility function, and model the data selection problem as trading off initial-selection cost for training gain. We run a comprehensive sweep of experiments across multiple tasks, varying compute budget by scaling finetuning tokens, model sizes, and data selection compute. Interestingly we find that many powerful data selection methods are almost never compute-optimal, and that cheaper data selection alternatives dominate both from a theoretical and empirical perspective. For compute-optimal training, we find that perplexity and gradient data selection require training-to-selection model size ratios of 5x and 10x, respectively.</description>

      <title>AUTALIC: A Dataset for Anti-AUTistic Ableist Language In Context</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16520v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As our understanding of autism and ableism continues to increase, so does our understanding of ableist language towards autistic people. Such language poses a significant challenge in NLP research due to its subtle and context-dependent nature. Yet, detecting anti-autistic ableist language remains underexplored, with existing NLP tools often failing to capture its nuanced expressions. We present AUTALIC, the first benchmark dataset dedicated to the detection of anti-autistic ableist language in context, addressing a significant gap in the field. The dataset comprises 2,400 autism-related sentences collected from Reddit, accompanied by surrounding context, and is annotated by trained experts with backgrounds in neurodiversity. Our comprehensive evaluation reveals that current language models, including state-of-the-art LLMs, struggle to reliably identify anti-autistic ableism and align with human judgments, underscoring their limitations in this domain. We publicly release AUTALIC along with the individual annotations which serve as a valuable resource to researchers working on ableism, neurodiversity, and also studying disagreements in annotation tasks. This dataset serves as a crucial step towards developing more inclusive and context-aware NLP systems that better reflect diverse perspectives.</description>

      <title>Understanding Layer Significance in LLM Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17875v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) through supervised fine-tuning is essential for tailoring them to specific applications. Recent studies suggest that alignment primarily adjusts a model's presentation style rather than its foundational knowledge, indicating that only certain components of the model are significantly impacted. To uncover how alignment affects model behavior at a granular level, we propose identifying which layers within LLMs are most critical to the alignment process. Our approach, named ILA, involves learning a binary mask for the parameter changes in each layer during alignment, as an indicator of layer significance. Experimental results reveal that, despite substantial differences in alignment datasets, the important layers of a model identified by ILA exhibit nearly 90\% overlap, highlighting fundamental patterns in LLM alignment. The results also indicate that freezing non-essential layers improves overall model performance, while selectively tuning the most critical layers significantly enhances fine-tuning efficiency with minimal performance loss. Finally, we discuss how these findings extend from LLM alignment to reasoning.</description>

      <title>KnowCoder-X: Boosting Multilingual Information Extraction via Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04794v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Empirical evidence indicates that LLMs exhibit spontaneous cross-lingual alignment. However, although LLMs show promising cross-lingual alignment in IE, a significant imbalance across languages persists, highlighting an underlying deficiency. To address this, we propose KnowCoder-X, a powerful code LLM with advanced cross-lingual and multilingual capabilities for universal information extraction. Firstly, it standardizes the representation of multilingual schemas using Python classes, ensuring a consistent ontology across different languages. Then, IE across languages is formulated as a unified code generation task. Secondly, we enhance the model's cross-lingual transferability through IE cross-lingual alignment instruction tuning on a translated instance prediction task we proposed. During this phase, we also construct a high-quality and diverse bilingual IE parallel dataset with 257k samples, called ParallelNER, synthesized by our proposed robust three-stage pipeline, with manual annotation to ensure quality. Although without training in 29 unseen languages, KnowCoder-X surpasses ChatGPT by $30.17\%$ and SoTA by $20.03\%$, thereby demonstrating superior cross-lingual IE capabilities. Comprehensive evaluations on 64 IE benchmarks in Chinese and English under various settings demonstrate that KnowCoder-X significantly enhances cross-lingual IE transfer through boosting the IE alignment.

      <title>Fox-1: Open Small Language Model for Cloud and Edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05281v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present Fox-1, a series of small language models (SLMs) consisting of Fox-1-1.6B and Fox-1-1.6B-Instruct-v0.1. These models are pre-trained on 3 trillion tokens of web-scraped document data and fine-tuned with 5 billion tokens of instruction-following and multi-turn conversation data. Aiming to improve the pre-training efficiency, Fox-1-1.6B model introduces a novel 3-stage data curriculum across all the training data with 2K-8K sequence length. In architecture design, Fox-1 features a deeper layer structure, an expanded vocabulary, and utilizes Grouped Query Attention (GQA), offering a performant and efficient architecture compared to other SLMs. Fox-1 achieves better or on-par performance in various benchmarks compared to StableLM-2-1.6B, Gemma-2B, Qwen1.5-1.8B, and OpenELM1.1B, with competitive inference speed and throughput. The model weights have been released under the Apache 2.0 license, where we aim to promote the democratization of LLMs and make them fully accessible to the whole open-source community.</description>

      <title>Characteristics of Political Misinformation Over the Past Decade</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06122v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although misinformation tends to spread online, it can have serious real-world consequences. In order to develop automated tools to detect and mitigate the impact of misinformation, researchers must leverage algorithms that can adapt to the modality (text, images and video), the source, and the content of the false information. However, these characteristics tend to change dynamically across time, making it challenging to develop robust algorithms to fight misinformation spread. Therefore, this paper uses natural language processing to find common characteristics of political misinformation over a twelve year period. The results show that misinformation has increased dramatically in recent years and that it has increasingly started to be shared from sources with primary information modalities of text and images (e.g., Facebook and Instagram), although video sharing sources containing misinformation are starting to increase (e.g., TikTok). Moreover, it was discovered that statements expressing misinformation contain more negative sentiment than accurate information. However, the sentiment associated with both accurate and inaccurate information has trended downward, indicating a generally more negative tone in political statements across time. Finally, recurring misinformation categories were uncovered that occur over multiple years, which may imply that people tend to share inaccurate statements around information they fear or don't understand (Science and Medicine, Crime, Religion), impacts them directly (Policy, Election Integrity, Economic) or Public Figures who are salient in their daily lives. Together, it is hoped that these insights will assist researchers in developing algorithms that are temporally invariant and capable of detecting and mitigating misinformation across time.</description>

      <title>PFML: Self-Supervised Learning of Time-Series Data Without Representation Collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10087v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) is a data-driven learning approach that utilizes the innate structure of the data to guide the learning process. In contrast to supervised learning, which depends on external labels, SSL utilizes the inherent characteristics of the data to produce its own supervisory signal. However, one frequent issue with SSL methods is representation collapse, where the model outputs a constant input-invariant feature representation. This issue hinders the potential application of SSL methods to new data modalities, as trying to avoid representation collapse wastes researchers' time and effort. This paper introduces a novel SSL algorithm for time-series data called Prediction of Functionals from Masked Latents (PFML). Instead of predicting masked input signals or their latent representations directly, PFML operates by predicting statistical functionals of the input signal corresponding to masked embeddings, given a sequence of unmasked embeddings. The algorithm is designed to avoid representation collapse, rendering it straightforwardly applicable to different time-series data domains, such as novel sensor modalities in clinical data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of PFML through complex, real-life classification tasks across three different data modalities: infant posture and movement classification from multi-sensor inertial measurement unit data, emotion recognition from speech data, and sleep stage classification from EEG data. The results show that PFML is superior to a conceptually similar SSL method and a contrastive learning-based SSL method. Additionally, PFML is on par with the current state-of-the-art SSL method, while also being conceptually simpler and without suffering from representation collapse.</description>

      <title>PATH: A Discrete-sequence Dataset for Evaluating Online Unsupervised Anomaly Detection Approaches for Multivariate Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13951v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Benchmarking anomaly detection approaches for multivariate time series is a challenging task due to a lack of high-quality datasets. Current publicly available datasets are too small, not diverse and feature trivial anomalies, which hinders measurable progress in this research area. We propose a solution: a diverse, extensive, and non-trivial dataset generated via state-of-the-art simulation tools that reflects realistic behaviour of an automotive powertrain, including its multivariate, dynamic and variable-state properties. Additionally, our dataset represents a discrete-sequence problem, which remains unaddressed by previously-proposed solutions in literature. To cater for both unsupervised and semi-supervised anomaly detection settings, as well as time series generation and forecasting, we make different versions of the dataset available, where training and test subsets are offered in contaminated and clean versions, depending on the task. We also provide baseline results from a selection of approaches based on deterministic and variational autoencoders, as well as a non-parametric approach. As expected, the baseline experimentation shows that the approaches trained on the semi-supervised version of the dataset outperform their unsupervised counterparts, highlighting a need for approaches more robust to contaminated training data. Furthermore, results show that the threshold used can have a large influence on detection performance, hence more work needs to be invested in methods to find a suitable threshold without the need for labelled data.</description>

      <title>SceneTAP: Scene-Coherent Typographic Adversarial Planner against Vision-Language Models in Real-World Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00114v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in interpreting visual content. While existing works demonstrate these models' vulnerability to deliberately placed adversarial texts, such texts are often easily identifiable as anomalous. In this paper, we present the first approach to generate scene-coherent typographic adversarial attacks that mislead advanced LVLMs while maintaining visual naturalness through the capability of the LLM-based agent. Our approach addresses three critical questions: what adversarial text to generate, where to place it within the scene, and how to integrate it seamlessly. We propose a training-free, multi-modal LLM-driven scene-coherent typographic adversarial planning (SceneTAP) that employs a three-stage process: scene understanding, adversarial planning, and seamless integration. The SceneTAP utilizes chain-of-thought reasoning to comprehend the scene, formulate effective adversarial text, strategically plan its placement, and provide detailed instructions for natural integration within the image. This is followed by a scene-coherent TextDiffuser that executes the attack using a local diffusion mechanism. We extend our method to real-world scenarios by printing and placing generated patches in physical environments, demonstrating its practical implications. Extensive experiments show that our scene-coherent adversarial text successfully misleads state-of-the-art LVLMs, including ChatGPT-4o, even after capturing new images of physical setups. Our evaluations demonstrate a significant increase in attack success rates while maintaining visual naturalness and contextual appropriateness. This work highlights vulnerabilities in current vision-language models to sophisticated, scene-coherent adversarial attacks and provides insights into potential defense mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Black Swan: Abductive and Defeasible Video Reasoning in Unpredictable Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05725v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The commonsense reasoning capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs), especially in abductive reasoning and defeasible reasoning, remain poorly understood. Most benchmarks focus on typical visual scenarios, making it difficult to discern whether model performance stems from keen perception and reasoning skills, or reliance on pure statistical recall. We argue that by focusing on atypical events in videos, clearer insights can be gained on the core capabilities of VLMs. Explaining and understanding such out-of-distribution events requires models to extend beyond basic pattern recognition and regurgitation of their prior knowledge. To this end, we introduce BlackSwanSuite, a benchmark for evaluating VLMs' ability to reason about unexpected events through abductive and defeasible tasks. Our tasks artificially limit the amount of visual information provided to models while questioning them about hidden unexpected events, or provide new visual information that could change an existing hypothesis about the event. We curate a comprehensive benchmark suite comprising over 3,800 MCQ, 4,900 generative and 6,700 yes/no questions, spanning 1,655 videos. After extensively evaluating various state-of-the-art VLMs, including GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro, as well as open-source VLMs such as LLaVA-Video, we find significant performance gaps of up to 32% from humans on these tasks. Our findings reveal key limitations in current VLMs, emphasizing the need for enhanced model architectures and training strategies. Our data and leaderboard is available at blackswan.cs.ubc.ca.</description>

      <title>SiReRAG: Indexing Similar and Related Information for Multihop Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06206v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Indexing is an important step towards strong performance in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems. However, existing methods organize data based on either semantic similarity (similarity) or related information (relatedness), but do not cover both perspectives comprehensively. Our analysis reveals that modeling only one perspective results in insufficient knowledge synthesis, leading to suboptimal performance on complex tasks requiring multihop reasoning. In this paper, we propose SiReRAG, a novel RAG indexing approach that explicitly considers both similar and related information. On the similarity side, we follow existing work and explore some variances to construct a similarity tree based on recursive summarization. On the relatedness side, SiReRAG extracts propositions and entities from texts, groups propositions via shared entities, and generates recursive summaries to construct a relatedness tree. We index and flatten both similarity and relatedness trees into a unified retrieval pool. Our experiments demonstrate that SiReRAG consistently outperforms state-of-the-art indexing methods on three multihop datasets (MuSiQue, 2WikiMultiHopQA, and HotpotQA), with an average 1.9% improvement in F1 scores. As a reasonably efficient solution, SiReRAG enhances existing reranking methods significantly, with up to 7.8% improvement in average F1 scores.

      <title>Augmenting the action space with conventions to improve multi-agent cooperation in Hanabi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06333</link>

Abstract: The card game Hanabi is considered a strong medium for the testing and development of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms, due to its cooperative nature, hidden information, limited communication and remarkable complexity. Previous research efforts have explored the capabilities of MARL algorithms within Hanabi, focusing largely on advanced architecture design and algorithmic manipulations to achieve state-of-the-art performance for a various number of cooperators. However, this often leads to complex solution strategies with high computational cost and requiring large amounts of training data. For humans to solve the Hanabi game effectively, they require the use of conventions, which often allows for a means to implicitly convey ideas or knowledge based on a predefined, and mutually agreed upon, set of ``rules''. Multi-agent problems containing partial observability, especially when limited communication is present, can benefit greatly from the use of implicit knowledge sharing. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to augmenting the action space using conventions, which act as special cooperative actions that span over multiple time steps and multiple agents, requiring agents to actively opt in for it to reach fruition. These conventions are based on existing human conventions, and result in a significant improvement on the performance of existing techniques for self-play and cross-play across a various number of cooperators within Hanabi.</description>

      <title>PyraNet: A Multi-Layered Hierarchical Dataset for Verilog</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06947v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, there has been a growing interest in leveraging Large Language Models for Verilog code generation. However, the current quality of the generated Verilog code remains suboptimal. This is largely due to the absence of well-defined, well-organized datasets with high-quality samples, as well as a lack of innovative fine-tuning methods and models specifically trained on Verilog. In this paper, we introduce a novel open-source dataset and a corresponding fine-tuning technique, which utilizes a multi-layered structure that we refer to as PyraNet. Our experiments demonstrate that employing the proposed dataset and fine-tuning approach leads to a more accurate fine-tuned model, producing syntactically and functionally correct Verilog code. The evaluation results show improvements by up-to $32.6\%$ in comparison to the CodeLlama-7B baseline model and up-to $16.7\%$ in comparison to the state-of-the-art models using VerilogEval evaluation platform.</description>

      <title>Proactive Adversarial Defense: Harnessing Prompt Tuning in Vision-Language Models to Detect Unseen Backdoored Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08755v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Backdoor attacks pose a critical threat by embedding hidden triggers into inputs, causing models to misclassify them into target labels. While extensive research has focused on mitigating these attacks in object recognition models through weight fine-tuning, much less attention has been given to detecting backdoored samples directly. Given the vast datasets used in training, manual inspection for backdoor triggers is impractical, and even state-of-the-art defense mechanisms fail to fully neutralize their impact. To address this gap, we introduce a groundbreaking method to detect unseen backdoored images during both training and inference. Leveraging the transformative success of prompt tuning in Vision Language Models (VLMs), our approach trains learnable text prompts to differentiate clean images from those with hidden backdoor triggers. Experiments demonstrate the exceptional efficacy of this method, achieving an impressive average accuracy of 86% across two renowned datasets for detecting unseen backdoor triggers, establishing a new standard in backdoor defense.</description>

      <title>Sample-efficient Unsupervised Policy Cloning from Ensemble Self-supervised Labeled Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10778v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current advanced policy learning methodologies have demonstrated the ability to develop expert-level strategies when provided enough information. However, their requirements, including task-specific rewards, action-labeled expert trajectories, and huge environmental interactions, can be expensive or even unavailable in many scenarios. In contrast, humans can efficiently acquire skills within a few trials and errors by imitating easily accessible internet videos, in the absence of any other supervision. In this paper, we try to let machines replicate this efficient watching-and-learning process through Unsupervised Policy from Ensemble Self-supervised labeled Videos (UPESV), a novel framework to efficiently learn policies from action-free videos without rewards and any other expert supervision. UPESV trains a video labeling model to infer the expert actions in expert videos through several organically combined self-supervised tasks. Each task performs its duties, and they together enable the model to make full use of both action-free videos and reward-free interactions for robust dynamics understanding and advanced action prediction. Simultaneously, UPESV clones a policy from the labeled expert videos, in turn collecting environmental interactions for self-supervised tasks. After a sample-efficient, unsupervised, and iterative training process, UPESV obtains an advanced policy based on a robust video labeling model. Extensive experiments in sixteen challenging procedurally generated environments demonstrate that the proposed UPESV achieves state-of-the-art interaction-limited policy learning performance (outperforming five current advanced baselines on 12/16 tasks) without exposure to any other supervision except for videos.</description>

      <title>Neural Port-Hamiltonian Differential Algebraic Equations for Compositional Learning of Electrical Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11215v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop compositional learning algorithms for coupled dynamical systems. While deep learning has proven effective at modeling complex relationships from data, compositional couplings between system components typically introduce algebraic constraints on state variables, posing challenges to many existing data-driven approaches to modeling dynamical systems. Towards developing deep learning models for constrained dynamical systems, we introduce neural port-Hamiltonian differential algebraic equations (N-PHDAEs), which use neural networks to parametrize unknown terms in both the differential and algebraic components of a port-Hamiltonian DAE. To train these models, we propose an algorithm that uses automatic differentiation to perform index reduction, automatically transforming the neural DAE into an equivalent system of neural ordinary differential equations (N-ODEs), for which established model inference and backpropagation methods exist. The proposed compositional modeling framework and learning algorithms may be applied broadly to learn control-oriented models of dynamical systems in a variety of application areas, however, in this work, we focus on their application to the modeling of electrical networks. Experiments simulating the dynamics of nonlinear circuits exemplify the benefits of our approach: the proposed N-PHDAE model achieves an order of magnitude improvement in prediction accuracy and constraint satisfaction when compared to a baseline N-ODE over long prediction time horizons. We also validate the compositional capabilities of our approach through experiments on a simulated D.C. microgrid: we train individual N-PHDAE models for separate grid components, before coupling them to accurately predict the behavior of larger-scale networks.</description>

      <title>A stochastic first-order method with multi-extrapolated momentum for highly smooth unconstrained optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14488v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider an unconstrained stochastic optimization problem where the objective function exhibits high-order smoothness. Specifically, we propose a new stochastic first-order method (SFOM) with multi-extrapolated momentum, in which multiple extrapolations are performed in each iteration, followed by a momentum update based on these extrapolations. We demonstrate that the proposed SFOM can accelerate optimization by exploiting the high-order smoothness of the objective function $f$. Assuming that the $p$th-order derivative of $f$ is Lipschitz continuous for some $p\ge2$, and under additional mild assumptions, we establish that our method achieves a sample complexity of $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-(3p+1)/p})$ for finding a point $x$ such that $\mathbb{E}[\|\nabla f(x)\|]\le\epsilon$. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first SFOM to leverage arbitrary-order smoothness of the objective function for acceleration, resulting in a sample complexity that improves upon the best-known results without assuming the mean-squared smoothness condition. Preliminary numerical experiments validate the practical performance of our method and support our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Evaluating and Enhancing LLMs for Multi-turn Text-to-SQL with Multiple Question Types</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17867v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced text-to-SQL systems. However, most LLM-based methods often narrowly focus on SQL generation, neglecting the complexities of real-world conversational queries. This oversight can lead to unreliable responses, particularly for ambiguous questions that cannot be directly addressed with SQL. To bridge this gap, we propose MMSQL, a comprehensive test suite designed to evaluate the question classification and SQL generation capabilities of LLMs by simulating real-world scenarios with diverse question types and multi-turn Q&amp;A interactions. Using MMSQL, we assessed the performance of popular LLMs, including both open-source and closed-source models, and identified key factors impacting their performance in such scenarios. Moreover, we introduce an LLM-based multi-agent framework that employs specialized agents to identify question types and determine appropriate answering strategies. Our experiments demonstrate that this approach significantly enhances the model's ability to navigate the complexities of conversational dynamics, effectively handling the diverse and complex nature of user queries. Our dataset and code are publicly available at https://mcxiaoxiao.github.io/MMSQL.</description>

      <title>Retrieval-Based Interleaved Visual Chain-of-Thought in Real-World Driving Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04671v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting improves reasoning in large language models, its effectiveness in vision-language models (VLMs) remains limited due to over-reliance on textual cues and memorized knowledge. To investigate the visual reasoning capabilities of VLMs in complex real-world scenarios, we introduce DrivingVQA, a visual question answering dataset derived from driving theory exams, which contains 3,931 multiple-choice problems with expert-written explanations and grounded entities relevant to the reasoning process. Leveraging this dataset, we propose RIV-CoT, a Retrieval-Based Interleaved Visual Chain-of-Thought method that enables VLMs to reason using visual crops corresponding to these relevant entities. Our experiments demonstrate that RIV-CoT improves answer accuracy by 3.1% and reasoning accuracy by 4.6% over vanilla CoT prompting. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our method effectively scales to the larger A-OKVQA reasoning dataset by leveraging automatically generated pseudo-labels, outperforming CoT prompting.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models for Knowledge Graph Embedding: A Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07766v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have garnered significant attention for their superior performance in many knowledge-driven applications on the world wide web.These models are designed to train hundreds of millions or more parameters on large amounts of text data, enabling them to understand and generate naturallanguage effectively. As the superior performance of LLMs becomes apparent,they are increasingly being applied to knowledge graph embedding (KGE) related tasks to improve the processing results. Traditional KGE representation learning methods map entities and relations into a low-dimensional vector space, enablingthe triples in the knowledge graph to satisfy a specific scoring function in thevector space. However, based on the powerful language understanding and seman-tic modeling capabilities of LLMs, that have recently been invoked to varying degrees in different types of KGE related scenarios such as multi-modal KGE andopen KGE according to their task characteristics. In this paper, we investigate awide range of approaches for performing LLMs-related tasks in different types of KGE scenarios. To better compare the various approaches, we summarize each KGE scenario in a classification. Finally, we discuss the applications in which the methods are mainly used and suggest several forward-looking directions for the development of this new research area.</description>

      <title>Prompt-CAM: Making Vision Transformers Interpretable for Fine-Grained Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09333v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a simple approach to make pre-trained Vision Transformers (ViTs) interpretable for fine-grained analysis, aiming to identify and localize the traits that distinguish visually similar categories, such as bird species. Pre-trained ViTs, such as DINO, have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in extracting localized, discriminative features. However, saliency maps like Grad-CAM often fail to identify these traits, producing blurred, coarse heatmaps that highlight entire objects instead. We propose a novel approach, Prompt Class Attention Map (Prompt-CAM), to address this limitation. Prompt-CAM learns class-specific prompts for a pre-trained ViT and uses the corresponding outputs for classification. To correctly classify an image, the true-class prompt must attend to unique image patches not present in other classes' images (i.e., traits). As a result, the true class's multi-head attention maps reveal traits and their locations. Implementation-wise, Prompt-CAM is almost a ``free lunch,'' requiring only a modification to the prediction head of Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT). This makes Prompt-CAM easy to train and apply, in stark contrast to other interpretable methods that require designing specific models and training processes. Extensive empirical studies on a dozen datasets from various domains (e.g., birds, fishes, insects, fungi, flowers, food, and cars) validate the superior interpretation capability of Prompt-CAM. The source code and demo are available at https://github.com/Imageomics/Prompt_CAM.</description>

      <title>YOLOv8 to YOLO11: A Comprehensive Architecture In-depth Comparative Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13400v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the field of deep learning-based computer vision, YOLO is revolutionary. With respect to deep learning models, YOLO is also the one that is evolving the most rapidly. Unfortunately, not every YOLO model possesses scholarly publications. Moreover, there exists a YOLO model that lacks a publicly accessible official architectural diagram. Naturally, this engenders challenges, such as complicating the understanding of how the model operates in practice. Furthermore, the review articles that are presently available do not delve into the specifics of each model. The objective of this study is to present a comprehensive and in-depth architecture comparison of the four most recent YOLO models, specifically YOLOv8 through YOLO11, thereby enabling readers to quickly grasp not only how each model functions, but also the distinctions between them. To analyze each YOLO version's architecture, we meticulously examined the relevant academic papers, documentation, and scrutinized the source code. The analysis reveals that while each version of YOLO has improvements in architecture and feature extraction, certain blocks remain unchanged. The lack of scholarly publications and official diagrams presents challenges for understanding the model's functionality and future enhancement. Future developers are encouraged to provide these resources.</description>

      <title>Expertized Caption Auto-Enhancement for Video-Text Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02885v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Video-text retrieval has been stuck in the information mismatch caused by personalized and inadequate textual descriptions of videos. The substantial information gap between the two modalities hinders an effective cross-modal representation alignment, resulting in ambiguous retrieval results. Although text rewriting methods have been proposed to broaden text expressions, the modality gap remains significant, as the text representation space is hardly expanded with insufficient semantic enrichment.Instead, this paper turns to enhancing visual presentation, bridging video expression closer to textual representation via caption generation and thereby facilitating video-text matching.While multimodal large language models (mLLM) have shown a powerful capability to convert video content into text, carefully crafted prompts are essential to ensure the reasonableness and completeness of the generated captions. Therefore, this paper proposes an automatic caption enhancement method that improves expression quality and mitigates empiricism in augmented captions through self-learning.Additionally, an expertized caption selection mechanism is designed and introduced to customize augmented captions for each video, further exploring the utilization potential of caption augmentation.Our method is entirely data-driven, which not only dispenses with heavy data collection and computation workload but also improves self-adaptability by circumventing lexicon dependence and introducing personalized matching. The superiority of our method is validated by state-of-the-art results on various benchmarks, specifically achieving Top-1 recall accuracy of 68.5% on MSR-VTT, 68.1% on MSVD, and 62.0% on DiDeMo. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/CaryXiang/ECA4VTR.</description>

      <title>Graph Federated Learning Based Proactive Content Caching in Edge Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04760v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the rapid growth of mobile data traffic and the increasing prevalence of video streaming, proactive content caching in edge computing has become crucial for reducing latency and alleviating network congestion. However, traditional caching strategies such as FIFO, LRU, and LFU fail to effectively predict future content popularity, while existing proactive caching approaches often require users to upload data to a central server, raising concerns regarding privacy and scalability. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a Graph Federated Learning-based Proactive Content Caching (GFPCC) scheme that enhances caching efficiency while preserving user privacy. The proposed approach integrates federated learning and graph neural networks, enabling users to locally train Light Graph Convolutional Networks (LightGCN) to capture user-item relationships and predict content popularity. Instead of sharing raw data, only the trained model parameters are transmitted to the central server, where a federated averaging algorithm aggregates updates, refines the global model, and selects the most popular files for proactive caching. Experimental evaluations on real-world datasets, such as MovieLens, demonstrate that GFPCC outperforms baseline caching algorithms by achieving higher cache efficiency through more accurate content popularity predictions. Moreover, the federated learning framework strengthens privacy protection while maintaining efficient model training; however, scalability remains a challenge in large-scale networks with dynamic user preferences.</description>

      <title>Safe at the Margins: A General Approach to Safety Alignment in Low-Resource English Languages -- A Singlish Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12485v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ensuring the safety of Large Language Models (LLMs) in diverse linguistic settings remains challenging, particularly for low-resource languages. Existing safety alignment methods are English-centric, limiting their effectiveness. We systematically compare Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO) for aligning SEA-Lion-v2.1-Instruct, a Llama 3-8B variant, to reduce toxicity in Singlish. Our results show that SFT+KTO achieves superior safety alignment with higher sample efficiency than DPO. Additionally, we introduce KTO-S, which enhances stability via improved KL divergence regularization. Our approach reduces Singlish toxicity by 99\%, generalizes to TOXIGEN, and maintains strong performance on standard LLM benchmarks, providing a scalable framework for safer AI deployment in multilingual contexts.</description>

      <title>GSCE: A Prompt Framework with Enhanced Reasoning for Reliable LLM-driven Drone Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12531v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into robotic control, including drones, has the potential to revolutionize autonomous systems. Research studies have demonstrated that LLMs can be leveraged to support robotic operations. However, when facing tasks with complex reasoning, concerns and challenges are raised about the reliability of solutions produced by LLMs. In this paper, we propose a prompt framework with enhanced reasoning to enable reliable LLM-driven control for drones. Our framework consists of novel technical components designed using Guidelines, Skill APIs, Constraints, and Examples, namely GSCE. GSCE is featured by its reliable and constraint-compliant code generation. We performed thorough experiments using GSCE for the control of drones with a wide level of task complexities. Our experiment results demonstrate that GSCE can significantly improve task success rates and completeness compared to baseline approaches, highlighting its potential for reliable LLM-driven autonomous drone systems.</description>

      <title>MMTEB: Massive Multilingual Text Embedding Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13595v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Text embeddings are typically evaluated on a limited set of tasks, which are constrained by language, domain, and task diversity. To address these limitations and provide a more comprehensive evaluation, we introduce the Massive Multilingual Text Embedding Benchmark (MMTEB) - a large-scale, community-driven expansion of MTEB, covering over 500 quality-controlled evaluation tasks across 250+ languages. MMTEB includes a diverse set of challenging, novel tasks such as instruction following, long-document retrieval, and code retrieval, representing the largest multilingual collection of evaluation tasks for embedding models to date. Using this collection, we develop several highly multilingual benchmarks, which we use to evaluate a representative set of models. We find that while large language models (LLMs) with billions of parameters can achieve state-of-the-art performance on certain language subsets and task categories, the best-performing publicly available model is multilingual-e5-large-instruct with only 560 million parameters. To facilitate accessibility and reduce computational cost, we introduce a novel downsampling method based on inter-task correlation, ensuring a diverse selection while preserving relative model rankings. Furthermore, we optimize tasks such as retrieval by sampling hard negatives, creating smaller but effective splits. These optimizations allow us to introduce benchmarks that drastically reduce computational demands. For instance, our newly introduced zero-shot English benchmark maintains a ranking order similar to the full-scale version but at a fraction of the computational cost.</description>

      <title>REFIND at SemEval-2025 Task 3: Retrieval-Augmented Factuality Hallucination Detection in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13622v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hallucinations in large language model (LLM) outputs severely limit their reliability in knowledge-intensive tasks such as question answering. To address this challenge, we introduce REFIND (Retrieval-augmented Factuality hallucINation Detection), a novel framework that detects hallucinated spans within LLM outputs by directly leveraging retrieved documents. As part of the REFIND, we propose the Context Sensitivity Ratio (CSR), a novel metric that quantifies the sensitivity of LLM outputs to retrieved evidence. This innovative approach enables REFIND to efficiently and accurately detect hallucinations, setting it apart from existing methods. In the evaluation, REFIND demonstrated robustness across nine languages, including low-resource settings, and significantly outperformed baseline models, achieving superior IoU scores in identifying hallucinated spans. This work highlights the effectiveness of quantifying context sensitivity for hallucination detection, thereby paving the way for more reliable and trustworthy LLM applications across diverse languages. Our code is available at https://github.com/oneonlee/REFIND.</description>

      <title>Model Inversion Attack against Federated Unlearning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14558v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the introduction of regulations related to the ``right to be forgotten", federated learning (FL) is facing new privacy compliance challenges. To address these challenges, researchers have proposed federated unlearning (FU). However, existing FU research has primarily focused on improving the efficiency of unlearning, with less attention paid to the potential privacy vulnerabilities inherent in these methods. To address this gap, we draw inspiration from gradient inversion attacks in FL and propose the federated unlearning inversion attack (FUIA). The FUIA is specifically designed for the three types of FU (sample unlearning, client unlearning, and class unlearning), aiming to provide a comprehensive analysis of the privacy leakage risks associated with FU. In FUIA, the server acts as an honest-but-curious attacker, recording and exploiting the model differences before and after unlearning to expose the features and labels of forgotten data. FUIA significantly leaks the privacy of forgotten data and can target all types of FU. This attack contradicts the goal of FU to eliminate specific data influence, instead exploiting its vulnerabilities to recover forgotten data and expose its privacy flaws. Extensive experimental results show that FUIA can effectively reveal the private information of forgotten data. To mitigate this privacy leakage, we also explore two potential defense methods, although these come at the cost of reduced unlearning effectiveness and the usability of the unlearned model.</description>

      <title>A Cautionary Tale About "Neutrally" Informative AI Tools Ahead of the 2025 Federal Elections in Germany</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15568v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we examine the reliability of AI-based Voting Advice Applications (VAAs) and large language models (LLMs) in providing objective political information. Our analysis is based upon a comparison with party responses to 38 statements of the Wahl-O-Mat, a well-established German online tool that helps inform voters by comparing their views with political party positions. For the LLMs, we identify significant biases. They exhibit a strong alignment (over 75% on average) with left-wing parties and a substantially lower alignment with center-right (smaller 50%) and right-wing parties (around 30%). Furthermore, for the VAAs, intended to objectively inform voters, we found substantial deviations from the parties' stated positions in Wahl-O-Mat: While one VAA deviated in 25% of cases, another VAA showed deviations in more than 50% of cases. For the latter, we even observed that simple prompt injections led to severe hallucinations, including false claims such as non-existent connections between political parties and right-wing extremist ties.</description>

      <title>DataMan: Data Manager for Pre-training Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19363v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The performance emergence of large language models (LLMs) driven by data scaling laws makes the selection of pre-training data increasingly important. However, existing methods rely on limited heuristics and human intuition, lacking comprehensive and clear guidelines. To address this, we are inspired by ``reverse thinking'' -- prompting LLMs to self-identify which criteria benefit its performance. As its pre-training capabilities are related to perplexity (PPL), we derive 14 quality criteria from the causes of text perplexity anomalies and introduce 15 common application domains to support domain mixing. In this paper, we train a Data Manager (DataMan) to learn quality ratings and domain recognition from pointwise rating, and use it to annotate a 447B token pre-training corpus with 14 quality ratings and domain type. Our experiments validate our approach, using DataMan to select 30B tokens to train a 1.3B-parameter language model, demonstrating significant improvements in in-context learning (ICL), perplexity, and instruction-following ability over the state-of-the-art baseline. The best-performing model, based on the Overall Score l=5 surpasses a model trained with 50% more data using uniform sampling. We continue pre-training with high-rated, domain-specific data annotated by DataMan to enhance domain-specific ICL performance and thus verify DataMan's domain mixing ability. Our findings emphasize the importance of quality ranking, the complementary nature of quality criteria, and their low correlation with perplexity, analyzing misalignment between PPL and ICL performance. We also thoroughly analyzed our pre-training dataset, examining its composition, the distribution of quality ratings, and the original document sources.</description>

      <title>A Unified Framework with Novel Metrics for Evaluating the Effectiveness of XAI Techniques in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05050v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The increasing complexity of LLMs presents significant challenges to their transparency and interpretability, necessitating the use of eXplainable AI (XAI) techniques to enhance trustworthiness and usability. This study introduces a comprehensive evaluation framework with four novel metrics for assessing the effectiveness of five XAI techniques across five LLMs and two downstream tasks. We apply this framework to evaluate several XAI techniques LIME, SHAP, Integrated Gradients, Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP), and Attention Mechanism Visualization (AMV) using the IMDB Movie Reviews and Tweet Sentiment Extraction datasets. The evaluation focuses on four key metrics: Human-reasoning Agreement (HA), Robustness, Consistency, and Contrastivity. Our results show that LIME consistently achieves high scores across multiple LLMs and evaluation metrics, while AMV demonstrates superior Robustness and near-perfect Consistency. LRP excels in Contrastivity, particularly with more complex models. Our findings provide valuable insights into the strengths and limitations of different XAI methods, offering guidance for developing and selecting appropriate XAI techniques for LLMs.</description>

      <title>Search-R1: Training LLMs to Reason and Leverage Search Engines with Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09516v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficiently acquiring external knowledge and up-to-date information is essential for effective reasoning and text generation in large language models (LLMs). Prompting advanced LLMs with reasoning capabilities to use search engines during inference is often suboptimal, as the LLM might not fully possess the capability on how to interact optimally with the search engine. This paper introduces Search-R1, an extension of reinforcement learning (RL) for reasoning frameworks where the LLM learns to autonomously generate (multiple) search queries during step-by-step reasoning with real-time retrieval. Search-R1 optimizes LLM reasoning trajectories with multi-turn search interactions, leveraging retrieved token masking for stable RL training and a simple outcome-based reward function. Experiments on seven question-answering datasets show that Search-R1 improves performance by 41% (Qwen2.5-7B) and 20% (Qwen2.5-3B) over various RAG baselines under the same setting. This paper further provides empirical insights into RL optimization methods, LLM choices, and response length dynamics in retrieval-augmented reasoning. The code and model checkpoints are available at https://github.com/PeterGriffinJin/Search-R1.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10666v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become widely used across various domains spanning search engines, code generation, and text creation. However, a major concern associated with their adoption is the high cost of inference, impacting both their sustainability and financial feasibility. In this study, we empirically study how different prompt and response characteristics directly impact LLM inference energy cost. We conduct experiments leveraging three open-source transformer-based LLMs across three task types$-$question answering, sentiment analysis, and text generation. For each inference, we analyzed prompt and response characteristics (length, semantic meaning, time taken, energy consumption). Our results demonstrate that even when presented with identical tasks, models generate responses with varying characteristics and subsequently exhibit distinct energy consumption patterns. We found that prompt length is less significant than the semantic meaning of the task itself. In addition, we identified specific keywords associated with higher or lower energy usage that vary between associated tasks. These findings highlight the importance of prompt design in optimizing inference efficiency. We conclude that the semantic meaning of prompts and certain task-related keywords significantly impact inference costs, leading the way for deeper exploration towards creating energy-adaptive LLMs.</description>

      <title>TULIP: Towards Unified Language-Image Pretraining</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15485v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the recent success of image-text contrastive models like CLIP and SigLIP, these models often struggle with vision-centric tasks that demand high-fidelity image understanding, such as counting, depth estimation, and fine-grained object recognition. These models, by performing language alignment, tend to prioritize high-level semantics over visual understanding, weakening their image understanding. On the other hand, vision-focused models are great at processing visual information but struggle to understand language, limiting their flexibility for language-driven tasks. In this work, we introduce TULIP, an open-source, drop-in replacement for existing CLIP-like models. Our method leverages generative data augmentation, enhanced image-image and text-text contrastive learning, and image/text reconstruction regularization to learn fine-grained visual features while preserving global semantic alignment. Our approach, scaling to over 1B parameters, outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) models across multiple benchmarks, establishing a new SOTA zero-shot performance on ImageNet-1K, delivering up to a $2\times$ enhancement over SigLIP on RxRx1 in linear probing for few-shot classification, and improving vision-language models, achieving over $3\times$ higher scores than SigLIP on MMVP.

      <description>arXiv:2503.17401v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Environmental journalism is vital for raising awareness of ecological crises and supporting evidence-based policy, yet traditional methods suffer from delays, limited scalability, and lack of coverage in under-monitored regions. This paper introduces the Artificial Intelligence Journalism Integration Model (AIJIM), a conceptual and transferable theoretical model that structures real-time, AI-supported environmental journalism workflows.
  AIJIM combines citizen-sourced image data, automated hazard detection, dual-level validation (visual and textual), and AI-generated reporting. Validated through a pilot study in Mallorca, AIJIM achieved significant improvements in reporting speed and accuracy, while maintaining transparency and ethical oversight through Explainable AI (XAI), GDPR compliance, and community review. The model demonstrates high transferability and offers a new benchmark for scalable, responsible, and participatory journalism at the intersection of environmental communication and artificial intelligence.</description>

      <title>ProtoGS: Efficient and High-Quality Rendering with 3D Gaussian Prototypes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17486v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has made significant strides in novel view synthesis but is limited by the substantial number of Gaussian primitives required, posing challenges for deployment on lightweight devices. Recent methods address this issue by compressing the storage size of densified Gaussians, yet fail to preserve rendering quality and efficiency. To overcome these limitations, we propose ProtoGS to learn Gaussian prototypes to represent Gaussian primitives, significantly reducing the total Gaussian amount without sacrificing visual quality. Our method directly uses Gaussian prototypes to enable efficient rendering and leverage the resulting reconstruction loss to guide prototype learning. To further optimize memory efficiency during training, we incorporate structure-from-motion (SfM) points as anchor points to group Gaussian primitives. Gaussian prototypes are derived within each group by clustering of K-means, and both the anchor points and the prototypes are optimized jointly. Our experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets prove that we outperform existing methods, achieving a substantial reduction in the number of Gaussians, and enabling high rendering speed while maintaining or even enhancing rendering fidelity.</description>

Abstract: Effective patient communication is pivotal in healthcare, yet traditional medical training often lacks exposure to diverse, challenging interpersonal dynamics. To bridge this gap, this study proposes the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to simulate authentic patient communication styles, specifically the "accuser" and "rationalizer" personas derived from the Satir model, while also ensuring multilingual applicability to accommodate diverse cultural contexts and enhance accessibility for medical professionals. Leveraging advanced prompt engineering, including behavioral prompts, author's notes, and stubbornness mechanisms, we developed virtual patients (VPs) that embody nuanced emotional and conversational traits. Medical professionals evaluated these VPs, rating their authenticity (accuser: $3.8 \pm 1.0$; rationalizer: $3.7 \pm 0.8$ on a 5-point Likert scale (from one to five)) and correctly identifying their styles. Emotion analysis revealed distinct profiles: the accuser exhibited pain, anger, and distress, while the rationalizer displayed contemplation and calmness, aligning with predefined, detailed patient description including medical history. Sentiment scores (on a scale from zero to nine) further validated these differences in the communication styles, with the accuser adopting negative ($3.1 \pm 0.6$) and the rationalizer more neutral ($4.0 \pm 0.4$) tone. These results underscore LLMs' capability to replicate complex communication styles, offering transformative potential for medical education. This approach equips trainees to navigate challenging clinical scenarios by providing realistic, adaptable patient interactions, enhancing empathy and diagnostic acumen. Our findings advocate for AI-driven tools as scalable, cost-effective solutions to cultivate nuanced communication skills, setting a foundation for future innovations in healthcare training.</description>

      <title>Thinking Longer, Not Larger: Enhancing Software Engineering Agents via Scaling Test-Time Compute</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23803v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in software engineering agents have demonstrated promising capabilities in automating program improvements. However, their reliance on closed-source or resource-intensive models introduces significant deployment challenges in private environments, prompting a critical question: \textit{How can personally deployable open-source LLMs achieve comparable code reasoning performance?}
  To this end, we propose a unified Test-Time Compute scaling framework that leverages increased inference-time computation instead of larger models. Our framework incorporates two complementary strategies: internal TTC and external TTC. Internally, we introduce a \textit{development-contextualized trajectory synthesis} method leveraging real-world software repositories to bootstrap multi-stage reasoning processes, such as fault localization and patch generation. We further enhance trajectory quality through rejection sampling, rigorously evaluating trajectories along accuracy and complexity. Externally, we propose a novel \textit{development-process-based search} strategy guided by reward models and execution verification. This approach enables targeted computational allocation at critical development decision points, overcoming limitations of existing "end-point only" verification methods.
  Evaluations on SWE-bench Verified demonstrate our \textbf{32B model achieves a 46\% issue resolution rate}, surpassing significantly larger models such as DeepSeek R1 671B and OpenAI o1. Additionally, we provide the empirical validation of the test-time scaling phenomenon within SWE agents, revealing that \textbf{models dynamically allocate more tokens to increasingly challenging problems}, effectively enhancing reasoning capabilities. We publicly release all training data, models, and code to facilitate future research. https://github.com/yingweima2022/SWE-Reasoner</description>

      <title>Do Chinese models speak Chinese languages?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00289v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The release of top-performing open-weight LLMs has cemented China's role as a leading force in AI development. Do these models support languages spoken in China? Or do they speak the same languages as Western models? Comparing multilingual capabilities is important for two reasons. First, language ability provides insights into pre-training data curation, and thus into resource allocation and development priorities. Second, China has a long history of explicit language policy, varying between inclusivity of minority languages and a Mandarin-first policy. To test whether Chinese LLMs today reflect an agenda about China's languages, we test performance of Chinese and Western open-source LLMs on Asian regional and Chinese minority languages. Our experiments on Information Parity and reading comprehension show Chinese models' performance across these languages correlates strongly (r=0.93) with Western models', with the sole exception being better Mandarin. Sometimes, Chinese models cannot identify languages spoken by Chinese minorities such as Kazakh and Uyghur, even though they are good at French and German. These results provide a window into current development priorities, suggest options for future development, and indicate guidance for end users.</description>

      <title>On the Consistency of Multilingual Context Utilization in Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00597v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with large language models (LLMs) has demonstrated strong performance in multilingual question-answering (QA) tasks by leveraging relevant passages retrieved from corpora. In multilingual RAG (mRAG), the retrieved passages can be written in languages other than that of the query entered by the user, making it challenging for LLMs to effectively utilize the provided information. Recent research suggests that retrieving passages from multilingual corpora can improve RAG performance, particularly for low-resource languages. However, the extent to which LLMs can leverage different kinds of multilingual contexts to generate accurate answers, *independently from retrieval quality*, remains understudied. In this paper, we conduct an extensive assessment of LLMs' ability to (i) make consistent use of a relevant passage regardless of its language, (ii) respond in the expected language, and (iii) focus on the relevant passage even when multiple `distracting' passages in different languages are provided in the context. Our experiments with four LLMs across three QA datasets covering a total of 48 languages reveal a surprising ability of LLMs to extract the relevant information from out-language passages, but a much weaker ability to formulate a full answer in the correct language. Our analysis, based on both accuracy and feature attribution techniques, further shows that distracting passages negatively impact answer quality regardless of their language. However, distractors in the query language exert a slightly stronger influence. Taken together, our findings deepen the understanding of how LLMs utilize context in mRAG systems, providing directions for future improvements.</description>

      <title>Text Speaks Louder than Vision: ASCII Art Reveals Textual Biases in Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01589v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have advanced rapidly in processing multimodal information, but their ability to reconcile conflicting signals across modalities remains underexplored. This work investigates how VLMs process ASCII art, a unique medium where textual elements collectively form visual patterns, potentially creating semantic-visual conflicts. We introduce a novel evaluation framework that systematically challenges five state-of-the-art models (including GPT-4o, Claude, and Gemini) using adversarial ASCII art, where character-level semantics deliberately contradict global visual patterns. Our experiments reveal a strong text-priority bias: VLMs consistently prioritize textual information over visual patterns, with visual recognition ability declining dramatically as semantic complexity increases. Various mitigation attempts through visual parameter tuning and prompt engineering yielded only modest improvements, suggesting that this limitation requires architectural-level solutions. These findings uncover fundamental flaws in how current VLMs integrate multimodal information, providing important guidance for future model development while highlighting significant implications for content moderation systems vulnerable to adversarial examples.</description>

      <title>ToM-RL: Reinforcement Learning Unlocks Theory of Mind in Small LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01698v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in rule-based reinforcement learning (RL), applied during the post-training phase of large language models (LLMs), have significantly enhanced their capabilities in structured reasoning tasks such as mathematics and logical inference. However, the effectiveness of RL in social reasoning, particularly in Theory of Mind (ToM), the ability to infer others' mental states, remains largely unexplored. In this study, we demonstrate that RL methods effectively unlock ToM reasoning capabilities even in small-scale LLMs (0.5B to 7B parameters). Using a modest dataset comprising 3200 questions across diverse scenarios, our RL-trained 7B model achieves 84.50\% accuracy on the Hi-ToM benchmark, surpassing models like GPT-4o and DeepSeek-v3 despite significantly fewer parameters. While smaller models ($\leq$3B parameters) suffer from reasoning collapse, larger models (7B parameters) maintain stable performance through consistent belief tracking. Additionally, our RL-based models demonstrate robust generalization to higher-order, out-of-distribution ToM problems, novel textual presentations, and previously unseen datasets. These findings highlight RL's potential to enhance social cognitive reasoning, bridging the gap between structured problem-solving and nuanced social inference in LLMs.</description>

      <title>Scaling Video-Language Models to 10K Frames via Hierarchical Differential Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02438v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Long-form video processing fundamentally challenges vision-language models (VLMs) due to the high computational costs of handling extended temporal sequences. Existing token pruning and feature merging methods often sacrifice critical temporal dependencies or dilute semantic information. We introduce differential distillation, a principled approach that systematically preserves task-relevant information while suppressing redundancy. Based on this principle, we develop ViLaMP, a hierarchical video-language model that processes hour-long videos at ``mixed precision'' through two key mechanisms: (1) differential keyframe selection that maximizes query relevance while maintaining temporal distinctiveness at the frame level and (2) differential feature merging that preserves query-salient features in non-keyframes at the patch level. Hence, ViLaMP retains full information in keyframes while reducing non-keyframes to their most salient features, resembling mixed-precision training. Extensive experiments demonstrate ViLaMP's superior performance across four video understanding benchmarks, particularly on long-form content. Notably, ViLaMP can process ultra-long videos (up to 10K frames) on a single NVIDIA A100 GPU, achieving substantial computational efficiency while maintaining state-of-the-art performance.</description>

      <title>APIGen-MT: Agentic Pipeline for Multi-Turn Data Generation via Simulated Agent-Human Interplay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03601v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Training effective AI agents for multi-turn interactions requires high-quality data that captures realistic human-agent dynamics, yet such data is scarce and expensive to collect manually. We introduce APIGen-MT, a two-phase framework that generates verifiable and diverse multi-turn agent data. In the first phase, our agentic pipeline produces detailed task blueprints with ground-truth actions, leveraging a committee of LLM reviewers and iterative feedback loops. These blueprints are then transformed into complete interaction trajectories through simulated human-agent interplay. We train a family of models -- the xLAM-2-fc-r series with sizes ranging from 1B to 70B parameters. Our models outperform frontier models such as GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 on $\tau$-bench and BFCL benchmarks, with the smaller models surpassing their larger counterparts, particularly in multi-turn settings, while maintaining superior consistency across multiple trials. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our verified blueprint-to-details approach yields high-quality training data, enabling the development of more reliable, efficient, and capable agents. We open-source both the synthetic data collected and the trained xLAM-2-fc-r models to advance research in AI agents. Models are available on HuggingFace at https://huggingface.co/collections/Salesforce/xlam-2-67ef5be12949d8dcdae354c4 and project website is https://apigen-mt.github.io</description>

      <title>Drawing a Map of Elections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03809v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Our main contribution is the introduction of the map of elections framework. A map of elections consists of three main elements: (1) a dataset of elections (i.e., collections of ordinal votes over given sets of candidates), (2) a way of measuring similarities between these elections, and (3) a representation of the elections in the 2D Euclidean space as points, so that the more similar two elections are, the closer are their points. In our maps, we mostly focus on datasets of synthetic elections, but we also show an example of a map over real-life ones. To measure similarities, we would have preferred to use, e.g., the isomorphic swap distance, but this is infeasible due to its high computational complexity. Hence, we propose polynomial-time computable positionwise distance and use it instead. Regarding the representations in 2D Euclidean space, we mostly use the Kamada-Kawai algorithm, but we also show two alternatives. We develop the necessary theoretical results to form our maps and argue experimentally that they are accurate and credible. Further, we show how coloring the elections in a map according to various criteria helps in analyzing results of a number of experiments. In particular, we show colorings according to the scores of winning candidates or committees, running times of ILP-based winner determination algorithms, and approximation ratios achieved by particular algorithms.</description>

      <title>Recursive Training Loops in LLMs: How training data properties modulate distribution shift in generated data?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03814v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly contributing to the creation of content on the Internet. This creates a feedback loop as subsequent generations of models will be trained on this generated, synthetic data. This phenomenon is receiving increasing interest, in particular because previous studies have shown that it may lead to distribution shift - models misrepresent and forget the true underlying distributions of human data they are expected to approximate (e.g. resulting in a drastic loss of quality). In this study, we study the impact of human data properties on distribution shift dynamics in iterated training loops. We first confirm that the distribution shift dynamics greatly vary depending on the human data by comparing four datasets (two based on Twitter and two on Reddit). We then test whether data quality may influence the rate of this shift. We find that it does on the twitter, but not on the Reddit datasets. We then focus on a Reddit dataset and conduct a more exhaustive evaluation of a large set of dataset properties. This experiment associated lexical diversity with larger, and semantic diversity with smaller detrimental shifts, suggesting that incorporating text with high lexical (but limited semantic) diversity could exacerbate the degradation of generated text. We then focus on the evolution of political bias, and find that the type of shift observed (bias reduction, amplification or inversion) depends on the political lean of the human (true) distribution. Overall, our work extends the existing literature on the consequences of recursive fine-tuning by showing that this phenomenon is highly dependent on features of the human data on which training occurs. This suggests that different parts of internet (e.g. GitHub, Reddit) may undergo different types of shift depending on their properties.</description>

      <title>CORTEX-AVD: CORner Case Testing &amp; EXploration for Autonomous Vehicles Development</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03989v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) aim to improve traffic safety and efficiency by reducing human error. However, ensuring AVs reliability and safety is a challenging task when rare, high-risk traffic scenarios are considered. These 'Corner Cases' (CC) scenarios, such as unexpected vehicle maneuvers or sudden pedestrian crossings, must be safely and reliable dealt by AVs during their operations. But they arehard to be efficiently generated. Traditional CC generation relies on costly and risky real-world data acquisition, limiting scalability, and slowing research and development progress. Simulation-based techniques also face challenges, as modeling diverse scenarios and capturing all possible CCs is complex and time-consuming. To address these limitations in CC generation, this research introduces CORTEX-AVD, CORner Case Testing &amp; EXploration for Autonomous Vehicles Development, an open-source framework that integrates the CARLA Simulator and Scenic to automatically generate CC from textual descriptions, increasing the diversity and automation of scenario modeling. Genetic Algorithms (GA) are used to optimize the scenario parameters in six case study scenarios, increasing the occurrence of high-risk events. Unlike previous methods, CORTEX-AVD incorporates a multi-factor fitness function that considers variables such as distance, time, speed, and collision likelihood. Additionally, the study provides a benchmark for comparing GA-based CC generation methods, contributing to a more standardized evaluation of synthetic data generation and scenario assessment. Experimental results demonstrate that the CORTEX-AVD framework significantly increases CC incidence while reducing the proportion of wasted simulations.</description>

      <title>Improving Mixed-Criticality Scheduling with Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03994v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel reinforcement learning (RL) approach to scheduling mixed-criticality (MC) systems on processors with varying speeds. Building upon the foundation laid by [1], we extend their work to address the non-preemptive scheduling problem, which is known to be NP-hard. By modeling this scheduling challenge as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), we develop an RL agent capable of generating near-optimal schedules for real-time MC systems. Our RL-based scheduler prioritizes high-critical tasks while maintaining overall system performance.
  Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the scalability and effectiveness of our approach. The RL scheduler significantly improves task completion rates, achieving around 80% overall and 85% for high-criticality tasks across 100,000 instances of synthetic data and real data under varying system conditions. Moreover, under stable conditions without degradation, the scheduler achieves 94% overall task completion and 93% for high-criticality tasks. These results highlight the potential of RL-based schedulers in real-time and safety-critical applications, offering substantial improvements in handling complex and dynamic scheduling scenarios.</description>

      <title>IMPersona: Evaluating Individual Level LM Impersonation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04332v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As language models achieve increasingly human-like capabilities in conversational text generation, a critical question emerges: to what extent can these systems simulate the characteristics of specific individuals? To evaluate this, we introduce IMPersona, a framework for evaluating LMs at impersonating specific individuals' writing style and personal knowledge. Using supervised fine-tuning and a hierarchical memory-inspired retrieval system, we demonstrate that even modestly sized open-source models, such as Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, can achieve impersonation abilities at concerning levels. In blind conversation experiments, participants (mis)identified our fine-tuned models with memory integration as human in 44.44% of interactions, compared to just 25.00% for the best prompting-based approach. We analyze these results to propose detection methods and defense strategies against such impersonation attempts. Our findings raise important questions about both the potential applications and risks of personalized language models, particularly regarding privacy, security, and the ethical deployment of such technologies in real-world contexts.</description>

Abstract: Loops--short audio segments designed for seamless repetition--are central to many music genres, particularly those rooted in dance and electronic styles. However, current generative music models struggle to produce truly loopable audio, as generating a short waveform alone does not guarantee a smooth transition from its endpoint back to its start, often resulting in audible discontinuities. Loops--short audio segments designed for seamless repetition--are central to many music genres, particularly those rooted in dance and electronic styles. However, current generative music models struggle to produce truly loopable audio, as generating a short waveform alone does not guarantee a smooth transition from its endpoint back to its start, often resulting in audible discontinuities. We address this gap by modifying a non-autoregressive model (MAGNeT) to generate tokens in a circular pattern, letting the model attend to the beginning of the audio when creating its ending. This inference-only approach results in generations that are aware of future context and loop naturally, without the need for any additional training or data. We evaluate the consistency of loop transitions by computing token perplexity around the seam of the loop, observing a 55% improvement. Blind listening tests further confirm significant perceptual gains over baseline methods, improving mean ratings by 70%. Taken together, these results highlight the effectiveness of inference-only approaches in improving generative models and underscore the advantages of non-autoregressive methods for context-aware music generation.</description>

      <title>Your Image Generator Is Your New Private Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04582v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative diffusion models have emerged as powerful tools to synthetically produce training data, offering potential solutions to data scarcity and reducing labelling costs for downstream supervised deep learning applications. However, effectively leveraging text-conditioned image generation for building classifier training sets requires addressing key issues: constructing informative textual prompts, adapting generative models to specific domains, and ensuring robust performance. This paper proposes the Text-Conditioned Knowledge Recycling (TCKR) pipeline to tackle these challenges. TCKR combines dynamic image captioning, parameter-efficient diffusion model fine-tuning, and Generative Knowledge Distillation techniques to create synthetic datasets tailored for image classification. The pipeline is rigorously evaluated on ten diverse image classification benchmarks. The results demonstrate that models trained solely on TCKR-generated data achieve classification accuracies on par with (and in several cases exceeding) models trained on real images. Furthermore, the evaluation reveals that these synthetic-data-trained models exhibit substantially enhanced privacy characteristics: their vulnerability to Membership Inference Attacks is significantly reduced, with the membership inference AUC lowered by 5.49 points on average compared to using real training data, demonstrating a substantial improvement in the performance-privacy trade-off. These findings indicate that high-fidelity synthetic data can effectively replace real data for training classifiers, yielding strong performance whilst simultaneously providing improved privacy protection as a valuable emergent property. The code and trained models are available in the accompanying open-source repository.</description>

      <title>Beyond Single-Turn: A Survey on Multi-Turn Interactions with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04717v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized their ability to handle single-turn tasks, yet real-world applications demand sophisticated multi-turn interactions. This survey provides a comprehensive review of recent advancements in evaluating and enhancing multi-turn interactions in LLMs. Focusing on task-specific scenarios, from instruction following in diverse domains such as math and coding to complex conversational engagements in roleplay, healthcare, education, and even adversarial jailbreak settings, we systematically examine the challenges of maintaining context, coherence, fairness, and responsiveness over prolonged dialogues. The paper organizes current benchmarks and datasets into coherent categories that reflect the evolving landscape of multi-turn dialogue evaluation. In addition, we review a range of enhancement methodologies under multi-turn settings, including model-centric strategies (contextual learning, supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning, and new architectures), external integration approaches (memory-augmented, retrieval-based methods, and knowledge graph), and agent-based techniques for collaborative interactions. Finally, we discuss open challenges and propose future directions for research to further advance the robustness and effectiveness of multi-turn interactions in LLMs. Related resources and papers are available at https://github.com/yubol-cmu/Awesome-Multi-Turn-LLMs.</description>

      <title>Lumina-OmniLV: A Unified Multimodal Framework for General Low-Level Vision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04903v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present Lunima-OmniLV (abbreviated as OmniLV), a universal multimodal multi-task framework for low-level vision that addresses over 100 sub-tasks across four major categories: image restoration, image enhancement, weak-semantic dense prediction, and stylization. OmniLV leverages both textual and visual prompts to offer flexible and user-friendly interactions. Built on Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based generative priors, our framework supports arbitrary resolutions -- achieving optimal performance at 1K resolution -- while preserving fine-grained details and high fidelity. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that separately encoding text and visual instructions, combined with co-training using shallow feature control, is essential to mitigate task ambiguity and enhance multi-task generalization. Our findings also reveal that integrating high-level generative tasks into low-level vision models can compromise detail-sensitive restoration. These insights pave the way for more robust and generalizable low-level vision systems.</description>

      <title>A Taxonomy of Self-Handover</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04939v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Self-handover, transferring an object between one's own hands, is a common but understudied bimanual action. While it facilitates seamless transitions in complex tasks, the strategies underlying its execution remain largely unexplored. Here, we introduce the first systematic taxonomy of self-handover, derived from manual annotation of over 12 hours of cooking activity performed by 21 participants. Our analysis reveals that self-handover is not merely a passive transition, but a highly coordinated action involving anticipatory adjustments by both hands. As a step toward automated analysis of human manipulation, we further demonstrate the feasibility of classifying self-handover types using a state-of-the-art vision-language model. These findings offer fresh insights into bimanual coordination, underscoring the role of self-handover in enabling smooth task transitions-an ability essential for adaptive dual-arm robotics.</description>

      <title>Leveraging LLMs for Utility-Focused Annotation: Reducing Manual Effort for Retrieval and RAG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05220v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Retrieval models typically rely on costly human-labeled query-document relevance annotations for training and evaluation. To reduce this cost and leverage the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in relevance judgments, we aim to explore whether LLM-generated annotations can effectively replace human annotations in training retrieval models. Retrieval usually emphasizes relevance, which indicates "topic-relatedness" of a document to a query, while in RAG, the value of a document (or utility) depends on how it contributes to answer generation. Recognizing this mismatch, some researchers use LLM performance on downstream tasks with documents as labels, but this approach requires manual answers for specific tasks, leading to high costs and limited generalization. In another line of work, prompting LLMs to select useful documents as RAG references eliminates the need for human annotation and is not task-specific. If we leverage LLMs' utility judgments to annotate retrieval data, we may retain cross-task generalization without human annotation in large-scale corpora. Therefore, we investigate utility-focused annotation via LLMs for large-scale retriever training data across both in-domain and out-of-domain settings on the retrieval and RAG tasks. To reduce the impact of low-quality positives labeled by LLMs, we design a novel loss function, i.e., Disj-InfoNCE. Our experiments reveal that: (1) Retrievers trained on utility-focused annotations significantly outperform those trained on human annotations in the out-of-domain setting on both tasks, demonstrating superior generalization capabilities. (2) LLM annotation does not replace human annotation in the in-domain setting. However, incorporating just 20% human-annotated data enables retrievers trained with utility-focused annotations to match the performance of models trained entirely with human annotations.</description>
