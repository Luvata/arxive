<title>DiffSpectralNet : Unveiling the Potential of Diffusion Models for Hyperspectral Image Classification. (arXiv:2312.12441v1 [cs.CV])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12441</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Hyperspectral images (HSI) have become popular for analysing remotely sensed
images in multiple domain like agriculture, medical. However, existing models
struggle with complex relationships and characteristics of spectral-spatial
data due to the multi-band nature and data redundancy of hyperspectral data. To
address this limitation, we propose a new network called DiffSpectralNet, which
combines diffusion and transformer techniques. Our approach involves a two-step
process. First, we use an unsupervised learning framework based on the
diffusion model to extract both high-level and low-level spectral-spatial
features. The diffusion method is capable of extracting diverse and meaningful
spectral-spatial features, leading to improvement in HSI classification. Then,
we employ a pretrained denoising U-Net to extract intermediate hierarchical
features for classification. Finally, we use a supervised transformer-based
classifier to perform the HSI classification. Through comprehensive experiments
on HSI datasets, we evaluate the classification performance of DiffSpectralNet.
The results demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms existing
approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

<title>Enhancing Understanding of Driving Attributes through Quantitative Assessment of Driver Cognition. (arXiv:2312.12443v1 [eess.SP])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12443</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;This paper presents a novel approach for analysing EEG data from drivers in a
simulated driving test. We focused on the Hurst exponent, Shannon entropy, and
fractal dimension as markers of the nonlinear dynamics of the brain. The
results show significant trends: Shannon Entropy and Fractal Dimension exhibit
variations during driving condition transitions, whereas the Hurst exponent
reflects memory retention portraying learning patterns. These findings suggest
that the tools of Non-linear Dynamical (NLD) Theory as indicators of cognitive
state and driving memory changes for assessing driver performance and advancing
the understanding of non-linear dynamics of human cognition in the context of
driving and beyond. Our study reveals the potential of NLD tools to elucidate
brain state and system variances, enabling their integration into current Deep
Learning and Machine Learning models. This integration can extend beyond
driving applications and be harnessed for cognitive learning, thereby improving
overall productivity and accuracy levels.

<title>Can It Edit? Evaluating the Ability of Large Language Models to Follow Code Editing Instructions. (arXiv:2312.12450v1 [cs.SE])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12450</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;A significant amount of research is focused on developing and evaluating
large language models for a variety of code synthesis tasks. These include
synthesizing code from natural language instructions, synthesizing tests from
code, and synthesizing explanations of code. In contrast, the behavior of
instructional code editing with LLMs is understudied. These are tasks in which
the model is instructed to update a block of code provided in a prompt. The
editing instruction may ask for a feature to added or removed, describe a bug
and ask for a fix, ask for a different kind of solution, or many other common
code editing tasks.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We introduce a carefully crafted benchmark of code editing tasks and use it
evaluate several cutting edge LLMs. Our evaluation exposes a significant gap
between the capabilities of state-of-the-art open and closed models. For
example, even GPT-3.5-Turbo is 8.8% better than the best open model at editing
code.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also introduce a new, carefully curated, permissively licensed training
set of code edits coupled with natural language instructions. Using this
training set, we show that we can fine-tune open Code LLMs to significantly
improve their code editing capabilities.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;A basic experiment in probability theory is drawing without replacement from
an urn filled with multiple balls of different colours. Clearly, it is
physically impossible to overdraw, that is, to draw more balls from the urn

mathematically, once we allow signed distributions with negative probabilities.
A new (conservative) extension of the familiar hypergeometric

sizes, including overdraws. The underlying theory makes use of the dual basis
functions of the Bernstein polynomials, which play a prominent role in computer

categorical probability and the central role of datastructures such as

<title>FengWu-4DVar: Coupling the Data-driven Weather Forecasting Model with 4D Variational Assimilation. (arXiv:2312.12455v1 [physics.ao-ph])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12455</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Weather forecasting is a crucial yet highly challenging task. With the
maturity of Artificial Intelligence (AI), the emergence of data-driven weather
forecasting models has opened up a new paradigm for the development of weather
forecasting systems. Despite the significant successes that have been achieved
(e.g., surpassing advanced traditional physical models for global medium-range
forecasting), existing data-driven weather forecasting models still rely on the
analysis fields generated by the traditional assimilation and forecasting
system, which hampers the significance of data-driven weather forecasting
models regarding both computational cost and forecasting accuracy. In this
work, we explore the possibility of coupling the data-driven weather
forecasting model with data assimilation by integrating the global AI weather
forecasting model, FengWu, with one of the most popular assimilation
algorithms, Four-Dimensional Variational (4DVar) assimilation, and develop an
AI-based cyclic weather forecasting system, FengWu-4DVar. FengWu-4DVar can
incorporate observational data into the data-driven weather forecasting model
and consider the temporal evolution of atmospheric dynamics to obtain accurate
analysis fields for making predictions in a cycling manner without the help of
physical models. Owning to the auto-differentiation ability of deep learning
models, FengWu-4DVar eliminates the need of developing the cumbersome adjoint
model, which is usually required in the traditional implementation of the 4DVar
algorithm. Experiments on the simulated observational dataset demonstrate that
FengWu-4DVar is capable of generating reasonable analysis fields for making
accurate and efficient iterative predictions.

<title>PowerInfer: Fast Large Language Model Serving with a Consumer-grade GPU. (arXiv:2312.12456v1 [cs.LG])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12456</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;This paper introduces PowerInfer, a high-speed Large Language Model (LLM)
inference engine on a personal computer (PC) equipped with a single
consumer-grade GPU. The key underlying the design of PowerInfer is exploiting
the high locality inherent in LLM inference, characterized by a power-law
distribution in neuron activation. This distribution indicates that a small
subset of neurons, termed hot neurons, are consistently activated across
inputs, while the majority, cold neurons, vary based on specific inputs.
PowerInfer exploits such an insight to design a GPU-CPU hybrid inference
engine: hot-activated neurons are preloaded onto the GPU for fast access, while
cold-activated neurons are computed on the CPU, thus significantly reducing GPU
memory demands and CPU-GPU data transfers. PowerInfer further integrates
adaptive predictors and neuron-aware sparse operators, optimizing the
efficiency of neuron activation and computational sparsity. Evaluation shows
that PowerInfer attains an average token generation rate of 13.20 tokens/s,
with a peak of 29.08 tokens/s, across various LLMs (including OPT-175B) on a
single NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU, only 18% lower than that achieved by a top-tier
server-grade A100 GPU. This significantly outperforms llama.cpp by up to 11.69x
while retaining model accuracy.

<title>Let AI Entertain You: Increasing User Engagement with Generative AI and Rejection Sampling. (arXiv:2312.12457v1 [cs.HC])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12457</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;While generative AI excels in content generation, it does not always increase
user engagement. This can be attributed to two main factors. First, generative
AI generates content without incorporating explicit or implicit feedback about
user interactions. Even if the generated content seems to be more informative
or well-written, it does not necessarily lead to an increase in user
activities, such as clicks. Second, there is a concern with the quality of the
content generative AI produces, which often lacks the distinctiveness and
authenticity that human-created content possesses. These two factors can lead
to content that fails to meet specific needs and preferences of users,
ultimately reducing its potential to be engaging.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This paper presents a generic framework of how to improve user engagement
with generative AI by leveraging user feedback. Our solutions employ rejection
sampling, a technique used in reinforcement learning, to boost engagement
metrics. We leveraged the framework in the context of email notification
subject lines generation for an online social network, and achieved significant
engagement metric lift including +1% Session and +0.4% Weekly Active Users. We
believe our work offers a universal framework that enhances user engagement
with generative AI, particularly when standard generative AI reaches its limits
in terms of enhancing content to be more captivating. To the best of our
knowledge, this represents an early milestone in the industry&apos;s successful use
of generative AI to enhance user engagement.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;AI is increasingly playing a pivotal role in businesses and organizations,
impacting the outcomes and interests of human users. Automated Machine Learning
(AutoML) streamlines the machine learning model development process by
automating repetitive tasks and making data-driven decisions, enabling even
non-experts to construct high-quality models efficiently. This democratization
allows more users (including non-experts) to access and utilize
state-of-the-art machine-learning expertise. However, AutoML tools may also
propagate bias in the way these tools handle the data, model choices, and
optimization approaches adopted. We conducted an experimental study of
User-interface-based open source AutoML tools (DataRobot, H2O Studio, Dataiku,
and Rapidminer Studio) to examine if they had features to assist users in
developing fairness-aware machine learning models. The experiments covered the
following considerations for the evaluation of features: understanding use case
context, data representation, feature relevance and sensitivity, data bias and
preprocessing techniques, data handling capabilities, training-testing split,
hyperparameter handling, and constraints, fairness-oriented model development,
explainability and ability to download and edit models by the user. The results
revealed inadequacies in features that could support in fairness-aware model
development. Further, the results also highlight the need to establish certain

<title>Bird Movement Prediction Using Long Short-Term Memory Networks to Prevent Bird Strikes with Low Altitude Aircraft. (arXiv:2312.12461v1 [cs.LG])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12461</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;The number of collisions between aircraft and birds in the airspace has been
increasing at an alarming rate over the past decade due to increasing bird
population, air traffic and usage of quieter aircraft. Bird strikes with
aircraft are anticipated to increase dramatically when emerging Advanced Air
Mobility aircraft start operating in the low altitude airspace where
probability of bird strikes is the highest. Not only do such bird strikes can
result in human and bird fatalities, but they also cost the aviation industry
millions of dollars in damages to aircraft annually. To better understand the
causes and effects of bird strikes, research to date has mainly focused on
analyzing factors which increase the probability of bird strikes, identifying
high risk birds in different locations, predicting the future number of bird
strike incidents, and estimating cost of bird strike damages. However, research
on bird movement prediction for use in flight planning algorithms to minimize
the probability of bird strikes is very limited. To address this gap in
research, we implement four different types of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
models to predict bird movement latitudes and longitudes. A publicly available
data set on the movement of pigeons is utilized to train the models and
evaluate their performances. Using the bird flight track predictions, aircraft
departures from Cleveland Hopkins airport are simulated to be delayed by
varying amounts to avoid potential bird strikes with aircraft during takeoff.
Results demonstrate that the LSTM models can predict bird movement with high
accuracy, achieving a Mean Absolute Error of less than 100 meters,
outperforming linear and nonlinear regression models. Our findings indicate
that incorporating bird movement prediction into flight planning can be highly
beneficial.

<title>Towards an End-to-End Artificial Intelligence Driven Global Weather Forecasting System. (arXiv:2312.12462v1 [physics.ao-ph])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12462</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;The weather forecasting system is important for science and society, and
significant achievements have been made in applying artificial intelligence
(AI) to medium-range weather forecasting. However, existing AI-based weather
forecasting models still rely on analysis or reanalysis products from the
traditional numerical weather prediction (NWP) systems as initial conditions
for making predictions, preventing them from being fully independent systems.
As a crucial component of an end-to-end global weather forecasting system, data
assimilation is vital in generating initial states for forecasting. In this
paper, we present an AI-based data assimilation model, i.e., Adas, for global
weather variables, which learns to generate the analysis from the background
and sparse observations. Different from existing assimilation methods, Adas
employs the gated convolution module to handle sparse observations and the
gated cross-attention module for capturing the interactions between
observations and background efficiently, which are guided by the confidence
matrix to represent the availability and quality of observations. Then, we
combine Adas with the advanced AI-based weather forecasting model (i.e.,
FengWu) and construct the first end-to-end AI-based global weather forecasting
system: FengWu-Adas. Experiments demonstrate that Adas can assimilate the
simulated global observations with the AI-generated background through a
one-year simulation and generate high-quality analysis stably in a cyclic
manner. Based on the generated analysis, FengWu-Adas exhibits skillful
performance and outperforms the Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) in weather
forecasting over seven days.

<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12467</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Recently, many mesh-based graph neural network (GNN) models have been
proposed for modeling complex high-dimensional physical systems. Remarkable
achievements have been made in significantly reducing the solving time compared
to traditional numerical solvers. These methods are typically designed to i)
reduce the computational cost in solving physical dynamics and/or ii) propose
techniques to enhance the solution accuracy in fluid and rigid body dynamics.
However, it remains under-explored whether they are effective in addressing the
challenges of flexible body dynamics, where instantaneous collisions occur
within a very short timeframe. In this paper, we present Hierarchical Contact
Mesh Transformer (HCMT), which uses hierarchical mesh structures and can learn
long-range dependencies (occurred by collisions) among spatially distant
positions of a body -- two close positions in a higher-level mesh corresponds
to two distant positions in a lower-level mesh. HCMT enables long-range
interactions, and the hierarchical mesh structure quickly propagates collision
effects to faraway positions. To this end, it consists of a contact mesh
Transformer and a hierarchical mesh Transformer (CMT and HMT, respectively).
Lastly, we propose a flexible body dynamics dataset, consisting of trajectories
that reflect experimental settings frequently used in the display industry for
product designs. We also compare the performance of several baselines using
well-known benchmark datasets. Our results show that HCMT provides significant
performance improvements over existing methods.

performance. In this paper, we propose a generic Guided Non-Autoregressive
Knowledge Distillation (GNARKD) method to obtain high-performance NAR models
having a low inference latency. GNARKD removes the constraint of sequential
generation in AR models while preserving the learned pivotal components in the
network architecture to obtain the corresponding NAR models through knowledge
distillation. We evaluate GNARKD by applying it to three widely adopted AR
models to obtain NAR VRP solvers for both synthesized and real-world instances.
The experimental results demonstrate that GNARKD significantly reduces the
inference time (4-5 times faster) with acceptable performance drop (2-3\%). To
the best of our knowledge, this study is first-of-its-kind to obtain NAR VRP
solvers from AR ones through knowledge distillation.

<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12474</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Input-Convex Neural Networks (ICNNs) are networks that guarantee convexity in
their input-output mapping. These networks have been successfully applied for
energy-based modelling, optimal transport problems and learning invariances.
The convexity of ICNNs is achieved by using non-decreasing convex activation
functions and non-negative weights. Because of these peculiarities, previous
initialisation strategies, which implicitly assume centred weights, are not
effective for ICNNs. By studying signal propagation through layers with
non-negative weights, we are able to derive a principled weight initialisation
for ICNNs. Concretely, we generalise signal propagation theory by removing the
assumption that weights are sampled from a centred distribution. In a set of
experiments, we demonstrate that our principled initialisation effectively
accelerates learning in ICNNs and leads to better generalisation. Moreover, we
find that, in contrast to common belief, ICNNs can be trained without
skip-connections when initialised correctly. Finally, we apply ICNNs to a
real-world drug discovery task and show that they allow for more effective
molecular latent space exploration.

<title>Learning to Reweight for Graph Neural Network. (arXiv:2312.12475v1 [cs.LG])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12475</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) show promising results for graph tasks. However,
existing GNNs&apos; generalization ability will degrade when there exist
distribution shifts between testing and training graph data. The cardinal
impetus underlying the severe degeneration is that the GNNs are architected
predicated upon the I.I.D assumptions. In such a setting, GNNs are inclined to
leverage imperceptible statistical correlations subsisting in the training set
to predict, albeit it is a spurious correlation. In this paper, we study the
problem of the generalization ability of GNNs in Out-Of-Distribution (OOD)
settings. To solve this problem, we propose the Learning to Reweight for
Generalizable Graph Neural Network (L2R-GNN) to enhance the generalization
ability for achieving satisfactory performance on unseen testing graphs that
have different distributions with training graphs. We propose a novel nonlinear
graph decorrelation method, which can substantially improve the
out-of-distribution generalization ability and compares favorably to previous
methods in restraining the over-reduced sample size. The variables of the graph
representation are clustered based on the stability of the correlation, and the
graph decorrelation method learns weights to remove correlations between the
variables of different clusters rather than any two variables. Besides, we
interpose an efficacious stochastic algorithm upon bi-level optimization for
the L2R-GNN framework, which facilitates simultaneously learning the optimal
weights and GNN parameters, and avoids the overfitting problem. Experimental
results show that L2R-GNN greatly outperforms baselines on various graph
prediction benchmarks under distribution shifts.

<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12476</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;While widely recognized as one of the most substantial weather forecasting
methodologies, Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) usually suffers from
relatively coarse resolution and inevitable bias due to tempo-spatial
discretization, physical parametrization process, and computation limitation.
With the roaring growth of deep learning-based techniques, we propose the
Dual-Stage Adaptive Framework (DSAF), a novel framework to address regional NWP
downscaling and bias correction tasks. DSAF uniquely incorporates adaptive
elements in its design to ensure a flexible response to evolving weather
conditions. Specifically, NWP downscaling and correction are well-decoupled in
the framework and can be applied independently, which strategically guides the
optimization trajectory of the model. Utilizing a multi-task learning mechanism
and an uncertainty-weighted loss function, DSAF facilitates balanced training
across various weather factors. Additionally, our specifically designed
attention-centric learnable module effectively integrates geographic
information, proficiently managing complex interrelationships. Experimental
validation on the ECMWF operational forecast (HRES) and reanalysis (ERA5)
archive demonstrates DSAF&apos;s superior performance over existing state-of-the-art
models and shows substantial improvements when existing models are augmented
using our proposed modules. Code is publicly available at

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful representation learning
tools for capturing complex dependencies within diverse graph-structured data.
Despite their success in a wide range of graph mining tasks, GNNs have raised
serious concerns regarding their trustworthiness, including susceptibility to
distribution shift, biases towards certain populations, and lack of
explainability. Recently, integrating causal learning techniques into GNNs has
sparked numerous ground-breaking studies since most of the trustworthiness
issues can be alleviated by capturing the underlying data causality rather than
superficial correlations. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of
recent research efforts on causality-inspired GNNs. Specifically, we first
present the key trustworthy risks of existing GNN models through the lens of
causality. Moreover, we introduce a taxonomy of Causality-Inspired GNNs
(CIGNNs) based on the type of causal learning capability they are equipped
with, i.e., causal reasoning and causal representation learning. Besides, we
systematically discuss typical methods within each category and demonstrate how
they mitigate trustworthiness risks. Finally, we summarize useful resources and
discuss several future directions, hoping to shed light on new research
opportunities in this emerging field. The representative papers, along with
open-source data and codes, are available in

<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12484</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Federated Learning (FL) is becoming a popular paradigm for leveraging
distributed data and preserving data privacy. However, due to the distributed
characteristic, FL systems are vulnerable to Byzantine attacks that compromised
clients attack the global model by uploading malicious model updates. Most
existing Byzantine-robust FL systems statistically analyze the weights of whole
individual model updates uploaded by clients to defend against Byzantine
attacks. With the development of layer-level and parameter-level fine-grained
attacks, the attacks&apos; stealthiness and effectiveness have been significantly
improved. Due to unawareness or overreaction, the existing model-level defense
methods degrade the training efficiency and model performance. To address this
problem, we propose SkyMask, a new attack-agnostic robust FL system that
leverages fine-grained learnable masks to identify malicious model updates at
the parameter-level. Specifically, the FL server applies parameter-level masks
to model updates uploaded by clients and trains the masks over a small clean
dataset (i.e., root dataset) to learn the subtle difference between benign and
malicious model updates in a high-dimension space. Our extensive experiments
involve different models on three public datasets under state-of-the-art (SOTA)
attacks, where the results show that SkyMask achieves up to 10% higher testing
accuracy compared with SOTA defense strategies and successfully defends against
attacks with malicious clients of a high fraction up to 80%. In the meantime,
the experimental results demonstrate the scalability of our approach and the
weak dependence on the data distribution of the root dataset.

<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12485</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Decision-focused learning is a promising development for contextual
optimisation. It enables us to train prediction models that reflect the
contextual sensitivity structure of the problem. However, there have been
limited attempts to extend this paradigm to robust optimisation. We propose a
double implicit layer model for training prediction models with respect to
robust decision loss in uncertain convex quadratically constrained quadratic
programs (QCQP). The first layer solves a deterministic version of the problem,
the second layer evaluates the worst case realisation for an uncertainty set
centred on the observation given the decisions obtained from the first layer.
This enables us to learn model parameterisations that lead to robust decisions
while only solving a simpler deterministic problem at test time. Additionally,
instead of having to solve a robust counterpart we solve two smaller and
potentially easier problems in training. The second layer (worst case problem)
can be seen as a regularisation approach for predict-and-optimise by fitting to
a neighbourhood of problems instead of just a point observation. We motivate
relaxations of the worst-case problem in cases of uncertainty sets that would
otherwise lead to trust region problems, and leverage various relaxations to
deal with uncertain constraints. Both layers are typically strictly convex in
this problem setting and thus have meaningful gradients almost everywhere. We
demonstrate an application of this model on simulated experiments. The method
is an effective regularisation tool for decision-focused learning for uncertain
convex QCQPs.

<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12487</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;This paper presents a comprehensive study on the role of Classifier-Free
Guidance (CFG) in text-conditioned diffusion models from the perspective of
inference efficiency. In particular, we relax the default choice of applying
CFG in all diffusion steps and instead search for efficient guidance policies.
We formulate the discovery of such policies in the differentiable Neural
Architecture Search framework. Our findings suggest that the denoising steps
proposed by CFG become increasingly aligned with simple conditional steps,
which renders the extra neural network evaluation of CFG redundant, especially
in the second half of the denoising process. Building upon this insight, we
propose &quot;Adaptive Guidance&quot; (AG), an efficient variant of CFG, that adaptively
omits network evaluations when the denoising process displays convergence. Our
experiments demonstrate that AG preserves CFG&apos;s image quality while reducing
computation by 25%. Thus, AG constitutes a plug-and-play alternative to
Guidance Distillation, achieving 50% of the speed-ups of the latter while being
training-free and retaining the capacity to handle negative prompts. Finally,
we uncover further redundancies of CFG in the first half of the diffusion
process, showing that entire neural function evaluations can be replaced by
simple affine transformations of past score estimates. This method, termed
LinearAG, offers even cheaper inference at the cost of deviating from the
baseline model. Our findings provide insights into the efficiency of the
conditional denoising process that contribute to more practical and swift
deployment of text-conditioned diffusion models.

<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12488</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Gradient inversion attacks can leak data privacy when clients share weight
updates with the server in federated learning (FL). Existing studies mainly use
L2 or cosine distance as the loss function for gradient matching in the attack.
Our empirical investigation shows that the vulnerability ranking varies with
the loss function used. Gradient norm, which is commonly used as a
vulnerability proxy for gradient inversion attack, cannot explain this as it
remains constant regardless of the loss function for gradient matching. In this
paper, we propose a loss-aware vulnerability proxy (LAVP) for the first time.
LAVP refers to either the maximum or minimum eigenvalue of the Hessian with
respect to gradient matching loss at ground truth. This suggestion is based on
our theoretical findings regarding the local optimization of the gradient
inversion in proximity to the ground truth, which corresponds to the worst case
attack scenario. We demonstrate the effectiveness of LAVP on various
architectures and datasets, showing its consistent superiority over the
gradient norm in capturing sample vulnerabilities. The performance of each
proxy is measured in terms of Spearman&apos;s rank correlation with respect to
several similarity scores. This work will contribute to enhancing FL security
against any potential loss functions beyond L2 or cosine distance in the
future.

<title>H-ensemble: An Information Theoretic Approach to Reliable Few-Shot Multi-Source-Free Transfer. (arXiv:2312.12489v1 [cs.LG])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12489</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Multi-source transfer learning is an effective solution to data scarcity by
utilizing multiple source tasks for the learning of the target task. However,
access to source data and model details is limited in the era of commercial
models, giving rise to the setting of multi-source-free (MSF) transfer learning
that aims to leverage source domain knowledge without such access. As a newly
defined problem paradigm, MSF transfer learning remains largely underexplored
and not clearly formulated. In this work, we adopt an information theoretic
perspective on it and propose a framework named H-ensemble, which dynamically
learns the optimal linear combination, or ensemble, of source models for the
target task, using a generalization of maximal correlation regression. The
ensemble weights are optimized by maximizing an information theoretic metric
for transferability. Compared to previous works, H-ensemble is characterized
by: 1) its adaptability to a novel and realistic MSF setting for few-shot
target tasks, 2) theoretical reliability, 3) a lightweight structure easy to
interpret and adapt. Our method is empirically validated by ablation studies,
along with extensive comparative analysis with other task ensemble and transfer
learning methods. We show that the H-ensemble can successfully learn the
optimal task ensemble, as well as outperform prior arts.

<title>InstructVideo: Instructing Video Diffusion Models with Human Feedback. (arXiv:2312.12490v1 [cs.CV])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12490</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Diffusion models have emerged as the de facto paradigm for video generation.
However, their reliance on web-scale data of varied quality often yields
results that are visually unappealing and misaligned with the textual prompts.
To tackle this problem, we propose InstructVideo to instruct text-to-video
diffusion models with human feedback by reward fine-tuning. InstructVideo has
two key ingredients: 1) To ameliorate the cost of reward fine-tuning induced by
generating through the full DDIM sampling chain, we recast reward fine-tuning
as editing. By leveraging the diffusion process to corrupt a sampled video,
InstructVideo requires only partial inference of the DDIM sampling chain,
reducing fine-tuning cost while improving fine-tuning efficiency. 2) To
mitigate the absence of a dedicated video reward model for human preferences,
we repurpose established image reward models, e.g., HPSv2. To this end, we
propose Segmental Video Reward, a mechanism to provide reward signals based on
segmental sparse sampling, and Temporally Attenuated Reward, a method that
mitigates temporal modeling degradation during fine-tuning. Extensive
experiments, both qualitative and quantitative, validate the practicality and
efficacy of using image reward models in InstructVideo, significantly enhancing
the visual quality of generated videos without compromising generalization
capabilities. Code and models will be made publicly available.

<title>StreamDiffusion: A Pipeline-level Solution for Real-time Interactive Generation. (arXiv:2312.12491v1 [cs.CV])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12491</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;We introduce StreamDiffusion, a real-time diffusion pipeline designed for
interactive image generation. Existing diffusion models are adept at creating
images from text or image prompts, yet they often fall short in real-time
interaction. This limitation becomes particularly evident in scenarios
involving continuous input, such as Metaverse, live video streaming, and
broadcasting, where high throughput is imperative. To address this, we present
a novel approach that transforms the original sequential denoising into the
batching denoising process. Stream Batch eliminates the conventional
wait-and-interact approach and enables fluid and high throughput streams. To
handle the frequency disparity between data input and model throughput, we
design a novel input-output queue for parallelizing the streaming process.
Moreover, the existing diffusion pipeline uses classifier-free guidance(CFG),
which requires additional U-Net computation. To mitigate the redundant
computations, we propose a novel residual classifier-free guidance (RCFG)
algorithm that reduces the number of negative conditional denoising steps to
only one or even zero. Besides, we introduce a stochastic similarity
filter(SSF) to optimize power consumption. Our Stream Batch achieves around
1.5x speedup compared to the sequential denoising method at different denoising
levels. The proposed RCFG leads to speeds up to 2.05x higher than the
conventional CFG. Combining the proposed strategies and existing mature
acceleration tools makes the image-to-image generation achieve up-to 91.07fps
on one RTX4090, improving the throughputs of AutoPipline developed by Diffusers
over 59.56x. Furthermore, our proposed StreamDiffusion also significantly
reduces the energy consumption by 2.39x on one RTX3060 and 1.99x on one
RTX4090, respectively.

<title>Blood Glucose Level Prediction: A Graph-based Explainable Method with Federated Learning. (arXiv:2312.12541v1 [cs.LG])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12541</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;In the UK, approximately 400,000 people with type 1 diabetes (T1D) rely on
insulin delivery due to insufficient pancreatic insulin production. Managing
blood glucose (BG) levels is crucial, with continuous glucose monitoring (CGM)
playing a key role. CGM, tracking BG every 5 minutes, enables effective blood
glucose level prediction (BGLP) by considering factors like carbohydrate intake
and insulin delivery.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent research has focused on developing sequential models for BGLP using
historical BG data, incorporating additional attributes such as carbohydrate
intake, insulin delivery, and time. These methods have shown notable success in
BGLP, with some providing temporal explanations. However, they often lack clear
correlations between attributes and their impact on BGLP. Additionally, some
methods raise privacy concerns by aggregating participant data to learn
population patterns.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Addressing these limitations, we introduced a graph attentive memory (GAM)
model, combining a graph attention network (GAT) with a gated recurrent unit
(GRU). GAT applies graph attention to model attribute correlations, offering
transparent, dynamic attribute relationships. Attention weights dynamically
gauge attribute significance over time. To ensure privacy, we employed
federated learning (FL), facilitating secure population pattern analysis.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our method was validated using the OhioT1DM&apos;18 and OhioT1DM&apos;20 datasets from
12 participants, focusing on 6 key attributes. We demonstrated our model&apos;s
stability and effectiveness through hyperparameter impact analysis.

<title>Sample Efficient Reinforcement Learning with Partial Dynamics Knowledge. (arXiv:2312.12558v1 [cs.LG])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12558</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;The problem of sample complexity of online reinforcement learning is often
studied in the literature without taking into account any partial knowledge
about the system dynamics that could potentially accelerate the learning
process. In this paper, we study the sample complexity of online Q-learning
methods when some prior knowledge about the dynamics is available or can be
learned efficiently. We focus on systems that evolve according to an additive
disturbance model of the form $S_{h+1} = f(S_h, A_h) + W_h$, where $f$
represents the underlying system dynamics, and $W_h$ are unknown disturbances
independent of states and actions. In the setting of finite episodic Markov
decision processes with $S$ states, $A$ actions, and episode length $H$, we
present an optimistic Q-learning algorithm that achieves
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\text{Poly}(H)\sqrt{T})$ regret under perfect knowledge of
$f$, where $T$ is the total number of interactions with the system. This is in
contrast to the typical $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\text{Poly}(H)\sqrt{SAT})$ regret
for existing Q-learning methods. Further, if only a noisy estimate $\hat{f}$ of
$f$ is available, our method can learn an approximately optimal policy in a
number of samples that is independent of the cardinalities of state and action
spaces. The sub-optimality gap depends on the approximation error $\hat{f}-f$,
as well as the Lipschitz constant of the corresponding optimal value function.
Our approach does not require modeling of the transition probabilities and
enjoys the same memory complexity as model-free methods.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Reinforcement learning solutions have great success in the 2-player general
sum setting. In this setting, the paradigm of Opponent Shaping (OS), in which
agents account for the learning of their co-players, has led to agents which
are able to avoid collectively bad outcomes, whilst also maximizing their
reward. These methods have currently been limited to 2-player game. However,
the real world involves interactions with many more agents, with interactions
on both local and global scales. In this paper, we extend Opponent Shaping (OS)
methods to environments involving multiple co-players and multiple shaping
agents. We evaluate on over 4 different environments, varying the number of
players from 3 to 5, and demonstrate that model-based OS methods converge to
equilibrium with better global welfare than naive learning. However, we find
that when playing with a large number of co-players, OS methods&apos; relative
performance reduces, suggesting that in the limit OS methods may not perform
well. Finally, we explore scenarios where more than one OS method is present,
noticing that within games requiring a majority of cooperating agents, OS
methods converge to outcomes with poor global welfare.

<title>Generator Assisted Mixture of Experts For Feature Acquisition in Batch. (arXiv:2312.12574v1 [cs.LG])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12574</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Given a set of observations, feature acquisition is about finding the subset
of unobserved features which would enhance accuracy. Such problems have been
explored in a sequential setting in prior work. Here, the model receives
feedback from every new feature acquired and chooses to explore more features
or to predict. However, sequential acquisition is not feasible in some settings
where time is of the essence. We consider the problem of feature acquisition in
batch, where the subset of features to be queried in batch is chosen based on
the currently observed features, and then acquired as a batch, followed by
prediction. We solve this problem using several technical innovations. First,
we use a feature generator to draw a subset of the synthetic features for some
examples, which reduces the cost of oracle queries. Second, to make the feature
acquisition problem tractable for the large heterogeneous observed features, we
partition the data into buckets, by borrowing tools from locality sensitive
hashing and then train a mixture of experts model. Third, we design a tractable
lower bound of the original objective. We use a greedy algorithm combined with
model training to solve the underlying problem. Experiments with four datasets
show that our approach outperforms these methods in terms of trade-off between
accuracy and feature acquisition cost.

<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12578</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;The impressive expressive power of deep neural networks (DNNs) underlies
their widespread applicability. However, while the theoretical capacity of deep
architectures is high, the practical expressive power achieved through
successful training often falls short. Building on the insights gained from
Neural ODEs, which explore the depth of DNNs as a continuous variable, in this
work, we generalize the traditional fully connected DNN through the concept of
continuous width. In the Generalized Deep Neural Network (GDNN), the
traditional notion of neurons in each layer is replaced by a continuous state
function. Using the finite rank parameterization of the weight integral kernel,
we establish that GDNN can be obtained by employing the Integral Activation
Transform (IAT) as activation layers within the traditional DNN framework. The
IAT maps the input vector to a function space using some basis functions,
followed by nonlinear activation in the function space, and then extracts
information through the integration with another collection of basis functions.
A specific variant, IAT-ReLU, featuring the ReLU nonlinearity, serves as a
smooth generalization of the scalar ReLU activation. Notably, IAT-ReLU exhibits
a continuous activation pattern when continuous basis functions are employed,
making it smooth and enhancing the trainability of the DNN. Our numerical
experiments demonstrate that IAT-ReLU outperforms regular ReLU in terms of
trainability and better smoothness.

<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12583</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;For robotic decision-making under uncertainty, the balance between
exploitation and exploration of available options must be carefully taken into
account. In this study, we introduce a new variant of contextual multi-armed
bandits called observation-augmented CMABs (OA-CMABs) wherein a decision-making
agent can utilize extra outcome observations from an external information
source. CMABs model the expected option outcomes as a function of context
features and hidden parameters, which are inferred from previous option
outcomes. In OA-CMABs, external observations are also a function of context
features and thus provide additional evidence about the hidden parameters. Yet,
if an external information source is error-prone, the resulting posterior
updates can harm decision-making performance unless the presence of errors is
considered. To this end, we propose a robust Bayesian inference process for
OA-CMABs that is based on the concept of probabilistic data validation. Our
approach handles complex mixture model parameter priors and hybrid observation
likelihoods for semantic data sources, allowing us to develop validation
algorithms based on recently develop probabilistic semantic data association
techniques. Furthermore, to more effectively cope with the combined sources of
uncertainty in OA-CMABs, we derive a new active inference algorithm for option
selection based on expected free energy minimization. This generalizes previous
work on active inference for bandit-based robotic decision-making by accounting
for faulty observations and non-Gaussian inference. Our approaches are
demonstrated on a simulated asynchronous search site selection problem for
space exploration. The results show that even if incorrect observations are
provided by external information sources, efficient decision-making and robust
parameter inference are still achieved in a wide variety of experimental
conditions.

intense attack strategies to ensure attack success. However, these methods
suffer from high attack costs and increased detectability. In this work, we
propose a novel approach, BadRL, which focuses on conducting highly sparse
backdoor poisoning efforts during training and testing while maintaining
successful attacks. Our algorithm, BadRL, strategically chooses state
observations with high attack values to inject triggers during training and
testing, thereby reducing the chances of detection. In contrast to the previous
methods that utilize sample-agnostic trigger patterns, BadRL dynamically
generates distinct trigger patterns based on targeted state observations,
thereby enhancing its effectiveness. Theoretical analysis shows that the
targeted backdoor attack is always viable and remains stealthy under specific
assumptions. Empirical results on various classic RL tasks illustrate that
BadRL can substantially degrade the performance of a victim agent with minimal
poisoning efforts 0.003% of total training steps) during training and
infrequent attacks during testing.

<title>Robust Machine Learning by Transforming and Augmenting Imperfect Training Data. (arXiv:2312.12597v1 [cs.LG])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12597</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Machine Learning (ML) is an expressive framework for turning data into
computer programs. Across many problem domains -- both in industry and policy
settings -- the types of computer programs needed for accurate prediction or
optimal control are difficult to write by hand. On the other hand, collecting
instances of desired system behavior may be relatively more feasible. This
makes ML broadly appealing, but also induces data sensitivities that often
manifest as unexpected failure modes during deployment. In this sense, the
training data available tend to be imperfect for the task at hand. This thesis
explores several data sensitivities of modern machine learning and how to
address them. We begin by discussing how to prevent ML from codifying prior
human discrimination measured in the training data, where we take a fair
representation learning approach. We then discuss the problem of learning from
data containing spurious features, which provide predictive fidelity during
training but are unreliable upon deployment. Here we observe that insofar as
standard training methods tend to learn such features, this propensity can be
leveraged to search for partitions of training data that expose this
inconsistency, ultimately promoting learning algorithms invariant to spurious
features. Finally, we turn our attention to reinforcement learning from data
with insufficient coverage over all possible states and actions. To address the
coverage issue, we discuss how causal priors can be used to model the
single-step dynamics of the setting where data are collected. This enables a
new type of data augmentation where observed trajectories are stitched together
to produce new but plausible counterfactual trajectories.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Colonoscopy plays a crucial role in the diagnosis and prognosis of various
gastrointestinal diseases. Due to the challenges of collecting large-scale
high-quality ground truth annotations for colonoscopy images, and more
generally medical images, we explore using self-supervised features from vision

indicate that image-level features learned from DINO models achieve image
classification performance comparable to fully supervised models, and
patch-level features contain rich semantic information for object detection.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that self-supervised features combined with

<title>Studying the Practices of Testing Machine Learning Software in the Wild. (arXiv:2312.12604v1 [cs.SE])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12604</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Background: We are witnessing an increasing adoption of machine learning
(ML), especially deep learning (DL) algorithms in many software systems,
including safety-critical systems such as health care systems or autonomous
driving vehicles. Ensuring the software quality of these systems is yet an open
challenge for the research community, mainly due to the inductive nature of ML
software systems. Traditionally, software systems were constructed deductively,
by writing down the rules that govern the behavior of the system as program
code. However, for ML software, these rules are inferred from training data.
Few recent research advances in the quality assurance of ML systems have
adapted different concepts from traditional software testing, such as mutation
testing, to help improve the reliability of ML software systems. However, it is
unclear if any of these proposed testing techniques from research are adopted
in practice. There is little empirical evidence about the testing strategies of
ML engineers. Aims: To fill this gap, we perform the first fine-grained
empirical study on ML testing practices in the wild, to identify the ML
properties being tested, the followed testing strategies, and their
implementation throughout the ML workflow. Method: First, we systematically
summarized the different testing strategies (e.g., Oracle Approximation), the
tested ML properties (e.g., Correctness, Bias, and Fairness), and the testing
methods (e.g., Unit test) from the literature. Then, we conducted a study to
understand the practices of testing ML software. Results: In our findings: 1)
we identified four (4) major categories of testing strategy including Grey-box,
White-box, Black-box, and Heuristic-based techniques that are used by the ML
engineers to find software bugs. 2) We identified 16 ML properties that are
tested in the ML workflow.

<title>Optimizing Neural Networks with Gradient Lexicase Selection. (arXiv:2312.12606v1 [cs.LG])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12606</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;One potential drawback of using aggregated performance measurement in machine
learning is that models may learn to accept higher errors on some training
cases as compromises for lower errors on others, with the lower errors actually
being instances of overfitting. This can lead to both stagnation at local
optima and poor generalization. Lexicase selection is an uncompromising method
developed in evolutionary computation, which selects models on the basis of
sequences of individual training case errors instead of using aggregated
metrics such as loss and accuracy. In this paper, we investigate how lexicase
selection, in its general form, can be integrated into the context of deep
learning to enhance generalization. We propose Gradient Lexicase Selection, an
optimization framework that combines gradient descent and lexicase selection in
an evolutionary fashion. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed
method improves the generalization performance of various widely-used deep
neural network architectures across three image classification benchmarks.
Additionally, qualitative analysis suggests that our method assists networks in
learning more diverse representations. Our source code is available on GitHub:

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Machine learning models have demonstrated remarkable success across diverse

applications of randomized smoothing in verifying machine learning classifiers.
We provide an in-depth exploration of the fundamental concepts underlying

robustness against adversarial perturbations. Additionally, we discuss the

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Being the most classical generative model for serial data, state-space models
(SSM) are fundamental in AI and statistical machine learning. In SSM, any form
of parameter learning or latent state inference typically involves the
computation of complex latent-state posteriors. In this work, we build upon the
variational sequential Monte Carlo (VSMC) method, which provides
computationally efficient and accurate model parameter estimation and Bayesian
latent-state inference by combining particle methods and variational inference.
While standard VSMC operates in the offline mode, by re-processing repeatedly a
given batch of data, we distribute the approximation of the gradient of the
VSMC surrogate ELBO in time using stochastic approximation, allowing for online
learning in the presence of streams of data. This results in an algorithm,
online VSMC, that is capable of performing efficiently, entirely on-the-fly,
both parameter estimation and particle proposal adaptation. In addition, we
provide rigorous theoretical results describing the algorithm&apos;s convergence
properties as the number of data tends to infinity as well as numerical
illustrations of its excellent convergence properties and usefulness also in
batch-processing settings.

<title>Calibrating Wireless Ray Tracing for Digital Twinning using Local Phase Error Estimates. (arXiv:2312.12625v1 [eess.SP])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12625</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Embodying the principle of simulation intelligence, digital twin (DT) systems
construct and maintain a high-fidelity virtual model of a physical system. This
paper focuses on ray tracing (RT), which is widely seen as an enabling
technology for DTs of the radio access network (RAN) segment of next-generation
disaggregated wireless systems. RT makes it possible to simulate channel
conditions, enabling data augmentation and prediction-based transmission.
However, the effectiveness of RT hinges on the adaptation of the
electromagnetic properties assumed by the RT to actual channel conditions, a
process known as calibration. The main challenge of RT calibration is the fact
that small discrepancies in the geometric model fed to the RT software hinder
the accuracy of the predicted phases of the simulated propagation paths.
Existing solutions to this problem either rely on the channel power profile,
hence disregarding phase information, or they operate on the channel responses
by assuming the simulated phases to be sufficiently accurate for calibration.
This paper proposes a novel channel response-based scheme that, unlike the
state of the art, estimates and compensates for the phase errors in the
RT-generated channel responses. The proposed approach builds on the variational
expectation maximization algorithm with a flexible choice of the prior
phase-error distribution that bridges between a deterministic model with no
phase errors and a stochastic model with uniform phase errors. The algorithm is
computationally efficient, and is demonstrated, by leveraging the open-source
differentiable RT software available within the Sionna library, to outperform
existing methods in terms of the accuracy of RT predictions.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;One of the central challenge for extracting governing principles of dynamical
system via Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) is about the limit data
availability or formally called as Limited Data Acquisition in the present
paper. In the interest of discovering the governing principles for a dynamical
system with limited data acquisition, we provide a variant of Kernelized
Extended DMD (KeDMD) based on the Koopman operator which employ the notion of
Gaussian random matrix to recover the dominant Koopman modes for the standard
fluid flow across cylinder experiment. It turns out that the traditional kernel
function, Gaussian Radial Basis Function Kernel, unfortunately, is not able to
generate the desired Koopman modes in the scenario of executing KeDMD with
limited data acquisition. However, the Laplacian Kernel Function successfully
generates the desired Koopman modes when limited data is provided in terms of
data-set snapshot for the aforementioned experiment and this manuscripts serves
the purpose of reporting these exciting experimental insights. This paper also
explores the functionality of the Koopman operator when it interacts with the
reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) that arises from the normalized
probability Lebesgue measure
$d\mu_{\sigma,1,\mathbb{C}^n}(z)=(2\pi\sigma^2)^{-n}\exp\left(-\frac{\|z\|_2}{\sigma}\right)dV(z)$
when it is embedded in $L^2-$sense for the holomorphic functions over

of the Koopman operator on the RKHS generated by the normalized Laplacian
measure $d\mu_{\sigma,1,\mathbb{C}^n}(z)$ in the $L^2-$sense. In doing so, we
provide the compactification &amp;amp; closable characterization of Koopman operator

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Among existing Neural Architecture Search methods, DARTS is known for its
efficiency and simplicity. This approach applies continuous relaxation of
network representation to construct a weight-sharing supernet and enables the
identification of excellent subnets in just a few GPU days. However,
performance collapse in DARTS results in deteriorating architectures filled
with parameter-free operations and remains a great challenge to the robustness.
To resolve this problem, we reveal that the fundamental reason is the biased
estimation of the candidate importance in the search space through theoretical
and experimental analysis, and more precisely select operations via
information-based measurements. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the excessive
concern over the supernet and inefficient utilization of data in bi-level
optimization also account for suboptimal results. We adopt a more realistic
objective focusing on the performance of subnets and simplify it with the help
of the information-based measurements. Finally, we explain theoretically why
progressively shrinking the width of the supernet is necessary and reduce the
approximation error of optimal weights in DARTS. Our proposed method, named
IS-DARTS, comprehensively improves DARTS and resolves the aforementioned
problems. Extensive experiments on NAS-Bench-201 and DARTS-based search space
demonstrate the effectiveness of IS-DARTS.

<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12655</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;In-context learning (ICL) has revolutionized the capabilities of transformer
models in NLP. In our project, we extend the understanding of the mechanisms
underpinning ICL by exploring whether transformers can learn from sequential,
non-textual function class data distributions. We introduce a novel sliding
window sequential function class and employ toy-sized transformers with a GPT-2
architecture to conduct our experiments. Our analysis indicates that these
models can indeed leverage ICL when trained on non-textual sequential function
classes. Additionally, our experiments with randomized y-label sequences
highlights that transformers retain some ICL capabilities even when the label
associations are obfuscated. We provide evidence that transformers can reason
with and understand sequentiality encoded within function classes, as reflected
by the effective learning of our proposed tasks. Our results also show that the
performance deteriorated with increasing randomness in the labels, though not
to the extent one might expect, implying a potential robustness of learned
sequentiality against label noise. Future research may want to look into how
previous explanations of transformers, such as induction heads and task
vectors, relate to sequentiality in ICL in these toy examples. Our
investigation lays the groundwork for further research into how transformers
process and perceive sequential data.

<title>The Convex Landscape of Neural Networks: Characterizing Global Optima and Stationary Points via Lasso Models. (arXiv:2312.12657v1 [cs.LG])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12657</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Due to the non-convex nature of training Deep Neural Network (DNN) models,
their effectiveness relies on the use of non-convex optimization heuristics.
Traditional methods for training DNNs often require costly empirical methods to
produce successful models and do not have a clear theoretical foundation. In
this study, we examine the use of convex optimization theory and sparse
recovery models to refine the training process of neural networks and provide a
better interpretation of their optimal weights. We focus on training two-layer
neural networks with piecewise linear activations and demonstrate that they can
be formulated as a finite-dimensional convex program. These programs include a
regularization term that promotes sparsity, which constitutes a variant of
group Lasso. We first utilize semi-infinite programming theory to prove strong
duality for finite width neural networks and then we express these
architectures equivalently as high dimensional convex sparse recovery models.
Remarkably, the worst-case complexity to solve the convex program is polynomial
in the number of samples and number of neurons when the rank of the data matrix
is bounded, which is the case in convolutional networks. To extend our method
to training data of arbitrary rank, we develop a novel polynomial-time
approximation scheme based on zonotope subsampling that comes with a guaranteed
approximation ratio. We also show that all the stationary of the nonconvex
training objective can be characterized as the global optimum of a subsampled
convex program. Our convex models can be trained using standard convex solvers
without resorting to heuristics or extensive hyper-parameter tuning unlike
non-convex methods. Through extensive numerical experiments, we show that
convex models can outperform traditional non-convex methods and are not
sensitive to optimizer hyperparameters.

<title>Incremental Semi-supervised Federated Learning for Health Inference via Mobile Sensing. (arXiv:2312.12666v1 [cs.LG])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12666</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Mobile sensing appears as a promising solution for health inference problem
(e.g., influenza-like symptom recognition) by leveraging diverse smart sensors
to capture fine-grained information about human behaviors and ambient contexts.
Centralized training of machine learning models can place mobile users&apos;
sensitive information under privacy risks due to data breach and
misexploitation. Federated Learning (FL) enables mobile devices to
collaboratively learn global models without the exposure of local private data.
However, there are challenges of on-device FL deployment using mobile sensing:
1) long-term and continuously collected mobile sensing data may exhibit domain
shifts as sensing objects (e.g. humans) have varying behaviors as a result of
internal and/or external stimulus; 2) model retraining using all available data
may increase computation and memory burden; and 3) the sparsity of annotated
crowd-sourced data causes supervised FL to lack robustness. In this work, we
propose FedMobile, an incremental semi-supervised federated learning algorithm,
to train models semi-supervisedly and incrementally in a decentralized online
fashion. We evaluate FedMobile using a real-world mobile sensing dataset for
influenza-like symptom recognition. Our empirical results show that
FedMobile-trained models achieve the best results in comparison to the selected
baseline methods.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Malware represents a significant security concern in today&apos;s digital
landscape, as it can destroy or disable operating systems, steal sensitive user
information, and occupy valuable disk space. However, current malware detection
methods, such as static-based and dynamic-based approaches, struggle to
identify newly developed (``zero-day&quot;) malware and are limited by customized
virtual machine (VM) environments. To overcome these limitations, we propose a
novel malware detection approach that leverages deep learning, mathematical
techniques, and network science. Our approach focuses on static and dynamic
analysis and utilizes the Low-Level Virtual Machine (LLVM) to profile
applications within a complex network. The generated network topologies are
input into the GraphSAGE architecture to efficiently distinguish between benign
and malicious software applications, with the operation names denoted as node
features. Importantly, the GraphSAGE models analyze the network&apos;s topological
geometry to make predictions, enabling them to detect state-of-the-art malware
and prevent potential damage during execution in a VM. To evaluate our
approach, we conduct a study on a dataset comprising source code from 24,376
applications, specifically written in C/C++, sourced directly from
widely-recognized malware and various types of benign software. The results
show a high detection performance with an Area Under the Receiver Operating
Characteristic Curve (AUROC) of 99.85%. Our approach marks a substantial
improvement in malware detection, providing a notably more accurate and
efficient solution when compared to current state-of-the-art malware detection
methods.

<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12668</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;The Forward-Forward (FF) Algorithm has been recently proposed to alleviate
the issues of backpropagation (BP) commonly used to train deep neural networks.
However, its current formulation exhibits limitations such as the generation of
negative data, slower convergence, and inadequate performance on complex tasks.
In this paper, we take the main ideas of FF and improve them by leveraging
channel-wise competitive learning in the context of convolutional neural
networks for image classification tasks. A layer-wise loss function is
introduced that promotes competitive learning and eliminates the need for
negative data construction. To enhance both the learning of compositional
features and feature space partitioning, a channel-wise feature separator and
extractor block is proposed that complements the competitive learning process.
Our method outperforms recent FF-based models on image classification tasks,
achieving testing errors of 0.58%, 7.69%, 21.89%, and 48.77% on MNIST,
Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 respectively. Our approach bridges the
performance gap between FF learning and BP methods, indicating the potential of
our proposed approach to learn useful representations in a layer-wise modular
fashion, enabling more efficient and flexible learning.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Federated Averaging (FedAvg) is known to experience convergence issues when
encountering significant clients system heterogeneity and data heterogeneity.
Server momentum has been proposed as an effective mitigation. However, existing
server momentum works are restrictive in the momentum formulation, do not
properly schedule hyperparameters and focus only on system homogeneous
settings, which leaves the role of server momentum still an under-explored
problem. In this paper, we propose a general framework for server momentum,
that (a) covers a large class of momentum schemes that are unexplored in
federated learning (FL), (b) enables a popular stagewise hyperparameter
scheduler, (c) allows heterogeneous and asynchronous local computing. We
provide rigorous convergence analysis for the proposed framework. To our best
knowledge, this is the first work that thoroughly analyzes the performances of
server momentum with a hyperparameter scheduler and system heterogeneity.
Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our proposed framework.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;We consider a combinatorial Gaussian process semi-bandit problem with
time-varying arm availability. Each round, an agent is provided a set of
available base arms and must select a subset of them to maximize the long-term
cumulative reward. Assuming the expected rewards are sampled from a Gaussian
process (GP) over the arm space, the agent can efficiently learn. We study the
Bayesian setting and provide novel Bayesian regret bounds for three GP-based
algorithms: GP-UCB, Bayes-GP-UCB and GP-TS. Our bounds extend previous results
for GP-UCB and GP-TS to a combinatorial setting with varying arm availability
and to the best of our knowledge, we provide the first Bayesian regret bound
for Bayes-GP-UCB. Time-varying arm availability encompasses other widely
considered bandit problems such as contextual bandits. We formulate the online
energy-efficient navigation problem as a combinatorial and contextual bandit
and provide a comprehensive experimental study on synthetic and real-world road
networks with detailed simulations. The contextual GP model obtains lower
regret and is less dependent on the informativeness of the prior compared to
the non-contextual Bayesian inference model. In addition, Thompson sampling
obtains lower regret than Bayes-UCB for both the contextual and non-contextual
model.

<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12703</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Federated learning (FL) has shown remarkable success in cooperatively
training deep models, while typically struggling with noisy labels. Advanced
works propose to tackle label noise by a re-weighting strategy with a strong
assumption, i.e., mild label noise. However, it may be violated in many
real-world FL scenarios because of highly contaminated clients, resulting in
extreme noise ratios, e.g., $&amp;gt;$90%. To tackle extremely noisy clients, we study
the robustness of the re-weighting strategy, showing a pessimistic conclusion:
minimizing the weight of clients trained over noisy data outperforms
re-weighting strategies. To leverage models trained on noisy clients, we
propose a novel approach, called negative distillation (FedNed). FedNed first
identifies noisy clients and employs rather than discards the noisy clients in
a knowledge distillation manner. In particular, clients identified as noisy
ones are required to train models using noisy labels and pseudo-labels obtained
by global models. The model trained on noisy labels serves as a `bad teacher&apos;
in knowledge distillation, aiming to decrease the risk of providing incorrect
information. Meanwhile, the model trained on pseudo-labels is involved in model
aggregation if not identified as a noisy client. Consequently, through
pseudo-labeling, FedNed gradually increases the trustworthiness of models
trained on noisy clients, while leveraging all clients for model aggregation
through negative distillation. To verify the efficacy of FedNed, we conduct
extensive experiments under various settings, demonstrating that FedNed can
consistently outperform baselines and achieve state-of-the-art performance. Our
code is available at https://github.com/linChen99/FedNed.

widely adopted in education research. The proposed BloomVQA dataset can be
mapped to a hierarchical graph-based representation of visual stories, enabling
automatic data augmentation and novel measures characterizing model consistency
across the underlying taxonomy. We demonstrate graded evaluation and
reliability analysis based on our proposed consistency metrics on
state-of-the-art vision-language models. Our results suggest that, while
current models achieve the most gain on low-level comprehension tasks, they
generally fall short on high-level tasks requiring more advanced comprehension
and cognitive skills, as 38.0% drop in VQA accuracy is observed comparing
lowest and highest level tasks. Furthermore, current models show consistency
patterns misaligned with human comprehension in various scenarios, suggesting
emergent structures of model behaviors.

<title>DoDo-Code: a Deep Levenshtein Distance Embedding-based Code for IDS Channel and DNA Storage. (arXiv:2312.12717v1 [cs.IT])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12717</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Recently, DNA storage has emerged as a promising data storage solution,
offering significant advantages in storage density, maintenance cost
efficiency, and parallel replication capability. Mathematically, the DNA
storage pipeline can be viewed as an insertion, deletion, and substitution
(IDS) channel. Because of the mathematical terra incognita of the Levenshtein
distance, designing an IDS-correcting code is still a challenge. In this paper,
we propose an innovative approach that utilizes deep Levenshtein distance
embedding to bypass these mathematical challenges. By representing the
Levenshtein distance between two sequences as a conventional distance between
their corresponding embedding vectors, the inherent structural property of
Levenshtein distance is revealed in the friendly embedding space. Leveraging
this embedding space, we introduce the DoDo-Code, an IDS-correcting code that
incorporates deep embedding of Levenshtein distance, deep embedding-based
codeword search, and deep embedding-based segment correcting. To address the
requirements of DNA storage, we also present a preliminary algorithm for long
sequence decoding. As far as we know, the DoDo-Code is the first IDS-correcting
code designed using plausible deep learning methodologies, potentially paving
the way for a new direction in error-correcting code research. It is also the
first IDS code that exhibits characteristics of being `optimal&apos; in terms of
redundancy, significantly outperforming the mainstream IDS-correcting codes of
the Varshamov-Tenengolts code family in code rate.

<title>Progressive Poisoned Data Isolation for Training-time Backdoor Defense. (arXiv:2312.12724v1 [cs.CR])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12724</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Deep Neural Networks (DNN) are susceptible to backdoor attacks where
malicious attackers manipulate the model&apos;s predictions via data poisoning. It
is hence imperative to develop a strategy for training a clean model using a
potentially poisoned dataset. Previous training-time defense mechanisms
typically employ an one-time isolation process, often leading to suboptimal
isolation outcomes. In this study, we present a novel and efficacious defense
method, termed Progressive Isolation of Poisoned Data (PIPD), that
progressively isolates poisoned data to enhance the isolation accuracy and
mitigate the risk of benign samples being misclassified as poisoned ones. Once
the poisoned portion of the dataset has been identified, we introduce a
selective training process to train a clean model. Through the implementation
of these techniques, we ensure that the trained model manifests a significantly
diminished attack success rate against the poisoned data. Extensive experiments
on multiple benchmark datasets and DNN models, assessed against nine
state-of-the-art backdoor attacks, demonstrate the superior performance of our
PIPD method for backdoor defense. For instance, our PIPD achieves an average
True Positive Rate (TPR) of 99.95% and an average False Positive Rate (FPR) of
0.06% for diverse attacks over CIFAR-10 dataset, markedly surpassing the
performance of state-of-the-art methods.

<title>Lookahead: An Inference Acceleration Framework for Large Language Model with Lossless Generation Accuracy. (arXiv:2312.12728v1 [cs.IR])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12728</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;As Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant advancements across
various tasks, such as question answering, translation, text summarization, and
dialogue systems, the need for accuracy in information becomes crucial,
especially for serious financial products serving billions of users like
Alipay. To address this, Alipay has developed a Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) system that grounds LLMs on the most accurate and up-to-date information.
However, for a real-world product serving millions of users, the inference
speed of LLMs becomes a critical factor compared to a mere experimental model.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hence, this paper presents a generic framework for accelerating the inference
process, resulting in a substantial increase in speed and cost reduction for
our RAG system, with lossless generation accuracy. In the traditional inference
process, each token is generated sequentially by the LLM, leading to a time
consumption proportional to the number of generated tokens. To enhance this
process, our framework, named \textit{lookahead}, introduces a
\textit{multi-branch} strategy. Instead of generating a single token at a time,
we propose a \textit{Trie-based Retrieval} (TR) process that enables the
generation of multiple branches simultaneously, each of which is a sequence of
tokens. Subsequently, for each branch, a \textit{Verification and Accept} (VA)
process is performed to identify the longest correct sub-sequence as the final
output. Our strategy offers two distinct advantages: (1) it guarantees absolute
correctness of the output, avoiding any approximation algorithms, and (2) the
worst-case performance of our approach is equivalent to the conventional
process. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the significant
improvements achieved by applying our inference acceleration framework.

<title>Robustly Improving Bandit Algorithms with Confounded and Selection Biased Offline Data: A Causal Approach. (arXiv:2312.12731v1 [cs.LG])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12731</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;This paper studies bandit problems where an agent has access to offline data
that might be utilized to potentially improve the estimation of each arm&apos;s
reward distribution. A major obstacle in this setting is the existence of
compound biases from the observational data. Ignoring these biases and blindly
fitting a model with the biased data could even negatively affect the online
learning phase. In this work, we formulate this problem from a causal
perspective. First, we categorize the biases into confounding bias and
selection bias based on the causal structure they imply. Next, we extract the
causal bound for each arm that is robust towards compound biases from biased
observational data. The derived bounds contain the ground truth mean reward and
can effectively guide the bandit agent to learn a nearly-optimal decision
policy. We also conduct regret analysis in both contextual and non-contextual
bandit settings and show that prior causal bounds could help consistently
reduce the asymptotic regret.

<title>Learning and Forgetting Unsafe Examples in Large Language Models. (arXiv:2312.12736v1 [cs.CL])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12736</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;As the number of large language models (LLMs) released to the public grows,
there is a pressing need to understand the safety implications associated with
these models learning from third-party custom finetuning data. We explore the
behavior of LLMs finetuned on noisy custom data containing unsafe content,
represented by datasets that contain biases, toxicity, and harmfulness, finding
that while aligned LLMs can readily learn this unsafe content, they also tend
to forget it more significantly than other examples when subsequently finetuned
on safer content. Drawing inspiration from the discrepancies in forgetting, we
introduce the &quot;ForgetFilter&quot; algorithm, which filters unsafe data based on how
strong the model&apos;s forgetting signal is for that data. We demonstrate that the
ForgetFilter algorithm ensures safety in customized finetuning without
compromising downstream task performance, unlike sequential safety finetuning.
ForgetFilter outperforms alternative strategies like replay and moral
self-correction in curbing LLMs&apos; ability to assimilate unsafe content during
custom finetuning, e.g. 75% lower than not applying any safety measures and 62%
lower than using self-correction in toxicity score.

<title>FSscore: A Machine Learning-based Synthetic Feasibility Score Leveraging Human Expertise. (arXiv:2312.12737v1 [cs.LG])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12737</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Determining whether a molecule can be synthesized is crucial for many aspects
of chemistry and drug discovery, allowing prioritization of experimental work
and ranking molecules in de novo design tasks. Existing scoring approaches to
assess synthetic feasibility struggle to extrapolate to out-of-distribution
chemical spaces or fail to discriminate based on minor differences such as
chirality that might be obvious to trained chemists. This work aims to address
these limitations by introducing the Focused Synthesizability score (FSscore),
which learns to rank structures based on binary preferences using a graph
attention network. First, a baseline trained on an extensive set of
reactant-product pairs is established that subsequently is fine-tuned with
expert human feedback on a chemical space of interest. Fine-tuning on focused
datasets improves performance on these chemical scopes over the pre-trained
model exhibiting moderate performance and generalizability. This enables
distinguishing hard- from easy-to-synthesize molecules and improving the
synthetic accessibility of generative model outputs. On very complex scopes
with limited labels achieving satisfactory gains remains challenging. The
FSscore showcases how human expert feedback can be utilized to optimize the
assessment of synthetic feasibility for a variety of applications.

<title>Locally Optimal Fixed-Budget Best Arm Identification in Two-Armed Gaussian Bandits with Unknown Variances. (arXiv:2312.12741v1 [cs.LG])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12741</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;We address the problem of best arm identification (BAI) with a fixed budget
for two-armed Gaussian bandits. In BAI, given multiple arms, we aim to find the
best arm, an arm with the highest expected reward, through an adaptive
experiment. Kaufmann et al. (2016) develops a lower bound for the probability
of misidentifying the best arm. They also propose a strategy, assuming that the
variances of rewards are known, and show that it is asymptotically optimal in
the sense that its probability of misidentification matches the lower bound as
the budget approaches infinity. However, an asymptotically optimal strategy is
unknown when the variances are unknown. For this open issue, we propose a
strategy that estimates variances during an adaptive experiment and draws arms
with a ratio of the estimated standard deviations. We refer to this strategy as
the Neyman Allocation (NA)-Augmented Inverse Probability weighting (AIPW)
strategy. We then demonstrate that this strategy is asymptotically optimal by
showing that its probability of misidentification matches the lower bound when
the budget approaches infinity, and the gap between the expected rewards of two
arms approaches zero (small-gap regime). Our results suggest that under the
worst-case scenario characterized by the small-gap regime, our strategy, which
employs estimated variance, is asymptotically optimal even when the variances
are unknown.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Due to the limitations in the accuracy and robustness of current
electroencephalogram (EEG) classification algorithms, applying motor imagery

challenging. This paper proposed a model that combined a three-dimensional
convolutional neural network (CNN) with a long short-term memory (LSTM) network
with attention to classify MI-EEG signals. This model combined MI-EEG signals
from different channels into three-dimensional features and extracted spatial
features through convolution operations with multiple three-dimensional
convolutional kernels of different scales. At the same time, to ensure the
integrity of the extracted MI-EEG signal temporal features, the LSTM network
was directly trained on the preprocessed raw signal. Finally, the features
obtained from these two networks were combined and used for classification.
Experimental results showed that this model achieved a classification accuracy
of 92.7% and an F1-score of 0.91 on the public dataset BCI Competition IV

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;How do we measure the efficacy of language model explainability methods?
While many explainability methods have been developed, they are typically
evaluated on bespoke tasks, preventing an apples-to-apples comparison. To help
fill this gap, we present ALMANACS, a language model explainability benchmark.
ALMANACS scores explainability methods on simulatability, i.e., how well the
explanations improve behavior prediction on new inputs. The ALMANACS scenarios
span twelve safety-relevant topics such as ethical reasoning and advanced AI
behaviors; they have idiosyncratic premises to invoke model-specific behavior;
and they have a train-test distributional shift to encourage faithful
explanations. By using another language model to predict behavior based on the
explanations, ALMANACS is a fully automated benchmark. We use ALMANACS to
evaluate counterfactuals, rationalizations, attention, and Integrated Gradients
explanations. Our results are sobering: when averaged across all topics, no
explanation method outperforms the explanation-free control. We conclude that
despite modest successes in prior work, developing an explanation method that
aids simulatability in ALMANACS remains an open challenge.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Deep learning models have become increasingly computationally intensive,
requiring extensive computational resources and time for both training and
inference. A significant contributing factor to this challenge is the uniform
computational effort expended on each input example, regardless of its
complexity. We introduce \textbf{DynaLay}, an alternative architecture that
features a decision-making agent to adaptively select the most suitable layers
for processing each input, thereby endowing the model with a remarkable level
of introspection. DynaLay reevaluates more complex inputs during inference,
adjusting the computational effort to optimize both performance and efficiency.
The core of the system is a main model equipped with Fixed-Point Iterative
(FPI) layers, capable of accurately approximating complex functions, paired
with an agent that chooses these layers or a direct action based on the
introspection of the models inner state. The model invests more time in
processing harder examples, while minimal computation is required for easier
ones. This introspective approach is a step toward developing deep learning
models that &quot;think&quot; and &quot;ponder&quot;, rather than &quot;ballistically&apos;&apos; produce answers.

optimal power, performance, and area (PPA) for advanced semiconductor process
development. Cell library characterization is essential in DTCO flow, but
traditional methods are time-consuming and costly. To overcome these
challenges, we propose a graph neural network (GNN)-based machine learning
model for rapid and accurate cell library characterization. Our model
incorporates cell structures and demonstrates high prediction accuracy across
various process-voltage-temperature (PVT) corners and technology parameters.
Validation with 512 unseen technology corners and over one million test data
points shows accurate predictions of delay, power, and input pin capacitance
for 33 types of cells, with a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) $\le$ 0.95%
and a speed-up of 100X compared with SPICE simulations. Additionally, we
investigate system-level metrics such as worst negative slack (WNS), leakage
power, and dynamic power using predictions obtained from the GNN-based model on
unseen corners. Our model achieves precise predictions, with absolute error
$\le$3.0 ps for WNS, percentage errors $\le$0.60% for leakage power, and
$\le$0.99% for dynamic power, when compared to golden reference. With the

Rather than a decoder, a feature adaptation module is designed to replace it

<title>Model-Based Control with Sparse Neural Dynamics. (arXiv:2312.12791v1 [cs.RO])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12791</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Learning predictive models from observations using deep neural networks
(DNNs) is a promising new approach to many real-world planning and control
problems. However, common DNNs are too unstructured for effective planning, and
current control methods typically rely on extensive sampling or local gradient
descent. In this paper, we propose a new framework for integrated model
learning and predictive control that is amenable to efficient optimization
algorithms. Specifically, we start with a ReLU neural model of the system
dynamics and, with minimal losses in prediction accuracy, we gradually sparsify
it by removing redundant neurons. This discrete sparsification process is
approximated as a continuous problem, enabling an end-to-end optimization of
both the model architecture and the weight parameters. The sparsified model is
subsequently used by a mixed-integer predictive controller, which represents
the neuron activations as binary variables and employs efficient
branch-and-bound algorithms. Our framework is applicable to a wide variety of
DNNs, from simple multilayer perceptrons to complex graph neural dynamics. It
can efficiently handle tasks involving complicated contact dynamics, such as
object pushing, compositional object sorting, and manipulation of deformable
objects. Numerical and hardware experiments show that, despite the aggressive
sparsification, our framework can deliver better closed-loop performance than
existing state-of-the-art methods.

<title>Bandit Sequential Posted Pricing via Half-Concavity. (arXiv:2312.12794v1 [cs.LG])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12794</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Sequential posted pricing auctions are popular because of their simplicity in
practice and their tractability in theory. A usual assumption in their study is
that the Bayesian prior distributions of the buyers are known to the seller,
while in reality these priors can only be accessed from historical data. To
overcome this assumption, we study sequential posted pricing in the bandit
learning model, where the seller interacts with $n$ buyers over $T$ rounds: In
each round the seller posts $n$ prices for the $n$ buyers and the first buyer
with a valuation higher than the price takes the item. The only feedback that
the seller receives in each round is the revenue.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our main results obtain nearly-optimal regret bounds for single-item
sequential posted pricing in the bandit learning model. In particular, we
achieve an $\tilde{O}(\mathsf{poly}(n)\sqrt{T})$ regret for buyers with
(Myerson&apos;s) regular distributions and an
$\tilde{O}(\mathsf{poly}(n)T^{{2}/{3}})$ regret for buyers with general
distributions, both of which are tight in the number of rounds $T$. Our result
for regular distributions was previously not known even for the single-buyer
setting and relies on a new half-concavity property of the revenue function in
the value space. For $n$ sequential buyers, our technique is to run a
generalized single-buyer algorithm for all the buyers and to carefully bound
the regret from the sub-optimal pricing of the suffix buyers.

<title>Near-Optimal Resilient Aggregation Rules for Distributed Learning Using 1-Center and 1-Mean Clustering with Outliers. (arXiv:2312.12835v1 [cs.LG])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12835</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Byzantine machine learning has garnered considerable attention in light of
the unpredictable faults that can occur in large-scale distributed learning
systems. The key to secure resilience against Byzantine machines in distributed
learning is resilient aggregation mechanisms. Although abundant resilient
aggregation rules have been proposed, they are designed in ad-hoc manners,
imposing extra barriers on comparing, analyzing, and improving the rules across
performance criteria. This paper studies near-optimal aggregation rules using
clustering in the presence of outliers. Our outlier-robust clustering approach
utilizes geometric properties of the update vectors provided by workers. Our
analysis show that constant approximations to the 1-center and 1-mean
clustering problems with outliers provide near-optimal resilient aggregators
for metric-based criteria, which have been proven to be crucial in the
homogeneous and heterogeneous cases respectively. In addition, we discuss two
contradicting types of attacks under which no single aggregation rule is
guaranteed to improve upon the naive average. Based on the discussion, we
propose a two-phase resilient aggregation framework. We run experiments for
image classification using a non-convex loss function. The proposed algorithms
outperform previously known aggregation rules by a large margin with both
homogeneous and heterogeneous data distributions among non-faulty workers. Code

<title>FedA3I: Annotation Quality-Aware Aggregation for Federated Medical Image Segmentation Against Heterogeneous Annotation Noise. (arXiv:2312.12838v1 [cs.LG])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12838</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for training
segmentation models on decentralized medical data, owing to its
privacy-preserving property. However, existing research overlooks the prevalent
annotation noise encountered in real-world medical datasets, which limits the
performance ceilings of FL. In this paper, we, for the first time, identify and
tackle this problem. For problem formulation, we propose a contour evolution
for modeling non-independent and identically distributed (Non-IID) noise across
pixels within each client and then extend it to the case of multi-source data
to form a heterogeneous noise model (\textit{i.e.}, Non-IID annotation noise
across clients). For robust learning from annotations with such two-level
Non-IID noise, we emphasize the importance of data quality in model
aggregation, allowing high-quality clients to have a greater impact on FL. To
achieve this, we propose \textbf{Fed}erated learning with \textbf{A}nnotation
qu\textbf{A}lity-aware \textbf{A}ggregat\textbf{I}on, named \textbf{FedA$^3$I},
by introducing a quality factor based on client-wise noise estimation.
Specifically, noise estimation at each client is accomplished through the
Gaussian mixture model and then incorporated into model aggregation in a
layer-wise manner to up-weight high-quality clients. Extensive experiments on
two real-world medical image segmentation datasets demonstrate the superior
performance of FedA$^3$I against the state-of-the-art approaches in dealing
with cross-client annotation noise. The code is available at

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;We propose a framework for descriptively analyzing sets of partial orders
based on the concept of depth functions. Despite intensive studies in linear
and metric spaces, there is very little discussion on depth functions for
non-standard data types such as partial orders. We introduce an adaptation of
the well-known simplicial depth to the set of all partial orders, the
union-free generic (ufg) depth. Moreover, we utilize our ufg depth for a
comparison of machine learning algorithms based on multidimensional performance
measures. Concretely, we provide two examples of classifier comparisons on
samples of standard benchmark data sets. Our results demonstrate promisingly
the wide variety of different analysis approaches based on ufg methods.
Furthermore, the examples outline that our approach differs substantially from
existing benchmarking approaches, and thus adds a new perspective to the vivid
debate on classifier comparison.

<title>Causal Discovery under Identifiable Heteroscedastic Noise Model. (arXiv:2312.12844v1 [cs.LG])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12844</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Capturing the underlying structural causal relations represented by Directed
Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) has been a fundamental task in various AI disciplines.
Causal DAG learning via the continuous optimization framework has recently
achieved promising performance in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.
However, most methods make strong assumptions of homoscedastic noise, i.e.,
exogenous noises have equal variances across variables, observations, or even
both. The noises in real data usually violate both assumptions due to the
biases introduced by different data collection processes. To address the issue
of heteroscedastic noise, we introduce relaxed and implementable sufficient
conditions, proving the identifiability of a general class of SEM subject to
these conditions. Based on the identifiable general SEM, we propose a novel
formulation for DAG learning that accounts for the variation in noise variance
across variables and observations. We then propose an effective two-phase
iterative DAG learning algorithm to address the increasing optimization
difficulties and to learn a causal DAG from data with heteroscedastic variable
noise under varying variance. We show significant empirical gains of the
proposed approaches over state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic data and
real data.

<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12849</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Exponential families are statistical models which are the workhorses in
statistics, information theory, and machine learning. An exponential family can
either be normalized subtractively by its cumulant function or equivalently
normalized divisively by its partition function. Both subtractive and divisive
normalizers are strictly convex and smooth functions inducing pairs of Bregman
and Jensen divergences. It is well-known that skewed Bhattacharryya distances
between probability densities of an exponential family amounts to skewed Jensen
divergences induced by the cumulant function between their corresponding
natural parameters, and in limit cases that the sided Kullback-Leibler
divergences amount to reverse-sided Bregman divergences. In this note, we first
show that the $\alpha$-divergences between unnormalized densities of an
exponential family amounts scaled $\alpha$-skewed Jensen divergences induced by
the partition function. We then show how comparative convexity with respect to
a pair of quasi-arithmetic means allows to deform convex functions and define
dually flat spaces with corresponding divergences when ordinary convexity is
preserved.

<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12856</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Remote sensing imagery, despite its broad applications in helping achieve
Sustainable Development Goals and tackle climate change, has not yet benefited
from the recent advancements of versatile, task-agnostic vision language models
(VLMs). A key reason is that the large-scale, semantically diverse image-text
dataset required for developing VLMs is still absent for remote sensing images.
Unlike natural images, remote sensing images and their associated text
descriptions cannot be efficiently collected from the public Internet at scale.
In this work, we bridge this gap by using geo-coordinates to automatically
connect open, unlabeled remote sensing images with rich semantics covered in
OpenStreetMap, and thus construct SkyScript, a comprehensive vision-language
dataset for remote sensing images, comprising 2.6 million image-text pairs
covering 29K distinct semantic tags. With continual pre-training on this
dataset, we obtain a VLM that surpasses baseline models with a 6.2% average
accuracy gain in zero-shot scene classification across seven benchmark
datasets. It also demonstrates the ability of zero-shot transfer for
fine-grained object attribute classification and cross-modal retrieval. We hope
this dataset can support the advancement of VLMs for various multi-modal tasks
in remote sensing, such as open-vocabulary classification, retrieval,
captioning, and text-to-image synthesis.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;While providing machine learning model as a service to process users&apos;

utilizing newly collected data. Federated learning (FL) is beneficial for
enabling the training of models across distributed clients while keeping the

training and inference under clients&apos; limited resources. This paper focuses on
the joint optimization of model training and inference to maximize inference
performance at clients. Such an optimization faces several challenges. The
first challenge is to characterize the clients&apos; inference performance when
clients may partially participate in FL. To resolve this challenge, we
introduce a new notion of age of model (AoM) to quantify client-side model
freshness, based on which we use FL&apos;s global model convergence error as an
approximate measure of inference performance. The second challenge is the tight
coupling among clients&apos; decisions, including participation probability in FL,
model download probability, and service rates. Toward the challenges, we
propose an online problem approximation to reduce the problem complexity and
optimize the resources to balance the needs of model training and inference.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm improves the
average inference accuracy by up to 12%.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Approximate value iteration~(AVI) is a family of algorithms for reinforcement
learning~(RL) that aims to obtain an approximation of the optimal value
function. Generally, AVI algorithms implement an iterated procedure where each
step consists of (i) an application of the Bellman operator and (ii) a
projection step into a considered function space. Notoriously, the Bellman
operator leverages transition samples, which strongly determine its behavior,
as uninformative samples can result in negligible updates or long detours,
whose detrimental effects are further exacerbated by the computationally
intensive projection step. To address these issues, we propose a novel
alternative approach based on learning an approximate version of the Bellman
operator rather than estimating it through samples as in AVI approaches. This
way, we are able to (i) generalize across transition samples and (ii) avoid the
computationally intensive projection step. For this reason, we call our novel
operator projected Bellman operator (PBO). We formulate an optimization problem
to learn PBO for generic sequential decision-making problems, and we
theoretically analyze its properties in two representative classes of RL
problems. Furthermore, we theoretically study our approach under the lens of
AVI and devise algorithmic implementations to learn PBO in offline and online
settings by leveraging neural network parameterizations. Finally, we
empirically showcase the benefits of PBO w.r.t. the regular Bellman operator on
several RL problems.

<title>Testing the Segment Anything Model on radiology data. (arXiv:2312.12880v1 [eess.IV])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12880</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Deep learning models trained with large amounts of data have become a recent
and effective approach to predictive problem solving -- these have become known
as &quot;foundation models&quot; as they can be used as fundamental tools for other
applications. While the paramount examples of image classification (earlier)
and large language models (more recently) led the way, the Segment Anything
Model (SAM) was recently proposed and stands as the first foundation model for
image segmentation, trained on over 10 million images and with recourse to over
1 billion masks. However, the question remains -- what are the limits of this
foundation? Given that magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) stands as an important
method of diagnosis, we sought to understand whether SAM could be used for a
few tasks of zero-shot segmentation using MRI data. Particularly, we wanted to
know if selecting masks from the pool of SAM predictions could lead to good
segmentations.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, we provide a critical assessment of the performance of SAM on magnetic
resonance imaging data. We show that, while acceptable in a very limited set of
cases, the overall trend implies that these models are insufficient for MRI
segmentation across the whole volume, but can provide good segmentations in a
few, specific slices. More importantly, we note that while foundation models
trained on natural images are set to become key aspects of predictive
modelling, they may prove ineffective when used on other imaging modalities.

<title>BSL: Understanding and Improving Softmax Loss for Recommendation. (arXiv:2312.12882v1 [cs.LG])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12882</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Loss functions steer the optimization direction of recommendation models and
are critical to model performance, but have received relatively little
attention in recent recommendation research. Among various losses, we find
Softmax loss (SL) stands out for not only achieving remarkable accuracy but
also better robustness and fairness. Nevertheless, the current literature lacks
a comprehensive explanation for the efficacy of SL. Toward addressing this
research gap, we conduct theoretical analyses on SL and uncover three insights:
1) Optimizing SL is equivalent to performing Distributionally Robust
Optimization (DRO) on the negative data, thereby learning against perturbations
on the negative distribution and yielding robustness to noisy negatives. 2)
Comparing with other loss functions, SL implicitly penalizes the prediction
variance, resulting in a smaller gap between predicted values and and thus
producing fairer results. Building on these insights, we further propose a
novel loss function Bilateral SoftMax Loss (BSL) that extends the advantage of
SL to both positive and negative sides. BSL augments SL by applying the same
Log-Expectation-Exp structure to positive examples as is used for negatives,
making the model robust to the noisy positives as well. Remarkably, BSL is
simple and easy-to-implement -- requiring just one additional line of code
compared to SL. Experiments on four real-world datasets and three
representative backbones demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposal. The
code is available at https://github.com/junkangwu/BSL

<title>A Minimal Control Family of Dynamical Syetem for Universal Approximation. (arXiv:2312.12903v1 [eess.SY])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12903</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;The universal approximation property (UAP) of neural networks is a
fundamental characteristic of deep learning. It is widely recognized that a
composition of linear functions and non-linear functions, such as the rectified
linear unit (ReLU) activation function, can approximate continuous functions on
compact domains. In this paper, we extend this efficacy to the scenario of
dynamical systems with controls. We prove that the control family
$\mathcal{F}_1 = \mathcal{F}_0 \cup \{ \text{ReLU}(\cdot)\} $ is enough to
generate flow maps that can uniformly approximate diffeomorphisms of
$\mathbb{R}^d$ on any compact domain, where $\mathcal{F}_0 = \{x \mapsto Ax+b:
A\in \mathbb{R}^{d\times d}, b \in \mathbb{R}^d\}$ is the set of linear maps
and the dimension $d\ge2$. Since $\mathcal{F}_1$ contains only one nonlinear
function and $\mathcal{F}_0$ does not hold the UAP, we call $\mathcal{F}_1$ a
minimal control family for UAP. Based on this, some sufficient conditions, such
as the affine invariance, on the control family are established and discussed.
Our result reveals an underlying connection between the approximation power of
neural networks and control systems.

we propose the action consistency ratio as a measure of stealthiness, and a new

that our method can ensure the effectiveness and stealthiness of attack
compared with other algorithms. Moreover, our methods are considerably faster

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;In this work, we study the problem of stability of Graph Convolutional Neural
Networks (GCNs) under random small perturbations in the underlying graph
topology, i.e. under a limited number of insertions or deletions of edges. We
derive a novel bound on the expected difference between the outputs of
unperturbed and perturbed GCNs. The proposed bound explicitly depends on the
magnitude of the perturbation of the eigenpairs of the Laplacian matrix, and
the perturbation explicitly depends on which edges are inserted or deleted.
Then, we provide a quantitative characterization of the effect of perturbing
specific edges on the stability of the network. We leverage tools from small
perturbation analysis to express the bounds in closed, albeit approximate,
form, in order to enhance interpretability of the results, without the need to
compute any perturbed shift operator. Finally, we numerically evaluate the
effectiveness of the proposed bound.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;We consider training decision trees using noisily labeled data, focusing on
loss functions that can lead to robust learning algorithms. Our contributions
are threefold. First, we offer novel theoretical insights on the robustness of
many existing loss functions in the context of decision tree learning. We show
that some of the losses belong to a class of what we call conservative losses,
and the conservative losses lead to an early stopping behavior during training
and noise-tolerant predictions during testing. Second, we introduce a framework
for constructing robust loss functions, called distribution losses. These
losses apply percentile-based penalties based on an assumed margin
distribution, and they naturally allow adapting to different noise rates via a
robustness parameter. In particular, we introduce a new loss called the
negative exponential loss, which leads to an efficient greedy
impurity-reduction learning algorithm. Lastly, our experiments on multiple
datasets and noise settings validate our theoretical insight and the
effectiveness of our adaptive negative exponential loss.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;This study investigates the misclassification excess risk bound in the
context of 1-bit matrix completion, a significant problem in machine learning
involving the recovery of an unknown matrix from a limited subset of its
entries. Matrix completion has garnered considerable attention in the last two
decades due to its diverse applications across various fields. Unlike
conventional approaches that deal with real-valued samples, 1-bit matrix
completion is concerned with binary observations. While prior research has
predominantly focused on the estimation error of proposed estimators, our study
shifts attention to the prediction error. This paper offers theoretical
analysis regarding the prediction errors of two previous works utilizing the
logistic regression model: one employing a max-norm constrained minimization
and the other employing nuclear-norm penalization. Significantly, our findings
demonstrate that the latter achieves the minimax-optimal rate without the need
for an additional logarithmic term. These novel results contribute to a deeper
understanding of 1-bit matrix completion by shedding light on the predictive

<title>From Past to Future: Rethinking Eligibility Traces. (arXiv:2312.12972v1 [cs.LG])</title>

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;In this paper, we introduce a fresh perspective on the challenges of credit
assignment and policy evaluation. First, we delve into the nuances of
eligibility traces and explore instances where their updates may result in
unexpected credit assignment to preceding states. From this investigation
emerges the concept of a novel value function, which we refer to as the
\emph{bidirectional value function}. Unlike traditional state value functions,
bidirectional value functions account for both future expected returns (rewards
anticipated from the current state onward) and past expected returns
(cumulative rewards from the episode&apos;s start to the present). We derive
principled update equations to learn this value function and, through
experimentation, demonstrate its efficacy in enhancing the process of policy
evaluation. In particular, our results indicate that the proposed learning
approach can, in certain challenging contexts, perform policy evaluation more
rapidly than TD($\lambda$) -- a method that learns forward value functions,
$v^\pi$, \emph{directly}. Overall, our findings present a new perspective on
eligibility traces and potential advantages associated with the novel value
function it inspires, especially for policy evaluation.

<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12973</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Scalable load balancing algorithms are of great interest in cloud networks
and data centers, necessitating the use of tractable techniques to compute
optimal load balancing policies for good performance. However, most existing
scalable techniques, especially asymptotically scaling methods based on mean
field theory, have not been able to model large queueing networks with strong
locality. Meanwhile, general multi-agent reinforcement learning techniques can
be hard to scale and usually lack a theoretical foundation. In this work, we
address this challenge by leveraging recent advances in sparse mean field
theory to learn a near-optimal load balancing policy in sparsely connected
queueing networks in a tractable manner, which may be preferable to global
approaches in terms of communication overhead. Importantly, we obtain a general
load balancing framework for a large class of sparse bounded-degree topologies.
By formulating a novel mean field control problem in the context of graphs with
bounded degree, we reduce the otherwise difficult multi-agent problem to a
single-agent problem. Theoretically, the approach is justified by approximation
guarantees. Empirically, the proposed methodology performs well on several
realistic and scalable network topologies. Moreover, we compare it with a
number of well-known load balancing heuristics and with existing scalable
multi-agent reinforcement learning methods. Overall, we obtain a tractable
approach for load balancing in highly localized networks.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;The significance of the freshness of sensor and control data at the receiver
side, often referred to as Age of Information (AoI), is fundamentally
constrained by contention for limited network resources. Evidently, network
congestion is detrimental for AoI, where this congestion is partly self-induced
by the sensor transmission process in addition to the contention from other
transmitting sensors. In this work, we devise a decentralized AoI-minimizing
transmission policy for a number of sensor agents sharing capacity-limited,
non-FIFO duplex channels that introduce random delays in communication with a
common receiver. By implementing the same policy, however with no explicit
inter-agent communication, the agents minimize the expected AoI in this
partially observable system. We cater to the partial observability due to
random channel delays by designing a bootstrap particle filter that
independently maintains a belief over the AoI of each agent. We also leverage
mean-field control approximations and reinforcement learning to derive scalable
and optimal solutions for minimizing the expected AoI collaboratively.

supervised learning (ML). Using the Chemical Entities of Biological Interest
(ChEBI) database as a model ontology, three curation tasks were devised. For
ICL, three prompting strategies were employed with GPT-4, GPT-3.5, BioGPT.
PubmedBERT was chosen for the FT paradigm. For ML, six embedding models were
utilized for training Random Forest and Long-Short Term Memory models. Five
setups were designed to assess ML and FT model performance across different
data availability scenarios.Datasets for curation tasks included: task 1
(620,386), task 2 (611,430), and task 3 (617,381), maintaining a 50:50 positive
versus negative ratio. For ICL models, GPT-4 achieved best accuracy scores of
0.916, 0.766 and 0.874 for tasks 1-3 respectively. In a direct comparison, ML
(trained on ~260,000 triples) outperformed ICL in accuracy across all tasks.
(accuracy differences: +.11, +.22 and +.17). Fine-tuned PubmedBERT performed
similarly to leading ML models in tasks 1 &amp;amp; 2 (F1 differences: -.014 and
+.002), but worse in task 3 (-.048). Simulations revealed performance declines
in both ML and FT models with smaller and higher imbalanced training data.
where ICL (particularly GPT-4) excelled in tasks 1 &amp;amp; 3. GPT-4 excelled in tasks
1 and 3 with less than 6,000 triples, surpassing ML/FT. ICL underperformed
ML/FT in task 2.ICL-augmented foundation models can be good assistants for
knowledge curation with correct prompting, however, not making ML and FT
paradigms obsolete. The latter two require task-specific data to beat ICL. In
such cases, ML relies on small pretrained embeddings, minimizing computational

<title>No More Shortcuts: Realizing the Potential of Temporal Self-Supervision. (arXiv:2312.13008v1 [cs.CV])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13008</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Self-supervised approaches for video have shown impressive results in video
understanding tasks. However, unlike early works that leverage temporal
self-supervision, current state-of-the-art methods primarily rely on tasks from
the image domain (e.g., contrastive learning) that do not explicitly promote
the learning of temporal features. We identify two factors that limit existing
temporal self-supervision: 1) tasks are too simple, resulting in saturated
training performance, and 2) we uncover shortcuts based on local appearance
statistics that hinder the learning of high-level features. To address these
issues, we propose 1) a more challenging reformulation of temporal
self-supervision as frame-level (rather than clip-level) recognition tasks and
2) an effective augmentation strategy to mitigate shortcuts. Our model extends
a representation of single video frames, pre-trained through contrastive
learning, with a transformer that we train through temporal self-supervision.
We demonstrate experimentally that our more challenging frame-level task
formulations and the removal of shortcuts drastically improve the quality of
features learned through temporal self-supervision. The generalization
capability of our self-supervised video method is evidenced by its
state-of-the-art performance in a wide range of high-level semantic tasks,
including video retrieval, action classification, and video attribute
recognition (such as object and scene identification), as well as low-level
temporal correspondence tasks like video object segmentation and pose tracking.
Additionally, we show that the video representations learned through our method
exhibit increased robustness to the input perturbations.

<title>Doubly Perturbed Task-Free Continual Learning. (arXiv:2312.13027v1 [cs.LG])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13027</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Task-free online continual learning (TF-CL) is a challenging problem where
the model incrementally learns tasks without explicit task information.
Although training with entire data from the past, present as well as future is
considered as the gold standard, naive approaches in TF-CL with the current
samples may be conflicted with learning with samples in the future, leading to
catastrophic forgetting and poor plasticity. Thus, a proactive consideration of
an unseen future sample in TF-CL becomes imperative. Motivated by this
intuition, we propose a novel TF-CL framework considering future samples and
show that injecting adversarial perturbations on both input data and
decision-making is effective. Then, we propose a novel method named Doubly
Perturbed Continual Learning (DPCL) to efficiently implement these input and
decision-making perturbations. Specifically, for input perturbation, we propose
an approximate perturbation method that injects noise into the input data as
well as the feature vector and then interpolates the two perturbed samples. For
decision-making process perturbation, we devise multiple stochastic
classifiers. We also investigate a memory management scheme and learning rate
scheduling reflecting our proposed double perturbations. We demonstrate that
our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline methods by large
margins on various TF-CL benchmarks.

<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13032</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become mainstream methods for solving the
semi-supervised node classification problem. However, due to the uneven
location distribution of labeled nodes in the graph, labeled nodes are only
accessible to a small portion of unlabeled nodes, leading to the
\emph{under-reaching} issue. In this study, we firstly reveal under-reaching by
conducting an empirical investigation on various well-known graphs. Then, we
demonstrate that under-reaching results in unsatisfactory distribution
alignment between labeled and unlabeled nodes through systematic experimental
analysis, significantly degrading GNNs&apos; performance. To tackle under-reaching
for GNNs, we propose an architecture-agnostic method dubbed NodeMixup. The
fundamental idea is to (1) increase the reachability of labeled nodes by
labeled-unlabeled pairs mixup, (2) leverage graph structures via fusing the
neighbor connections of intra-class node pairs to improve performance gains of
mixup, and (3) use neighbor label distribution similarity incorporating node
degrees to determine sampling weights for node mixup. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the efficacy of NodeMixup in assisting GNNs in handling
under-reaching. The source code is available at

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;This review paper provides an integrated perspective of Explainable
Artificial Intelligence techniques applied to Brain-Computer Interfaces. BCIs
use predictive models to interpret brain signals for various high-stake
applications. However, achieving explainability in these complex models is
challenging as it compromises accuracy. The field of XAI has emerged to address
the need for explainability across various stakeholders, but there is a lack of
an integrated perspective in XAI for BCI (XAI4BCI) literature. It is necessary
to differentiate key concepts like explainability, interpretability, and
understanding in this context and formulate a comprehensive framework. To
understand the need of XAI for BCI, we pose six key research questions for a
systematic review and meta-analysis, encompassing its purposes, applications,
usability, and technical feasibility. We employ the PRISMA methodology --
preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses to review
(n=1246) and analyze (n=84) studies published in 2015 and onwards for key
insights. The results highlight that current research primarily focuses on
interpretability for developers and researchers, aiming to justify outcomes and
enhance model performance. We discuss the unique approaches, advantages, and
limitations of XAI4BCI from the literature. We draw insights from philosophy,
psychology, and social sciences. We propose a design space for XAI4BCI,
considering the evolving need to visualize and investigate predictive model
outcomes customised for various stakeholders in the BCI development and
deployment lifecycle. This paper is the first to focus solely on reviewing
XAI4BCI research articles. This systematic review and meta-analysis findings
with the proposed design space prompt important discussions on establishing
standards for BCI explanations, highlighting current limitations, and guiding
the future of XAI in BCI.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;In this study, we present a deep learning-based approach for time-series
respiration data classification. The dataset contains regular breathing
patterns as well as various forms of abnormal breathing, obtained through
non-contact incoherent light-wave sensing (LWS) technology. Given the
one-dimensional (1D) nature of the data, we employed a 1D convolutional neural
network (1D-CNN) for classification purposes. Genetic algorithm was employed to
optimize the 1D-CNN architecture to maximize classification accuracy.
Addressing the computational complexity associated with training the 1D-CNN
across multiple generations, we implemented transfer learning from a
pre-trained model. This approach significantly reduced the computational time
required for training, thereby enhancing the efficiency of the optimization
process. This study contributes valuable insights into the potential
applications of deep learning methodologies for enhancing respiratory anomaly

<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13038</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Automated machine learning (AutoML) streamlines the creation of ML models.
While most methods select the &quot;best&quot; model based on predictive quality, it&apos;s
crucial to acknowledge other aspects, such as interpretability and resource
consumption. This holds particular importance in the context of deep neural
networks (DNNs), as these models are often perceived as computationally
intensive black boxes. In the challenging domain of time series forecasting,
DNNs achieve stunning results, but specialized approaches for automatically
selecting models are scarce. In this paper, we propose AutoXPCR - a novel
method for automated and explainable multi-objective model selection. Our
approach leverages meta-learning to estimate any model&apos;s performance along PCR
criteria, which encompass (P)redictive error, (C)omplexity, and (R)esource
demand. Explainability is addressed on multiple levels, as our interactive
framework can prioritize less complex models and provide by-product
explanations of recommendations. We demonstrate practical feasibility by
deploying AutoXPCR on over 1000 configurations across 114 data sets from
various domains. Our method clearly outperforms other model selection
approaches - on average, it only requires 20% of computation costs for
recommending models with 90% of the best-possible quality.

<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13068</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Over the past two decades, there has been a tremendous increase in the growth
of representation learning methods for graphs, with numerous applications
across various fields, including bioinformatics, chemistry, and the social
sciences. However, current dynamic network approaches focus on discrete-time
networks or treat links in continuous-time networks as instantaneous events.
Therefore, these approaches have limitations in capturing the persistence or
absence of links that continuously emerge and disappear over time for
particular durations. To address this, we propose a novel stochastic process
relying on survival functions to model the durations of links and their
absences over time. This forms a generic new likelihood specification
explicitly accounting for intermittent edge-persistent networks, namely GraSSP:
Graph Representation with Sequential Survival Process. We apply the developed
framework to a recent continuous time dynamic latent distance model
characterizing network dynamics in terms of a sequence of piecewise linear
movements of nodes in latent space. We quantitatively assess the developed
framework in various downstream tasks, such as link prediction and network
completion, demonstrating that the developed modeling framework accounting for
link persistence and absence well tracks the intrinsic trajectories of nodes in
a latent space and captures the underlying characteristics of evolving network
structure.

<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13091</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Reconstructing an avatar from a portrait image has many applications in
multimedia, but remains a challenging research problem. Extracting reflectance
maps and geometry from one image is ill-posed: recovering geometry is a
one-to-many mapping problem and reflectance and light are difficult to
disentangle. Accurate geometry and reflectance can be captured under the
controlled conditions of a light stage, but it is costly to acquire large
datasets in this fashion. Moreover, training solely with this type of data
leads to poor generalization with in-the-wild images. This motivates the
introduction of MoSAR, a method for 3D avatar generation from monocular images.
We propose a semi-supervised training scheme that improves generalization by
learning from both light stage and in-the-wild datasets. This is achieved using
a novel differentiable shading formulation. We show that our approach
effectively disentangles the intrinsic face parameters, producing relightable
avatars. As a result, MoSAR estimates a richer set of skin reflectance maps,
and generates more realistic avatars than existing state-of-the-art methods. We
also introduce a new dataset, named FFHQ-UV-Intrinsics, the first public
dataset providing intrisic face attributes at scale (diffuse, specular, ambient
occlusion and translucency maps) for a total of 10k subjects. The project
website and the dataset are available on the following link:

<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13110</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Learning representations of molecular structures using deep learning is a
fundamental problem in molecular property prediction tasks. Molecules
inherently exist in the real world as three-dimensional structures;
furthermore, they are not static but in continuous motion in the 3D Euclidean
space, forming a potential energy surface. Therefore, it is desirable to
generate multiple conformations in advance and extract molecular
representations using a 4D-QSAR model that incorporates multiple conformations.
However, this approach is impractical for drug and material discovery tasks
because of the computational cost of obtaining multiple conformations. To
address this issue, we propose a pre-training method for molecular GNNs using
an existing dataset of molecular conformations to generate a latent vector
universal to multiple conformations from a 2D molecular graph. Our method,
called Boltzmann GNN, is formulated by maximizing the conditional marginal
likelihood of a conditional generative model for conformations generation. We
show that our model has a better prediction performance for molecular
properties than existing pre-training methods using molecular graphs and
three-dimensional molecular structures.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;The transferability of adversarial examples is of central importance to
transfer-based black-box adversarial attacks. Previous works for generating
transferable adversarial examples focus on attacking \emph{given} pretrained
surrogate models while the connections between surrogate models and adversarial
trasferability have been overlooked. In this paper, we propose {\em Lipschitz
Regularized Surrogate} (LRS) for transfer-based black-box attacks, a novel
approach that transforms surrogate models towards favorable adversarial
transferability. Using such transformed surrogate models, any existing
transfer-based black-box attack can run without any change, yet achieving much
better performance. Specifically, we impose Lipschitz regularization on the
loss landscape of surrogate models to enable a smoother and more controlled
optimization process for generating more transferable adversarial examples. In
addition, this paper also sheds light on the connection between the inner
properties of surrogate models and adversarial transferability, where three
factors are identified: smaller local Lipschitz constant, smoother loss
landscape, and stronger adversarial robustness. We evaluate our proposed LRS
approach by attacking state-of-the-art standard deep neural networks and
defense models. The results demonstrate significant improvement on the attack
success rates and transferability. Our code is available at

constructing potential attack graphs that adversaries can exploit. Furthermore,
Prometheus evaluates the exploitability of these attack paths and quantifies
the overall security posture through a scoring mechanism. The system takes a

interconnections between these layers, exploring how vulnerabilities in one

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;The last six years have witnessed significant progress in adversarially
robust deep learning. As evidenced by the CIFAR-10 dataset category in
RobustBench benchmark, the accuracy under $\ell_\infty$ adversarial
perturbations improved from 44\% in \citet{Madry2018Towards} to 71\% in
\citet{peng2023robust}. Although impressive, existing state-of-the-art is still
far from satisfactory. It is further observed that best-performing models are
often very large models adversarially trained by industrial labs with
significant computational budgets. In this paper, we aim to understand: ``how
much longer can computing power drive adversarial robustness advances?&quot; To
answer this question, we derive \emph{scaling laws for adversarial robustness}
which can be extrapolated in the future to provide an estimate of how much cost
we would need to pay to reach a desired level of robustness. We show that
increasing the FLOPs needed for adversarial training does not bring as much
advantage as it does for standard training in terms of performance
improvements. Moreover, we find that some of the top-performing techniques are
difficult to exactly reproduce, suggesting that they are not robust enough for
minor changes in the training setup. Our analysis also uncovers potentially
worthwhile directions to pursue in future research. Finally, we make our
benchmarking framework (built on top of \texttt{timm}~\citep{rw2019timm})
publicly available to facilitate future analysis in efficient robust deep
learning.

<title>Molecular Hypergraph Neural Networks. (arXiv:2312.13136v1 [physics.chem-ph])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13136</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Graph neural networks (GNNs) have demonstrated promising performance across
various chemistry-related tasks. However, conventional graphs only model the
pairwise connectivity in molecules, failing to adequately represent
higher-order connections like multi-center bonds and conjugated structures. To
tackle this challenge, we introduce molecular hypergraphs and propose Molecular
Hypergraph Neural Networks (MHNN) to predict the optoelectronic properties of
organic semiconductors, where hyperedges represent conjugated structures. A
general algorithm is designed for irregular high-order connections, which can
efficiently operate on molecular hypergraphs with hyperedges of various orders.
The results show that MHNN outperforms all baseline models on most tasks of
OPV, OCELOTv1 and PCQM4Mv2 datasets. Notably, MHNN achieves this without any 3D
geometric information, surpassing the baseline model that utilizes atom
positions. Moreover, MHNN achieves better performance than pretrained GNNs
under limited training data, underscoring its excellent data efficiency. This
work provides a new strategy for more general molecular representations and
property prediction tasks related to high-order connections.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Data augmentation techniques play an important role in enhancing the

<title>Underwater Acoustic Signal Recognition Based on Salient Features. (arXiv:2312.13143v1 [cs.SD])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13143</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;With the rapid advancement of technology, the recognition of underwater
acoustic signals in complex environments has become increasingly crucial.
Currently, mainstream underwater acoustic signal recognition relies primarily
on time-frequency analysis to extract spectral features, finding widespread
applications in the field. However, existing recognition methods heavily depend
on expert systems, facing limitations such as restricted knowledge bases and
challenges in handling complex relationships. These limitations stem from the
complexity and maintenance difficulties associated with rules or inference
engines. Recognizing the potential advantages of deep learning in handling
intricate relationships, this paper proposes a method utilizing neural networks
for underwater acoustic signal recognition. The proposed approach involves
continual learning of features extracted from spectra for the classification of
underwater acoustic signals. Deep learning models can automatically learn
abstract features from data and continually adjust weights during training to
enhance classification performance.

<title>Neural Stochastic Differential Equations with Change Points: A Generative Adversarial Approach. (arXiv:2312.13152v1 [cs.LG])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13152</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Stochastic differential equations (SDEs) have been widely used to model real
world random phenomena. Existing works mainly focus on the case where the time
series is modeled by a single SDE, which might be restrictive for modeling time
series with distributional shift. In this work, we propose a change point
detection algorithm for time series modeled as neural SDEs. Given a time series
dataset, the proposed method jointly learns the unknown change points and the
parameters of distinct neural SDE models corresponding to each change point.
Specifically, the SDEs are learned under the framework of generative
adversarial networks (GANs) and the change points are detected based on the
output of the GAN discriminator in a forward pass. At each step of the proposed
algorithm, the change points and the SDE model parameters are updated in an
alternating fashion. Numerical results on both synthetic and real datasets are
provided to validate the performance of our algorithm in comparison to
classical change point detection benchmarks, standard GAN-based neural SDEs,
and other state-of-the-art deep generative models for time series data.

<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13173</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;We consider the problem of learning fair policies for multi-stage selection
problems from observational data. This problem arises in several high-stakes
domains such as company hiring, loan approval, or bail decisions where outcomes
(e.g., career success, loan repayment, recidivism) are only observed for those
selected. We propose a multi-stage framework that can be augmented with various
fairness constraints, such as demographic parity or equal opportunity. This
problem is a highly intractable infinite chance-constrained program involving
the unknown joint distribution of covariates and outcomes. Motivated by the
potential impact of selection decisions on people&apos;s lives and livelihoods, we
propose to focus on interpretable linear selection rules. Leveraging tools from
causal inference and sample average approximation, we obtain an asymptotically
consistent solution to this selection problem by solving a mixed binary conic
optimization problem, which can be solved using standard off-the-shelf solvers.
We conduct extensive computational experiments on a variety of datasets adapted
from the UCI repository on which we show that our proposed approaches can
achieve an 11.6% improvement in precision and a 38% reduction in the measure of
unfairness compared to the existing selection policy.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC) is a paradigm for quantum
computation where computation is driven by local measurements on a suitably
entangled resource state. In this work we show that MBQC is related to a model
of quantum computation based on Clifford quantum cellular automata (CQCA).
Specifically, we show that certain MBQCs can be directly constructed from CQCAs
which yields a simple and intuitive circuit model representation of MBQC in
terms of quantum computation based on CQCA. We apply this description to
construct various MBQC-based Ans\&quot;atze for parameterized quantum circuits,
demonstrating that the different Ans\&quot;atze may lead to significantly different
performances on different learning tasks. In this way, MBQC yields a family of
Hardware-efficient Ans\&quot;atze that may be adapted to specific problem settings
and is particularly well suited for architectures with translationally

<title>A 3D super-resolution of wind fields via physics-informed pixel-wise self-attention generative adversarial network. (arXiv:2312.13212v1 [physics.ao-ph])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13212</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;To mitigate global warming, greenhouse gas sources need to be resolved at a
high spatial resolution and monitored in time to ensure the reduction and
ultimately elimination of the pollution source. However, the complexity of
computation in resolving high-resolution wind fields left the simulations
impractical to test different time lengths and model configurations. This study
presents a preliminary development of a physics-informed super-resolution (SR)
generative adversarial network (GAN) that super-resolves the three-dimensional
(3D) low-resolution wind fields by upscaling x9 times. We develop a pixel-wise
self-attention (PWA) module that learns 3D weather dynamics via a
self-attention computation followed by a 2D convolution. We also employ a loss
term that regularizes the self-attention map during pretraining, capturing the
vertical convection process from input wind data. The new PWA SR-GAN shows the
high-fidelity super-resolved 3D wind data, learns a wind structure at the
high-frequency domain, and reduces the computational cost of a high-resolution
wind simulation by x89.7 times.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Public dataset limitations have significantly hindered the development and
benchmarking of learning to defer (L2D) algorithms, which aim to optimally
combine human and AI capabilities in hybrid decision-making systems. In such
systems, human availability and domain-specific concerns introduce
difficulties, while obtaining human predictions for training and evaluation is
costly. Financial fraud detection is a high-stakes setting where algorithms and
human experts often work in tandem; however, there are no publicly available
datasets for L2D concerning this important application of human-AI teaming. To
fill this gap in L2D research, we introduce the Financial Fraud Alert Review
Dataset (FiFAR), a synthetic bank account fraud detection dataset, containing
the predictions of a team of 50 highly complex and varied synthetic fraud
analysts, with varied bias and feature dependence. We also provide a realistic
definition of human work capacity constraints, an aspect of L2D systems that is
often overlooked, allowing for extensive testing of assignment systems under
real-world conditions. We use our dataset to develop a capacity-aware L2D
method and rejection learning approach under realistic data availability
conditions, and benchmark these baselines under an array of 300 distinct
testing scenarios. We believe that this dataset will serve as a pivotal
instrument in facilitating a systematic, rigorous, reproducible, and
transparent evaluation and comparison of L2D methods, thereby fostering the
development of more synergistic human-AI collaboration in decision-making
systems. The public dataset and detailed synthetic expert information are

<title>Finding Subgroups with Significant Treatment Effects. (arXiv:2103.07066v2 [econ.EM] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.07066</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Researchers often run resource-intensive randomized controlled trials (RCTs)
to estimate the causal effects of interventions on outcomes of interest. Yet
these outcomes are often noisy, and estimated overall effects can be small or
imprecise. Nevertheless, we may still be able to produce reliable evidence of
the efficacy of an intervention by finding subgroups with significant effects.
In this paper, we propose a machine-learning method that is specifically
optimized for finding such subgroups in noisy data. Unlike available methods
for personalized treatment assignment, our tool is fundamentally designed to
take significance testing into account: it produces a subgroup that is chosen
to maximize the probability of obtaining a statistically significant positive
treatment effect. We provide a computationally efficient implementation using
decision trees and demonstrate its gain over selecting subgroups based on
positive (estimated) treatment effects. Compared to standard tree-based
regression and classification tools, this approach tends to yield higher power
in detecting subgroups affected by the treatment.

situations where the observations include functions, typically time series. We
extend the modeling with Mixtures-of-Experts (ME), as a framework of choice in
modeling heterogeneity in data for prediction with vectorial observations, to
this functional data analysis context. We first present a new family of ME
models, named functional ME (FME) in which the predictors are potentially noisy
observations, from entire functions. Furthermore, the data generating process
of the predictor and the real response, is governed by a hidden discrete
variable representing an unknown partition. Second, by imposing sparsity on
derivatives of the underlying functional parameters via Lasso-like
regularizations, we provide sparse and interpretable functional representations
of the FME models called iFME. We develop dedicated expectation--maximization
algorithms for Lasso-like (EM-Lasso) regularized maximum-likelihood parameter
estimation strategies to fit the models. The proposed models and algorithms are
studied in simulated scenarios and in applications to two real data sets, and
the obtained results demonstrate their performance in accurately capturing

performance. This paper provides the first regret bounds on the performance of
dual-based PID controllers for online allocation problems. We do so by first
establishing a fundamental connection between dual-based PID controllers and a
new first-order algorithm for online convex optimization called
\emph{Convolutional Mirror Descent} (CMD), which updates iterates based on a
weighted moving average of past gradients. CMD recovers, in a special case,
online mirror descent with momentum and optimistic mirror descent. We establish
sufficient conditions under which CMD attains low regret for general online
convex optimization problems with adversarial inputs. We leverage this new
result to give the first regret bound for dual-based PID controllers for online
allocation problems. As a byproduct of our proofs, we provide the first regret
bound for CMD for non-smooth convex optimization, which might be of independent
interest.

<title>Attribution-based Explanations that Provide Recourse Cannot be Robust. (arXiv:2205.15834v3 [stat.ML] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.15834</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Different users of machine learning methods require different explanations,
depending on their goals. To make machine learning accountable to society, one
important goal is to get actionable options for recourse, which allow an
affected user to change the decision $f(x)$ of a machine learning system by
making limited changes to its input $x$. We formalize this by providing a
general definition of recourse sensitivity, which needs to be instantiated with
a utility function that describes which changes to the decisions are relevant
to the user. This definition applies to local attribution methods, which
attribute an importance weight to each input feature. It is often argued that
such local attributions should be robust, in the sense that a small change in
the input $x$ that is being explained, should not cause a large change in the
feature weights. However, we prove formally that it is in general impossible
for any single attribution method to be both recourse sensitive and robust at
the same time. It follows that there must always exist counterexamples to at
least one of these properties. We provide such counterexamples for several
popular attribution methods, including LIME, SHAP, Integrated Gradients and
SmoothGrad. Our results also cover counterfactual explanations, which may be
viewed as attributions that describe a perturbation of $x$. We further discuss
possible ways to work around our impossibility result, for instance by allowing
the output to consist of sets with multiple attributions, and we provide
sufficient conditions for specific classes of continuous functions to be
recourse sensitive. Finally, we strengthen our impossibility result for the
restricted case where users are only able to change a single attribute of $x$,
by providing an exact characterization of the functions $f$ to which
impossibility applies.

<title>On the Number of Regions of Piecewise Linear Neural Networks. (arXiv:2206.08615v2 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.08615</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Many feedforward neural networks (NNs) generate continuous and
piecewise-linear (CPWL) mappings. Specifically, they partition the input domain
into regions on which the mapping is affine. The number of these so-called
linear regions offers a natural metric to characterize the expressiveness of
CPWL NNs. The precise determination of this quantity is often out of reach in
practice, and bounds have been proposed for specific architectures, including
for ReLU and Maxout NNs. In this work, we generalize these bounds to NNs with
arbitrary and possibly multivariate CPWL activation functions. We first provide
upper and lower bounds on the maximal number of linear regions of a CPWL NN
given its depth, width, and the number of linear regions of its activation
functions. Our results rely on the combinatorial structure of convex partitions
and confirm the distinctive role of depth which, on its own, is able to
exponentially increase the number of regions. We then introduce a complementary
stochastic framework to estimate the average number of linear regions produced
by a CPWL NN. Under reasonable assumptions, the expected density of linear
regions along any 1D path is bounded by the product of depth, width, and a
measure of activation complexity (up to a scaling factor). This yields an
identical role to the three sources of expressiveness: no exponential growth
with depth is observed anymore.

<title>Multipoint-BAX: A New Approach for Efficiently Tuning Particle Accelerator Emittance via Virtual Objectives. (arXiv:2209.04587v5 [physics.acc-ph] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.04587</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Although beam emittance is critical for the performance of high-brightness
accelerators, optimization is often time limited as emittance calculations,
commonly done via quadrupole scans, are typically slow. Such calculations are a
type of $\textit{multipoint query}$, i.e. each query requires multiple
secondary measurements. Traditional black-box optimizers such as Bayesian
optimization are slow and inefficient when dealing with such objectives as they
must acquire the full series of measurements, but return only the emittance,
with each query. We propose a new information-theoretic algorithm,
Multipoint-BAX, for black-box optimization on multipoint queries, which queries
and models individual beam-size measurements using techniques from Bayesian
Algorithm Execution (BAX). Our method avoids the slow multipoint query on the
accelerator by acquiring points through a $\textit{virtual objective}$, i.e.
calculating the emittance objective from a fast learned model rather than
directly from the accelerator. We use Multipoint-BAX to minimize emittance at
the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) and the Facility for Advanced
Accelerator Experimental Tests II (FACET-II). In simulation, our method is
20$\times$ faster and more robust to noise compared to existing methods. In
live tests, it matched the hand-tuned emittance at FACET-II and achieved a 24%
lower emittance than hand-tuning at LCLS. Our method represents a conceptual
shift for optimizing multipoint queries, and we anticipate that it can be
readily adapted to similar problems in particle accelerators and other
scientific instruments.

<title>Automatic and effective discovery of quantum kernels. (arXiv:2209.11144v2 [quant-ph] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11144</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Quantum computing can empower machine learning models by enabling kernel
machines to leverage quantum kernels for representing similarity measures
between data. Quantum kernels are able to capture relationships in the data
that are not efficiently computable on classical devices. However, there is no
straightforward method to engineer the optimal quantum kernel for each specific
use case. While recent literature has focused on exploiting the potential
offered by the presence of symmetries in the data to guide the construction of
quantum kernels, we adopt here a different approach, which employs optimization
techniques, similar to those used in neural architecture search and AutoML, to
automatically find an optimal kernel in a heuristic manner. The algorithm we
present constructs a quantum circuit implementing the similarity measure as a
combinatorial object, which is evaluated based on a cost function and is then
iteratively modified using a meta-heuristic optimization technique. The cost
function can encode many criteria ensuring favorable statistical properties of
the candidate solution, such as the rank of the Dynamical Lie Algebra.
Importantly, our approach is independent of the optimization technique
employed. The results obtained by testing our approach on a high-energy physics
problem demonstrate that, in the best-case scenario, we can either match or
improve testing accuracy with respect to the manual design approach, showing
the potential of our technique to deliver superior results with reduced effort.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;We propose a differentiable imaging framework to address uncertainty in

formulate the problem as measurement interpolation at unknown nodes supervised
through the forward operator. To solve it we apply implicit neural networks,

the input coordinates. We also develop differentiable spline interpolators
which perform as well as neural networks, require less time to optimize and
have well-understood properties. Differentiability is key as it allows us to
jointly fit a measurement representation, optimize over the uncertain
measurement coordinates, and perform image reconstruction which in turn ensures
consistent calibration. We apply our approach to 2D and 3D computed tomography,
and show that it produces improved reconstructions compared to baselines that
do not account for the lack of calibration. The flexibility of the proposed
framework makes it easy to extend to almost arbitrary imaging problems.

<title>SoftCorrect: Error Correction with Soft Detection for Automatic Speech Recognition. (arXiv:2212.01039v2 [cs.CL] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.01039</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Error correction in automatic speech recognition (ASR) aims to correct those
incorrect words in sentences generated by ASR models. Since recent ASR models
usually have low word error rate (WER), to avoid affecting originally correct
tokens, error correction models should only modify incorrect words, and
therefore detecting incorrect words is important for error correction. Previous
works on error correction either implicitly detect error words through
target-source attention or CTC (connectionist temporal classification) loss, or
explicitly locate specific deletion/substitution/insertion errors. However,
implicit error detection does not provide clear signal about which tokens are
incorrect and explicit error detection suffers from low detection accuracy. In
this paper, we propose SoftCorrect with a soft error detection mechanism to
avoid the limitations of both explicit and implicit error detection.
Specifically, we first detect whether a token is correct or not through a
probability produced by a dedicatedly designed language model, and then design
a constrained CTC loss that only duplicates the detected incorrect tokens to
let the decoder focus on the correction of error tokens. Compared with implicit
error detection with CTC loss, SoftCorrect provides explicit signal about which
words are incorrect and thus does not need to duplicate every token but only
incorrect tokens; compared with explicit error detection, SoftCorrect does not
detect specific deletion/substitution/insertion errors but just leaves it to
CTC loss. Experiments on AISHELL-1 and Aidatatang datasets show that
SoftCorrect achieves 26.1% and 9.4% CER reduction respectively, outperforming
previous works by a large margin, while still enjoying fast speed of parallel
generation.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;As social media continues to grow rapidly, the prevalence of harassment on
these platforms has also increased. This has piqued the interest of researchers
in the field of fake detection. Social media data, often forms complex graphs
with numerous nodes, posing several challenges. These challenges and
limitations include dealing with a significant amount of irrelevant features in
matrices and addressing issues such as high data dispersion and an imbalanced
class distribution within the dataset. To overcome these challenges and
limitations, researchers have employed auto-encoders and a combination of
semi-supervised learning with a GAN algorithm, referred to as SGAN. Our
proposed method utilizes auto-encoders for feature extraction and incorporates
SGAN. By leveraging an unlabeled dataset, the unsupervised layer of SGAN
compensates for the limited availability of labeled data, making efficient use
of the limited number of labeled instances. Multiple evaluation metrics were
employed, including the Confusion Matrix and the ROC curve. The dataset was
divided into training and testing sets, with 100 labeled samples for training
and 1,000 samples for testing. The novelty of our research lies in applying
SGAN to address the issue of imbalanced datasets in fake account detection. By
optimizing the use of a smaller number of labeled instances and reducing the
need for extensive computational power, our method offers a more efficient
solution. Additionally, our study contributes to the field by achieving an 81%
accuracy in detecting fake accounts using only 100 labeled samples. This
demonstrates the potential of SGAN as a powerful tool for handling minority

First, we model instance relevance using a mixture of multiple timescales of

auxiliary scorer model that recovers the appropriate mixture of timescales as a
function of the instance itself. Finally, we propose a nested optimization
objective for learning the scorer, by which it maximizes forward transfer for
the learned model. Experiments on a large real-world dataset of 39M photos over
a 9 year period show upto 15% relative gains in accuracy compared to other
robust learning baselines. We replicate our gains on two collections of

<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.06370</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Accurate uncertainty quantification is necessary to enhance the reliability
of deep learning models in real-world applications. In the case of regression
tasks, prediction intervals (PIs) should be provided along with the
deterministic predictions of deep learning models. Such PIs are useful or
&quot;high-quality&quot; as long as they are sufficiently narrow and capture most of the
probability density. In this paper, we present a method to learn prediction
intervals for regression-based neural networks automatically in addition to the
conventional target predictions. In particular, we train two companion neural
networks: one that uses one output, the target estimate, and another that uses
two outputs, the upper and lower bounds of the corresponding PI. Our main
contribution is the design of a novel loss function for the PI-generation
network that takes into account the output of the target-estimation network and
has two optimization objectives: minimizing the mean prediction interval width
and ensuring the PI integrity using constraints that maximize the prediction
interval probability coverage implicitly. Furthermore, we introduce a
self-adaptive coefficient that balances both objectives within the loss
function, which alleviates the task of fine-tuning. Experiments using a
synthetic dataset, eight benchmark datasets, and a real-world crop yield
prediction dataset showed that our method was able to maintain a nominal
probability coverage and produce significantly narrower PIs without detriment
to its target estimation accuracy when compared to those PIs generated by three
state-of-the-art neural-network-based methods. In other words, our method was
shown to produce higher-quality PIs.

in safe, discreet, efficient, and non-invasive human breathing monitoring
without raising privacy concerns. The respiration monitoring system needs to be
trained on different types of breathing patterns to identify breathing
anomalies.The system must also validate the collected data as a breathing
waveform, discarding any faulty data caused by external interruption, user
movement, or system malfunction. To address these needs, this study simulated
normal and different types of abnormal respiration using a robot that mimics
human breathing patterns. Then, time-series respiration data were collected
using infrared light-wave sensing technology. Three machine learning
algorithms, decision tree, random forest and XGBoost, were applied to detect
breathing anomalies and faulty data. Model performances were evaluated through
cross-validation, assessing classification accuracy, precision and recall
scores. The random forest model achieved the highest classification accuracy of
96.75% with data collected at a 0.5m distance. In general, ensemble models like
random forest and XGBoost performed better than a single model in classifying
the data collected at multiple distances from the light-wave sensing setup.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Time Series Classification and Extrinsic Regression are important and
challenging machine learning tasks. Deep learning has revolutionized natural
language processing and computer vision and holds great promise in other fields
such as time series analysis where the relevant features must often be

current state of the art in the fast-moving field of deep learning for time
series classification and extrinsic regression. We review different network
architectures and training methods used for these tasks and discuss the
challenges and opportunities when applying deep learning to time series data.
We also summarize two critical applications of time series classification and

<title>Transformed Low-Rank Parameterization Can Help Robust Generalization for Tensor Neural Networks. (arXiv:2303.00196v3 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00196</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Achieving efficient and robust multi-channel data learning is a challenging
task in data science. By exploiting low-rankness in the transformed domain,
i.e., transformed low-rankness, tensor Singular Value Decomposition (t-SVD) has
achieved extensive success in multi-channel data representation and has
recently been extended to function representation such as Neural Networks with
t-product layers (t-NNs). However, it still remains unclear how t-SVD
theoretically affects the learning behavior of t-NNs. This paper is the first
to answer this question by deriving the upper bounds of the generalization
error of both standard and adversarially trained t-NNs. It reveals that the
t-NNs compressed by exact transformed low-rank parameterization can achieve a
sharper adversarial generalization bound. In practice, although t-NNs rarely
have exactly transformed low-rank weights, our analysis further shows that by
adversarial training with gradient flow (GF), the over-parameterized t-NNs with
ReLU activations are trained with implicit regularization towards transformed
low-rank parameterization under certain conditions. We also establish
adversarial generalization bounds for t-NNs with approximately transformed
low-rank weights. Our analysis indicates that the transformed low-rank
parameterization can promisingly enhance robust generalization for t-NNs.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Even though deep speaker models have demonstrated impressive accuracy in
speaker verification tasks, this often comes at the expense of increased model
size and computation time, presenting challenges for deployment in
resource-constrained environments. Our research focuses on addressing this
limitation through the development of small footprint deep speaker embedding
extraction using knowledge distillation. While previous work in this domain has
concentrated on speaker embedding extraction at the utterance level, our
approach involves amalgamating embeddings from different levels of the x-vector
model (teacher network) to train a compact student network. The results
highlight the significance of frame-level information, with the student models
exhibiting a remarkable size reduction of 85%-91% compared to their teacher
counterparts, depending on the size of the teacher embeddings. Notably, by
concatenating teacher embeddings, we achieve student networks that maintain
comparable performance to the teacher while enjoying a substantial 75%
reduction in model size. These findings and insights extend to other x-vector
variants, underscoring the broad applicability of our approach.

<title>Robust Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training against Data Poisoning and Backdoor Attacks. (arXiv:2303.06854v2 [cs.CV] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06854</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Contrastive vision-language representation learning has achieved
state-of-the-art performance for zero-shot classification, by learning from
millions of image-caption pairs crawled from the internet. However, the massive
data that powers large multimodal models such as CLIP, makes them extremely
vulnerable to various types of targeted data poisoning and backdoor attacks.
Despite this vulnerability, robust contrastive vision-language pre-training
against such attacks has remained unaddressed. In this work, we propose ROCLIP,
the first effective method for robust pre-training multimodal vision-language
models against targeted data poisoning and backdoor attacks. ROCLIP effectively
breaks the association between poisoned image-caption pairs by considering a
relatively large and varying pool of random captions, and matching every image
with the text that is most similar to it in the pool instead of its own
caption, every few epochs.It also leverages image and text augmentations to
further strengthen the defense and improve the performance of the model. Our
extensive experiments show that ROCLIP renders state-of-the-art targeted data
poisoning and backdoor attacks ineffective during pre-training CLIP models. In
particular, ROCLIP decreases the success rate for targeted data poisoning
attacks from 93.75% to 12.5% and that of backdoor attacks down to 0%, while
improving the model&apos;s linear probe performance by 10% and maintains a similar
zero shot performance compared to CLIP. By increasing the frequency of
matching, ROCLIP is able to defend strong attacks, which add up to 1% poisoned
examples to the data, and successfully maintain a low attack success rate of
12.5%, while trading off the performance on some tasks.

<title>Debiasing Scores and Prompts of 2D Diffusion for View-consistent Text-to-3D Generation. (arXiv:2303.15413v5 [cs.CV] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15413</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Existing score-distilling text-to-3D generation techniques, despite their
considerable promise, often encounter the view inconsistency problem. One of
the most notable issues is the Janus problem, where the most canonical view of
an object (\textit{e.g}., face or head) appears in other views. In this work,
we explore existing frameworks for score-distilling text-to-3D generation and
identify the main causes of the view inconsistency problem -- the embedded bias
of 2D diffusion models. Based on these findings, we propose two approaches to
debias the score-distillation frameworks for view-consistent text-to-3D
generation. Our first approach, called score debiasing, involves cutting off
the score estimated by 2D diffusion models and gradually increasing the
truncation value throughout the optimization process. Our second approach,
called prompt debiasing, identifies conflicting words between user prompts and
view prompts using a language model, and adjusts the discrepancy between view
prompts and the viewing direction of an object. Our experimental results show
that our methods improve the realism of the generated 3D objects by
significantly reducing artifacts and achieve a good trade-off between
faithfulness to the 2D diffusion models and 3D consistency with little
overhead. Our project page is available

<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16521</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Online deep clustering refers to the joint use of a feature extraction
network and a clustering model to assign cluster labels to each new data point
or batch as it is processed. While faster and more versatile than offline
methods, online clustering can easily reach the collapsed solution where the
encoder maps all inputs to the same point and all are put into a single
cluster. Successful existing models have employed various techniques to avoid
this problem, most of which require data augmentation or which aim to make the
average soft assignment across the dataset the same for each cluster. We
propose a method that does not require data augmentation, and that, differently
from existing methods, regularizes the hard assignments. Using a Bayesian
framework, we derive an intuitive optimization objective that can be
straightforwardly included in the training of the encoder network. Tested on
four image datasets and one human-activity recognition dataset, it consistently
avoids collapse more robustly than other methods and leads to more accurate
clustering. We also conduct further experiments and analyses justifying our
choice to regularize the hard cluster assignments. Code is available at

<title>RED-PSM: Regularization by Denoising of Partially Separable Models for Dynamic Imaging. (arXiv:2304.03483v3 [eess.IV] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03483</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Dynamic imaging addresses the recovery of a time-varying 2D or 3D object at
each time instant using its undersampled measurements. In particular, in the
case of dynamic tomography, only a single projection at a single view angle may
be available at a time, making the problem severely ill-posed. In this work, we
propose an approach, RED-PSM, which combines for the first time two powerful
techniques to address this challenging imaging problem. The first, are
partially separable models, which have been used to efficiently introduce a
low-rank prior for the spatio-temporal object. The second is the recent
\textit{Regularization by Denoising (RED)}, which provides a flexible framework
to exploit the impressive performance of state-of-the-art image denoising
algorithms, for various inverse problems. We propose a partially separable
objective with RED and a computationally efficient and scalable optimization
scheme with variable splitting and ADMM. Theoretical analysis proves the
convergence of our objective to a value corresponding to a stationary point
satisfying the first-order optimality conditions. Convergence is accelerated by
a particular projection-domain-based initialization. We demonstrate the
performance and computational improvements of our proposed RED-PSM with a
learned image denoiser by comparing it to a recent deep-prior-based method
known as TD-DIP. Although the main focus is on dynamic tomography, we also show
performance advantages of RED-PSM in a cardiac dynamic MRI setting.

<title>Exponentially Improved Efficient and Accurate Machine Learning for Quantum Many-body States with Provable Guarantees. (arXiv:2304.04353v2 [quant-ph] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04353</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Solving the ground state and the ground-state properties of quantum many-body
systems is generically a hard task for classical algorithms. For a family of
Hamiltonians defined on an $m$-dimensional space of physical parameters, the
ground state and its properties at an arbitrary parameter configuration can be
predicted via a machine learning protocol up to a prescribed prediction error
$\varepsilon$, provided that a sample set (of size $N$) of the states can be
efficiently prepared and measured. In a recent work [Huang et al., Science 377,
eabk3333 (2022)], a rigorous guarantee for such a generalization was proved.
Unfortunately, an exponential scaling for the provable sample complexity,
$N=m^{{\cal{O}}\left(\frac{1}{\varepsilon}\right)}$, was found to be universal
for generic gapped Hamiltonians. This result applies to the situation where the
dimension of the parameter space is large while the scaling with the accuracy
is not an urgent factor. In this work, we consider an alternative scenario
where $m$ is a finite, not necessarily large constant while the scaling with
the prediction error becomes the central concern. By jointly preserving the
fundamental properties of density matrices in the learning protocol and
utilizing the continuity of quantum states in the parameter range of interest,
we rigorously obtain a polynomial sample complexity for predicting quantum
many-body states and their properties, with respect to the uniform prediction
error $\varepsilon$ and the number of qubits $n$. Moreover, if restricted to
learning local quantum-state properties, the number of samples with respect to
$n$ can be further reduced exponentially. Our results provide theoretical
guarantees for efficient and accurate learning of quantum many-body states and
their properties, with model-independent applications not restricted to ground
states of gapped Hamiltonians.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Focusing on stochastic programming (SP) with covariate information, this
paper proposes an empirical risk minimization (ERM) method embedded within a
nonconvex piecewise affine decision rule (PADR), which aims to learn the direct

asymptotic consistency result for constrained ones. To solve the nonconvex and
nondifferentiable ERM problem, we develop an enhanced stochastic
majorization-minimization algorithm and establish the asymptotic convergence to
(composite strong) directional stationarity along with complexity analysis. We
show that the proposed PADR-based ERM method applies to a broad class of
nonconvex SP problems with theoretical consistency guarantees and computational
tractability. Our numerical study demonstrates the superior performance of
PADR-based ERM methods compared to state-of-the-art approaches under various

<title>LAVA: Data Valuation without Pre-Specified Learning Algorithms. (arXiv:2305.00054v3 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00054</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, data valuation (DV) is posed as a problem of equitably
splitting the validation performance of a learning algorithm among the training
data. As a result, the calculated data values depend on many design choices of
the underlying learning algorithm. However, this dependence is undesirable for
many DV use cases, such as setting priorities over different data sources in a
data acquisition process and informing pricing mechanisms in a data
marketplace. In these scenarios, data needs to be valued before the actual
analysis and the choice of the learning algorithm is still undetermined then.
Another side-effect of the dependence is that to assess the value of individual
points, one needs to re-run the learning algorithm with and without a point,
which incurs a large computation burden. This work leapfrogs over the current
limits of data valuation methods by introducing a new framework that can value
training data in a way that is oblivious to the downstream learning algorithm.
Our main results are as follows. (1) We develop a proxy for the validation
performance associated with a training set based on a non-conventional
class-wise Wasserstein distance between training and validation sets. We show
that the distance characterizes the upper bound of the validation performance
for any given model under certain Lipschitz conditions. (2) We develop a novel
method to value individual data based on the sensitivity analysis of the
class-wise Wasserstein distance. Importantly, these values can be directly
obtained for free from the output of off-the-shelf optimization solvers when
computing the distance. (3) We evaluate our new data valuation framework over
various use cases related to detecting low-quality data and show that,
surprisingly, the learning-agnostic feature of our framework enables a
significant improvement over SOTA performance while being orders of magnitude
faster.

<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12554</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Stochastic Human Motion Prediction (HMP) aims to predict multiple possible
upcoming pose sequences based on past human motion trajectories. Although
previous approaches have shown impressive performance, they face several
issues, including complex training processes and a tendency to generate
predictions that are often inconsistent with the provided history, and
sometimes even becoming entirely unreasonable. To overcome these issues, we
propose DiffMotion, an end-to-end diffusion-based stochastic HMP framework.
DiffMotion&apos;s motion predictor is composed of two modules, including (1) a
Transformer-based network for initial motion reconstruction from corrupted
motion, and (2) a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to refine the generated
motion considering past observations. Our method, facilitated by this novel
Transformer-GCN module design and a proposed variance scheduler, excels in
predicting accurate, realistic, and consistent motions, while maintaining an

<title>MultiFusion: Fusing Pre-Trained Models for Multi-Lingual, Multi-Modal Image Generation. (arXiv:2305.15296v3 [cs.CV] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15296</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;The recent popularity of text-to-image diffusion models (DM) can largely be
attributed to the intuitive interface they provide to users. The intended
generation can be expressed in natural language, with the model producing
faithful interpretations of text prompts. However, expressing complex or
nuanced ideas in text alone can be difficult. To ease image generation, we
propose MultiFusion that allows one to express complex and nuanced concepts
with arbitrarily interleaved inputs of multiple modalities and languages.
MutliFusion leverages pre-trained models and aligns them for integration into a
cohesive system, thereby avoiding the need for extensive training from scratch.
Our experimental results demonstrate the efficient transfer of capabilities
from individual modules to the downstream model. Specifically, the fusion of
all independent components allows the image generation module to utilize
multilingual, interleaved multimodal inputs despite being trained solely on
monomodal data in a single language.

<title>MADiff: Offline Multi-agent Learning with Diffusion Models. (arXiv:2305.17330v3 [cs.AI] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17330</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Diffusion model (DM), as a powerful generative model, recently achieved huge
success in various scenarios including offline reinforcement learning, where
the policy learns to conduct planning by generating trajectory in the online
evaluation. However, despite the effectiveness shown for single-agent learning,
it remains unclear how DMs can operate in multi-agent problems, where agents
can hardly complete teamwork without good coordination by independently
modeling each agent&apos;s trajectories. In this paper, we propose MADiff, a novel
generative multi-agent learning framework to tackle this problem. MADiff is
realized with an attention-based diffusion model to model the complex
coordination among behaviors of multiple diffusion agents. To the best of our
knowledge, MADiff is the first diffusion-based multi-agent offline RL
framework, which behaves as both a decentralized policy and a centralized
controller. During decentralized executions, MADiff simultaneously performs
teammate modeling, and the centralized controller can also be applied in
multi-agent trajectory predictions. Our experiments show the superior
performance of MADiff compared to baseline algorithms in a wide range of
multi-agent learning tasks, which emphasizes the effectiveness of MADiff in
modeling complex multi-agent interactions. Our code is available at

<title>Self Contrastive Learning for Session-based Recommendation. (arXiv:2306.01266v2 [cs.IR] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01266</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Session-based recommendation, which aims to predict the next item of users&apos;
interest as per an existing sequence interaction of items, has attracted
growing applications of Contrastive Learning (CL) with improved user and item
representations. However, these contrastive objectives: (1) serve a similar
role as the cross-entropy loss while ignoring the item representation space
optimisation; and (2) commonly require complicated modelling, including complex
positive/negative sample constructions and extra data augmentation. In this
work, we introduce Self-Contrastive Learning (SCL), which simplifies the
application of CL and enhances the performance of state-of-the-art CL-based
recommendation techniques. Specifically, SCL is formulated as an objective
function that directly promotes a uniform distribution among item
representations and efficiently replaces all the existing contrastive objective
components of state-of-the-art models. Unlike previous works, SCL eliminates
the need for any positive/negative sample construction or data augmentation,
leading to enhanced interpretability of the item representation space and
facilitating its extensibility to existing recommender systems. Through
experiments on three benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that SCL consistently
improves the performance of state-of-the-art models with statistical
significance. Notably, our experiments show that SCL improves the performance
of two best-performing models by 8.2% and 9.5% in P@10 (Precision) and 9.9% and
11.2% in MRR@10 (Mean Reciprocal Rank) on average across different benchmarks.
Additionally, our analysis elucidates the improvement in terms of alignment and
uniformity of representations, as well as the effectiveness of SCL with a low
computational cost.

<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02630</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;We consider the problem of best arm identification in the multi-armed bandit
model, under fixed confidence. Given a confidence input $\delta$, the goal is
to identify the arm with the highest mean reward with a probability of at least
1 -- $\delta$, while minimizing the number of arm pulls. While the literature
provides solutions to this problem under the assumption of independent arms
distributions, we propose a more flexible scenario where arms can be dependent
and rewards can be sampled simultaneously. This framework allows the learner to
estimate the covariance among the arms distributions, enabling a more efficient
identification of the best arm. The relaxed setting we propose is relevant in
various applications, such as clinical trials, where similarities between
patients or drugs suggest underlying correlations in the outcomes. We introduce
new algorithms that adapt to the unknown covariance of the arms and demonstrate
through theoretical guarantees that substantial improvement can be achieved
over the standard setting. Additionally, we provide new lower bounds for the
relaxed setting and present numerical simulations that support their
theoretical findings.

<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03410</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;We propose to use a simulation driven inverse inference approach to model the
dynamics of tree branches under manipulation. Learning branch dynamics and
gaining the ability to manipulate deformable vegetation can help with
occlusion-prone tasks, such as fruit picking in dense foliage, as well as
moving overhanging vines and branches for navigation in dense vegetation. The
underlying deformable tree geometry is encapsulated as coarse spring
abstractions executed on parallel, non-differentiable simulators. The implicit
statistical model defined by the simulator, reference trajectories obtained by
actively probing the ground truth, and the Bayesian formalism, together guide
the spring parameter posterior density estimation. Our non-parametric inference
algorithm, based on Stein Variational Gradient Descent, incorporates
biologically motivated assumptions into the inference process as neural network
driven learnt joint priors; moreover, it leverages the finite difference scheme
for gradient approximations. Real and simulated experiments confirm that our
model can predict deformation trajectories, quantify the estimation
uncertainty, and it can perform better when base-lined against other inference
algorithms, particularly from the Monte Carlo family. The model displays strong
robustness properties in the presence of heteroscedastic sensor noise;
furthermore, it can generalise to unseen grasp locations.

<title>Multi-task Bioassay Pre-training for Protein-ligand Binding Affinity Prediction. (arXiv:2306.04886v2 [q-bio.BM] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04886</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Protein-ligand binding affinity (PLBA) prediction is the fundamental task in
drug discovery. Recently, various deep learning-based models predict binding
affinity by incorporating the three-dimensional structure of protein-ligand
complexes as input and achieving astounding progress. However, due to the
scarcity of high-quality training data, the generalization ability of current
models is still limited. In addition, different bioassays use varying affinity
measurement labels (i.e., IC50, Ki, Kd), and different experimental conditions
inevitably introduce systematic noise, which poses a significant challenge to
constructing high-precision affinity prediction models. To address these
issues, we (1) propose Multi-task Bioassay Pre-training (MBP), a pre-training
framework for structure-based PLBA prediction; (2) construct a pre-training
dataset called ChEMBL-Dock with more than 300k experimentally measured affinity
labels and about 2.8M docked three-dimensional structures. By introducing
multi-task pre-training to treat the prediction of different affinity labels as
different tasks and classifying relative rankings between samples from the same
bioassay, MBP learns robust and transferrable structural knowledge from our new
ChEMBL-Dock dataset with varied and noisy labels. Experiments substantiate the
capability of MBP as a general framework that can improve and be tailored to
mainstream structure-based PLBA prediction tasks. To the best of our knowledge,
MBP is the first affinity pre-training model and shows great potential for
future development.

<title>A Graph Dynamics Prior for Relational Inference. (arXiv:2306.06041v2 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06041</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Relational inference aims to identify interactions between parts of a
dynamical system from the observed dynamics. Current state-of-the-art methods
fit the dynamics with a graph neural network (GNN) on a learnable graph. They
use one-step message-passing GNNs -- intuitively the right choice since
non-locality of multi-step or spectral GNNs may confuse direct and indirect
interactions. But the \textit{effective} interaction graph depends on the
sampling rate and it is rarely localized to direct neighbors, leading to poor
local optima for the one-step model. In this work, we propose a \textit{graph
dynamics prior} (GDP) for relational inference. GDP constructively uses error
amplification in non-local polynomial filters to steer the solution to the
ground-truth graph. To deal with non-uniqueness, GDP simultaneously fits a
``shallow&apos;&apos; one-step model and a polynomial multi-step model with shared graph
topology. Experiments show that GDP reconstructs graphs far more accurately
than earlier methods, with remarkable robustness to under-sampling. Since
appropriate sampling rates for unknown dynamical systems are not known a
priori, this robustness makes GDP suitable for real applications in scientific
machine learning. Reproducible code is available at

<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.10982</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Federated learning (FL) enables edge devices to collaboratively train machine
learning models, with model communication replacing direct data uploading.
While over-the-air model aggregation improves communication efficiency,
uploading models to an edge server over wireless networks can pose privacy
risks. Differential privacy (DP) is a widely used quantitative technique to
measure statistical data privacy in FL. Previous research has focused on
over-the-air FL with a single-antenna server, leveraging communication noise to
enhance user-level DP. This approach achieves the so-called &quot;free DP&quot; by
controlling transmit power rather than introducing additional DP-preserving
mechanisms at devices, such as adding artificial noise. In this paper, we study
differentially private over-the-air FL over a multiple-input multiple-output
(MIMO) fading channel. We show that FL model communication with a
multiple-antenna server amplifies privacy leakage as the multiple-antenna
server employs separate receive combining for model aggregation and information
inference. Consequently, relying solely on communication noise, as done in the
multiple-input single-output system, cannot meet high privacy requirements, and
a device-side privacy-preserving mechanism is necessary for optimal DP design.
We analyze the learning convergence and privacy loss of the studied FL system
and propose a transceiver design algorithm based on alternating optimization.
Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves a better
privacy-learning trade-off compared to prior work.

<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12045</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Developing computational models of neural response is crucial for
understanding sensory processing and neural computations. Current
state-of-the-art neural network methods use temporal filters to handle temporal
dependencies, resulting in an unrealistic and inflexible processing paradigm.
Meanwhile, these methods target trial-averaged firing rates and fail to capture
important features in spike trains. This work presents the temporal
conditioning spiking latent variable models (TeCoS-LVM) to simulate the neural
response to natural visual stimuli. We use spiking neurons to produce spike
outputs that directly match the recorded trains. This approach helps to avoid
losing information embedded in the original spike trains. We exclude the
temporal dimension from the model parameter space and introduce a temporal
conditioning operation to allow the model to adaptively explore and exploit
temporal dependencies in stimuli sequences in a {\it natural paradigm}. We show
that TeCoS-LVM models can produce more realistic spike activities and
accurately fit spike statistics than powerful alternatives. Additionally,
learned TeCoS-LVM models can generalize well to longer time scales. Overall,
while remaining computationally tractable, our model effectively captures key
features of neural coding systems. It thus provides a useful tool for building
accurate predictive computational accounts for various sensory perception
circuits.

<title>Bootstrapping Vision-Language Learning with Decoupled Language Pre-training. (arXiv:2307.07063v4 [cs.CV] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07063</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;We present a novel methodology aimed at optimizing the application of frozen
large language models (LLMs) for resource-intensive vision-language (VL)
pre-training. The current paradigm uses visual features as prompts to guide
language models, with a focus on determining the most relevant visual features
for corresponding text. Our approach diverges by concentrating on the language
component, specifically identifying the optimal prompts to align with visual
features. We introduce the Prompt-Transformer (P-Former), a model that predicts
these ideal prompts, which is trained exclusively on linguistic data, bypassing
the need for image-text pairings. This strategy subtly bifurcates the
end-to-end VL training process into an additional, separate stage. Our
experiments reveal that our framework significantly enhances the performance of
a robust image-to-text baseline (BLIP-2), and effectively narrows the
performance gap between models trained with either 4M or 129M image-text pairs.
Importantly, our framework is modality-agnostic and flexible in terms of
architectural design, as validated by its successful application in a video
learning task using varied base modules. The code will be made available at
https://github.com/yiren-jian/BLIText.

<title>Feature Transportation Improves Graph Neural Networks. (arXiv:2307.16092v2 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</title>

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown remarkable success in learning
representations for graph-structured data. However, GNNs still face challenges
in modeling complex phenomena that involve feature transportation. In this
paper, we propose a novel GNN architecture inspired by
Advection-Diffusion-Reaction systems, called ADR-GNN. Advection models feature
transportation, while diffusion captures the local smoothing of features, and
reaction represents the non-linear transformation between feature channels. We
provide an analysis of the qualitative behavior of ADR-GNN, that shows the
benefit of combining advection, diffusion, and reaction. To demonstrate its
efficacy, we evaluate ADR-GNN on real-world node classification and
spatio-temporal datasets, and show that it improves or offers competitive
performance compared to state-of-the-art networks.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;We introduce DeSCo, a scalable neural deep subgraph counting pipeline,
designed to accurately predict both the count and occurrence position of
queries on target graphs post single training. Firstly, DeSCo uses a novel

graphs, greatly reducing the count variation while guaranteeing no missing or
double-counting. Secondly, neighborhood counting uses an expressive
subgraph-based heterogeneous graph neural network to accurately count in each
neighborhood. Finally, gossip propagation propagates neighborhood counts with
learnable gates to harness the inductive biases of motif counts. DeSCo is
evaluated on eight real-world datasets from various domains. It outperforms
state-of-the-art neural methods with 137x improvement in the mean squared error

<title>Two-and-a-half Order Score-based Model for Solving 3D Ill-posed Inverse Problems. (arXiv:2308.08511v3 [eess.IV] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08511</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Computed Tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) are crucial
technologies in the field of medical imaging. Score-based models have proven to
be effective in addressing different inverse problems encountered in CT and
MRI, such as sparse-view CT and fast MRI reconstruction. However, these models
face challenges in achieving accurate three dimensional (3D) volumetric
reconstruction. The existing score-based models primarily focus on
reconstructing two dimensional (2D) data distribution, leading to
inconsistencies between adjacent slices in the reconstructed 3D volumetric
images. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel two-and-a-half order
score-based model (TOSM). During the training phase, our TOSM learns data
distributions in 2D space, which reduces the complexity of training compared to
directly working on 3D volumes. However, in the reconstruction phase, the TOSM
updates the data distribution in 3D space, utilizing complementary scores along
three directions (sagittal, coronal, and transaxial) to achieve a more precise
reconstruction. The development of TOSM is built on robust theoretical
principles, ensuring its reliability and efficacy. Through extensive
experimentation on large-scale sparse-view CT and fast MRI datasets, our method
demonstrates remarkable advancements and attains state-of-the-art results in
solving 3D ill-posed inverse problems. Notably, the proposed TOSM effectively
addresses the inter-slice inconsistency issue, resulting in high-quality 3D
volumetric reconstruction.

<title>PMET: Precise Model Editing in a Transformer. (arXiv:2308.08742v4 [cs.CL] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08742</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Model editing techniques modify a minor proportion of knowledge in Large
Language Models (LLMs) at a relatively low cost, which have demonstrated
notable success. Existing methods assume Transformer Layer (TL) hidden states
are values of key-value memories of the Feed-Forward Network (FFN). They
usually optimize the TL hidden states to memorize target knowledge and use it
to update the weights of the FFN in LLMs. However, the information flow of TL
hidden states comes from three parts: Multi-Head Self-Attention (MHSA), FFN,
and residual connections. Existing methods neglect the fact that the TL hidden
states contains information not specifically required for FFN. Consequently,
the performance of model editing decreases. To achieve more precise model
editing, we analyze hidden states of MHSA and FFN, finding that MHSA encodes
certain general knowledge extraction patterns. This implies that MHSA weights
do not require updating when new knowledge is introduced. Based on above
findings, we introduce PMET, which simultaneously optimizes Transformer
Component (TC, namely MHSA and FFN) hidden states, while only using the
optimized TC hidden states of FFN to precisely update FFN weights. Our
experiments demonstrate that PMET exhibits state-of-the-art performance on both
the COUNTERFACT and zsRE datasets. Our ablation experiments substantiate the
effectiveness of our enhancements, further reinforcing the finding that the
MHSA encodes certain general knowledge extraction patterns and indicating its
storage of a small amount of factual knowledge. Our code is available at

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;We propose to learn non-convex regularizers with a prescribed upper bound on
their weak-convexity modulus. Such regularizers give rise to variational
denoisers that minimize a convex energy. They rely on few parameters (less than
15,000) and offer a signal-processing interpretation as they mimic handcrafted
sparsity-promoting regularizers. Through numerical experiments, we show that
such denoisers outperform convex-regularization methods as well as the popular
BM3D denoiser. Additionally, the learned regularizer can be deployed to solve
inverse problems with iterative schemes that provably converge. For both CT and
MRI reconstruction, the regularizer generalizes well and offers an excellent
tradeoff between performance, number of parameters, guarantees, and
interpretability when compared to other data-driven approaches.

<title>From system models to class models: An in-context learning paradigm. (arXiv:2308.13380v2 [eess.SY] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13380</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Is it possible to understand the intricacies of a dynamical system not solely
from its input/output pattern, but also by observing the behavior of other
systems within the same class? This central question drives the study presented
in this paper.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to this query, we introduce a novel paradigm for system
identification, addressing two primary tasks: one-step-ahead prediction and
multi-step simulation. Unlike conventional methods, we do not directly estimate
a model for the specific system. Instead, we learn a meta model that represents
a class of dynamical systems. This meta model is trained on a potentially
infinite stream of synthetic data, generated by simulators whose settings are
randomly extracted from a probability distribution. When provided with a
context from a new system-specifically, an input/output sequence-the meta model
implicitly discerns its dynamics, enabling predictions of its behavior.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposed approach harnesses the power of Transformers, renowned for their
\emph{in-context learning} capabilities. For one-step prediction, a GPT-like
decoder-only architecture is utilized, whereas the simulation problem employs
an encoder-decoder structure. Initial experimental results affirmatively answer
our foundational question, opening doors to fresh research avenues in system
identification.

<title>On the Tradeoff between Privacy Preservation and Byzantine-Robustness in Decentralized Learning. (arXiv:2308.14606v3 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14606</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;This paper jointly considers privacy preservation and Byzantine-robustness in
decentralized learning. In a decentralized network, honest-but-curious agents
faithfully follow the prescribed algorithm, but expect to infer their
neighbors&apos; private data from messages received during the learning process,
while dishonest-and-Byzantine agents disobey the prescribed algorithm, and
deliberately disseminate wrong messages to their neighbors so as to bias the
learning process. For this novel setting, we investigate a generic
privacy-preserving and Byzantine-robust decentralized stochastic gradient
descent (SGD) framework, in which Gaussian noise is injected to preserve
privacy and robust aggregation rules are adopted to counteract Byzantine
attacks. We analyze its learning error and privacy guarantee, discovering an
essential tradeoff between privacy preservation and Byzantine-robustness in
decentralized learning -- the learning error caused by defending against
Byzantine attacks is exacerbated by the Gaussian noise added to preserve
privacy. For a class of state-of-the-art robust aggregation rules, we give
unified analysis of the &quot;mixing abilities&quot;. Building upon this analysis, we
reveal how the &quot;mixing abilities&quot; affect the tradeoff between privacy
preservation and Byzantine-robustness. The theoretical results provide
guidelines for achieving a favorable tradeoff with proper design of robust
aggregation rules. Numerical experiments are conducted and corroborate our
theoretical findings.

<title>Data-Juicer: A One-Stop Data Processing System for Large Language Models. (arXiv:2309.02033v3 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02033</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;The immense evolution in Large Language Models (LLMs) has underscored the
importance of massive, heterogeneous, and high-quality data. A data recipe is a
mixture of data from different sources for training LLMs, which plays a vital
role in LLMs&apos; performance. Existing open-source tools for LLM data processing
are mostly tailored for specific data recipes. To continuously uncover the
potential of LLMs, incorporate data from new sources, and improve LLMs&apos;
performance, we build a new system named Data-Juicer, with which we can
efficiently generate diverse data recipes, explore different possibilities in
forming data mixtures, and evaluate their effects on model performance.
Different from traditional data-analytics pipelines, Data-Juicer faces some
unique challenges. Firstly, the possible data sources for forming data recipes
are truly heterogeneous and massive with various qualities. Secondly, it is
extremely expensive to precisely evaluate data recipes&apos; impact on LLMs&apos;
performance. Thirdly, the end users of Data-Juicer, model developers, need
sufficient flexibility to configure and evaluate different data recipes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data-Juicer features a fine-grained abstraction of pipelines for constructing
data recipes, with over 50 built-in operators for easy composition and
extension. By incorporating visualization and auto-evaluation capabilities,
Data-Juicer enables a timely feedback loop for both LLM pre-training and
fine-tuning. Further, Data-Juicer is optimized and integrated with ecosystems
for LLM training, evaluation, and distributed computing. The data recipes
derived with Data-Juicer gain notable improvements on state-of-the-art LLMs, by
up to 7.45% increase in averaged score across 16 LLM benchmarks and 17.5%
higher win rate in pair-wise GPT-4 evaluations. Our system, data recipes, and
tutorials are released, calling for broader data-centric research on training
and understanding LLMs.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Decision trees remain one of the most popular machine learning models today,
largely due to their out-of-the-box performance and interpretability. In this
work, we present a Bayesian approach to decision tree induction via maximum a

demonstrate a connection between maximum a posteriori inference of decision
trees and AND/OR search. Using this connection, we propose an AND/OR search
algorithm, dubbed MAPTree, which is able to recover the maximum a posteriori
tree. Lastly, we demonstrate the empirical performance of the maximum a
posteriori tree both on synthetic data and in real world settings. On 16 real
world datasets, MAPTree either outperforms baselines or demonstrates comparable
performance but with much smaller trees. On a synthetic dataset, MAPTree also
demonstrates greater robustness to noise and better generalization than
existing approaches. Finally, MAPTree recovers the maxiumum a posteriori tree
faster than existing sampling approaches and, in contrast with those
algorithms, is able to provide a certificate of optimality. The code for our

<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01685</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Interpretability for machine learning models in medical imaging (MLMI) is an
important direction of research. However, there is a general sense of murkiness
in what interpretability means. Why does the need for interpretability in MLMI
arise? What goals does one actually seek to address when interpretability is
needed? To answer these questions, we identify a need to formalize the goals
and elements of interpretability in MLMI. By reasoning about real-world tasks
and goals common in both medical image analysis and its intersection with
machine learning, we identify five core elements of interpretability:
localization, visual recognizability, physical attribution, model transparency,
and actionability. From this, we arrive at a framework for interpretability in
MLMI, which serves as a step-by-step guide to approaching interpretability in
this context. Overall, this paper formalizes interpretability needs in the
context of medical imaging, and our applied perspective clarifies concrete
MLMI-specific goals and considerations in order to guide method design and
improve real-world usage. Our goal is to provide practical and didactic
information for model designers and practitioners, inspire developers of models
in the medical imaging field to reason more deeply about what interpretability
is achieving, and suggest future directions of interpretability research.

<title>Graph Neural Network-based EEG Classification: A Survey. (arXiv:2310.02152v2 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02152</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Graph neural networks (GNN) are increasingly used to classify EEG for tasks
such as emotion recognition, motor imagery and neurological diseases and
disorders. A wide range of methods have been proposed to design GNN-based
classifiers. Therefore, there is a need for a systematic review and
categorisation of these approaches. We exhaustively search the published
literature on this topic and derive several categories for comparison. These
categories highlight the similarities and differences among the methods. The
results suggest a prevalence of spectral graph convolutional layers over
spatial. Additionally, we identify standard forms of node features, with the
most popular being the raw EEG signal and differential entropy. Our results
summarise the emerging trends in GNN-based approaches for EEG classification.
Finally, we discuss several promising research directions, such as exploring
the potential of transfer learning methods and appropriate modelling of
cross-frequency interactions.

<title>Taming Binarized Neural Networks and Mixed-Integer Programs. (arXiv:2310.04469v3 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04469</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;There has been a great deal of recent interest in binarized neural networks,
especially because of their explainability. At the same time, automatic
differentiation algorithms such as backpropagation fail for binarized neural
networks, which limits their applicability. By reformulating the problem of
training binarized neural networks as a subadditive dual of a mixed-integer
program, we show that binarized neural networks admit a tame representation.
This, in turn, makes it possible to use the framework of Bolte et al. for
implicit differentiation, which offers the possibility for practical
implementation of backpropagation in the context of binarized neural networks.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This approach could also be used for a broader class of mixed-integer
programs, beyond the training of binarized neural networks, as encountered in
symbolic approaches to AI and beyond.

<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06958</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Nowadays neural-network-based image- and video-quality metrics show better
performance compared to traditional methods. However, they also became more
vulnerable to adversarial attacks that increase metrics&apos; scores without
improving visual quality. The existing benchmarks of quality metrics compare
their performance in terms of correlation with subjective quality and
calculation time. However, the adversarial robustness of image-quality metrics
is also an area worth researching. In this paper, we analyse modern metrics&apos;
robustness to different adversarial attacks. We adopted adversarial attacks
from computer vision tasks and compared attacks&apos; efficiency against 15
no-reference image/video-quality metrics. Some metrics showed high resistance
to adversarial attacks which makes their usage in benchmarks safer than
vulnerable metrics. The benchmark accepts new metrics submissions for
researchers who want to make their metrics more robust to attacks or to find
such metrics for their needs. Try our benchmark using pip install

<title>Online RL in Linearly $q^\pi$-Realizable MDPs Is as Easy as in Linear MDPs If You Learn What to Ignore. (arXiv:2310.07811v2 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07811</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;We consider online reinforcement learning (RL) in episodic Markov decision
processes (MDPs) under the linear $q^\pi$-realizability assumption, where it is
assumed that the action-values of all policies can be expressed as linear
functions of state-action features. This class is known to be more general than
linear MDPs, where the transition kernel and the reward function are assumed to
be linear functions of the feature vectors. As our first contribution, we show
that the difference between the two classes is the presence of states in
linearly $q^\pi$-realizable MDPs where for any policy, all the actions have
approximately equal values, and skipping over these states by following an
arbitrarily fixed policy in those states transforms the problem to a linear
MDP. Based on this observation, we derive a novel (computationally inefficient)
learning algorithm for linearly $q^\pi$-realizable MDPs that simultaneously
learns what states should be skipped over and runs another learning algorithm
on the linear MDP hidden in the problem. The method returns an
$\epsilon$-optimal policy after $\text{polylog}(H, d)/\epsilon^2$ interactions
with the MDP, where $H$ is the time horizon and $d$ is the dimension of the
feature vectors, giving the first polynomial-sample-complexity online RL
algorithm for this setting. The results are proved for the misspecified case,
where the sample complexity is shown to degrade gracefully with the
misspecification error.

<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16999</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;We describe a method for verifying the output of a deep neural network for
medical image segmentation that is robust to several classes of random as well
as worst-case perturbations i.e. adversarial attacks. This method is based on a
general approach recently developed by the authors called &quot;Trust, but Verify&quot;
wherein an auxiliary verification network produces predictions about certain
masked features in the input image using the segmentation as an input. A
well-designed auxiliary network will produce high-quality predictions when the
input segmentations are accurate, but will produce low-quality predictions when
the segmentations are incorrect. Checking the predictions of such a network
with the original image allows us to detect bad segmentations. However, to
ensure the verification method is truly robust, we need a method for checking
the quality of the predictions that does not itself rely on a black-box neural
network. Indeed, we show that previous methods for segmentation evaluation that
do use deep neural regression networks are vulnerable to false negatives i.e.
can inaccurately label bad segmentations as good. We describe the design of a
verification network that avoids such vulnerability and present results to
demonstrate its robustness compared to previous methods.

<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03351</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Combining offline and online reinforcement learning (RL) is crucial for
efficient and safe learning. However, previous approaches treat offline and
online learning as separate procedures, resulting in redundant designs and
limited performance. We ask: Can we achieve straightforward yet effective
offline and online learning without introducing extra conservatism or
regularization? In this study, we propose Uni-o4, which utilizes an on-policy
objective for both offline and online learning. Owning to the alignment of
objectives in two phases, the RL agent can transfer between offline and online
learning seamlessly. This property enhances the flexibility of the learning
paradigm, allowing for arbitrary combinations of pretraining, fine-tuning,
offline, and online learning. In the offline phase, specifically, Uni-o4
leverages diverse ensemble policies to address the mismatch issues between the
estimated behavior policy and the offline dataset. Through a simple offline
policy evaluation (OPE) approach, Uni-o4 can achieve multi-step policy
improvement safely. We demonstrate that by employing the method above, the
fusion of these two paradigms can yield superior offline initialization as well
as stable and rapid online fine-tuning capabilities. Through real-world robot
tasks, we highlight the benefits of this paradigm for rapid deployment in
challenging, previously unseen real-world environments. Additionally, through
comprehensive evaluations using numerous simulated benchmarks, we substantiate
that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both offline and
offline-to-online fine-tuning learning. Our website:

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Multimedia generation approaches occupy a prominent place in artificial
intelligence research. Text-to-image models achieved high-quality results over
the last few years. However, video synthesis methods recently started to
develop. This paper presents a new two-stage latent diffusion text-to-video
generation architecture based on the text-to-image diffusion model. The first
stage concerns keyframes synthesis to figure the storyline of a video, while
the second one is devoted to interpolation frames generation to make movements
of the scene and objects smooth. We compare several temporal conditioning
approaches for keyframes generation. The results show the advantage of using
separate temporal blocks over temporal layers in terms of metrics reflecting
video generation quality aspects and human preference. The design of our
interpolation model significantly reduces computational costs compared to other
masked frame interpolation approaches. Furthermore, we evaluate different
configurations of MoVQ-based video decoding scheme to improve consistency and
achieve higher PSNR, SSIM, MSE, and LPIPS scores. Finally, we compare our
pipeline with existing solutions and achieve top-2 scores overall and top-1
among open-source solutions: CLIPSIM = 0.2976 and FVD = 433.054. Project page:

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Stress-strain curves, or more generally, stress functions, are an extremely
important characterization of a material&apos;s mechanical properties. However,
stress functions are often difficult to derive and are narrowly tailored to a

sensitivity, and effect of material parameters compound modeling challenges. We
propose a generalized deep neural network approach to model stress as a state
function with quantile regression to capture uncertainty. We extend these
models to uniaxial impact mechanics using stochastic differential equations to
demonstrate a use case and provide a framework for implementing this
uncertainty-aware stress function. We provide experiments benchmarking our
approach against leading constitutive, machine learning, and transfer learning
approaches to stress and impact mechanics modeling on publicly available and

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;External control arms (ECA) can inform the early clinical development of
experimental drugs and provide efficacy evidence for regulatory approval in
non-randomized settings. However, the main challenge of implementing ECA lies
in accessing real-world data or historical clinical trials. Indeed, data
sharing is often not feasible due to privacy considerations related to data
leaving the original collection centers, along with pharmaceutical companies&apos;
competitive motives. In this paper, we leverage a privacy-enhancing technology
called federated learning (FL) to remove some of the barriers to data sharing.
We introduce a federated learning inverse probability of treatment weighted
(IPTW) method for time-to-event outcomes called FedECA which eases the
implementation of ECA by limiting patients&apos; data exposure. We show with
extensive experiments that FedECA outperforms its closest competitor,
matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC), in terms of statistical power and
ability to balance the treatment and control groups. To encourage the use of
such methods, we publicly release our code which relies on Substra, an
open-source FL software with proven experience in privacy-sensitive contexts.

response which help save lives, livelihoods, and scarce financial resources. In
this work we present a new quantitative methodology to forecast levels of food
consumption for 60 consecutive days, at the sub-national level, in four
countries: Mali, Nigeria, Syria, and Yemen. The methodology is built on
publicly available data from the World Food Programme&apos;s integrated global
hunger monitoring system which collects, processes, and displays daily updates
on key food security metrics, conflict, weather events, and other drivers of
food insecurity across 90 countries (https://hungermap.wfp.org/). In this
study, we assessed the performance of various models including ARIMA, XGBoost,
LSTMs, CNNs, and Reservoir Computing (RC), by comparing their Root Mean Squared
Error (RMSE) metrics. This comprehensive analysis spanned classical
statistical, machine learning, and deep learning approaches. Our findings
highlight Reservoir Computing as a particularly well-suited model in the field
of food security given both its notable resistance to over-fitting on limited
data samples and its efficient training capabilities. The methodology we
introduce establishes the groundwork for a global, data-driven early warning

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;The recent surge of pervasive devices that generate dynamic data streams has
underscored the necessity for learning systems to adapt continually to data
distributional shifts. To tackle this challenge, the research community has put
forth a spectrum of methodologies, including the demanding pursuit of

a parameter isolation method that aims to significantly enhance the performance
of replay-free solutions and achieve state-of-the-art results on several widely
studied datasets. Our approach introduces two main contributions: two
alternative distillation procedures that significantly improve the efficiency
of MIND increasing the accumulated knowledge of each sub-network, and the
optimization of the BachNorm layers across tasks inside the sub-networks.
Overall, MIND outperforms all the state-of-the-art methods for rehearsal-free
Class-Incremental learning (with an increment in classification accuracy of
approx. +6% on CIFAR-100/10 and +10% on TinyImageNet/10) reaching up to approx.
+40% accuracy in Domain-Incremental scenarios. Moreover, we ablated each
contribution to demonstrate its impact on performance improvement. Our results
showcase the superior performance of MIND indicating its potential for
addressing the challenges posed by Class-incremental and Domain-Incremental

<title>Invariant Random Forest: Tree-Based Model Solution for OOD Generalization. (arXiv:2312.04273v2 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04273</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) generalization is an essential topic in machine
learning. However, recent research is only focusing on the corresponding
methods for neural networks. This paper introduces a novel and effective
solution for OOD generalization of decision tree models, named Invariant
Decision Tree (IDT). IDT enforces a penalty term with regard to the
unstable/varying behavior of a split across different environments during the
growth of the tree. Its ensemble version, the Invariant Random Forest (IRF), is
constructed. Our proposed method is motivated by a theoretical result under
mild conditions, and validated by numerical tests with both synthetic and real
datasets. The superior performance compared to non-OOD tree models implies that
considering OOD generalization for tree models is absolutely necessary and
should be given more attention.

<title>Transformer as Linear Expansion of Learngene. (arXiv:2312.05614v2 [cs.AI] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05614</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;We propose expanding the shared Transformer module to produce and initialize
Transformers of varying depths, enabling adaptation to diverse resource
constraints. Drawing an analogy to genetic expansibility, we term such module
as learngene. To identify the expansion mechanism, we delve into the
relationship between the layer&apos;s position and its corresponding weight value,
and find that linear function appropriately approximates this relationship.
Building on this insight, we present Transformer as Linear Expansion of
learnGene (TLEG), a novel approach for flexibly producing and initializing
Transformers of diverse depths. Specifically, to learn learngene, we firstly
construct an auxiliary Transformer linearly expanded from learngene, after
which we train it through employing soft distillation. Subsequently, we can
produce and initialize Transformers of varying depths via linearly expanding
the well-trained learngene, thereby supporting diverse downstream scenarios.
Extensive experiments on ImageNet-1K demonstrate that TLEG achieves comparable
or better performance in contrast to many individual models trained from
scratch, while reducing around 2x training cost. When transferring to several
downstream classification datasets, TLEG surpasses existing initialization
methods by a large margin (e.g., +6.87% on iNat 2019 and +7.66% on CIFAR-100).
Under the situation where we need to produce models of varying depths adapting
for different resource constraints, TLEG achieves comparable results while
reducing around 19x parameters stored to initialize these models and around 5x
pre-training costs, in contrast to the pre-training and fine-tuning approach.
When transferring a fixed set of parameters to initialize different models,
TLEG presents better flexibility and competitive performance while reducing
around 2.9x parameters stored to initialize, compared to the pre-training
approach.

<title>AUGCAL: Improving Sim2Real Adaptation by Uncertainty Calibration on Augmented Synthetic Images. (arXiv:2312.06106v2 [cs.CV] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06106</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Synthetic data (SIM) drawn from simulators have emerged as a popular
alternative for training models where acquiring annotated real-world images is
difficult. However, transferring models trained on synthetic images to
real-world applications can be challenging due to appearance disparities. A
commonly employed solution to counter this SIM2REAL gap is unsupervised domain
adaptation, where models are trained using labeled SIM data and unlabeled REAL
data. Mispredictions made by such SIM2REAL adapted models are often associated
with miscalibration - stemming from overconfident predictions on real data. In
this paper, we introduce AUGCAL, a simple training-time patch for unsupervised
adaptation that improves SIM2REAL adapted models by - (1) reducing overall
miscalibration, (2) reducing overconfidence in incorrect predictions and (3)
improving confidence score reliability by better guiding misclassification
detection - all while retaining or improving SIM2REAL performance. Given a base
SIM2REAL adaptation algorithm, at training time, AUGCAL involves replacing
vanilla SIM images with strongly augmented views (AUG intervention) and
additionally optimizing for a training time calibration loss on augmented SIM
predictions (CAL intervention). We motivate AUGCAL using a brief analytical
justification of how to reduce miscalibration on unlabeled REAL data. Through
our experiments, we empirically show the efficacy of AUGCAL across multiple
adaptation methods, backbones, tasks and shifts.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;While Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning (GCRL) has gained attention,
its algorithmic robustness against adversarial perturbations remains
unexplored. The attacks and robust representation training methods that are
designed for traditional RL become less effective when applied to GCRL. To
address this challenge, we first propose the Semi-Contrastive Representation
attack, a novel approach inspired by the adversarial contrastive attack. Unlike
existing attacks in RL, it only necessitates information from the policy
function and can be seamlessly implemented during deployment. Then, to mitigate
the vulnerability of existing GCRL algorithms, we introduce Adversarial
Representation Tactics, which combines Semi-Contrastive Adversarial
Augmentation with Sensitivity-Aware Regularizer to improve the adversarial
robustness of the underlying RL agent against various types of perturbations.
Extensive experiments validate the superior performance of our attack and

<title>Double Machine Learning for Static Panel Models with Fixed Effects. (arXiv:2312.08174v2 [econ.EM] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08174</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are powerful data-driven tools for
approximating highdimensional or non-linear nuisance functions which are useful
in practice because the true functional form of the predictors is ex-ante
unknown. In this paper, we develop estimators of policy interventions from
panel data which allow for non-linear effects of the confounding regressors,
and investigate the performance of these estimators using three well-known ML
algorithms, specifically, LASSO, classification and regression trees, and
random forests. We use Double Machine Learning (DML) (Chernozhukov et al.,
2018) for the estimation of causal effects of homogeneous treatments with
unobserved individual heterogeneity (fixed effects) and no unobserved
confounding by extending Robinson (1988)&apos;s partially linear regression model.
We develop three alternative approaches for handling unobserved individual
heterogeneity based on extending the within-group estimator, first-difference
estimator, and correlated random effect estimator (Mundlak, 1978) for
non-linear models. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we find that conventional
least squares estimators can perform well even if the data generating process
is nonlinear, but there are substantial performance gains in terms of bias
reduction under a process where the true effect of the regressors is non-linear
and discontinuous. However, for the same scenarios, we also find - despite
extensive hyperparameter tuning - inference to be problematic for both
tree-based learners because these lead to highly non-normal estimator
distributions and the estimator variance being severely under-estimated. This
contradicts the performance of trees in other circumstances and requires
further investigation. Finally, we provide an illustrative example of DML for
observational panel data showing the impact of the introduction of the national
minimum wage in the UK.

<title>Hybrid Sample Synthesis-based Debiasing of Classifier in Limited Data Setting. (arXiv:2312.08288v2 [cs.CV] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08288</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Deep learning models are known to suffer from the problem of bias, and
researchers have been exploring methods to address this issue. However, most of
these methods require prior knowledge of the bias and are not always practical.
In this paper, we focus on a more practical setting with no prior information
about the bias. Generally, in this setting, there are a large number of
bias-aligned samples that cause the model to produce biased predictions and a
few bias-conflicting samples that do not conform to the bias. If the training
data is limited, the influence of the bias-aligned samples may become even
stronger on the model predictions, and we experimentally demonstrate that
existing debiasing techniques suffer severely in such cases. In this paper, we
examine the effects of unknown bias in small dataset regimes and present a
novel approach to mitigate this issue. The proposed approach directly addresses
the issue of the extremely low occurrence of bias-conflicting samples in
limited data settings through the synthesis of hybrid samples that can be used
to reduce the effect of bias. We perform extensive experiments on several
benchmark datasets and experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of our
proposed approach in addressing any unknown bias in the presence of limited
data. Specifically, our approach outperforms the vanilla, LfF, LDD, and DebiAN
debiasing methods by absolute margins of 10.39%, 9.08%, 8.07%, and 9.67% when
only 10% of the Corrupted CIFAR-10 Type 1 dataset is available with a
bias-conflicting sample ratio of 0.05.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;In this paper, we study random neural networks which are single-hidden-layer
feedforward neural networks whose weights and biases are randomly initialized.
After this random initialization, only the linear readout needs to be trained,
which can be performed efficiently, e.g., by the least squares method. By
viewing random neural networks as Banach space-valued random variables, we
prove a universal approximation theorem within a large class of Bochner spaces.
Hereby, the corresponding Banach space can be significantly more general than
the space of continuous functions over a compact subset of a Euclidean space,
namely, e.g., an $L^p$-space or a Sobolev space, where the latter includes the
approximation of the derivatives. Moreover, we derive approximation rates and
an explicit algorithm to learn a deterministic function by a random neural
network. In addition, we provide a full error analysis and study when random
neural networks overcome the curse of dimensionality in the sense that the
training costs scale at most polynomially in the input and output dimension.
Furthermore, we show in two numerical examples the empirical advantages of
random neural networks compared to fully trained deterministic neural networks.

<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09787</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;The development of biophysical models for clinical applications is rapidly
advancing in the research community, thanks to their predictive nature and
their ability to assist the interpretation of clinical data. However,
high-resolution and accurate multi-physics computational models are
computationally expensive and their personalisation involves fine calibration
of a large number of parameters, which may be space-dependent, challenging
their clinical translation. In this work, we propose a new approach which
relies on the combination of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) with
three-dimensional soft tissue nonlinear biomechanical models, capable of
reconstructing displacement fields and estimating heterogeneous
patient-specific biophysical properties. The proposed learning algorithm
encodes information from a limited amount of displacement and, in some cases,
strain data, that can be routinely acquired in the clinical setting, and
combines it with the physics of the problem, represented by a mathematical
model based on partial differential equations, to regularise the problem and
improve its convergence properties. Several benchmarks are presented to show
the accuracy and robustness of the proposed method and its great potential to
enable the robust and effective identification of patient-specific,
heterogeneous physical properties, s.a. tissue stiffness properties. In
particular, we demonstrate the capability of the PINN to detect the presence,
location and severity of scar tissue, which is beneficial to develop
personalised simulation models for disease diagnosis, especially for cardiac
applications.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Ensuring fairness in Recommendation Systems (RSs) across demographic groups
is critical due to the increased integration of RSs in applications such as
personalized healthcare, finance, and e-commerce. Graph-based RSs play a
crucial role in capturing intricate higher-order interactions among entities.
However, integrating these graph models into the Federated Learning (FL)
paradigm with fairness constraints poses formidable challenges as this requires
access to the entire interaction graph and sensitive user information (such as
gender, age, etc.) at the central server. This paper addresses the pervasive
issue of inherent bias within RSs for different demographic groups without
compromising the privacy of sensitive user attributes in FL environment with
the graph-based model. To address the group bias, we propose F2PGNN (Fair
Federated Personalized Graph Neural Network), a novel framework that leverages
the power of Personalized Graph Neural Network (GNN) coupled with fairness
considerations. Additionally, we use differential privacy techniques to fortify
privacy protection. Experimental evaluation on three publicly available
datasets showcases the efficacy of F2PGNN in mitigating group unfairness by 47%
- 99% compared to the state-of-the-art while preserving privacy and maintaining
the utility. The results validate the significance of our framework in
achieving equitable and personalized recommendations using GNN within the FL

<title>NN-Steiner: A Mixed Neural-algorithmic Approach for the Rectilinear Steiner Minimum Tree Problem. (arXiv:2312.10589v2 [cs.AI] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10589</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Recent years have witnessed rapid advances in the use of neural networks to
solve combinatorial optimization problems. Nevertheless, designing the &quot;right&quot;
neural model that can effectively handle a given optimization problem can be
challenging, and often there is no theoretical understanding or justification
of the resulting neural model. In this paper, we focus on the rectilinear
Steiner minimum tree (RSMT) problem, which is of critical importance in IC
layout design and as a result has attracted numerous heuristic approaches in
the VLSI literature. Our contributions are two-fold. On the methodology front,
we propose NN-Steiner, which is a novel mixed neural-algorithmic framework for
computing RSMTs that leverages the celebrated PTAS algorithmic framework of
Arora to solve this problem (and other geometric optimization problems). Our
NN-Steiner replaces key algorithmic components within Arora&apos;s PTAS by suitable
neural components. In particular, NN-Steiner only needs four neural network
(NN) components that are called repeatedly within an algorithmic framework.
Crucially, each of the four NN components is only of bounded size independent
of input size, and thus easy to train. Furthermore, as the NN component is
learning a generic algorithmic step, once learned, the resulting mixed
neural-algorithmic framework generalizes to much larger instances not seen in
training. Our NN-Steiner, to our best knowledge, is the first neural
architecture of bounded size that has capacity to approximately solve RSMT (and
variants). On the empirical front, we show how NN-Steiner can be implemented
and demonstrate the effectiveness of our resulting approach, especially in
terms of generalization, by comparing with state-of-the-art methods (both
neural and non-neural based).

<title>Agglomerative Federated Learning: Empowering Larger Model Training via End-Edge-Cloud Collaboration. (arXiv:2312.11489v2 [cs.DC] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11489</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Federated Learning (FL) enables training Artificial Intelligence (AI) models
over end devices without compromising their privacy. As computing tasks are
increasingly performed by a combination of cloud, edge, and end devices, FL can
benefit from this End-Edge-Cloud Collaboration (EECC) paradigm to achieve
collaborative device-scale expansion with real-time access. Although
Hierarchical Federated Learning (HFL) supports multi-tier model aggregation
suitable for EECC, prior works assume the same model structure on all computing
nodes, constraining the model scale by the weakest end devices. To address this
issue, we propose Agglomerative Federated Learning (FedAgg), which is a novel
EECC-empowered FL framework that allows the trained models from end, edge, to
cloud to grow larger in size and stronger in generalization ability. FedAgg
recursively organizes computing nodes among all tiers based on Bridge Sample
Based Online Distillation Protocol (BSBODP), which enables every pair of
parent-child computing nodes to mutually transfer and distill knowledge
extracted from generated bridge samples. This design enhances the performance
by exploiting the potential of larger models, with privacy constraints of FL
and flexibility requirements of EECC both satisfied. Experiments under various
settings demonstrate that FedAgg outperforms state-of-the-art methods by an
average of 4.53\% accuracy gains and remarkable improvements in convergence
rate.

<title>Unlocking Musculoskeletal Disorder Risk Factors: NLP-Based Classification and Mode-Based Ranking. (arXiv:2312.11517v2 [cs.CL] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11517</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;This research delves into the intricate landscape of Musculoskeletal Disorder
(MSD) risk factors, employing a novel fusion of Natural Language Processing
(NLP) techniques and mode-based ranking methodologies. The primary objective is
to advance the comprehension of MSD risk factors, their classification, and
their relative severity, facilitating more targeted preventive and management
interventions. The study utilizes eight diverse models, integrating pre-trained
transformers, cosine similarity, and various distance metrics to classify risk
factors into personal, biomechanical, workplace, psychological, and
organizational classes. Key findings reveal that the BERT model with cosine
similarity attains an overall accuracy of 28%, while the sentence transformer,
coupled with Euclidean, Bray-Curtis, and Minkowski distances, achieves a
flawless accuracy score of 100%. In tandem with the classification efforts, the
research employs a mode-based ranking approach on survey data to discern the
severity hierarchy of MSD risk factors. Intriguingly, the rankings align
precisely with the previous literature, reaffirming the consistency and
reliability of the approach. ``Working posture&quot; emerges as the most severe risk
factor, emphasizing the critical role of proper posture in preventing MSDs. The
collective perceptions of survey participants underscore the significance of
factors like &quot;Job insecurity,&quot; &quot;Effort reward imbalance,&quot; and &quot;Poor employee
facility&quot; in contributing to MSD risks. The convergence of rankings provides
actionable insights for organizations aiming to reduce the prevalence of MSDs.
The study concludes with implications for targeted interventions,
recommendations for improving workplace conditions, and avenues for future
research.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;We study the task of $(\epsilon, \delta)$-differentially private online
convex optimization (OCO). In the online setting, the release of each distinct

best known results for the regime of {\epsilon} not being very small are
presented in Agarwal et al. [2023]. In this paper we improve upon the results
of Agarwal et al. [2023] in terms of the dimension factors as well as removing
the requirement of smoothness. Our results are now the best known rates for
DP-OCO in this regime.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our algorithms builds upon the work of [Asi et al., 2023] which introduced
the idea of explicitly limiting the number of switches via rejection sampling.
The main innovation in our algorithm is the use of sampling from a strongly
log-concave density which allows us to trade-off the dimension factors better
leading to improved results.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Formal abductive explanations offer crucial guarantees of rigor and so are of
interest in high-stakes uses of machine learning (ML). One drawback of
abductive explanations is explanation size, justified by the cognitive limits

algorithms for the computation of locally-minimal PXAps, which offer
high-quality approximations of PXAps in practice. The experimental results

<title>OVD-Explorer: Optimism Should Not Be the Sole Pursuit of Exploration in Noisy Environments. (arXiv:2312.12145v2 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12145</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;In reinforcement learning, the optimism in the face of uncertainty (OFU) is a
mainstream principle for directing exploration towards less explored areas,
characterized by higher uncertainty. However, in the presence of environmental
stochasticity (noise), purely optimistic exploration may lead to excessive
probing of high-noise areas, consequently impeding exploration efficiency.
Hence, in exploring noisy environments, while optimism-driven exploration
serves as a foundation, prudent attention to alleviating unnecessary
over-exploration in high-noise areas becomes beneficial. In this work, we
propose Optimistic Value Distribution Explorer (OVD-Explorer) to achieve a
noise-aware optimistic exploration for continuous control. OVD-Explorer
proposes a new measurement of the policy&apos;s exploration ability considering
noise in optimistic perspectives, and leverages gradient ascent to drive
exploration. Practically, OVD-Explorer can be easily integrated with continuous
control RL algorithms. Extensive evaluations on the MuJoCo and GridChaos tasks
demonstrate the superiority of OVD-Explorer in achieving noise-aware optimistic
exploration.

<title>Poincar\&apos;e Differential Privacy for Hierarchy-Aware Graph Embedding. (arXiv:2312.12183v2 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12183</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Hierarchy is an important and commonly observed topological property in
real-world graphs that indicate the relationships between supervisors and
subordinates or the organizational behavior of human groups. As hierarchy is
introduced as a new inductive bias into the Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in
various tasks, it implies latent topological relations for attackers to improve
their inference attack performance, leading to serious privacy leakage issues.
In addition, existing privacy-preserving frameworks suffer from reduced
protection ability in hierarchical propagation due to the deficiency of
adaptive upper-bound estimation of the hierarchical perturbation boundary. It
is of great urgency to effectively leverage the hierarchical property of data
while satisfying privacy guarantees. To solve the problem, we propose the
Poincar\&apos;e Differential Privacy framework, named PoinDP, to protect the
hierarchy-aware graph embedding based on hyperbolic geometry. Specifically,
PoinDP first learns the hierarchy weights for each entity based on the
Poincar\&apos;e model in hyperbolic space. Then, the Personalized Hierarchy-aware
Sensitivity is designed to measure the sensitivity of the hierarchical
structure and adaptively allocate the privacy protection strength. Besides, the
Hyperbolic Gaussian Mechanism (HGM) is proposed to extend the Gaussian
mechanism in Euclidean space to hyperbolic space to realize random
perturbations that satisfy differential privacy under the hyperbolic space
metric. Extensive experiment results on five real-world datasets demonstrate
the proposed PoinDP&apos;s advantages of effective privacy protection while
maintaining good performance on the node classification task.

<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1012.5754</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Software cost estimation is one of the prerequisite managerial activities
carried out at the software development initiation stages and also repeated
throughout the whole software life-cycle so that amendments to the total cost
are made. In software cost estimation typically, a selection of project
attributes is employed to produce effort estimations of the expected human
resources to deliver a software product. However, choosing the appropriate
project cost drivers in each case requires a lot of experience and knowledge on
behalf of the project manager which can only be obtained through years of
software engineering practice. A number of studies indicate that popular
methods applied in the literature for software cost estimation, such as linear
regression, are not robust enough and do not yield accurate predictions.
Recently the dual variables Ridge Regression (RR) technique has been used for
effort estimation yielding promising results. In this work we show that results
may be further improved if an AI method is used to automatically select
appropriate project cost drivers (inputs) for the technique. We propose a
hybrid approach combining RR with a Genetic Algorithm, the latter evolving the
subset of attributes for approximating effort more accurately. The proposed
hybrid cost model has been applied on a widely known high-dimensional dataset
of software project samples and the results obtained show that accuracy may be
increased if redundant attributes are eliminated.

<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1210.1161</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Feature selection has been recently used in the area of software engineering
for improving the accuracy and robustness of software cost models. The idea
behind selecting the most informative subset of features from a pool of
available cost drivers stems from the hypothesis that reducing the
dimensionality of datasets will significantly minimise the complexity and time
required to reach to an estimation using a particular modelling technique. This
work investigates the appropriateness of attributes, obtained from empirical
project databases and aims to reduce the cost drivers used while preserving
performance. Finding suitable subset selections that may cater improved
predictions may be considered as a pre-processing step of a particular
technique employed for cost estimation (filter or wrapper) or an internal
(embedded) step to minimise the fitting error. This paper compares nine
relatively popular feature selection methods and uses the empirical values of
selected attributes recorded in the ISBSG and Desharnais datasets to estimate
software development effort.
