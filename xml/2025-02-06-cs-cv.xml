      <title>FruitPAL: An IoT-Enabled Framework for Automatic Monitoring of Fruit Consumption in Smart Healthcare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fruits are rich sources of essential vitamins and nutrients that are vital for human health. This study introduces two fully automated devices, FruitPAL and its updated version, FruitPAL 2.0, which aim to promote safe fruit consumption while reducing health risks. Both devices leverage a high-quality dataset of fifteen fruit types and use advanced models- YOLOv8 and YOLOv5 V6.0- to enhance detection accuracy. The original FruitPAL device can identify various fruit types and notify caregivers if an allergic reaction is detected, thanks to YOLOv8's improved accuracy and rapid response time. Notifications are transmitted via the cloud to mobile devices, ensuring real-time updates and immediate accessibility. FruitPAL 2.0 builds upon this by not only detecting fruit but also estimating its nutritional value, thereby encouraging healthy consumption. Trained on the YOLOv5 V6.0 model, FruitPAL 2.0 analyzes fruit intake to provide users with valuable dietary insights. This study aims to promote fruit consumption by helping individuals make informed choices, balancing health benefits with allergy awareness. By alerting users to potential allergens while encouraging the consumption of nutrient-rich fruits, these devices support both health maintenance and dietary awareness.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Stable Diffusion for Monocular Depth Estimation via Image Semantic Encoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monocular depth estimation involves predicting depth from a single RGB image and plays a crucial role in applications such as autonomous driving, robotic navigation, 3D reconstruction, etc. Recent advancements in learning-based methods have significantly improved depth estimation performance. Generative models, particularly Stable Diffusion, have shown remarkable potential in recovering fine details and reconstructing missing regions through large-scale training on diverse datasets. However, models like CLIP, which rely on textual embeddings, face limitations in complex outdoor environments where rich context information is needed. These limitations reduce their effectiveness in such challenging scenarios. Here, we propose a novel image-based semantic embedding that extracts contextual information directly from visual features, significantly improving depth prediction in complex environments. Evaluated on the KITTI and Waymo datasets, our method achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art models while addressing the shortcomings of CLIP embeddings in handling outdoor scenes. By leveraging visual semantics directly, our method demonstrates enhanced robustness and adaptability in depth estimation tasks, showcasing its potential for application to other visual perception tasks.</description>

      <title>Semantic Communication based on Generative AI: A New Approach to Image Compression and Edge Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As digital technologies advance, communication networks face challenges in handling the vast data generated by intelligent devices. Autonomous vehicles, smart sensors, and IoT systems necessitate new paradigms. This thesis addresses these challenges by integrating semantic communication and generative models for optimized image compression and edge network resource allocation. Unlike bit-centric systems, semantic communication prioritizes transmitting meaningful data specifically selected to convey the meaning rather than obtain a faithful representation of the original data. The communication infrastructure can benefit to significant improvements in bandwidth efficiency and latency reduction. Central to this work is the design of semantic-preserving image compression using Generative Adversarial Networks and Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models. These models compress images by encoding only semantically relevant features, allowing for high-quality reconstruction with minimal transmission. Additionally, a Goal-Oriented edge network optimization framework is introduced, leveraging the Information Bottleneck principle and stochastic optimization to dynamically allocate resources and enhance efficiency. By integrating semantic communication into edge networks, this approach balances computational efficiency and communication effectiveness, making it suitable for real-time applications. The thesis compares semantic-aware models with conventional image compression techniques using classical and semantic evaluation metrics. Results demonstrate the potential of combining generative AI and semantic communication to create more efficient semantic-goal-oriented communication networks that meet the demands of modern data-driven applications.</description>

      <title>HuViDPO:Enhancing Video Generation through Direct Preference Optimization for Human-Centric Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid development of AIGC technology, significant progress has been made in diffusion model-based technologies for text-to-image (T2I) and text-to-video (T2V). In recent years, a few studies have introduced the strategy of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) into T2I tasks, significantly enhancing human preferences in generated images. However, existing T2V generation methods lack a well-formed pipeline with exact loss function to guide the alignment of generated videos with human preferences using DPO strategies. Additionally, challenges such as the scarcity of paired video preference data hinder effective model training. At the same time, the lack of training datasets poses a risk of insufficient flexibility and poor video generation quality in the generated videos. Based on those problems, our work proposes three targeted solutions in sequence. 1) Our work is the first to introduce the DPO strategy into the T2V tasks. By deriving a carefully structured loss function, we utilize human feedback to align video generation with human preferences. We refer to this new method as HuViDPO. 2) Our work constructs small-scale human preference datasets for each action category and fine-tune this model, improving the aesthetic quality of the generated videos while reducing training costs. 3) We adopt a First-Frame-Conditioned strategy, leveraging the rich in formation from the first frame to guide the generation of subsequent frames, enhancing flexibility in video generation. At the same time, we employ a SparseCausal Attention mechanism to enhance the quality of the generated videos.More details and examples can be accessed on our website: https://tankowa.github.io/HuViDPO. github.io/.</description>

      <title>CLIP-DQA: Blindly Evaluating Dehazed Images from Global and Local Perspectives Using CLIP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blind dehazed image quality assessment (BDQA), which aims to accurately predict the visual quality of dehazed images without any reference information, is essential for the evaluation, comparison, and optimization of image dehazing algorithms. Existing learning-based BDQA methods have achieved remarkable success, while the small scale of DQA datasets limits their performance. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose to adapt Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP), pre-trained on large-scale image-text pairs, to the BDQA task. Specifically, inspired by the fact that the human visual system understands images based on hierarchical features, we take global and local information of the dehazed image as the input of CLIP. To accurately map the input hierarchical information of dehazed images into the quality score, we tune both the vision branch and language branch of CLIP with prompt learning. Experimental results on two authentic DQA datasets demonstrate that our proposed approach, named CLIP-DQA, achieves more accurate quality predictions over existing BDQA methods.

      <title>A Multi-Scale Feature Fusion Framework Integrating Frequency Domain and Cross-View Attention for Dual-View X-ray Security Inspections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid development of modern transportation systems and the exponential growth of logistics volumes, intelligent X-ray-based security inspection systems play a crucial role in public safety. Although single-view X-ray equipment is widely deployed, it struggles to accurately identify contraband in complex stacking scenarios due to strong viewpoint dependency and inadequate feature representation. To address this, we propose an innovative multi-scale interactive feature fusion framework tailored for dual-view X-ray security inspection image classification. The framework comprises three core modules: the Frequency Domain Interaction Module (FDIM) enhances frequency-domain features through Fourier transform; the Multi-Scale Cross-View Feature Enhancement (MSCFE) leverages cross-view attention mechanisms to strengthen feature interactions; and the Convolutional Attention Fusion Module (CAFM) efficiently fuses features by integrating channel attention with depthwise-separable convolutions. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches across multiple backbone architectures, particularly excelling in complex scenarios with occlusions and object stacking.</description>

      <title>MJ-VIDEO: Fine-Grained Benchmarking and Rewarding Video Preferences in Video Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in video generation have significantly improved the ability to synthesize videos from text instructions. However, existing models still struggle with key challenges such as instruction misalignment, content hallucination, safety concerns, and bias. Addressing these limitations, we introduce MJ-BENCH-VIDEO, a large-scale video preference benchmark designed to evaluate video generation across five critical aspects: Alignment, Safety, Fineness, Coherence &amp; Consistency, and Bias &amp; Fairness. This benchmark incorporates 28 fine-grained criteria to provide a comprehensive evaluation of video preference. Building upon this dataset, we propose MJ-VIDEO, a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based video reward model designed to deliver fine-grained reward. MJ-VIDEO can dynamically select relevant experts to accurately judge the preference based on the input text-video pair. This architecture enables more precise and adaptable preference judgments. Through extensive benchmarking on MJ-BENCH-VIDEO, we analyze the limitations of existing video reward models and demonstrate the superior performance of MJ-VIDEO in video preference assessment, achieving 17.58% and 15.87% improvements in overall and fine-grained preference judgments, respectively. Additionally, introducing MJ-VIDEO for preference tuning in video generation enhances the alignment performance.</description>

      <title>Generating Multi-Image Synthetic Data for Text-to-Image Customization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Customization of text-to-image models enables users to insert custom concepts and generate the concepts in unseen settings. Existing methods either rely on costly test-time optimization or train encoders on single-image training datasets without multi-image supervision, leading to worse image quality. We propose a simple approach that addresses both limitations. We first leverage existing text-to-image models and 3D datasets to create a high-quality Synthetic Customization Dataset (SynCD) consisting of multiple images of the same object in different lighting, backgrounds, and poses. We then propose a new encoder architecture based on shared attention mechanisms that better incorporate fine-grained visual details from input images. Finally, we propose a new inference technique that mitigates overexposure issues during inference by normalizing the text and image guidance vectors. Through extensive experiments, we show that our model, trained on the synthetic dataset with the proposed encoder and inference algorithm, outperforms existing tuning-free methods on standard customization benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Sparse VideoGen: Accelerating Video Diffusion Transformers with Spatial-Temporal Sparsity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) dominate video generation but their high computational cost severely limits real-world applicability, usually requiring tens of minutes to generate a few seconds of video even on high-performance GPUs. This inefficiency primarily arises from the quadratic computational complexity of 3D Full Attention with respect to the context length. In this paper, we propose a training-free framework termed Sparse VideoGen (SVG) that leverages the inherent sparsity in 3D Full Attention to boost inference efficiency. We reveal that the attention heads can be dynamically classified into two groups depending on distinct sparse patterns: (1) Spatial Head, where only spatially-related tokens within each frame dominate the attention output, and (2) Temporal Head, where only temporally-related tokens across different frames dominate. Based on this insight, SVG proposes an online profiling strategy to capture the dynamic sparse patterns and predicts the type of attention head. Combined with a novel hardware-efficient tensor layout transformation and customized kernel implementations, SVG achieves up to 2.28x and 2.33x end-to-end speedup on CogVideoX-v1.5 and HunyuanVideo, respectively, while preserving generation quality.</description>

      <title>AquaticCLIP: A Vision-Language Foundation Model for Underwater Scene Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The preservation of aquatic biodiversity is critical in mitigating the effects of climate change. Aquatic scene understanding plays a pivotal role in aiding marine scientists in their decision-making processes. In this paper, we introduce AquaticCLIP, a novel contrastive language-image pre-training model tailored for aquatic scene understanding. AquaticCLIP presents a new unsupervised learning framework that aligns images and texts in aquatic environments, enabling tasks such as segmentation, classification, detection, and object counting. By leveraging our large-scale underwater image-text paired dataset without the need for ground-truth annotations, our model enriches existing vision-language models in the aquatic domain. For this purpose, we construct a 2 million underwater image-text paired dataset using heterogeneous resources, including YouTube, Netflix, NatGeo, etc. To fine-tune AquaticCLIP, we propose a prompt-guided vision encoder that progressively aggregates patch features via learnable prompts, while a vision-guided mechanism enhances the language encoder by incorporating visual context. The model is optimized through a contrastive pretraining loss to align visual and textual modalities. AquaticCLIP achieves notable performance improvements in zero-shot settings across multiple underwater computer vision tasks, outperforming existing methods in both robustness and interpretability. Our model sets a new benchmark for vision-language applications in underwater environments. The code and dataset for AquaticCLIP are publicly available on GitHub at xxx.</description>

      <title>PolyhedronNet: Representation Learning for Polyhedra with Surface-attributed Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ubiquitous geometric objects can be precisely and efficiently represented as polyhedra. The transformation of a polyhedron into a vector, known as polyhedra representation learning, is crucial for manipulating these shapes with mathematical and statistical tools for tasks like classification, clustering, and generation. Recent years have witnessed significant strides in this domain, yet most efforts focus on the vertex sequence of a polyhedron, neglecting the complex surface modeling crucial in real-world polyhedral objects. This study proposes \textbf{PolyhedronNet}, a general framework tailored for learning representations of 3D polyhedral objects. We propose the concept of the surface-attributed graph to seamlessly model the vertices, edges, faces, and their geometric interrelationships within a polyhedron. To effectively learn the representation of the entire surface-attributed graph, we first propose to break it down into local rigid representations to effectively learn each local region's relative positions against the remaining regions without geometric information loss. Subsequently, we propose PolyhedronGNN to hierarchically aggregate the local rigid representation via intra-face and inter-face geometric message passing modules, to obtain a global representation that minimizes information loss while maintaining rotation and translation invariance. Our experimental evaluations on four distinct datasets, encompassing both classification and retrieval tasks, substantiate PolyhedronNet's efficacy in capturing comprehensive and informative representations of 3D polyhedral objects.

      <title>Low Resource Video Super-resolution using Memory and Residual Deformable Convolutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformer-based video super-resolution (VSR) models have set new benchmarks in recent years, but their substantial computational demands make most of them unsuitable for deployment on resource-constrained devices. Achieving a balance between model complexity and output quality remains a formidable challenge in VSR. Although lightweight models have been introduced to address this issue, they often struggle to deliver state-of-the-art performance. We propose a novel lightweight, parameter-efficient deep residual deformable convolution network for VSR. Unlike prior methods, our model enhances feature utilization through residual connections and employs deformable convolution for precise frame alignment, addressing motion dynamics effectively. Furthermore, we introduce a single memory tensor to capture information accrued from the past frames and improve motion estimation across frames. This design enables an efficient balance between computational cost and reconstruction quality. With just 2.3 million parameters, our model achieves state-of-the-art SSIM of 0.9175 on the REDS4 dataset, surpassing existing lightweight and many heavy models in both accuracy and resource efficiency. Architectural insights from our model pave the way for real-time VSR on streaming data.</description>

      <title>Texture Image Synthesis Using Spatial GAN Based on Vision Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Texture synthesis is a fundamental task in computer vision, whose goal is to generate visually realistic and structurally coherent textures for a wide range of applications, from graphics to scientific simulations. While traditional methods like tiling and patch-based techniques often struggle with complex textures, recent advancements in deep learning have transformed this field. In this paper, we propose ViT-SGAN, a new hybrid model that fuses Vision Transformers (ViTs) with a Spatial Generative Adversarial Network (SGAN) to address the limitations of previous methods. By incorporating specialized texture descriptors such as mean-variance (mu, sigma) and textons into the self-attention mechanism of ViTs, our model achieves superior texture synthesis. This approach enhances the model's capacity to capture complex spatial dependencies, leading to improved texture quality that is superior to state-of-the-art models, especially for regular and irregular textures. Comparison experiments with metrics such as FID, IS, SSIM, and LPIPS demonstrate the substantial improvement of ViT-SGAN, which underlines its efficiency in generating diverse realistic textures.</description>

      <title>UVGS: Reimagining Unstructured 3D Gaussian Splatting using UV Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated superior quality in modeling 3D objects and scenes. However, generating 3DGS remains challenging due to their discrete, unstructured, and permutation-invariant nature. In this work, we present a simple yet effective method to overcome these challenges. We utilize spherical mapping to transform 3DGS into a structured 2D representation, termed UVGS. UVGS can be viewed as multi-channel images, with feature dimensions as a concatenation of Gaussian attributes such as position, scale, color, opacity, and rotation. We further find that these heterogeneous features can be compressed into a lower-dimensional (e.g., 3-channel) shared feature space using a carefully designed multi-branch network. The compressed UVGS can be treated as typical RGB images. Remarkably, we discover that typical VAEs trained with latent diffusion models can directly generalize to this new representation without additional training. Our novel representation makes it effortless to leverage foundational 2D models, such as diffusion models, to directly model 3DGS. Additionally, one can simply increase the 2D UV resolution to accommodate more Gaussians, making UVGS a scalable solution compared to typical 3D backbones. This approach immediately unlocks various novel generation applications of 3DGS by inherently utilizing the already developed superior 2D generation capabilities. In our experiments, we demonstrate various unconditional, conditional generation, and inpainting applications of 3DGS based on diffusion models, which were previously non-trivial.</description>

      <title>Foundation Model-Based Apple Ripeness and Size Estimation for Selective Harvesting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Harvesting is a critical task in the tree fruit industry, demanding extensive manual labor and substantial costs, and exposing workers to potential hazards. Recent advances in automated harvesting offer a promising solution by enabling efficient, cost-effective, and ergonomic fruit picking within tight harvesting windows. However, existing harvesting technologies often indiscriminately harvest all visible and accessible fruits, including those that are unripe or undersized. This study introduces a novel foundation model-based framework for efficient apple ripeness and size estimation. Specifically, we curated two public RGBD-based Fuji apple image datasets, integrating expanded annotations for ripeness ("Ripe" vs. "Unripe") based on fruit color and image capture dates. The resulting comprehensive dataset, Fuji-Ripeness-Size Dataset, includes 4,027 images and 16,257 annotated apples with ripeness and size labels. Using Grounding-DINO, a language-model-based object detector, we achieved robust apple detection and ripeness classification, outperforming other state-of-the-art models. Additionally, we developed and evaluated six size estimation algorithms, selecting the one with the lowest error and variation for optimal performance. The Fuji-Ripeness-Size Dataset and the apple detection and size estimation algorithms are made publicly available, which provides valuable benchmarks for future studies in automated and selective harvesting.</description>

      <title>Learning Fine-to-Coarse Cuboid Shape Abstraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The abstraction of 3D objects with simple geometric primitives like cuboids allows to infer structural information from complex geometry. It is important for 3D shape understanding, structural analysis and geometric modeling. We introduce a novel fine-to-coarse unsupervised learning approach to abstract collections of 3D shapes. Our architectural design allows us to reduce the number of primitives from hundreds (fine reconstruction) to only a few (coarse abstraction) during training. This allows our network to optimize the reconstruction error and adhere to a user-specified number of primitives per shape while simultaneously learning a consistent structure across the whole collection of data. We achieve this through our abstraction loss formulation which increasingly penalizes redundant primitives. Furthermore, we introduce a reconstruction loss formulation to account not only for surface approximation but also volume preservation. Combining both contributions allows us to represent 3D shapes more precisely with fewer cuboid primitives than previous work. We evaluate our method on collections of man-made and humanoid shapes comparing with previous state-of-the-art learning methods on commonly used benchmarks. Our results confirm an improvement over previous cuboid-based shape abstraction techniques. Furthermore, we demonstrate our cuboid abstraction in downstream tasks like clustering, retrieval, and partial symmetry detection.</description>

      <title>Reliability-Driven LiDAR-Camera Fusion for Robust 3D Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate and robust 3D object detection is essential for autonomous driving, where fusing data from sensors like LiDAR and camera enhances detection accuracy. However, sensor malfunctions such as corruption or disconnection can degrade performance, and existing fusion models often struggle to maintain reliability when one modality fails. To address this, we propose ReliFusion, a novel LiDAR-camera fusion framework operating in the bird's-eye view (BEV) space. ReliFusion integrates three key components: the Spatio-Temporal Feature Aggregation (STFA) module, which captures dependencies across frames to stabilize predictions over time; the Reliability module, which assigns confidence scores to quantify the dependability of each modality under challenging conditions; and the Confidence-Weighted Mutual Cross-Attention (CW-MCA) module, which dynamically balances information from LiDAR and camera modalities based on these confidence scores. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset show that ReliFusion significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior robustness and accuracy in scenarios with limited LiDAR fields of view and severe sensor malfunctions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previous work in aesthetic categorization and explainability utilizes manual labeling and classification to explain aesthetic scores. These methods require a complex labeling process and are limited in size. Our proposed approach attempts to explain aesthetic assessment models through visualizing dataset trends and automatic categorization of visual aesthetic features through training neural networks on different versions of the same dataset. By evaluating the models adapted to each specific modality using existing and novel metrics, we can capture and visualize aesthetic features and trends.</description>

      <title>Geometric Framework for 3D Cell Segmentation Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D cellular image segmentation methods are commonly divided into non-2D-based and 2D-based approaches, the latter reconstructing 3D shapes from the segmentation results of 2D layers. However, errors in 2D results often propagate, leading to oversegmentations in the final 3D results. To tackle this issue, we introduce an interpretable geometric framework that addresses the oversegmentations by correcting the 2D segmentation results based on geometric information from adjacent layers. Leveraging both geometric (layer-to-layer, 2D) and topological (3D shape) features, we use binary classification to determine whether neighboring cells should be stitched. We develop a pre-trained classifier on public plant cell datasets and validate its performance on animal cell datasets, confirming its effectiveness in correcting oversegmentations under the transfer learning setting. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our framework can be extended to correcting oversegmentation on non-2D-based methods. A clear pipeline is provided for end-users to build the pre-trained model to any labeled dataset.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bird's-eye view (BEV) perception for autonomous driving has garnered significant attention in recent years, in part because BEV representation facilitates the fusion of multi-sensor data. This enables a variety of perception tasks including BEV segmentation, a concise view of the environment that can be used to plan a vehicle's trajectory. However, this representation is not fully supported by existing datasets, and creation of new datasets can be a time-consuming endeavor. To address this problem, in this paper we introduce SimBEV, an extensively configurable and scalable randomized synthetic data generation tool that incorporates information from multiple sources to capture accurate BEV ground truth data, supports a comprehensive array of sensors, and enables a variety of perception tasks including BEV segmentation and 3D object detection. We use SimBEV to create the SimBEV dataset, a large collection of annotated perception data from diverse driving scenarios.</description>

      <title>INTACT: Inducing Noise Tolerance through Adversarial Curriculum Training for LiDAR-based Safety-Critical Perception and Autonomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present INTACT, a novel two-phase framework designed to enhance the robustness of deep neural networks (DNNs) against noisy LiDAR data in safety-critical perception tasks. INTACT combines meta-learning with adversarial curriculum training (ACT) to systematically address challenges posed by data corruption and sparsity in 3D point clouds. The meta-learning phase equips a teacher network with task-agnostic priors, enabling it to generate robust saliency maps that identify critical data regions. The ACT phase leverages these saliency maps to progressively expose a student network to increasingly complex noise patterns, ensuring targeted perturbation and improved noise resilience. INTACT's effectiveness is demonstrated through comprehensive evaluations on object detection, tracking, and classification benchmarks using diverse datasets, including KITTI, Argoverse, and ModelNet40. Results indicate that INTACT improves model robustness by up to 20% across all tasks, outperforming standard adversarial and curriculum training methods. This framework not only addresses the limitations of conventional training strategies but also offers a scalable and efficient solution for real-world deployment in resource-constrained safety-critical systems. INTACT's principled integration of meta-learning and adversarial training establishes a new paradigm for noise-tolerant 3D perception in safety-critical applications. INTACT improved KITTI Multiple Object Tracking Accuracy (MOTA) by 9.6% (64.1% -&gt; 75.1%) and by 12.4% under Gaussian noise (52.5% -&gt; 73.7%). Similarly, KITTI mean Average Precision (mAP) rose from 59.8% to 69.8% (50% point drop) and 49.3% to 70.9% (Gaussian noise), highlighting the framework's ability to enhance deep learning model resilience in safety-critical object tracking scenarios.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Homogeneity of Vision and Text Tokens in Large Vision-and-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large vision-and-language models (LVLMs) typically treat visual and textual embeddings as homogeneous inputs to a large language model (LLM). However, these inputs are inherently different: visual inputs are multi-dimensional and contextually rich, often pre-encoded by models like CLIP, while textual inputs lack this structure. In this paper, we propose Decomposed Attention (D-Attn), a novel method that processes visual and textual embeddings differently by decomposing the 1-D causal self-attention in LVLMs. After the attention decomposition, D-Attn diagonalizes visual-to-visual self-attention, reducing computation from $\mathcal{O}(|V|^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(|V|)$ for $|V|$ visual embeddings without compromising performance. Moreover, D-Attn debiases positional encodings in textual-to-visual cross-attention, further enhancing visual understanding. Finally, we introduce an $\alpha$-weighting strategy to merge visual and textual information, maximally preserving the pre-trained LLM's capabilities with minimal modifications. Extensive experiments and rigorous analyses validate the effectiveness of D-Attn, demonstrating significant improvements on multiple image benchmarks while significantly reducing computational costs. Code, data, and models will be publicly available.</description>

      <title>PATCH: a deep learning method to assess heterogeneity of artistic practice in historical paintings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The history of art has seen significant shifts in the manner in which artworks are created, making understanding of creative processes a central question in technical art history. In the Renaissance and Early Modern period, paintings were largely produced by master painters directing workshops of apprentices who often contributed to projects. The masters varied significantly in artistic and managerial styles, meaning different combinations of artists and implements might be seen both between masters and within workshops or even individual canvases. Information on how different workshops were managed and the processes by which artworks were created remains elusive. Machine learning methods have potential to unearth new information about artists' creative processes by extending the analysis of brushwork to a microscopic scale. Analysis of workshop paintings, however, presents a challenge in that documentation of the artists and materials involved is sparse, meaning external examples are not available to train networks to recognize their contributions. Here we present a novel machine learning approach we call pairwise assignment training for classifying heterogeneity (PATCH) that is capable of identifying individual artistic practice regimes with no external training data, or "ground truth." The method achieves unsupervised results by supervised means, and outperforms both simple statistical procedures and unsupervised machine learning methods. We apply this method to two historical paintings by the Spanish Renaissance master, El Greco: The Baptism of Christ and Christ on the Cross with Landscape, and our findings regarding the former potentially challenge previous work that has assigned the painting to workshop members. Further, the results of our analyses create a measure of heterogeneity of artistic practice that can be used to characterize artworks across time and space.</description>

      <title>Toward a Low-Cost Perception System in Autonomous Vehicles: A Spectrum Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a cost-effective new approach for generating denser depth maps for Autonomous Driving (AD) and Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) by integrating the images obtained from deep neural network (DNN) 4D radar detectors with conventional camera RGB images. Our approach introduces a novel pixel positional encoding algorithm inspired by Bartlett's spatial spectrum estimation technique. This algorithm transforms both radar depth maps and RGB images into a unified pixel image subspace called the Spatial Spectrum, facilitating effective learning based on their similarities and differences. Our method effectively leverages high-resolution camera images to train radar depth map generative models, addressing the limitations of conventional radar detectors in complex vehicular environments, thus sharpening the radar output. We develop spectrum estimation algorithms tailored for radar depth maps and RGB images, a comprehensive training framework for data-driven generative models, and a camera-radar deployment scheme for AV operation. Our results demonstrate that our approach also outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) by 27.95% in terms of Unidirectional Chamfer Distance (UCD).</description>

      <title>DAMO: Data- and Model-aware Alignment of Multi-modal LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has shown effectiveness in aligning multi-modal large language models (MLLM) with human preferences. However, existing methods exhibit an imbalanced responsiveness to the data of varying hardness, tending to overfit on the easy-to-distinguish data while underfitting on the hard-to-distinguish data. In this paper, we propose Data- and Model-aware DPO (DAMO) to dynamically adjust the optimization process from two key aspects: (1) a data-aware strategy that incorporates data hardness, and (2) a model-aware strategy that integrates real-time model responses. By combining the two strategies, DAMO enables the model to effectively adapt to data with varying levels of hardness. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks demonstrate that DAMO not only significantly enhances the trustworthiness, but also improves the effectiveness over general tasks. For instance, on the Object HalBench, our DAMO-7B reduces response-level and mentioned-level hallucination by 90.0% and 95.3%, respectively, surpassing the performance of GPT-4V.</description>

      <title>LAYOUTDREAMER: Physics-guided Layout for Text-to-3D Compositional Scene Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the field of text-guided 3D scene generation has garnered significant attention. High-quality generation that aligns with physical realism and high controllability is crucial for practical 3D scene applications. However, existing methods face fundamental limitations: (i) difficulty capturing complex relationships between multiple objects described in the text, (ii) inability to generate physically plausible scene layouts, and (iii) lack of controllability and extensibility in compositional scenes. In this paper, we introduce LayoutDreamer, a framework that leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to facilitate high-quality, physically consistent compositional scene generation guided by text. Specifically, given a text prompt, we convert it into a directed scene graph and adaptively adjust the density and layout of the initial compositional 3D Gaussians. Subsequently, dynamic camera adjustments are made based on the training focal point to ensure entity-level generation quality. Finally, by extracting directed dependencies from the scene graph, we tailor physical and layout energy to ensure both realism and flexibility. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that LayoutDreamer outperforms other compositional scene generation quality and semantic alignment methods. Specifically, it achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in the multiple objects generation metric of T3Bench.</description>

      <title>MATCNN: Infrared and Visible Image Fusion Method Based on Multi-scale CNN with Attention Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While attention-based approaches have shown considerable progress in enhancing image fusion and addressing the challenges posed by long-range feature dependencies, their efficacy in capturing local features is compromised by the lack of diverse receptive field extraction techniques. To overcome the shortcomings of existing fusion methods in extracting multi-scale local features and preserving global features, this paper proposes a novel cross-modal image fusion approach based on a multi-scale convolutional neural network with attention Transformer (MATCNN). MATCNN utilizes the multi-scale fusion module (MSFM) to extract local features at different scales and employs the global feature extraction module (GFEM) to extract global features. Combining the two reduces the loss of detail features and improves the ability of global feature representation. Simultaneously, an information mask is used to label pertinent details within the images, aiming to enhance the proportion of preserving significant information in infrared images and background textures in visible images in fused images. Subsequently, a novel optimization algorithm is developed, leveraging the mask to guide feature extraction through the integration of content, structural similarity index measurement, and global feature loss. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations are conducted across various datasets, revealing that MATCNN effectively highlights infrared salient targets, preserves additional details in visible images, and achieves better fusion results for cross-modal images. The code of MATCNN will be available at https://github.com/zhang3849/MATCNN.git.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Consensus Network for Multiview Feature Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiview feature learning aims to learn discriminative features by integrating the distinct information in each view. However, most existing methods still face significant challenges in learning view-consistency features, which are crucial for effective multiview learning. Motivated by the theories of CCA and contrastive learning in multiview feature learning, we propose the hierarchical consensus network (HCN) in this paper. The HCN derives three consensus indices for capturing the hierarchical consensus across views, which are classifying consensus, coding consensus, and global consensus, respectively. Specifically, classifying consensus reinforces class-level correspondence between views from a CCA perspective, while coding consensus closely resembles contrastive learning and reflects contrastive comparison of individual instances. Global consensus aims to extract consensus information from two perspectives simultaneously. By enforcing the hierarchical consensus, the information within each view is better integrated to obtain more comprehensive and discriminative features. The extensive experimental results obtained on four multiview datasets demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Memory Efficient Transformer Adapter for Dense Predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While current Vision Transformer (ViT) adapter methods have shown promising accuracy, their inference speed is implicitly hindered by inefficient memory access operations, e.g., standard normalization and frequent reshaping. In this work, we propose META, a simple and fast ViT adapter that can improve the model's memory efficiency and decrease memory time consumption by reducing the inefficient memory access operations. Our method features a memory-efficient adapter block that enables the common sharing of layer normalization between the self-attention and feed-forward network layers, thereby reducing the model's reliance on normalization operations. Within the proposed block, the cross-shaped self-attention is employed to reduce the model's frequent reshaping operations. Moreover, we augment the adapter block with a lightweight convolutional branch that can enhance local inductive biases, particularly beneficial for the dense prediction tasks, e.g., object detection, instance segmentation, and semantic segmentation. The adapter block is finally formulated in a cascaded manner to compute diverse head features, thereby enriching the variety of feature representations. Empirically, extensive evaluations on multiple representative datasets validate that META substantially enhances the predicted quality, while achieving a new state-of-the-art accuracy-efficiency trade-off. Theoretically, we demonstrate that META exhibits superior generalization capability and stronger adaptability.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Object Hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models via Attention Calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) exhibit impressive multimodal reasoning capabilities but remain highly susceptible to object hallucination, where models generate responses that are not factually aligned with the visual content. Recent works attribute this issue to an inherent bias of LVLMs where vision token attention map has a fixed correlation with spatial position, and propose to mitigate this issue by reordering visual tokens. However, we find that different LVLMs exhibit different correlations between attention and spatial position, which makes the existing solution difficult to generalize to other LVLMs. To address this issue, we first introduce a training-free solution, Uniform Attention Calibration (UAC), that estimates the bias from single meaningless input image and applies a calibration matrix to rectify attention imbalances. To further alleviate the bias, we relax the assumption of single meaningless input in UAC and introduce a fine-tuning solution, Dynamic Attention Calibration (DAC), that enforces the consistent outputs wherever the object locates in the image via a plug-and-plays module. Comprehensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that UAC and DAC significantly reduce object hallucination while improving general multimodal alignment. Our methods achieve state-of-the-art performance across diverse LVLM architectures on various metrics.</description>

      <title>AutoGUI: Scaling GUI Grounding with Automatic Functionality Annotations from LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: User interface understanding with vision-language models has received much attention due to its potential for enabling next-generation software automation. However, existing UI datasets either only provide large-scale context-free element annotations or contextualized functional descriptions for elements at a much smaller scale. In this work, we propose the \methodname{} pipeline for automatically annotating UI elements with detailed functionality descriptions at scale. Specifically, we leverage large language models (LLMs) to infer element functionality by comparing the UI content changes before and after simulated interactions with specific UI elements. To improve annotation quality, we propose LLM-aided rejection and verification, eliminating invalid and incorrect annotations without human labor. We construct an \methodname{}-704k dataset using the proposed pipeline, featuring multi-resolution, multi-device screenshots, diverse data domains, and detailed functionality annotations that have never been provided by previous datasets. Human evaluation shows that the AutoGUI pipeline achieves annotation correctness comparable to trained human annotators. Extensive experimental results show that our \methodname{}-704k dataset remarkably enhances VLM's UI grounding capabilities, exhibits significant scaling effects, and outperforms existing web pre-training data types. We envision AutoGUI as a scalable pipeline for generating massive data to build GUI-oriented VLMs. AutoGUI dataset can be viewed at this anonymous URL: https://autogui-project.github.io/.</description>

      <title>DCT-Mamba3D: Spectral Decorrelation and Spatial-Spectral Feature Extraction for Hyperspectral Image Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperspectral image classification presents challenges due to spectral redundancy and complex spatial-spectral dependencies. This paper proposes a novel framework, DCT-Mamba3D, for hyperspectral image classification. DCT-Mamba3D incorporates: (1) a 3D spectral-spatial decorrelation module that applies 3D discrete cosine transform basis functions to reduce both spectral and spatial redundancy, enhancing feature clarity across dimensions; (2) a 3D-Mamba module that leverages a bidirectional state-space model to capture intricate spatial-spectral dependencies; and (3) a global residual enhancement module that stabilizes feature representation, improving robustness and convergence. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that our DCT-Mamba3D outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in challenging scenarios such as the same object in different spectra and different objects in the same spectra.</description>

      <title>One Diffusion Step to Real-World Super-Resolution via Flow Trajectory Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have significantly advanced the development of real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR), but the computational cost of multi-step diffusion models limits their application. One-step diffusion models generate high-quality images in a one sampling step, greatly reducing computational overhead and inference latency. However, most existing one-step diffusion methods are constrained by the performance of the teacher model, where poor teacher performance results in image artifacts. To address this limitation, we propose FluxSR, a novel one-step diffusion Real-ISR technique based on flow matching models. We use the state-of-the-art diffusion model FLUX.1-dev as both the teacher model and the base model. First, we introduce Flow Trajectory Distillation (FTD) to distill a multi-step flow matching model into a one-step Real-ISR. Second, to improve image realism and address high-frequency artifact issues in generated images, we propose TV-LPIPS as a perceptual loss and introduce Attention Diversification Loss (ADL) as a regularization term to reduce token similarity in transformer, thereby eliminating high-frequency artifacts. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing one-step diffusion-based Real-ISR methods. The code and model will be released at https://github.com/JianzeLi-114/FluxSR.</description>

      <title>Multi-illuminant Color Constancy via Multi-scale Illuminant Estimation and Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-illuminant color constancy methods aim to eliminate local color casts within an image through pixel-wise illuminant estimation. Existing methods mainly employ deep learning to establish a direct mapping between an image and its illumination map, which neglects the impact of image scales. To alleviate this problem, we represent an illuminant map as the linear combination of components estimated from multi-scale images. Furthermore, we propose a tri-branch convolution networks to estimate multi-grained illuminant distribution maps from multi-scale images. These multi-grained illuminant maps are merged adaptively with an attentional illuminant fusion module. Through comprehensive experimental analysis and evaluation, the results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, and it has achieved state-of-the-art performance.</description>

      <title>From Fog to Failure: How Dehazing Can Harm Clear Image Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the challenges of integrating human visual cue-based dehazing into object detection, given the selective nature of human perception. While human vision adapts dynamically to environmental conditions, computational dehazing does not always enhance detection uniformly. We propose a multi-stage framework where a lightweight detector identifies regions of interest (RoIs), which are then enhanced via spatial attention-based dehazing before final detection by a heavier model. Though effective in foggy conditions, this approach unexpectedly degrades the performance on clear images. We analyze this phenomenon, investigate possible causes, and offer insights for designing hybrid pipelines that balance enhancement and detection. Our findings highlight the need for selective preprocessing and challenge assumptions about universal benefits from cascading transformations.</description>

      <title>MORPH-LER: Log-Euclidean Regularization for Population-Aware Image Registration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatial transformations that capture population-level morphological statistics are critical for medical image analysis. Commonly used smoothness regularizers for image registration fail to integrate population statistics, leading to anatomically inconsistent transformations. Inverse consistency regularizers promote geometric consistency but lack population morphometrics integration. Regularizers that constrain deformation to low-dimensional manifold methods address this. However, they prioritize reconstruction over interpretability and neglect diffeomorphic properties, such as group composition and inverse consistency. We introduce MORPH-LER, a Log-Euclidean regularization framework for population-aware unsupervised image registration. MORPH-LER learns population morphometrics from spatial transformations to guide and regularize registration networks, ensuring anatomically plausible deformations. It features a bottleneck autoencoder that computes the principal logarithm of deformation fields via iterative square-root predictions. It creates a linearized latent space that respects diffeomorphic properties and enforces inverse consistency. By integrating a registration network with a diffeomorphic autoencoder, MORPH-LER produces smooth, meaningful deformation fields. The framework offers two main contributions: (1) a data-driven regularization strategy that incorporates population-level anatomical statistics to enhance transformation validity and (2) a linearized latent space that enables compact and interpretable deformation fields for efficient population morphometrics analysis. We validate MORPH-LER across two families of deep learning-based registration networks, demonstrating its ability to produce anatomically accurate, computationally efficient, and statistically meaningful transformations on the OASIS-1 brain imaging dataset.</description>

      <title>CASIM: Composite Aware Semantic Injection for Text to Motion Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in generative modeling and tokenization have driven significant progress in text-to-motion generation, leading to enhanced quality and realism in generated motions. However, effectively leveraging textual information for conditional motion generation remains an open challenge. We observe that current approaches, primarily relying on fixed-length text embeddings (e.g., CLIP) for global semantic injection, struggle to capture the composite nature of human motion, resulting in suboptimal motion quality and controllability. To address this limitation, we propose the Composite Aware Semantic Injection Mechanism (CASIM), comprising a composite-aware semantic encoder and a text-motion aligner that learns the dynamic correspondence between text and motion tokens. Notably, CASIM is model and representation-agnostic, readily integrating with both autoregressive and diffusion-based methods. Experiments on HumanML3D and KIT benchmarks demonstrate that CASIM consistently improves motion quality, text-motion alignment, and retrieval scores across state-of-the-art methods. Qualitative analyses further highlight the superiority of our composite-aware approach over fixed-length semantic injection, enabling precise motion control from text prompts and stronger generalization to unseen text inputs.</description>

      <title>LoRA-TTT: Low-Rank Test-Time Training for Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancements in vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have intensified the need to address distribution shifts between training and testing datasets. Although prior Test-Time Training (TTT) techniques for VLMs have demonstrated robust performance, they predominantly rely on tuning text prompts, a process that demands substantial computational resources and is heavily dependent on entropy-based loss. In this paper, we propose LoRA-TTT, a novel TTT method that leverages Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), applied exclusively to the image encoder of VLMs. By introducing LoRA and updating only its parameters during test time, our method offers a simple yet effective TTT approach, retaining the model's initial generalization capability while achieving substantial performance gains with minimal memory and runtime overhead. Additionally, we introduce a highly efficient reconstruction loss tailored for TTT. Our method can adapt to diverse domains by combining these two losses, without increasing memory consumption or runtime. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks, covering 15 datasets, demonstrate that our method improves the zero-shot top-1 accuracy of CLIP-ViT-B/16 by an average of 5.79% on the OOD benchmark and 1.36% on the fine-grained benchmark, efficiently surpassing test-time prompt tuning, without relying on any external models or cache.</description>

      <title>Improving Power Plant CO2 Emission Estimation with Deep Learning and Satellite/Simulated Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CO2 emissions from power plants, as significant super emitters, contribute substantially to global warming. Accurate quantification of these emissions is crucial for effective climate mitigation strategies. While satellite-based plume inversion offers a promising approach, challenges arise from data limitations and the complexity of atmospheric conditions. This study addresses these challenges by (a) expanding the available dataset through the integration of NO2 data from Sentinel-5P, generating continuous XCO2 maps, and incorporating real satellite observations from OCO-2/3 for over 71 power plants in data-scarce regions; and (b) employing a customized U-Net model capable of handling diverse spatio-temporal resolutions for emission rate estimation. Our results demonstrate significant improvements in emission rate accuracy compared to previous methods. By leveraging this enhanced approach, we can enable near real-time, precise quantification of major CO2 emission sources, supporting environmental protection initiatives and informing regulatory frameworks.</description>

      <title>IPO: Iterative Preference Optimization for Text-to-Video Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video foundation models have achieved significant advancement with the help of network upgrade as well as model scale-up. However, they are still hard to meet requirements of applications due to unsatisfied generation quality. To solve this problem, we propose to align video foundation models with human preferences from the perspective of post-training in this paper. Consequently, we introduce an Iterative Preference Optimization strategy to enhance generated video quality by incorporating human feedback. Specifically, IPO exploits a critic model to justify video generations for pairwise ranking as in Direct Preference Optimization or point-wise scoring as in Kahneman-Tversky Optimization. Given this, IPO optimizes video foundation models with guidance of signals from preference feedback, which helps improve generated video quality in subject consistency, motion smoothness and aesthetic quality, etc. In addition, IPO incorporates the critic model with the multi-modality large language model, which enables it to automatically assign preference labels without need of retraining or relabeling. In this way, IPO can efficiently perform multi-round preference optimization in an iterative manner, without the need of tediously manual labeling. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed IPO can effectively improve the video generation quality of a pretrained model and help a model with only 2B parameters surpass the one with 5B parameters. Besides, IPO achieves new state-of-the-art performance on VBench benchmark. We will release our source codes, models as well as dataset to advance future research and applications.</description>

      <title>Efficient Dynamic Scene Editing via 4D Gaussian-based Static-Dynamic Separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent 4D dynamic scene editing methods require editing thousands of 2D images used for dynamic scene synthesis and updating the entire scene with additional training loops, resulting in several hours of processing to edit a single dynamic scene. Therefore, these methods are not scalable with respect to the temporal dimension of the dynamic scene (i.e., the number of timesteps). In this work, we propose an efficient dynamic scene editing method that is more scalable in terms of temporal dimension. To achieve computational efficiency, we leverage a 4D Gaussian representation that models a 4D dynamic scene by combining static 3D Gaussians with a Hexplane-based deformation field, which handles dynamic information. We then perform editing solely on the static 3D Gaussians, which is the minimal but sufficient component required for visual editing. To resolve the misalignment between the edited 3D Gaussians and the deformation field potentially resulting from the editing process, we additionally conducted a refinement stage using a score distillation mechanism. Extensive editing results demonstrate that our method is efficient, reducing editing time by more than half compared to existing methods, while achieving high editing quality that better follows user instructions.</description>

      <title>Dual-Flow: Transferable Multi-Target, Instance-Agnostic Attacks via In-the-wild Cascading Flow Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adversarial attacks are widely used to evaluate model robustness, and in black-box scenarios, the transferability of these attacks becomes crucial. Existing generator-based attacks have excellent generalization and transferability due to their instance-agnostic nature. However, when training generators for multi-target tasks, the success rate of transfer attacks is relatively low due to the limitations of the model's capacity. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Dual-Flow framework for multi-target instance-agnostic adversarial attacks, utilizing Cascading Distribution Shift Training to develop an adversarial velocity function. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Dual-Flow significantly improves transferability over previous multi-target generative attacks. For example, it increases the success rate from Inception-v3 to ResNet-152 by 34.58%. Furthermore, our attack method, such as adversarially trained models, shows substantially stronger robustness against defense mechanisms.</description>

      <title>VerteNet -- A Multi-Context Hybrid CNN Transformer for Accurate Vertebral Landmark Localization in Lateral Spine DXA Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lateral Spine Image (LSI) analysis is important for medical diagnosis, treatment planning, and detailed spinal health assessments. Although modalities like Computed Tomography and Digital X-ray Imaging are commonly used, Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) is often preferred due to lower radiation exposure, seamless capture, and cost-effectiveness. Accurate Vertebral Landmark Localization (VLL) on LSIs is important to detect spinal conditions like kyphosis and lordosis, as well as assessing Abdominal Aortic Calcification (AAC) using Inter-Vertebral Guides (IVGs). Nonetheless, few automated VLL methodologies have concentrated on DXA LSIs. We present VerteNet, a hybrid CNN-Transformer model featuring a novel dual-resolution attention mechanism in self and cross-attention domains, referred to as Dual Resolution Self-Attention (DRSA) and Dual Resolution Cross-Attention (DRCA). These mechanisms capture the diverse frequencies in DXA images by operating at two different feature map resolutions. Additionally, we design a Multi-Context Feature Fusion Block (MCFB) that efficiently integrates the features using DRSA and DRCA. We train VerteNet on 620 DXA LSIs from various machines and achieve superior results compared to existing methods. We also design an algorithm that utilizes VerteNet's predictions in estimating the Region of Interest (ROI) to detect potential abdominal aorta cropping, where inadequate soft tissue hinders calcification assessment. Additionally, we present a small proof-of-concept study to show that IVGs generated from VLL information can improve inter-reader correlation in AAC scoring, addressing two key areas of disagreement in expert AAC-24 scoring: IVG placement and quality control for full abdominal aorta assessment.

      <title>DOC-Depth: A novel approach for dense depth ground truth generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate depth information is essential for many computer vision applications. Yet, no available dataset recording method allows for fully dense accurate depth estimation in a large scale dynamic environment. In this paper, we introduce DOC-Depth, a novel, efficient and easy-to-deploy approach for dense depth generation from any LiDAR sensor. After reconstructing consistent dense 3D environment using LiDAR odometry, we address dynamic objects occlusions automatically thanks to DOC, our state-of-the art dynamic object classification method. Additionally, DOC-Depth is fast and scalable, allowing for the creation of unbounded datasets in terms of size and time. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the KITTI dataset, improving its density from 16.1% to 71.2% and release this new fully dense depth annotation, to facilitate future research in the domain. We also showcase results using various LiDAR sensors and in multiple environments. All software components are publicly available for the research community.</description>

      <title>On the Guidance of Flow Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flow matching has shown state-of-the-art performance in various generative tasks, ranging from image generation to decision-making, where guided generation is pivotal. However, the guidance of flow matching is more general than and thus substantially different from that of its predecessor, diffusion models. Therefore, the challenge in guidance for general flow matching remains largely underexplored. In this paper, we propose the first framework of general guidance for flow matching. From this framework, we derive a family of guidance techniques that can be applied to general flow matching. These include a new training-free asymptotically exact guidance, novel training losses for training-based guidance, and two classes of approximate guidance that cover classical gradient guidance methods as special cases. We theoretically investigate these different methods to give a practical guideline for choosing suitable methods in different scenarios. Experiments on synthetic datasets, image inverse problems, and offline reinforcement learning demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed guidance methods and verify the correctness of our flow matching guidance framework. Code to reproduce the experiments can be found at https://github.com/AI4Science-WestlakeU/flow_guidance.</description>

      <title>Progressive Correspondence Regenerator for Robust 3D Registration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Obtaining enough high-quality correspondences is crucial for robust registration. Existing correspondence refinement methods mostly follow the paradigm of outlier removal, which either fails to correctly identify the accurate correspondences under extreme outlier ratios, or select too few correct correspondences to support robust registration. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach named Regor, which is a progressive correspondence regenerator that generates higher-quality matches whist sufficiently robust for numerous outliers. In each iteration, we first apply prior-guided local grouping and generalized mutual matching to generate the local region correspondences. A powerful center-aware three-point consistency is then presented to achieve local correspondence correction, instead of removal. Further, we employ global correspondence refinement to obtain accurate correspondences from a global perspective. Through progressive iterations, this process yields a large number of high-quality correspondences. Extensive experiments on both indoor and outdoor datasets demonstrate that the proposed Regor significantly outperforms existing outlier removal techniques. More critically, our approach obtain 10 times more correct correspondences than outlier removal methods. As a result, our method is able to achieve robust registration even with weak features. The code will be released.</description>

      <title>DeepForest: Sensing Into Self-Occluding Volumes of Vegetation With Aerial Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Access to below-canopy volumetric vegetation data is crucial for understanding ecosystem dynamics. We address the long-standing limitation of remote sensing to penetrate deep into dense canopy layers. LiDAR and radar are currently considered the primary options for measuring 3D vegetation structures, while cameras can only extract the reflectance and depth of top layers. Using conventional, high-resolution aerial images, our approach allows sensing deep into self-occluding vegetation volumes, such as forests. It is similar in spirit to the imaging process of wide-field microscopy, but can handle much larger scales and strong occlusion. We scan focal stacks by synthetic-aperture imaging with drones and reduce out-of-focus signal contributions using pre-trained 3D convolutional neural networks. The resulting volumetric reflectance stacks contain low-frequency representations of the vegetation volume. Combining multiple reflectance stacks from various spectral channels provides insights into plant health, growth, and environmental conditions throughout the entire vegetation volume.</description>

      <title>Sequence models for continuous cell cycle stage prediction from brightfield images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding cell cycle dynamics is crucial for studying biological processes such as growth, development and disease progression. While fluorescent protein reporters like the Fucci system allow live monitoring of cell cycle phases, they require genetic engineering and occupy additional fluorescence channels, limiting broader applicability in complex experiments. In this study, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of deep learning methods for predicting continuous Fucci signals using non-fluorescence brightfield imaging, a widely available label-free modality. To that end, we generated a large dataset of 1.3 M images of dividing RPE1 cells with full cell cycle trajectories to quantitatively compare the predictive performance of distinct model categories including single time-frame models, causal state space models and bidirectional transformer models. We show that both causal and transformer-based models significantly outperform single- and fixed frame approaches, enabling the prediction of visually imperceptible transitions like G1/S within 1h resolution. Our findings underscore the importance of sequence models for accurate predictions of cell cycle dynamics and highlight their potential for label-free imaging.</description>

      <title>ShapeShifter: 3D Variations Using Multiscale and Sparse Point-Voxel Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes ShapeShifter, a new 3D generative model that learns to synthesize shape variations based on a single reference model. While generative methods for 3D objects have recently attracted much attention, current techniques often lack geometric details and/or require long training times and large resources. Our approach remedies these issues by combining sparse voxel grids and point, normal, and color sampling within a multiscale neural architecture that can be trained efficiently and in parallel. We show that our resulting variations better capture the fine details of their original input and can handle more general types of surfaces than previous SDF-based methods. Moreover, we offer interactive generation of 3D shape variants, allowing more human control in the design loop if needed.</description>

      <title>Exploiting Ensemble Learning for Cross-View Isolated Sign Language Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present our solution to the Cross-View Isolated Sign Language Recognition (CV-ISLR) challenge held at WWW 2025. CV-ISLR addresses a critical issue in traditional Isolated Sign Language Recognition (ISLR), where existing datasets predominantly capture sign language videos from a frontal perspective, while real-world camera angles often vary. To accurately recognize sign language from different viewpoints, models must be capable of understanding gestures from multiple angles, making cross-view recognition challenging. To address this, we explore the advantages of ensemble learning, which enhances model robustness and generalization across diverse views. Our approach, built on a multi-dimensional Video Swin Transformer model, leverages this ensemble strategy to achieve competitive performance. Finally, our solution ranked 3rd in both the RGB-based ISLR and RGB-D-based ISLR tracks, demonstrating the effectiveness in handling the challenges of cross-view recognition.

      <title>InterLCM: Low-Quality Images as Intermediate States of Latent Consistency Models for Effective Blind Face Restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion priors have been used for blind face restoration (BFR) by fine-tuning diffusion models (DMs) on restoration datasets to recover low-quality images. However, the naive application of DMs presents several key limitations. (i) The diffusion prior has inferior semantic consistency (e.g., ID, structure and color.), increasing the difficulty of optimizing the BFR model; (ii) reliance on hundreds of denoising iterations, preventing the effective cooperation with perceptual losses, which is crucial for faithful restoration. Observing that the latent consistency model (LCM) learns consistency noise-to-data mappings on the ODE-trajectory and therefore shows more semantic consistency in the subject identity, structural information and color preservation, we propose InterLCM to leverage the LCM for its superior semantic consistency and efficiency to counter the above issues. Treating low-quality images as the intermediate state of LCM, InterLCM achieves a balance between fidelity and quality by starting from earlier LCM steps. LCM also allows the integration of perceptual loss during training, leading to improved restoration quality, particularly in real-world scenarios. To mitigate structural and semantic uncertainties, InterLCM incorporates a Visual Module to extract visual features and a Spatial Encoder to capture spatial details, enhancing the fidelity of restored images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that InterLCM outperforms existing approaches in both synthetic and real-world datasets while also achieving faster inference speed.</description>

      <title>Exploring the latent space of diffusion models directly through singular value decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the groundbreaking success of diffusion models in generating high-fidelity images, their latent space remains relatively under-explored, even though it holds significant promise for enabling versatile and interpretable image editing capabilities. The complicated denoising trajectory and high dimensionality of the latent space make it extremely challenging to interpret. Existing methods mainly explore the feature space of U-Net in Diffusion Models (DMs) instead of the latent space itself. In contrast, we directly investigate the latent space via Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and discover three useful properties that can be used to control generation results without the requirements of data collection and maintain identity fidelity generated images. Based on these properties, we propose a novel image editing framework that is capable of learning arbitrary attributes from one pair of latent codes destined by text prompts in Stable Diffusion Models. To validate our approach, extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate its effectiveness and flexibility in image editing. We will release our codes soon to foster further research and applications in this area.</description>

      <title>A Robust Remote Photoplethysmography Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) is a method for measuring a subjects heart rate remotely using a camera. Factors such as subject movement, ambient light level, makeup etc. complicate such measurements by distorting the observed pulse. Recent works on this topic have proposed a variety of approaches for accurately measuring heart rate in humans, however these methods were tested in ideal conditions, where the subject does not make significant movements and all measurements are taken at the same level of illumination. In more realistic conditions these methods suffer from decreased accuracy. The study proposes a more robust method that is less susceptible to distortions and has minimal hardware requirements. The proposed method uses a combination of mathematical transforms to calculate the subjects heart rate. It performs best when used with a camera that has been modified by removing its infrared filter, although using an unmodified camera is also possible. The method was tested on 26 videos taken from 19 volunteers of varying gender and age. The obtained results were compared to reference data and the average mean absolute error was found to be at 1.95 beats per minute, which is noticeably better than the results from previous works. The remote photoplethysmography method proposed in the present article is more resistant to distortions than methods from previous publications and thus allows one to remotely and accurately measure the subjects heart rate without imposing any significant limitations on the subjects behavior.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-view clustering (MvC) utilizes information from multiple views to uncover the underlying structures of data. Despite significant advancements in MvC, mitigating the impact of missing samples in specific views on the integration of knowledge from different views remains a critical challenge. This paper proposes a novel Mask-informed Deep Contrastive Incomplete Multi-view Clustering (Mask-IMvC) method, which elegantly identifies a view-common representation for clustering. Specifically, we introduce a mask-informed fusion network that aggregates incomplete multi-view information while considering the observation status of samples across various views as a mask, thereby reducing the adverse effects of missing values. Additionally, we design a prior knowledge-assisted contrastive learning loss that boosts the representation capability of the aggregated view-common representation by injecting neighborhood information of samples from different views. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed Mask-IMvC method over state-of-the-art approaches across multiple MvC datasets, both in complete and incomplete scenarios.</description>

      <title>Rotation-Adaptive Point Cloud Domain Generalization via Intricate Orientation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The vulnerability of 3D point cloud analysis to unpredictable rotations poses an open yet challenging problem: orientation-aware 3D domain generalization. Cross-domain robustness and adaptability of 3D representations are crucial but not easily achieved through rotation augmentation. Motivated by the inherent advantages of intricate orientations in enhancing generalizability, we propose an innovative rotation-adaptive domain generalization framework for 3D point cloud analysis. Our approach aims to alleviate orientational shifts by leveraging intricate samples in an iterative learning process. Specifically, we identify the most challenging rotation for each point cloud and construct an intricate orientation set by optimizing intricate orientations. Subsequently, we employ an orientation-aware contrastive learning framework that incorporates an orientation consistency loss and a margin separation loss, enabling effective learning of categorically discriminative and generalizable features with rotation consistency. Extensive experiments and ablations conducted on 3D cross-domain benchmarks firmly establish the state-of-the-art performance of our proposed approach in the context of orientation-aware 3D domain generalization.</description>

      <title>UNIP: Rethinking Pre-trained Attention Patterns for Infrared Semantic Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pre-training techniques significantly enhance the performance of semantic segmentation tasks with limited training data. However, the efficacy under a large domain gap between pre-training (e.g. RGB) and fine-tuning (e.g. infrared) remains underexplored. In this study, we first benchmark the infrared semantic segmentation performance of various pre-training methods and reveal several phenomena distinct from the RGB domain. Next, our layerwise analysis of pre-trained attention maps uncovers that: (1) There are three typical attention patterns (local, hybrid, and global); (2) Pre-training tasks notably influence the pattern distribution across layers; (3) The hybrid pattern is crucial for semantic segmentation as it attends to both nearby and foreground elements; (4) The texture bias impedes model generalization in infrared tasks. Building on these insights, we propose UNIP, a UNified Infrared Pre-training framework, to enhance the pre-trained model performance. This framework uses the hybrid-attention distillation NMI-HAD as the pre-training target, a large-scale mixed dataset InfMix for pre-training, and a last-layer feature pyramid network LL-FPN for fine-tuning. Experimental results show that UNIP outperforms various pre-training methods by up to 13.5\% in average mIoU on three infrared segmentation tasks, evaluated using fine-tuning and linear probing metrics. UNIP-S achieves performance on par with MAE-L while requiring only 1/10 of the computational cost. Furthermore, UNIP significantly surpasses state-of-the-art (SOTA) infrared or RGB segmentation methods and demonstrates broad potential for application in other modalities, such as RGB and depth.

      <title>Survey of Quantization Techniques for On-Device Vision-based Crack Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) ensures the safety and longevity of infrastructure by enabling timely damage detection. Vision-based crack detection, combined with UAVs, addresses the limitations of traditional sensor-based SHM methods but requires the deployment of efficient deep learning models on resource-constrained devices. This study evaluates two lightweight convolutional neural network models, MobileNetV1x0.25 and MobileNetV2x0.5, across TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Open Neural Network Exchange platforms using three quantization techniques: dynamic quantization, post-training quantization (PTQ), and quantization-aware training (QAT). Results show that QAT consistently achieves near-floating-point accuracy, such as an F1-score of 0.8376 for MBNV2x0.5 with Torch-QAT, while maintaining efficient resource usage. PTQ significantly reduces memory and energy consumption but suffers from accuracy loss, particularly in TensorFlow. Dynamic quantization preserves accuracy but faces deployment challenges on PyTorch. By leveraging QAT, this work enables real-time, low-power crack detection on UAVs, enhancing safety, scalability, and cost-efficiency in SHM applications, while providing insights into balancing accuracy and efficiency across different platforms for autonomous inspections.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting has emerged as an efficient photorealistic novel view synthesis method. However, its reliance on sparse Structure-from-Motion (SfM) point clouds consistently compromises the scene reconstruction quality. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel 3D reconstruction framework Gaussian Processes Gaussian Splatting (GP-GS), where a multi-output Gaussian Process model is developed to achieve adaptive and uncertainty-guided densification of sparse SfM point clouds. Specifically, we propose a dynamic sampling and filtering pipeline that adaptively expands the SfM point clouds by leveraging GP-based predictions to infer new candidate points from the input 2D pixels and depth maps. The pipeline utilizes uncertainty estimates to guide the pruning of high-variance predictions, ensuring geometric consistency and enabling the generation of dense point clouds. The densified point clouds provide high-quality initial 3D Gaussians to enhance reconstruction performance. Extensive experiments conducted on synthetic and real-world datasets across various scales validate the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed framework.</description>

      <title>UniGaze: Towards Universal Gaze Estimation via Large-scale Pre-Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite decades of research on data collection and model architectures, current gaze estimation models face significant challenges in generalizing across diverse data domains. While recent advances in self-supervised pre-training have shown remarkable potential for improving model generalization in various vision tasks, their effectiveness in gaze estimation remains unexplored due to the geometric nature of the gaze regression task. We propose UniGaze, which leverages large-scale, in-the-wild facial datasets through self-supervised pre-training for gaze estimation. We carefully curate multiple facial datasets that capture diverse variations in identity, lighting, background, and head poses. By directly applying Masked Autoencoder (MAE) pre-training on normalized face images with a Vision Transformer (ViT) backbone, our UniGaze learns appropriate feature representations within the specific input space required by downstream gaze estimation models. Through comprehensive experiments using challenging cross-dataset evaluation and novel protocols, including leave-one-dataset-out and joint-dataset settings, we demonstrate that UniGaze significantly improves generalization across multiple data domains while minimizing reliance on costly labeled data. The source code and pre-trained models will be released upon acceptance.</description>

      <title>Review of Demographic Bias in Face Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Demographic bias in face recognition (FR) has emerged as a critical area of research, given its impact on fairness, equity, and reliability across diverse applications. As FR technologies are increasingly deployed globally, disparities in performance across demographic groups -- such as race, ethnicity, and gender -- have garnered significant attention. These biases not only compromise the credibility of FR systems but also raise ethical concerns, especially when these technologies are employed in sensitive domains. This review consolidates extensive research efforts providing a comprehensive overview of the multifaceted aspects of demographic bias in FR.
  We systematically examine the primary causes, datasets, assessment metrics, and mitigation approaches associated with demographic disparities in FR. By categorizing key contributions in these areas, this work provides a structured approach to understanding and addressing the complexity of this issue. Finally, we highlight current advancements and identify emerging challenges that need further investigation. This article aims to provide researchers with a unified perspective on the state-of-the-art while emphasizing the critical need for equitable and trustworthy FR systems.</description>

      <title>Improving Generalization Ability for 3D Object Detection by Learning Sparsity-invariant Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In autonomous driving, 3D object detection is essential for accurately identifying and tracking objects. Despite the continuous development of various technologies for this task, a significant drawback is observed in most of them-they experience substantial performance degradation when detecting objects in unseen domains. In this paper, we propose a method to improve the generalization ability for 3D object detection on a single domain. We primarily focus on generalizing from a single source domain to target domains with distinct sensor configurations and scene distributions. To learn sparsity-invariant features from a single source domain, we selectively subsample the source data to a specific beam, using confidence scores determined by the current detector to identify the density that holds utmost importance for the detector. Subsequently, we employ the teacher-student framework to align the Bird's Eye View (BEV) features for different point clouds densities. We also utilize feature content alignment (FCA) and graph-based embedding relationship alignment (GERA) to instruct the detector to be domain-agnostic. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method exhibits superior generalization capabilities compared to other baselines. Furthermore, our approach even outperforms certain domain adaptation methods that can access to the target domain data.</description>

      <title>Event-aided Semantic Scene Completion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous driving systems rely on robust 3D scene understanding. Recent advances in Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) for autonomous driving underscore the limitations of RGB-based approaches, which struggle under motion blur, poor lighting, and adverse weather. Event cameras, offering high dynamic range and low latency, address these challenges by providing asynchronous data that complements RGB inputs. We present DSEC-SSC, the first real-world benchmark specifically designed for event-aided SSC, which includes a novel 4D labeling pipeline for generating dense, visibility-aware labels that adapt dynamically to object motion. Our proposed RGB-Event fusion framework, EvSSC, introduces an Event-aided Lifting Module (ELM) that effectively bridges 2D RGB-Event features to 3D space, enhancing view transformation and the robustness of 3D volume construction across SSC models. Extensive experiments on DSEC-SSC and simulated SemanticKITTI-E demonstrate that EvSSC is adaptable to both transformer-based and LSS-based SSC architectures. Notably, evaluations on SemanticKITTI-C demonstrate that EvSSC achieves consistently improved prediction accuracy across five degradation modes and both In-domain and Out-of-domain settings, achieving up to a 52.5% relative improvement in mIoU when the image sensor partially fails. Additionally, we quantitatively and qualitatively validate the superiority of EvSSC under motion blur and extreme weather conditions, where autonomous driving is challenged. The established datasets and our codebase will be made publicly at https://github.com/Pandapan01/EvSSC.</description>

      <title>Geometric Neural Process Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of Neural Field (NeF) generalization, where models must efficiently adapt to new signals given only a few observations. To tackle this, we propose Geometric Neural Process Fields (G-NPF), a probabilistic framework for neural radiance fields that explicitly captures uncertainty. We formulate NeF generalization as a probabilistic problem, enabling direct inference of NeF function distributions from limited context observations. To incorporate structural inductive biases, we introduce a set of geometric bases that encode spatial structure and facilitate the inference of NeF function distributions. Building on these bases, we design a hierarchical latent variable model, allowing G-NPF to integrate structural information across multiple spatial levels and effectively parameterize INR functions. This hierarchical approach improves generalization to novel scenes and unseen signals. Experiments on novel-view synthesis for 3D scenes, as well as 2D image and 1D signal regression, demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in capturing uncertainty and leveraging structural information for improved generalization.</description>

      <title>Transfer Risk Map: Mitigating Pixel-level Negative Transfer in Medical Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How to mitigate negative transfer in transfer learning is a long-standing and challenging issue, especially in the application of medical image segmentation. Existing methods for reducing negative transfer focus on classification or regression tasks, ignoring the non-uniform negative transfer risk in different image regions. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective weighted fine-tuning method that directs the model's attention towards regions with significant transfer risk for medical semantic segmentation. Specifically, we compute a transferability-guided transfer risk map to quantify the transfer hardness for each pixel and the potential risks of negative transfer. During the fine-tuning phase, we introduce a map-weighted loss function, normalized with image foreground size to counter class imbalance. Extensive experiments on brain segmentation datasets show our method significantly improves the target task performance, with gains of 4.37% on FeTS2021 and 1.81% on iSeg2019, avoiding negative transfer across modalities and tasks. Meanwhile, a 2.9% gain under a few-shot scenario validates the robustness of our approach.</description>

      <title>MotionLab: Unified Human Motion Generation and Editing via the Motion-Condition-Motion Paradigm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human motion generation and editing are key components of computer graphics and vision. However, current approaches in this field tend to offer isolated solutions tailored to specific tasks, which can be inefficient and impractical for real-world applications. While some efforts have aimed to unify motion-related tasks, these methods simply use different modalities as conditions to guide motion generation. Consequently, they lack editing capabilities, fine-grained control, and fail to facilitate knowledge sharing across tasks. To address these limitations and provide a versatile, unified framework capable of handling both human motion generation and editing, we introduce a novel paradigm: Motion-Condition-Motion, which enables the unified formulation of diverse tasks with three concepts: source motion, condition, and target motion.Based on this paradigm, we propose a unified framework, MotionLab, which incorporates rectified flows to learn the mapping from source motion to target motion, guided by the specified conditions.In MotionLab, we introduce the 1) MotionFlow Transformer to enhance conditional generation and editing without task-specific modules; 2) Aligned Rotational Position Encoding} to guarantee the time synchronization between source motion and target motion; 3) Task Specified Instruction Modulation; and 4) Motion Curriculum Learning for effective multi-task learning and knowledge sharing across tasks. Notably, our MotionLab demonstrates promising generalization capabilities and inference efficiency across multiple benchmarks for human motion.

      <title>MaintaAvatar: A Maintainable Avatar Based on Neural Radiance Fields by Continual Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generation of a virtual digital avatar is a crucial research topic in the field of computer vision. Many existing works utilize Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) to address this issue and have achieved impressive results. However, previous works assume the images of the training person are available and fixed while the appearances and poses of a subject could constantly change and increase in real-world scenarios. How to update the human avatar but also maintain the ability to render the old appearance of the person is a practical challenge. One trivial solution is to combine the existing virtual avatar models based on NeRF with continual learning methods. However, there are some critical issues in this approach: learning new appearances and poses can cause the model to forget past information, which in turn leads to a degradation in the rendering quality of past appearances, especially color bleeding issues, and incorrect human body poses. In this work, we propose a maintainable avatar (MaintaAvatar) based on neural radiance fields by continual learning, which resolves the issues by utilizing a Global-Local Joint Storage Module and a Pose Distillation Module. Overall, our model requires only limited data collection to quickly fine-tune the model while avoiding catastrophic forgetting, thus achieving a maintainable virtual avatar. The experimental results validate the effectiveness of our MaintaAvatar model.</description>

      <title>LV-XAttn: Distributed Cross-Attention for Long Visual Inputs in Multimodal Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cross-attention is commonly adopted in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for integrating visual information into the language backbone. However, in applications with large visual inputs, such as video understanding, processing a large number of visual tokens in cross-attention layers leads to high memory demands and often necessitates distributed computation across multiple GPUs. Existing distributed attention mechanisms face significant communication overheads, making cross-attention layers a critical bottleneck for efficient training and inference of MLLMs. To address this, we propose LV-XAttn, a distributed, exact cross-attention mechanism with minimal communication overhead. We observe that in applications involving large visual inputs the size of the query block is typically much smaller than that of the key-value blocks. Thus, in LV-XAttn we keep the large key-value blocks locally on each GPU and exchange smaller query blocks across GPUs. We also introduce an efficient activation recomputation technique enabling support for longer visual context. We theoretically analyze the communication benefits of LV-XAttn and show that it can achieve speedups for a wide range of models. Our evaluations with mPLUG-Owl3 and OpenFlamingo models find that LV-XAttn achieves up to 5.58$\times$ end-to-end speedup compared to existing approaches.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present TUMTraffic-VideoQA, a novel dataset and benchmark designed for spatio-temporal video understanding in complex roadside traffic scenarios. The dataset comprises 1,000 videos, featuring 85,000 multiple-choice QA pairs, 2,300 object captioning, and 5,700 object grounding annotations, encompassing diverse real-world conditions such as adverse weather and traffic anomalies. By incorporating tuple-based spatio-temporal object expressions, TUMTraffic-VideoQA unifies three essential tasks-multiple-choice video question answering, referred object captioning, and spatio-temporal object grounding-within a cohesive evaluation framework. We further introduce the TUMTraffic-Qwen baseline model, enhanced with visual token sampling strategies, providing valuable insights into the challenges of fine-grained spatio-temporal reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the dataset's complexity, highlight the limitations of existing models, and position TUMTraffic-VideoQA as a robust foundation for advancing research in intelligent transportation systems. The dataset and benchmark are publicly available to facilitate further exploration.</description>

      <title>Personalization Toolkit: Training Free Personalization of Large Vision Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have significant potential to deliver personalized assistance by adapting to individual users' unique needs and preferences. Personalization of LVLMs is an emerging area that involves customizing models to recognize specific object instances and provide tailored responses. However, existing approaches rely on time-consuming test-time training for each user and object, rendering them impractical. This paper proposes a novel, training-free approach to LVLM personalization by leveraging pre-trained vision foundation models to extract distinct features, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques to recognize instances in the visual input, and visual prompting methods. Our model-agnostic vision toolkit enables flexible and efficient personalization without extensive retraining. We demonstrate state-of-the-art results, outperforming conventional training-based approaches and establish a new standard for LVLM personalization.</description>

      <title>IMDPrompter: Adapting SAM to Image Manipulation Detection by Cross-View Automated Prompt Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using extensive training data from SA-1B, the Segment Anything Model (SAM) has demonstrated exceptional generalization and zero-shot capabilities, attracting widespread attention in areas such as medical image segmentation and remote sensing image segmentation. However, its performance in the field of image manipulation detection remains largely unexplored and unconfirmed. There are two main challenges in applying SAM to image manipulation detection: a) reliance on manual prompts, and b) the difficulty of single-view information in supporting cross-dataset generalization. To address these challenges, we develops a cross-view prompt learning paradigm called IMDPrompter based on SAM. Benefiting from the design of automated prompts, IMDPrompter no longer relies on manual guidance, enabling automated detection and localization. Additionally, we propose components such as Cross-view Feature Perception, Optimal Prompt Selection, and Cross-View Prompt Consistency, which facilitate cross-view perceptual learning and guide SAM to generate accurate masks. Extensive experimental results from five datasets (CASIA, Columbia, Coverage, IMD2020, and NIST16) validate the effectiveness of our proposed method.</description>

      <title>Towards Consistent and Controllable Image Synthesis for Face Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current face editing methods mainly rely on GAN-based techniques, but recent focus has shifted to diffusion-based models due to their success in image reconstruction. However, diffusion models still face challenges in manipulating fine-grained attributes and preserving consistency of attributes that should remain unchanged. To address these issues and facilitate more convenient editing of face images, we propose a novel approach that leverages the power of Stable-Diffusion models and crude 3D face models to control the lighting, facial expression and head pose of a portrait photo. We observe that this task essentially involve combinations of target background, identity and different face attributes. We aim to sufficiently disentangle the control of these factors to enable high-quality of face editing. Specifically, our method, coined as RigFace, contains: 1) A Spatial Arrtibute Encoder that provides presise and decoupled conditions of background, pose, expression and lighting; 2) An Identity Encoder that transfers identity features to the denoising UNet of a pre-trained Stable-Diffusion model; 3) An Attribute Rigger that injects those conditions into the denoising UNet. Our model achieves comparable or even superior performance in both identity preservation and photorealism compared to existing face editing models.</description>

      <title>High-Fidelity Human Avatars from Laptop Webcams using Edge Compute</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Applications of generating photo-realistic human avatars are many, however, high-fidelity avatar generation traditionally required expensive professional camera rigs and artistic labor, but recent research has enabled constructing them automatically from smartphones with RGB and IR sensors. However, these new methods still rely on the presence of high-resolution cameras on modern smartphones and often require offloading the processing to powerful servers with GPUs. Modern applications such as video conferencing call for the ability to generate these avatars from consumer-grade laptop webcams using limited compute available on-device. In this work, we develop a novel method based on 3D morphable models, landmark detection, photo-realistic texture GANs, and differentiable rendering to tackle the problem of low webcam image quality and edge computation. We build an automatic system to generate high-fidelity animatable avatars under these limitations, leveraging the neural compute capabilities of mobile chips.</description>

      <title>Mind the Gap: Evaluating Patch Embeddings from General-Purpose and Histopathology Foundation Models for Cell Segmentation and Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in foundation models have transformed computer vision, driving significant performance improvements across diverse domains, including digital histopathology. However, the advantages of domain-specific histopathology foundation models over general-purpose models for specialized tasks such as cell analysis remain underexplored. This study investigates the representation learning gap between these two categories by analyzing multi-level patch embeddings applied to cell instance segmentation and classification. We implement an encoder-decoder architecture with a consistent decoder and various encoders. These include convolutional, vision transformer (ViT), and hybrid encoders pre-trained on ImageNet-22K or LVD-142M, representing general-purpose foundation models. These are compared against ViT encoders from the recently released UNI, Virchow2, and Prov-GigaPath foundation models, trained on patches extracted from hundreds of thousands of histopathology whole-slide images. The decoder integrates patch embeddings from different encoder depths via skip connections to generate semantic and distance maps. These maps are then post-processed to create instance segmentation masks where each label corresponds to an individual cell and to perform cell-type classification. All encoders remain frozen during training to assess their pre-trained feature extraction capabilities. Using the PanNuke and CoNIC histopathology datasets, and the newly introduced Nissl-stained CytoDArk0 dataset for brain cytoarchitecture studies, we evaluate instance-level detection, segmentation accuracy, and cell-type classification. This study provides insights into the comparative strengths and limitations of general-purpose vs. histopathology foundation models, offering guidance for model selection in cell-focused histopathology and brain cytoarchitecture analysis workflows.</description>

      <title>Hier-EgoPack: Hierarchical Egocentric Video Understanding with Diverse Task Perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our comprehension of video streams depicting human activities is naturally multifaceted: in just a few moments, we can grasp what is happening, identify the relevance and interactions of objects in the scene, and forecast what will happen soon, everything all at once. To endow autonomous systems with such a holistic perception, learning how to correlate concepts, abstract knowledge across diverse tasks, and leverage tasks synergies when learning novel skills is essential. A significant step in this direction is EgoPack, a unified framework for understanding human activities across diverse tasks with minimal overhead. EgoPack promotes information sharing and collaboration among downstream tasks, essential for efficiently learning new skills. In this paper, we introduce Hier-EgoPack, which advances EgoPack by enabling reasoning also across diverse temporal granularities, which expands its applicability to a broader range of downstream tasks. To achieve this, we propose a novel hierarchical architecture for temporal reasoning equipped with a GNN layer specifically designed to tackle the challenges of multi-granularity reasoning effectively. We evaluate our approach on multiple Ego4d benchmarks involving both clip-level and frame-level reasoning, demonstrating how our hierarchical unified architecture effectively solves these diverse tasks simultaneously.</description>

      <title>A Self-Supervised Framework for Improved Generalisability in Ultrasound B-mode Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrasound (US) imaging is clinically invaluable due to its noninvasive and safe nature. However, interpreting US images is challenging, requires significant expertise, and time, and is often prone to errors. Deep learning offers assistive solutions such as segmentation. Supervised methods rely on large, high-quality, and consistently labeled datasets, which are challenging to curate. Moreover, these methods tend to underperform on out-of-distribution data, limiting their clinical utility. Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a promising alternative, leveraging unlabeled data to enhance model performance and generalisability. We introduce a contrastive SSL approach tailored for B-mode US images, incorporating a novel Relation Contrastive Loss (RCL). RCL encourages learning of distinct features by differentiating positive and negative sample pairs through a learnable metric. Additionally, we propose spatial and frequency-based augmentation strategies for the representation learning on US images. Our approach significantly outperforms traditional supervised segmentation methods across three public breast US datasets, particularly in data-limited scenarios. Notable improvements on the Dice similarity metric include a 4% increase on 20% and 50% of the BUSI dataset, nearly 6% and 9% improvements on 20% and 50% of the BrEaST dataset, and 6.4% and 3.7% improvements on 20% and 50% of the UDIAT dataset, respectively. Furthermore, we demonstrate superior generalisability on the out-of-distribution UDIAT dataset with performance boosts of 20.6% and 13.6% compared to the supervised baseline using 20% and 50% of the BUSI and BrEaST training data, respectively. Our research highlights that domain-inspired SSL can improve US segmentation, especially under data-limited conditions.</description>

      <title>VideoJAM: Joint Appearance-Motion Representations for Enhanced Motion Generation in Video Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite tremendous recent progress, generative video models still struggle to capture real-world motion, dynamics, and physics. We show that this limitation arises from the conventional pixel reconstruction objective, which biases models toward appearance fidelity at the expense of motion coherence. To address this, we introduce VideoJAM, a novel framework that instills an effective motion prior to video generators, by encouraging the model to learn a joint appearance-motion representation. VideoJAM is composed of two complementary units. During training, we extend the objective to predict both the generated pixels and their corresponding motion from a single learned representation. During inference, we introduce Inner-Guidance, a mechanism that steers the generation toward coherent motion by leveraging the model's own evolving motion prediction as a dynamic guidance signal. Notably, our framework can be applied to any video model with minimal adaptations, requiring no modifications to the training data or scaling of the model. VideoJAM achieves state-of-the-art performance in motion coherence, surpassing highly competitive proprietary models while also enhancing the perceived visual quality of the generations. These findings emphasize that appearance and motion can be complementary and, when effectively integrated, enhance both the visual quality and the coherence of video generation.

      <title>Graph-based Document Structure Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When reading a document, glancing at the spatial layout of a document is an initial step to understand it roughly. Traditional document layout analysis (DLA) methods, however, offer only a superficial parsing of documents, focusing on basic instance detection and often failing to capture the nuanced spatial and logical relations between instances. These limitations hinder DLA-based models from achieving a gradually deeper comprehension akin to human reading. In this work, we propose a novel graph-based Document Structure Analysis (gDSA) task. This task requires that model not only detects document elements but also generates spatial and logical relations in form of a graph structure, allowing to understand documents in a holistic and intuitive manner. For this new task, we construct a relation graph-based document structure analysis dataset (GraphDoc) with 80K document images and 4.13M relation annotations, enabling training models to complete multiple tasks like reading order, hierarchical structures analysis, and complex inter-element relation inference. Furthermore, a document relation graph generator (DRGG) is proposed to address the gDSA task, which achieves performance with 57.6% at mAP$_g$@0.5 for a strong benchmark baseline on this novel task and dataset. We hope this graphical representation of document structure can mark an innovative advancement in document structure analysis and understanding. The new dataset and code will be made publicly available at https://yufanchen96.github.io/projects/GraphDoc.</description>

      <title>Unified Spatial-Temporal Edge-Enhanced Graph Networks for Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pedestrian trajectory prediction aims to forecast future movements based on historical paths. Spatial-temporal (ST) methods often separately model spatial interactions among pedestrians and temporal dependencies of individuals. They overlook the direct impacts of interactions among different pedestrians across various time steps (i.e., high-order cross-time interactions). This limits their ability to capture ST inter-dependencies and hinders prediction performance. To address these limitations, we propose UniEdge with three major designs. Firstly, we introduce a unified ST graph data structure that simplifies high-order cross-time interactions into first-order relationships, enabling the learning of ST inter-dependencies in a single step. This avoids the information loss caused by multi-step aggregation. Secondly, traditional GNNs focus on aggregating pedestrian node features, neglecting the propagation of implicit interaction patterns encoded in edge features. We propose the Edge-to-Edge-Node-to-Node Graph Convolution (E2E-N2N-GCN), a novel dual-graph network that jointly models explicit N2N social interactions among pedestrians and implicit E2E influence propagation across these interaction patterns. Finally, to overcome the limited receptive fields and challenges in capturing long-range dependencies of auto-regressive architectures, we introduce a transformer encoder-based predictor that enables global modeling of temporal correlation. UniEdge outperforms state-of-the-arts on multiple datasets, including ETH, UCY, and SDD.</description>

      <title>Privacy Attacks on Image AutoRegressive Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image autoregressive (IAR) models have surpassed diffusion models (DMs) in both image quality (FID: 1.48 vs. 1.58) and generation speed. However, their privacy risks remain largely unexplored. To address this, we conduct a comprehensive privacy analysis comparing IARs to DMs. We develop a novel membership inference attack (MIA) that achieves a significantly higher success rate in detecting training images (TPR@FPR=1%: 86.38% for IARs vs. 4.91% for DMs). Using this MIA, we perform dataset inference (DI) and find that IARs require as few as six samples to detect dataset membership, compared to 200 for DMs, indicating higher information leakage. Additionally, we extract hundreds of training images from an IAR (e.g., 698 from VAR-d30). Our findings highlight a fundamental privacy-utility trade-off: while IARs excel in generation quality and speed, they are significantly more vulnerable to privacy attacks. This suggests that incorporating techniques from DMs, such as per-token probability modeling using diffusion, could help mitigate IARs' privacy risks. Our code is available at https://github.com/sprintml/privacy_attacks_against_iars.</description>

      <title>Diff9D: Diffusion-Based Domain-Generalized Category-Level 9-DoF Object Pose Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nine-degrees-of-freedom (9-DoF) object pose and size estimation is crucial for enabling augmented reality and robotic manipulation. Category-level methods have received extensive research attention due to their potential for generalization to intra-class unknown objects. However, these methods require manual collection and labeling of large-scale real-world training data. To address this problem, we introduce a diffusion-based paradigm for domain-generalized category-level 9-DoF object pose estimation. Our motivation is to leverage the latent generalization ability of the diffusion model to address the domain generalization challenge in object pose estimation. This entails training the model exclusively on rendered synthetic data to achieve generalization to real-world scenes. We propose an effective diffusion model to redefine 9-DoF object pose estimation from a generative perspective. Our model does not require any 3D shape priors during training or inference. By employing the Denoising Diffusion Implicit Model, we demonstrate that the reverse diffusion process can be executed in as few as 3 steps, achieving near real-time performance. Finally, we design a robotic grasping system comprising both hardware and software components. Through comprehensive experiments on two benchmark datasets and the real-world robotic system, we show that our method achieves state-of-the-art domain generalization performance. Our code will be made public at https://github.com/CNJianLiu/Diff9D.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Quantification for Collaborative Object Detection Under Adversarial Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collaborative Object Detection (COD) and collaborative perception can integrate data or features from various entities, and improve object detection accuracy compared with individual perception. However, adversarial attacks pose a potential threat to the deep learning COD models, and introduce high output uncertainty. With unknown attack models, it becomes even more challenging to improve COD resiliency and quantify the output uncertainty for highly dynamic perception scenes such as autonomous vehicles. In this study, we propose the Trusted Uncertainty Quantification in Collaborative Perception framework (TUQCP). TUQCP leverages both adversarial training and uncertainty quantification techniques to enhance the adversarial robustness of existing COD models. More specifically, TUQCP first adds perturbations to the shared information of randomly selected agents during object detection collaboration by adversarial training. TUQCP then alleviates the impacts of adversarial attacks by providing output uncertainty estimation through learning-based module and uncertainty calibration through conformal prediction. Our framework works for early and intermediate collaboration COD models and single-agent object detection models. We evaluate TUQCP on V2X-Sim, a comprehensive collaborative perception dataset for autonomous driving, and demonstrate a 80.41% improvement in object detection accuracy compared to the baselines under the same adversarial attacks. TUQCP demonstrates the importance of uncertainty quantification to COD under adversarial attacks.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We tackle open-vocabulary 3D scene understanding by introducing a novel data generation pipeline and training framework. Our method addresses three critical requirements for effective training: precise 3D region segmentation, comprehensive textual descriptions, and sufficient dataset scale. By leveraging state-of-the-art open-vocabulary image segmentation models and region-aware Vision-Language Models, we develop an automatic pipeline that generates high-quality 3D mask-text pairs. Applying this pipeline to multiple 3D scene datasets, we create Mosaic3D-5.6M, a dataset of over 30K annotated scenes with 5.6M mask-text pairs, significantly larger than existing datasets. Building upon this data, we propose Mosaic3D, a foundation model combining a 3D encoder trained with contrastive learning and a lightweight mask decoder for open-vocabulary 3D semantic and instance segmentation. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on open-vocabulary 3D semantic and instance segmentation tasks including ScanNet200, Matterport3D, and ScanNet++, with ablation studies validating the effectiveness of our large-scale training data.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Expected Possession Value in Football: Introducing a Benchmark, U-Net Architecture, and Reward and Risk for Passes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces the first Expected Possession Value (EPV) benchmark and a new and improved EPV model for football. Through the introduction of the OJN-Pass-EPV benchmark, we present a novel method to quantitatively assess the quality of EPV models by using pairs of game states with given relative EPVs. Next, we attempt to replicate the results of Fern\'andez et al. (2021) using a dataset containing Dutch Eredivisie and World Cup matches. Following our failure to do so, we propose a new architecture based on U-net-type convolutional neural networks, achieving good results in model loss and Expected Calibration Error. Finally, we present an improved pass model that incorporates ball height and contains a new dual-component pass value model that analyzes reward and risk. The resulting EPV model correctly identifies the higher value state in 78% of the game state pairs in the OJN-Pass-EPV benchmark, demonstrating its ability to accurately assess goal-scoring potential. Our findings can help assess the quality of EPV models, improve EPV predictions, help assess potential reward and risk of passing decisions, and improve player and team performance.</description>

      <title>Calibrated Multi-Preference Optimization for Aligning Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aligning text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models with preference optimization is valuable for human-annotated datasets, but the heavy cost of manual data collection limits scalability. Using reward models offers an alternative, however, current preference optimization methods fall short in exploiting the rich information, as they only consider pairwise preference distribution. Furthermore, they lack generalization to multi-preference scenarios and struggle to handle inconsistencies between rewards. To address this, we present Calibrated Preference Optimization (CaPO), a novel method to align T2I diffusion models by incorporating the general preference from multiple reward models without human annotated data. The core of our approach involves a reward calibration method to approximate the general preference by computing the expected win-rate against the samples generated by the pretrained models. Additionally, we propose a frontier-based pair selection method that effectively manages the multi-preference distribution by selecting pairs from Pareto frontiers. Finally, we use regression loss to fine-tune diffusion models to match the difference between calibrated rewards of a selected pair. Experimental results show that CaPO consistently outperforms prior methods, such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), in both single and multi-reward settings validated by evaluation on T2I benchmarks, including GenEval and T2I-Compbench.</description>

      <title>COCONut-PanCap: Joint Panoptic Segmentation and Grounded Captions for Fine-Grained Understanding and Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces the COCONut-PanCap dataset, created to enhance panoptic segmentation and grounded image captioning. Building upon the COCO dataset with advanced COCONut panoptic masks, this dataset aims to overcome limitations in existing image-text datasets that often lack detailed, scene-comprehensive descriptions. The COCONut-PanCap dataset incorporates fine-grained, region-level captions grounded in panoptic segmentation masks, ensuring consistency and improving the detail of generated captions. Through human-edited, densely annotated descriptions, COCONut-PanCap supports improved training of vision-language models (VLMs) for image understanding and generative models for text-to-image tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that COCONut-PanCap significantly boosts performance across understanding and generation tasks, offering complementary benefits to large-scale datasets. This dataset sets a new benchmark for evaluating models on joint panoptic segmentation and grounded captioning tasks, addressing the need for high-quality, detailed image-text annotations in multi-modal learning.</description>

      <title>Articulate AnyMesh: Open-Vocabulary 3D Articulated Objects Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D articulated objects modeling has long been a challenging problem, since it requires to capture both accurate surface geometries and semantically meaningful and spatially precise structures, parts, and joints. Existing methods heavily depend on training data from a limited set of handcrafted articulated object categories (e.g., cabinets and drawers), which restricts their ability to model a wide range of articulated objects in an open-vocabulary context. To address these limitations, we propose Articulate Anymesh, an automated framework that is able to convert any rigid 3D mesh into its articulated counterpart in an open-vocabulary manner. Given a 3D mesh, our framework utilizes advanced Vision-Language Models and visual prompting techniques to extract semantic information, allowing for both the segmentation of object parts and the construction of functional joints. Our experiments show that Articulate Anymesh can generate large-scale, high-quality 3D articulated objects, including tools, toys, mechanical devices, and vehicles, significantly expanding the coverage of existing 3D articulated object datasets. Additionally, we show that these generated assets can facilitate the acquisition of new articulated object manipulation skills in simulation, which can then be transferred to a real robotic system.

      <title>Entropy-based measure of rock sample heterogeneity derived from micro-CT images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents an automated method for objectively measuring rock heterogeneity via raw X-ray micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) images, thereby addressing the limitations of traditional methods, which are time-consuming, costly, and subjective. Unlike approaches that rely on image segmentation, the proposed method processes micro-CT images directly, identifying textural heterogeneity. The image is partitioned into subvolumes, where attributes are calculated for each one, with entropy serving as a measure of uncertainty. This method adapts to varying sample characteristics and enables meaningful comparisons across distinct sets of samples. It was applied to a dataset consisting of 4,935 images of cylindrical plug samples derived from Brazilian reservoirs. The results showed that the selected attributes play a key role in producing desirable outcomes, such as strong correlations with structural heterogeneity. To assess the effectiveness of our method, we used evaluations provided by four experts who classified 175 samples as either heterogeneous or homogeneous, where each expert assessed a different number of samples. One of the presented attributes demonstrated a statistically significant difference between the homogeneous and heterogeneous samples labelled by all the experts, whereas the other two attributes yielded nonsignificant differences for three out of the four experts. The method was shown to better align with the expert choices than traditional textural attributes known for extracting heterogeneous properties from images. This textural heterogeneity measure provides an additional parameter that can assist in rock characterization, and the automated approach ensures easy reproduction and high cost-effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Efficient Brain Tumor Classification with Lightweight CNN Architecture: A Novel Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Brain tumor classification using MRI images is critical in medical diagnostics, where early and accurate detection significantly impacts patient outcomes. While recent advancements in deep learning (DL), particularly CNNs, have shown promise, many models struggle with balancing accuracy and computational efficiency and often lack robustness across diverse datasets. To address these challenges, we propose a novel model architecture integrating separable convolutions and squeeze and excitation (SE) blocks, designed to enhance feature extraction while maintaining computational efficiency. Our model further incorporates batch normalization and dropout to prevent overfitting, ensuring stable and reliable performance. The proposed model is lightweight because it uses separable convolutions, which reduce the number of parameters, and incorporates global average pooling instead of fully connected layers to minimize computational complexity while maintaining high accuracy. Our model does better than other models by about 0.5% to 1.0% in accuracy and 1.5% to 2.5% in loss reduction, as shown by many experiments. It has a validation accuracy of 99.22% and a test accuracy of 98.44%. These results highlight the model's ability to generalize effectively across different brain tumour types, offering a robust tools for clinical applications. Our work sets a new benchmark in the field, providing a foundation for future research in optimizing the accuracy and efficiency of DL models for medical image analysis.</description>

      <title>Automated Extraction of Spatio-Semantic Graphs for Identifying Cognitive Impairment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing methods for analyzing linguistic content from picture descriptions for assessment of cognitive-linguistic impairment often overlook the participant's visual narrative path, which typically requires eye tracking to assess. Spatio-semantic graphs are a useful tool for analyzing this narrative path from transcripts alone, however they are limited by the need for manual tagging of content information units (CIUs). In this paper, we propose an automated approach for estimation of spatio-semantic graphs (via automated extraction of CIUs) from the Cookie Theft picture commonly used in cognitive-linguistic analyses. The method enables the automatic characterization of the visual semantic path during picture description. Experiments demonstrate that the automatic spatio-semantic graphs effectively differentiate between cognitively impaired and unimpaired speakers. Statistical analyses reveal that the features derived by the automated method produce comparable results to the manual method, with even greater group differences between clinical groups of interest. These results highlight the potential of the automated approach for extracting spatio-semantic features in developing clinical speech models for cognitive impairment assessment.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Inverse Attention Network with Intrinsic Discriminant Feature Exploitation for Fake News Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal fake news detection has garnered significant attention due to its profound implications for social security. While existing approaches have contributed to understanding cross-modal consistency, they often fail to leverage modal-specific representations and explicit discrepant features. To address these limitations, we propose a Multimodal Inverse Attention Network (MIAN), a novel framework that explores intrinsic discriminative features based on news content to advance fake news detection. Specifically, MIAN introduces a hierarchical learning module that captures diverse intra-modal relationships through local-to-global and local-to-local interactions, thereby generating enhanced unimodal representations to improve the identification of fake news at the intra-modal level. Additionally, a cross-modal interaction module employs a co-attention mechanism to establish and model dependencies between the refined unimodal representations, facilitating seamless semantic integration across modalities. To explicitly extract inconsistency features, we propose an inverse attention mechanism that effectively highlights the conflicting patterns and semantic deviations introduced by fake news in both intra- and inter-modality. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that MIAN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, underscoring its pivotal contribution to advancing social security through enhanced multimodal fake news detection.</description>

      <title>Coarse-to-Fine 3D Keyframe Transporter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in Keyframe Imitation Learning (IL) have enabled learning-based agents to solve a diverse range of manipulation tasks. However, most approaches ignore the rich symmetries in the problem setting and, as a consequence, are sample-inefficient. This work identifies and utilizes the bi-equivariant symmetry within Keyframe IL to design a policy that generalizes to transformations of both the workspace and the objects grasped by the gripper. We make two main contributions: First, we analyze the bi-equivariance properties of the keyframe action scheme and propose a Keyframe Transporter derived from the Transporter Networks, which evaluates actions using cross-correlation between the features of the grasped object and the features of the scene. Second, we propose a computationally efficient coarse-to-fine SE(3) action evaluation scheme for reasoning the intertwined translation and rotation action. The resulting method outperforms strong Keyframe IL baselines by an average of &gt;10% on a wide range of simulation tasks, and by an average of 55% in 4 physical experiments.</description>

      <title>VILP: Imitation Learning with Latent Video Planning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the era of generative AI, integrating video generation models into robotics opens new possibilities for the general-purpose robot agent. This paper introduces imitation learning with latent video planning (VILP). We propose a latent video diffusion model to generate predictive robot videos that adhere to temporal consistency to a good degree. Our method is able to generate highly time-aligned videos from multiple views, which is crucial for robot policy learning. Our video generation model is highly time-efficient. For example, it can generate videos from two distinct perspectives, each consisting of six frames with a resolution of 96x160 pixels, at a rate of 5 Hz. In the experiments, we demonstrate that VILP outperforms the existing video generation robot policy across several metrics: training costs, inference speed, temporal consistency of generated videos, and the performance of the policy. We also compared our method with other imitation learning methods. Our findings indicate that VILP can rely less on extensive high-quality task-specific robot action data while still maintaining robust performance. In addition, VILP possesses robust capabilities in representing multi-modal action distributions. Our paper provides a practical example of how to effectively integrate video generation models into robot policies, potentially offering insights for related fields and directions.

      <title>HeRCULES: Heterogeneous Radar Dataset in Complex Urban Environment for Multi-session Radar SLAM</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, radars have been widely featured in robotics for their robustness in challenging weather conditions. Two commonly used radar types are spinning radars and phased-array radars, each offering distinct sensor characteristics. Existing datasets typically feature only a single type of radar, leading to the development of algorithms limited to that specific kind. In this work, we highlight that combining different radar types offers complementary advantages, which can be leveraged through a heterogeneous radar dataset. Moreover, this new dataset fosters research in multi-session and multi-robot scenarios where robots are equipped with different types of radars. In this context, we introduce the HeRCULES dataset, a comprehensive, multi-modal dataset with heterogeneous radars, FMCW LiDAR, IMU, GPS, and cameras. This is the first dataset to integrate 4D radar and spinning radar alongside FMCW LiDAR, offering unparalleled localization, mapping, and place recognition capabilities. The dataset covers diverse weather and lighting conditions and a range of urban traffic scenarios, enabling a comprehensive analysis across various environments. The sequence paths with multiple revisits and ground truth pose for each sensor enhance its suitability for place recognition research. We expect the HeRCULES dataset to facilitate odometry, mapping, place recognition, and sensor fusion research. The dataset and development tools are available at https://sites.google.com/view/herculesdataset.</description>

      <title>Layer Separation: Adjustable Joint Space Width Images Synthesis in Conventional Radiography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by joint inflammation and progressive structural damage. Joint space width (JSW) is a critical indicator in conventional radiography for evaluating disease progression, which has become a prominent research topic in computer-aided diagnostic (CAD) systems. However, deep learning-based radiological CAD systems for JSW analysis face significant challenges in data quality, including data imbalance, limited variety, and annotation difficulties. This work introduced a challenging image synthesis scenario and proposed Layer Separation Networks (LSN) to accurately separate the soft tissue layer, the upper bone layer, and the lower bone layer in conventional radiographs of finger joints. Using these layers, the adjustable JSW images can be synthesized to address data quality challenges and achieve ground truth (GT) generation. Experimental results demonstrated that LSN-based synthetic images closely resemble real radiographs, and significantly enhanced the performance in downstream tasks. The code and dataset will be available.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models suffer from the huge consumption of time and resources to train. For example, diffusion models need hundreds of GPUs to train for several weeks for a high-resolution generative task to meet the requirements of an extremely large number of iterations and a large batch size. Training diffusion models become a millionaire's game. With limited resources that only fit a small batch size, training a diffusion model always fails. In this paper, we investigate the key reasons behind the difficulties of training diffusion models with limited resources. Through numerous experiments and demonstrations, we identified a major factor: the significant variation in the training losses across different timesteps, which can easily disrupt the progress made in previous iterations. Moreover, different prediction types of $x_0$ exhibit varying effectiveness depending on the task and timestep. We hypothesize that using a mixed-prediction approach to identify the most accurate $x_0$ prediction type could potentially serve as a breakthrough in addressing this issue. In this paper, we outline several challenges and insights, with the hope of inspiring further research aimed at tackling the limitations of training diffusion models with constrained resources, particularly for high-resolution tasks.</description>

      <title>UD-Mamba: A pixel-level uncertainty-driven Mamba model for medical image segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements have highlighted the Mamba framework, a state-space model known for its efficiency in capturing long-range dependencies with linear computational complexity. While Mamba has shown competitive performance in medical image segmentation, it encounters difficulties in modeling local features due to the sporadic nature of traditional location-based scanning methods and the complex, ambiguous boundaries often present in medical images. To overcome these challenges, we propose Uncertainty-Driven Mamba (UD-Mamba), which redefines the pixel-order scanning process by incorporating channel uncertainty into the scanning mechanism. UD-Mamba introduces two key scanning techniques: 1) sequential scanning, which prioritizes regions with high uncertainty by scanning in a row-by-row fashion, and 2) skip scanning, which processes columns vertically, moving from high-to-low or low-to-high uncertainty at fixed intervals. Sequential scanning efficiently clusters high-uncertainty regions, such as boundaries and foreground objects, to improve segmentation precision, while skip scanning enhances the interaction between background and foreground regions, allowing for timely integration of background information to support more accurate foreground inference. Recognizing the advantages of scanning from certain to uncertain areas, we introduce four learnable parameters to balance the importance of features extracted from different scanning methods. Additionally, a cosine consistency loss is employed to mitigate the drawbacks of transitioning between uncertain and certain regions during the scanning process. Our method demonstrates robust segmentation performance, validated across three distinct medical imaging datasets involving pathology, dermatological lesions, and cardiac tasks.</description>

      <title>Efficient Domain Adaptation of Multimodal Embeddings using Constrastive Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in machine learning (ML), natural language processing (NLP), and foundational models have shown promise for real-life applications in critical, albeit compute-constrainted fields like healthcare.
  In such areas, combining foundational models with supervised ML offers potential for automating tasks like diagnosis and treatment planning, but the limited availability of onsite computational resources pose significant challenges before applying these technologies effectively: Current approaches either yield subpar results when using pretrained models without task-specific adaptation, or require substantial computational resources for fine-tuning, which is often a barrier to entry in such environments.
  This renders them inaccessible in applications where performance and quality standards are high, but computational resources are scarce.
  To bridge the gap between best-in-class performance and accessibility, we propose a novel method for adapting foundational, multimodal embeddings to downstream tasks, without the need of expensive fine-tuning processes.
  Our method leverages frozen embeddings from Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Models, and uses contrastive learning to train a small, task-specific nonlinear projection that can be used in the downstream task, without having to fine-tune the original foundational models.
  We show that this efficient procedure leads to significant performance improvements across various downstream tasks, and perhaps more importantly with minimal computational overhead, offering a practical solution for the use of advanced, foundational ML models in resource-constrained settings.</description>

      <title>RAPID: Robust and Agile Planner Using Inverse Reinforcement Learning for Vision-Based Drone Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a learning-based visual planner for agile drone flight in cluttered environments. The proposed planner generates collision-free waypoints in milliseconds, enabling drones to perform agile maneuvers in complex environments without building separate perception, mapping, and planning modules. Learning-based methods, such as behavior cloning (BC) and reinforcement learning (RL), demonstrate promising performance in visual navigation but still face inherent limitations. BC is susceptible to compounding errors due to limited expert imitation, while RL struggles with reward function design and sample inefficiency. To address these limitations, this paper proposes an inverse reinforcement learning (IRL)-based framework for high-speed visual navigation. By leveraging IRL, it is possible to reduce the number of interactions with simulation environments and improve capability to deal with high-dimensional spaces while preserving the robustness of RL policies. A motion primitive-based path planning algorithm collects an expert dataset with privileged map data from diverse environments, ensuring comprehensive scenario coverage. By leveraging both the acquired expert and learner dataset gathered from the agent's interactions with the simulation environments, a robust reward function and policy are learned across diverse states. While the proposed method is trained in a simulation environment only, it can be directly applied to real-world scenarios without additional training or tuning. The performance of the proposed method is validated in both simulation and real-world environments, including forests and various structures. The trained policy achieves an average speed of 7 m/s and a maximum speed of 8.8 m/s in real flight experiments. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to successfully apply an IRL framework for high-speed visual navigation of drones.</description>

      <title>Position Paper: Building Trust in Synthetic Data for Clinical AI</title>

Abstract: Deep generative models and synthetic medical data have shown significant promise in addressing key challenges in healthcare, such as privacy concerns, data bias, and the scarcity of realistic datasets. While research in this area has grown rapidly and demonstrated substantial theoretical potential, its practical adoption in clinical settings remains limited. Despite the benefits synthetic data offers, questions surrounding its reliability and credibility persist, leading to a lack of trust among clinicians. This position paper argues that fostering trust in synthetic medical data is crucial for its clinical adoption. It aims to spark a discussion on the viability of synthetic medical data in clinical practice, particularly in the context of current advancements in AI. We present empirical evidence from brain tumor segmentation to demonstrate that the quality, diversity, and proportion of synthetic data directly impact trust in clinical AI models. Our findings provide insights to improve the deployment and acceptance of synthetic data-driven AI systems in real-world clinical workflows.</description>

      <title>BRIDLE: Generalized Self-supervised Learning with Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-supervised learning has been a powerful approach for learning meaningful representations from unlabeled data across various domains, reducing the reliance on large labeled datasets. Inspired by BERT's success in capturing deep bidirectional contexts in natural language processing, similar frameworks have been adapted to other modalities such as audio, with models like BEATs extending the bidirectional training paradigm to audio signals using vector quantization (VQ). However, these frameworks face challenges, notably their dependence on a single codebook for quantization, which may not capture the complex, multifaceted nature of signals. In addition, inefficiencies in codebook utilization lead to underutilized code vectors. To address these limitations, we introduce BRIDLE (Bidirectional Residual Quantization Interleaved Discrete Learning Encoder), a self-supervised encoder pretraining framework that incorporates residual quantization (RQ) into the bidirectional training process, and is generalized for pretraining with audio, image, and video. Using multiple hierarchical codebooks, RQ enables fine-grained discretization in the latent space, enhancing representation quality. BRIDLE involves an interleaved training procedure between the encoder and tokenizer. We evaluate BRIDLE on audio understanding tasks using classification benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art results, and demonstrate competitive performance on image classification and video classification tasks, showing consistent improvements over traditional VQ methods in downstream performance.</description>

      <title>EditIQ: Automated Cinematic Editing of Static Wide-Angle Videos via Dialogue Interpretation and Saliency Cues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present EditIQ, a completely automated framework for cinematically editing scenes captured via a stationary, large field-of-view and high-resolution camera. From the static camera feed, EditIQ initially generates multiple virtual feeds, emulating a team of cameramen. These virtual camera shots termed rushes are subsequently assembled using an automated editing algorithm, whose objective is to present the viewer with the most vivid scene content. To understand key scene elements and guide the editing process, we employ a two-pronged approach: (1) a large language model (LLM)-based dialogue understanding module to analyze conversational flow, coupled with (2) visual saliency prediction to identify meaningful scene elements and camera shots therefrom. We then formulate cinematic video editing as an energy minimization problem over shot selection, where cinematic constraints determine shot choices, transitions, and continuity. EditIQ synthesizes an aesthetically and visually compelling representation of the original narrative while maintaining cinematic coherence and a smooth viewing experience. Efficacy of EditIQ against competing baselines is demonstrated via a psychophysical study involving twenty participants on the BBC Old School dataset plus eleven theatre performance videos. Video samples from EditIQ can be found at https://editiq-ave.github.io/.</description>

      <title>VLA-Cache: Towards Efficient Vision-Language-Action Model via Adaptive Token Caching in Robotic Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model can process instructions and visual perception to directly generate actions as output in an end-to-end fashion due to its strong multi-modal reasoning capabilities. While the performance of VLA models is promising, their computational cost can be substantial. This raises challenge for applying them on robotics tasks, which requires real-time decision-making to respond quickly to environmental changes. Since robotic control involves sequential decision-making, the visual input often exhibits minimal variation between successive steps. A natural idea is to reuse the computational results of unchanged visual tokens from the last step. Motivated by this idea, we propose VLA-Cache, an efficient vision-language-action model. VLA-Cache incorporates a token-selection mechanism that compares the visual input at each step with the input from the previous step, adaptively identifying visual tokens with minimal changes. The computational results for these unchanged tokens are then reused in subsequent steps via KV-cache, thereby significantly improving the efficiency of the VLA-Cache model. Experimental results on both simulation (e.g., LIBERO benchmark and SIMPLER) and real-world robot valid VLA-Cache can achieve practical acceleration with minimal sacrifice in success rate.</description>

      <title>Deep Ensemble approach for Enhancing Brain Tumor Segmentation in Resource-Limited Settings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Segmentation of brain tumors is a critical step in treatment planning, yet manual segmentation is both time-consuming and subjective, relying heavily on the expertise of radiologists. In Sub-Saharan Africa, this challenge is magnified by overburdened medical systems and limited access to advanced imaging modalities and expert radiologists. Automating brain tumor segmentation using deep learning offers a promising solution. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), especially the U-Net architecture, have shown significant potential. However, a major challenge remains: achieving generalizability across different datasets. This study addresses this gap by developing a deep learning ensemble that integrates UNet3D, V-Net, and MSA-VNet models for the semantic segmentation of gliomas. By initially training on the BraTS-GLI dataset and fine-tuning with the BraTS-SSA dataset, we enhance model performance. Our ensemble approach significantly outperforms individual models, achieving DICE scores of 0.8358 for Tumor Core, 0.8521 for Whole Tumor, and 0.8167 for Enhancing Tumor. These results underscore the potential of ensemble methods in improving the accuracy and reliability of automated brain tumor segmentation, particularly in resource-limited settings.</description>

      <title>Test Time Training for 4D Medical Image Interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 4D medical image interpolation is essential for improving temporal resolution and diagnostic precision in clinical applications. Previous works ignore the problem of distribution shifts, resulting in poor generalization under different distribution. A natural solution would be to adapt the model to a new test distribution, but this cannot be done if the test input comes without a ground truth label. In this paper, we propose a novel test time training framework which uses self-supervision to adapt the model to a new distribution without requiring any labels. Indeed, before performing frame interpolation on each test video, the model is trained on the same instance using a self-supervised task, such as rotation prediction or image reconstruction. We conduct experiments on two publicly available 4D medical image interpolation datasets, Cardiac and 4D-Lung. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieves significant performance across various evaluation metrics on both datasets. It achieves higher peak signal-to-noise ratio values, 33.73dB on Cardiac and 34.02dB on 4D-Lung. Our method not only advances 4D medical image interpolation but also provides a template for domain adaptation in other fields such as image segmentation and image registration.</description>

      <title>Field Matching: an Electrostatic Paradigm to Generate and Transfer Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose Electrostatic Field Matching (EFM), a novel method that is suitable for both generative modeling and distribution transfer tasks. Our approach is inspired by the physics of an electrical capacitor. We place source and target distributions on the capacitor plates and assign them positive and negative charges, respectively. We then learn the electrostatic field of the capacitor using a neural network approximator. To map the distributions to each other, we start at one plate of the capacitor and move the samples along the learned electrostatic field lines until they reach the other plate. We theoretically justify that this approach provably yields the distribution transfer. In practice, we demonstrate the performance of our EFM in toy and image data experiments.</description>

      <title>SAISA: Towards Multimodal Large Language Models with Both Training and Inference Efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) mainly fall into two architectures, each involving a trade-off between training and inference efficiency: embedding space alignment (e.g., LLaVA-1.5) is inefficient during inference, while cross-attention space alignment (e.g., Flamingo) is inefficient in training. In this paper, we compare these two architectures and identify the key factors for building efficient MLLMs. A primary difference between them lies in how attention is applied to visual tokens, particularly in their interactions with each other. To investigate whether attention among visual tokens is necessary, we propose a new self-attention mechanism, NAAViT (\textbf{N}o \textbf{A}ttention \textbf{A}mong \textbf{Vi}sual \textbf{T}okens), which eliminates this type of attention. Our pilot experiment on LLaVA-1.5 shows that attention among visual tokens is highly redundant. Based on these insights, we introduce SAISA (\textbf{S}elf-\textbf{A}ttention \textbf{I}nput \textbf{S}pace \textbf{A}lignment), a novel architecture that enhance both training and inference efficiency. SAISA directly aligns visual features with the input spaces of NAAViT self-attention blocks, reducing computational overhead in both self-attention blocks and feed-forward networks (FFNs). Using the same configuration as LLaVA-1.5, SAISA reduces inference FLOPs by 66\% and training budget by 26\%, while achieving superior performance in terms of accuracy. Comprehensive ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of SAISA across various LLMs and visual encoders. The code and model will be publicly available at https://github.com/icip-cas/SAISA.</description>

      <title>Style transfer as data augmentation: evaluating unpaired image-to-image translation models in mammography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Several studies indicate that deep learning models can learn to detect breast cancer from mammograms (X-ray images of the breasts). However, challenges with overfitting and poor generalisability prevent their routine use in the clinic. Models trained on data from one patient population may not perform well on another due to differences in their data domains, emerging due to variations in scanning technology or patient characteristics. Data augmentation techniques can be used to improve generalisability by expanding the diversity of feature representations in the training data by altering existing examples. Image-to-image translation models are one approach capable of imposing the characteristic feature representations (i.e. style) of images from one dataset onto another. However, evaluating model performance is non-trivial, particularly in the absence of ground truths (a common reality in medical imaging). Here, we describe some key aspects that should be considered when evaluating style transfer algorithms, highlighting the advantages and disadvantages of popular metrics, and important factors to be mindful of when implementing them in practice. We consider two types of generative models: a cycle-consistent generative adversarial network (CycleGAN) and a diffusion-based SynDiff model. We learn unpaired image-to-image translation across three mammography datasets. We highlight that undesirable aspects of model performance may determine the suitability of some metrics, and also provide some analysis indicating the extent to which various metrics assess unique aspects of model performance. We emphasise the need to use several metrics for a comprehensive assessment of model performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep Learning approaches in dermatological image classification have shown promising results, yet the field faces significant methodological challenges that impede proper evaluation. This paper presents a dual contribution: first, a systematic analysis of current methodological practices in skin disease classification research, revealing substantial inconsistencies in data preparation, augmentation strategies, and performance reporting; second, a comprehensive training and evaluation framework demonstrated through experiments with the DINOv2-Large vision transformer across three benchmark datasets (HAM10000, DermNet, ISIC Atlas). The analysis identifies concerning patterns, including pre-split data augmentation and validation-based reporting, potentially leading to overestimated metrics, while highlighting the lack of unified methodology standards. The experimental results demonstrate DINOv2's performance in skin disease classification, achieving macro-averaged F1-scores of 0.85 (HAM10000), 0.71 (DermNet), and 0.84 (ISIC Atlas). Attention map analysis reveals critical patterns in the model's decision-making, showing sophisticated feature recognition in typical presentations but significant vulnerabilities with atypical cases and composite images. Our findings highlight the need for standardized evaluation protocols and careful implementation strategies in clinical settings. We propose comprehensive methodological recommendations for model development, evaluation, and clinical deployment, emphasizing rigorous data preparation, systematic error analysis, and specialized protocols for different image types. To promote reproducibility, we provide our implementation code through GitHub. This work establishes a foundation for rigorous evaluation standards in dermatological image classification and provides insights for responsible AI implementation in clinical dermatology.</description>

      <title>AAD-DCE: An Aggregated Multimodal Attention Mechanism for Early and Late Dynamic Contrast Enhanced Prostate MRI Synthesis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DCE-MRI) is a medical imaging technique that plays a crucial role in the detailed visualization and identification of tissue perfusion in abnormal lesions and radiological suggestions for biopsy. However, DCE-MRI involves the administration of a Gadolinium based (Gad) contrast agent, which is associated with a risk of toxicity in the body. Previous deep learning approaches that synthesize DCE-MR images employ unimodal non-contrast or low-dose contrast MRI images lacking focus on the local perfusion information within the anatomy of interest. We propose AAD-DCE, a generative adversarial network (GAN) with an aggregated attention discriminator module consisting of global and local discriminators. The discriminators provide a spatial embedded attention map to drive the generator to synthesize early and late response DCE-MRI images. Our method employs multimodal inputs - T2 weighted (T2W), Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC), and T1 pre-contrast for image synthesis. Extensive comparative and ablation studies on the ProstateX dataset show that our model (i) is agnostic to various generator benchmarks and (ii) outperforms other DCE-MRI synthesis approaches with improvement margins of +0.64 dB PSNR, +0.0518 SSIM, -0.015 MAE for early response and +0.1 dB PSNR, +0.0424 SSIM, -0.021 MAE for late response, and (ii) emphasize the importance of attention ensembling.

      <title>Particle Trajectory Representation Learning with Masked Point Modeling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effective self-supervised learning (SSL) techniques have been key to unlocking large datasets for representation learning. While many promising methods have been developed using online corpora and captioned photographs, their application to scientific domains, where data encodes highly specialized knowledge, remains in its early stages. We present a self-supervised masked modeling framework for 3D particle trajectory analysis in Time Projection Chambers (TPCs). These detectors produce globally sparse (&lt;1% occupancy) but locally dense point clouds, capturing meter-scale particle trajectories at millimeter resolution. Starting with PointMAE, this work proposes volumetric tokenization to group sparse ionization points into resolution-agnostic patches, as well as an auxiliary energy infilling task to improve trajectory semantics. This approach -- which we call Point-based Liquid Argon Masked Autoencoder (PoLAr-MAE) -- achieves 99.4% track and 97.7% shower classification F-scores, matching that of supervised baselines without any labeled data. While the model learns rich particle trajectory representations, it struggles with sub-token phenomena like overlapping or short-lived particle trajectories. To support further research, we release PILArNet-M -- the largest open LArTPC dataset (1M+ events, 5.2B labeled points) -- to advance SSL in high energy physics (HEP).

      <description>arXiv:2502.02562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce STRING: Separable Translationally Invariant Position Encodings. STRING extends Rotary Position Encodings, a recently proposed and widely used algorithm in large language models, via a unifying theoretical framework. Importantly, STRING still provides exact translation invariance, including token coordinates of arbitrary dimensionality, whilst maintaining a low computational footprint. These properties are especially important in robotics, where efficient 3D token representation is key. We integrate STRING into Vision Transformers with RGB(-D) inputs (color plus optional depth), showing substantial gains, e.g. in open-vocabulary object detection and for robotics controllers. We complement our experiments with a rigorous mathematical analysis, proving the universality of our methods.</description>

      <title>Getting More Juice Out of Your Data: Hard Pair Refinement Enhances Visual-Language Models Without Extra Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.05208v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) has become the standard for cross-modal image-text representation learning. Improving CLIP typically requires additional data and retraining with new loss functions, but these demands raise resource and time costs, limiting practical use. In this work, we introduce HELIP, a cost-effective strategy that improves CLIP models by exploiting challenging text-image pairs within existing datasets in continuous training. This eliminates the need for additional data or extensive retraining. Moreover, HELIP integrates effortlessly into current training pipelines with minimal code modifications, allowing for quick and seamless implementation. On comprehensive benchmarks, HELIP consistently boosts existing models. In particular, within just two epochs of training, it improves zero-shot classification accuracy on ImageNet for SLIP models pre-trained on CC3M, CC12M, and YFCC15M datasets by 3.05%, 4.47%, and 10.1% , respectively. In addition, on fine-grained classification datasets, HELIP improves the zero-shot performance of CLIP and SLIP by an average of 8.4% and 18.6%, and their linear probe performance by an average of 9.5% and 3.0%.

      <title>SAMPro3D: Locating SAM Prompts in 3D for Zero-Shot Instance Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17707v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce SAMPro3D for zero-shot instance segmentation of 3D scenes. Given the 3D point cloud and multiple posed RGB-D frames of 3D scenes, our approach segments 3D instances by applying the pretrained Segment Anything Model (SAM) to 2D frames. Our key idea involves locating SAM prompts in 3D to align their projected pixel prompts across frames, ensuring the view consistency of SAM-predicted masks. Moreover, we suggest selecting prompts from the initial set guided by the information of SAM-predicted masks across all views, which enhances the overall performance. We further propose to consolidate different prompts if they are segmenting different surface parts of the same 3D instance, bringing a more comprehensive segmentation. Notably, our method does not require any additional training. Extensive experiments on diverse benchmarks show that our method achieves comparable or better performance compared to previous zero-shot or fully supervised approaches, and in many cases surpasses human annotations. Furthermore, since our fine-grained predictions often lack annotations in available datasets, we present ScanNet200-Fine50 test data which provides fine-grained annotations on 50 scenes from ScanNet200 dataset.

      <title>Monocular Per-Object Distance Estimation with Masked Object Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03191v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Per-object distance estimation is critical in surveillance and autonomous driving, where safety is crucial. While existing methods rely on geometric or deep supervised features, only a few attempts have been made to leverage self-supervised learning. In this respect, our paper draws inspiration from Masked Image Modeling (MiM) and extends it to multi-object tasks. While MiM focuses on extracting global image-level representations, it struggles with individual objects within the image. This is detrimental for distance estimation, as objects far away correspond to negligible portions of the image. Conversely, our strategy, termed Masked Object Modeling (MoM), enables a novel application of masking techniques. In a few words, we devise an auxiliary objective that reconstructs the portions of the image pertaining to the objects detected in the scene. The training phase is performed in a single unified stage, simultaneously optimizing the masking objective and the downstream loss (i.e., distance estimation).
  We evaluate the effectiveness of MoM on a novel reference architecture (DistFormer) on the standard KITTI, NuScenes, and MOTSynth datasets. Our evaluation reveals that our framework surpasses the SoTA and highlights its robust regularization properties. The MoM strategy enhances both zero-shot and few-shot capabilities, from synthetic to real domain. Finally, it furthers the robustness of the model in the presence of occluded or poorly detected objects. Code is available at https://github.com/apanariello4/DistFormer</description>

Abstract: Person re-identification (Re-ID) is an important task and has significant applications for public security and information forensics, which has progressed rapidly with the development of deep learning. In this work, we investigate a novel and challenging setting of Re-ID, i.e., cross-domain video-based person Re-ID. Specifically, we utilize synthetic video datasets as the source domain for training and real-world videos for testing, notably reducing the reliance on expensive real data acquisition and annotation. To harness the potential of synthetic data, we first propose a self-supervised domain-invariant feature learning strategy for both static and dynamic (temporal) features. Additionally, to enhance person identification accuracy in the target domain, we propose a mean-teacher scheme incorporating a self-supervised ID consistency loss. Experimental results across five real datasets validate the rationale behind cross-synthetic-real domain adaptation and demonstrate the efficacy of our method. Notably, the discovery that synthetic data outperforms real data in the cross-domain scenario is a surprising outcome. The code and data are publicly available at https://github.com/XiangqunZhang/UDA_Video_ReID.</description>

      <title>GaussNav: Gaussian Splatting for Visual Navigation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11625v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In embodied vision, Instance ImageGoal Navigation (IIN) requires an agent to locate a specific object depicted in a goal image within an unexplored environment. The primary challenge of IIN arises from the need to recognize the target object across varying viewpoints while ignoring potential distractors. Existing map-based navigation methods typically use Bird's Eye View (BEV) maps, which lack detailed texture representation of a scene. Consequently, while BEV maps are effective for semantic-level visual navigation, they are struggling for instance-level tasks. To this end, we propose a new framework for IIN, Gaussian Splatting for Visual Navigation (GaussNav), which constructs a novel map representation based on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). The GaussNav framework enables the agent to memorize both the geometry and semantic information of the scene, as well as retain the textural features of objects. By matching renderings of similar objects with the target, the agent can accurately identify, ground, and navigate to the specified object. Our GaussNav framework demonstrates a significant performance improvement, with Success weighted by Path Length (SPL) increasing from 0.347 to 0.578 on the challenging Habitat-Matterport 3D (HM3D) dataset.

      <title>DREAM: Improving Video-Text Retrieval Through Relevance-Based Augmentation Using Large Foundation Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05083v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent progress in video-text retrieval has been driven largely by advancements in model architectures and training strategies. However, the representation learning capabilities of videotext retrieval models remain constrained by lowquality and limited training data annotations. To address this issue, we present a novel ViDeoText Retrieval Paradigm with RElevance-based AugMentation, namely DREAM, which enhances video and text data using large foundation models to learn more generalized features. Specifically, we first adopt a simple augmentation method, which generates self-similar data by randomly duplicating or dropping subwords and frames. In addition, inspired by the recent advancement in visual and language generative models, we propose a more robust augmentation method through textual paraphrasing and video stylization using large language models (LLMs) and visual generative models (VGMs). To further enrich video and text information, we propose a relevance-based augmentation method, where LLMs and VGMs generate and integrate new relevant information into the original data. Leveraging this enriched data, extensive experiments on several video-text retrieval benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of DREAM over existing methods.</description>

      <title>EALD-MLLM: Emotion Analysis in Long-sequential and De-identity videos with Multi-modal Large Language Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00574v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Emotion AI is the ability of computers to understand human emotional states. Existing works have achieved promising progress, but two limitations remain to be solved: 1) Previous studies have been more focused on short sequential video emotion analysis while overlooking long sequential video. However, the emotions in short sequential videos only reflect instantaneous emotions, which may be deliberately guided or hidden. In contrast, long sequential videos can reveal authentic emotions; 2) Previous studies commonly utilize various signals such as facial, speech, and even sensitive biological signals (e.g., electrocardiogram). However, due to the increasing demand for privacy, developing Emotion AI without relying on sensitive signals is becoming important. To address the aforementioned limitations, in this paper, we construct a dataset for Emotion Analysis in Long-sequential and De-identity videos called EALD by collecting and processing the sequences of athletes' post-match interviews. In addition to providing annotations of the overall emotional state of each video, we also provide the Non-Facial Body Language (NFBL) annotations for each player. NFBL is an inner-driven emotional expression and can serve as an identity-free clue to understanding the emotional state. Moreover, we provide a simple but effective baseline for further research. More precisely, we evaluate the Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with de-identification signals (e.g., visual, speech, and NFBLs) to perform emotion analysis. Our experimental results demonstrate that: 1) MLLMs can achieve comparable, even better performance than the supervised single-modal models, even in a zero-shot scenario; 2) NFBL is an important cue in long sequential emotion analysis. EALD will be available on the open-source platform.</description>

      <title>Towards Accurate Post-Training Quantization of Vision Transformers via Error Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06794v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) for vision transformers (ViTs) has received increasing attention from both academic and industrial communities due to its minimal data needs and high time efficiency. However, many current methods fail to account for the complex interactions between quantized weights and activations, resulting in significant quantization errors and suboptimal performance. This paper presents ERQ, an innovative two-step PTQ method specifically crafted to reduce quantization errors arising from activation and weight quantization sequentially. The first step, Activation quantization error reduction (Aqer), first applies Reparameterization Initialization aimed at mitigating initial quantization errors in high-variance activations. Then, it further mitigates the errors by formulating a Ridge Regression problem, which updates the weights maintained at full-precision using a closed-form solution. The second step, Weight quantization error reduction (Wqer), first applies Dual Uniform Quantization to handle weights with numerous outliers, which arise from adjustments made during Reparameterization Initialization, thereby reducing initial weight quantization errors. Then, it employs an iterative approach to further tackle the errors. In each iteration, it adopts Rounding Refinement that uses an empirically derived, efficient proxy to refine the rounding directions of quantized weights, complemented by a Ridge Regression solver to reduce the errors. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate ERQ's superior performance across various ViTs variants and tasks. For example, ERQ surpasses the state-of-the-art GPTQ by a notable 36.81% in accuracy for W3A4 ViT-S. Our codes are available at https://github.com/zysxmu/ERQ.</description>

      <title>Unity in Diversity: Multi-expert Knowledge Confrontation and Collaboration for Generalizable Vehicle Re-identification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07351v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generalizable vehicle re-identification (ReID) seeks to develop models that can adapt to unknown target domains without the need for additional fine-tuning or retraining. Previous works have mainly focused on extracting domain-invariant features by aligning data distributions between source domains. However, interfered by the inherent domain-related redundancy in the source images, solely relying on common features is insufficient for accurately capturing the complementary features with lower occurrence probability and smaller energy. To solve this unique problem, we propose a two-stage Multi-expert Knowledge Confrontation and Collaboration (MiKeCoCo) method, which fully leverages the high-level semantics of Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) to obtain a diversified prompt set and achieve complementary feature representations. Specifically, this paper first designs a Spectrum-based Transformation for Redundancy Elimination and Augmentation Module (STREAM) through simple image preprocessing to obtain two types of image inputs for the training process. Since STREAM eliminates domain-related redundancy in source images, it enables the model to pay closer attention to the detailed prompt set that is crucial for distinguishing fine-grained vehicles. This learned prompt set related to the vehicle identity is then utilized to guide the comprehensive representation learning of complementary features for final knowledge fusion and identity recognition. Inspired by the unity principle, MiKeCoCo integrates the diverse evaluation ways of experts to ensure the accuracy and consistency of ReID. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.</description>

      <title>PhysPart: Physically Plausible Part Completion for Interactable Objects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13724v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interactable objects are ubiquitous in our daily lives. Recent advances in 3D generative models make it possible to automate the modeling of these objects, benefiting a range of applications from 3D printing to the creation of robot simulation environments. However, while significant progress has been made in modeling 3D shapes and appearances, modeling object physics, particularly for interactable objects, remains challenging due to the physical constraints imposed by inter-part motions. In this paper, we tackle the problem of physically plausible part completion for interactable objects, aiming to generate 3D parts that not only fit precisely into the object but also allow smooth part motions. To this end, we propose a diffusion-based part generation model that utilizes geometric conditioning through classifier-free guidance and formulates physical constraints as a set of stability and mobility losses to guide the sampling process. Additionally, we demonstrate the generation of dependent parts, paving the way toward sequential part generation for objects with complex part-whole hierarchies. Experimentally, we introduce a new metric for measuring physical plausibility based on motion success rates. Our model outperforms existing baselines over shape and physical metrics, especially those that do not adequately model physical constraints. We also demonstrate our applications in 3D printing, robot manipulation, and sequential part generation, showing our strength in realistic tasks with the demand for high physical plausibility.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14343v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work presents the INBD network proposed by Gillert et al. in CVPR-2023 and studies its application for delineating tree rings in RGB images of Pinus taeda cross sections captured by a smartphone (UruDendro dataset), which are images with different characteristics from the ones used to train the method. The INBD network operates in two stages: first, it segments the background, pith, and ring boundaries. In the second stage, the image is transformed into polar coordinates, and ring boundaries are iteratively segmented from the pith to the bark. Both stages are based on the U-Net architecture. The method achieves an F-Score of 77.5, a mAR of 0.540, and an ARAND of 0.205 on the evaluation set. The code for the experiments is available at https://github.com/hmarichal93/mlbrief_inbd.</description>

      <title>VisionTS: Visual Masked Autoencoders Are Free-Lunch Zero-Shot Time Series Forecasters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.17253v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Foundation models have emerged as a promising approach in time series forecasting (TSF). Existing approaches either repurpose large language models (LLMs) or build large-scale time series datasets to develop TSF foundation models for universal forecasting. However, these methods face challenges due to the severe cross-domain gap or in-domain heterogeneity. This paper explores a new road to building a TSF foundation model from rich, high-quality natural images. Our key insight is that a visual masked autoencoder, pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset, can naturally be a numeric series forecaster. By reformulating TSF as an image reconstruction task, we bridge the gap between image pre-training and TSF downstream tasks. Surprisingly, without further adaptation in the time series domain, the proposed VisionTS could achieve better zero-shot forecast performance than existing TSF foundation models. With fine-tuning for one epoch, VisionTS could further improve the forecasting and achieve state-of-the-art performance in most cases. Extensive experiments reveal intrinsic similarities between images and real-world time series, suggesting that visual models may offer a "free lunch" for TSF and highlight the potential for future cross-modality research. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/Keytoyze/VisionTS.</description>

      <title>$\epsilon$-VAE: Denoising as Visual Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04081v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In generative modeling, tokenization simplifies complex data into compact, structured representations, creating a more efficient, learnable space. For high-dimensional visual data, it reduces redundancy and emphasizes key features for high-quality generation. Current visual tokenization methods rely on a traditional autoencoder framework, where the encoder compresses data into latent representations, and the decoder reconstructs the original input. In this work, we offer a new perspective by proposing denoising as decoding, shifting from single-step reconstruction to iterative refinement. Specifically, we replace the decoder with a diffusion process that iteratively refines noise to recover the original image, guided by the latents provided by the encoder. We evaluate our approach by assessing both reconstruction (rFID) and generation quality (FID), comparing it to state-of-the-art autoencoding approaches. By adopting iterative reconstruction through diffusion, our autoencoder, namely $\epsilon$-VAE, achieves high reconstruction quality, which in turn enhances downstream generation quality by 22% and provides 2.3$\times$ inference speedup. We hope this work offers new insights into integrating iterative generation and autoencoding for improved compression and generation.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel method (GLOV) enabling Large Language Models (LLMs) to act as implicit Optimizers for Vision-Langugage Models (VLMs) to enhance downstream vision tasks. Our GLOV meta-prompts an LLM with the downstream task description, querying it for suitable VLM prompts (e.g., for zero-shot classification with CLIP). These prompts are ranked according to a purity measure obtained through a fitness function. In each respective optimization step, the ranked prompts are fed as in-context examples (with their accuracies) to equip the LLM with the knowledge of the type of text prompts preferred by the downstream VLM. Furthermore, we also explicitly steer the LLM generation process in each optimization step by specifically adding an offset difference vector of the embeddings from the positive and negative solutions found by the LLM, in previous optimization steps, to the intermediate layer of the network for the next generation step. This offset vector steers the LLM generation toward the type of language preferred by the downstream VLM, resulting in enhanced performance on the downstream vision tasks. We comprehensively evaluate our GLOV on 16 diverse datasets using two families of VLMs, i.e., dual-encoder (e.g., CLIP) and encoder-decoder (e.g., LLaVa) models -- showing that the discovered solutions can enhance the recognition performance by up to 15.0% and 57.5% (3.8% and 21.6% on average) for these models.</description>

      <title>VideoWebArena: Evaluating Long Context Multimodal Agents with Video Understanding Web Tasks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19100v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Videos are often used to learn or extract the necessary information to complete tasks in ways different than what text and static imagery alone can provide. However, many existing agent benchmarks neglect long-context video understanding, instead focusing on text or static image inputs. To bridge this gap, we introduce VideoWebArena (VideoWA), a benchmark for evaluating the capabilities of long-context multimodal agents for video understanding. VideoWA consists of 2,021 web agent tasks based on manually crafted video tutorials, which total almost four hours of content. For our benchmark, we define a taxonomy of long-context video-based agent tasks with two main areas of focus: skill retention and factual retention. While skill retention tasks evaluate whether an agent can use a given human demonstration to complete a task efficiently, the factual retention task evaluates whether an agent can retrieve instruction-relevant information from a video to complete a task. We find that the best model achieves 13.3% success on factual retention tasks and 45.8% on factual retention QA pairs, far below human performance at 73.9% and 79.3%, respectively. On skill retention tasks, long-context models perform worse with tutorials than without, exhibiting a 5% performance decrease in WebArena tasks and a 10.3% decrease in VisualWebArena tasks. Our work highlights the need to improve the agentic abilities of long-context multimodal models and provides a testbed for future development with long-context video agents.</description>

      <title>Constant Rate Schedule: Constant-Rate Distributional Change for Efficient Training and Sampling in Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12188v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a noise schedule that ensures a constant rate of change in the probability distribution of diffused data throughout the diffusion process. To obtain this schedule, we measure the probability-distributional change of diffused data by simulating the forward process and use it to determine the noise schedule before training diffusion models. The functional form of the noise schedule is automatically determined and tailored to each dataset and type of diffusion model, such as pixel space or latent space. We evaluate the effectiveness of our noise schedule on unconditional and class-conditional image generation tasks using the LSUN (Bedroom, Church, Cat, Horse), ImageNet, and FFHQ datasets. Through extensive experiments, we confirmed that our noise schedule broadly improves the performance of the pixel-space and latent-space diffusion models regardless of the dataset, sampler, and number of function evaluations.</description>

      <title>PaRCE: Probabilistic and Reconstruction-based Competency Estimation for CNN-based Image Classification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16715v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are extremely popular and effective for image classification tasks but tend to be overly confident in their predictions. Various works have sought to quantify uncertainty associated with these models, detect out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs, or identify anomalous regions in an image, but limited work has sought to develop a holistic approach that can accurately estimate perception model confidence across various sources of uncertainty. We develop a probabilistic and reconstruction-based competency estimation (PaRCE) method and compare it to existing approaches for uncertainty quantification and OOD detection. We find that our method can best distinguish between correctly classified, misclassified, and OOD samples with anomalous regions, as well as between samples with visual image modifications resulting in high, medium, and low prediction accuracy. We describe how to extend our approach for anomaly localization tasks and demonstrate the ability of our approach to distinguish between regions in an image that are familiar to the perception model from those that are unfamiliar. We find that our method generates interpretable scores that most reliably capture a holistic notion of perception model confidence.</description>

      <title>Towards Pixel-Level Prediction for Gaze Following: Benchmark and Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00309v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Following the gaze of other people and analyzing the target they are looking at can help us understand what they are thinking, and doing, and predict the actions that may follow. Existing methods for gaze following struggle to perform well in natural scenes with diverse objects, and focus on gaze points rather than objects, making it difficult to deliver clear semantics and accurate scope of the targets. To address this shortcoming, we propose a novel gaze target prediction solution named GazeSeg, that can fully utilize the spatial visual field of the person as guiding information and lead to a progressively coarse-to-fine gaze target segmentation and recognition process. Specifically, a prompt-based visual foundation model serves as the encoder, working in conjunction with three distinct decoding modules (e.g. FoV perception, heatmap generation, and segmentation) to form the framework for gaze target prediction. Then, with the head bounding box performed as an initial prompt, GazeSeg obtains the FoV map, heatmap, and segmentation map progressively, leading to a unified framework for multiple tasks (e.g. direction estimation, gaze target segmentation, and recognition). In particular, to facilitate this research, we construct and release a new dataset, comprising 72k images with pixel-level annotations and 270 categories of gaze targets, built upon the GazeFollow dataset. The quantitative evaluation shows that our approach achieves the Dice of 0.325 in gaze target segmentation and 71.7% top-5 recognition. Meanwhile, our approach also outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods, achieving 0.953 in AUC on the gaze-following task. The dataset and code will be released.</description>

      <title>ControlFace: Harnessing Facial Parametric Control for Face Rigging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01160v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Manipulation of facial images to meet specific controls such as pose, expression, and lighting, also known as face rigging, is a complex task in computer vision. Existing methods are limited by their reliance on image datasets, which necessitates individual-specific fine-tuning and limits their ability to retain fine-grained identity and semantic details, reducing practical usability. To overcome these limitations, we introduce ControlFace, a novel face rigging method conditioned on 3DMM renderings that enables flexible, high-fidelity control. We employ a dual-branch U-Nets: one, referred to as FaceNet, captures identity and fine details, while the other focuses on generation. To enhance control precision, the control mixer module encodes the correlated features between the target-aligned control and reference-aligned control, and a novel guidance method, reference control guidance, steers the generation process for better control adherence. By training on a facial video dataset, we fully utilize FaceNet's rich representations while ensuring control adherence. Extensive experiments demonstrate ControlFace's superior performance in identity preservation and control precision, highlighting its practicality.

      <title>Action-based image editing guided by human instructions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04558v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Text-based image editing is typically approached as a static task that involves operations such as inserting, deleting, or modifying elements of an input image based on human instructions. Given the static nature of this task, in this paper, we aim to make this task dynamic by incorporating actions. By doing this, we intend to modify the positions or postures of objects in the image to depict different actions while maintaining the visual properties of the objects. To implement this challenging task, we propose a new model that is sensitive to action text instructions by learning to recognize contrastive action discrepancies. The model training is done on new datasets defined by extracting frames from videos that show the visual scenes before and after an action. We show substantial improvements in image editing using action-based text instructions and high reasoning capabilities that allow our model to use the input image as a starting scene for an action while generating a new image that shows the final scene of the action.</description>

      <title>Ranking-aware adapter for text-driven image ordering with CLIP</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06760v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant progress in downstream tasks that require quantitative concepts such as facial age estimation and image quality assessment, enabling VLMs to explore applications like image ranking and retrieval. However, existing studies typically focus on the reasoning based on a single image and heavily depend on text prompting, limiting their ability to learn comprehensive understanding from multiple images. To address this, we propose an effective yet efficient approach that reframes the CLIP model into a learning-to-rank task and introduces a lightweight adapter to augment CLIP for text-guided image ranking. Specifically, our approach incorporates learnable prompts to adapt to new instructions for ranking purposes and an auxiliary branch with ranking-aware attention, leveraging text-conditioned visual differences for additional supervision in image ranking. Our ranking-aware adapter consistently outperforms fine-tuned CLIPs on various tasks and achieves competitive results compared to state-of-the-art models designed for specific tasks like facial age estimation and image quality assessment. Overall, our approach primarily focuses on ranking images with a single instruction, which provides a natural and generalized way of learning from visual differences across images, bypassing the need for extensive text prompts tailored to individual tasks.

      <title>Efficient 3D Recognition with Event-driven Spike Sparse Convolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07360v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) provide an energy-efficient way to extract 3D spatio-temporal features. Point clouds are sparse 3D spatial data, which suggests that SNNs should be well-suited for processing them. However, when applying SNNs to point clouds, they often exhibit limited performance and fewer application scenarios. We attribute this to inappropriate preprocessing and feature extraction methods. To address this issue, we first introduce the Spike Voxel Coding (SVC) scheme, which encodes the 3D point clouds into a sparse spike train space, reducing the storage requirements and saving time on point cloud preprocessing. Then, we propose a Spike Sparse Convolution (SSC) model for efficiently extracting 3D sparse point cloud features. Combining SVC and SSC, we design an efficient 3D SNN backbone (E-3DSNN), which is friendly with neuromorphic hardware. For instance, SSC can be implemented on neuromorphic chips with only minor modifications to the addressing function of vanilla spike convolution. Experiments on ModelNet40, KITTI, and Semantic KITTI datasets demonstrate that E-3DSNN achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results with remarkable efficiency. Notably, our E-3DSNN (1.87M) obtained 91.7\% top-1 accuracy on ModelNet40, surpassing the current best SNN baselines (14.3M) by 3.0\%. To our best knowledge, it is the first direct training 3D SNN backbone that can simultaneously handle various 3D computer vision tasks (e.g., classification, detection, and segmentation) with an event-driven nature.

      <title>DCBM: Data-Efficient Visual Concept Bottleneck Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11576v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) enhance the interpretability of neural networks by basing predictions on human-understandable concepts. However, current CBMs typically rely on concept sets extracted from large language models or extensive image corpora, limiting their effectiveness in data-sparse scenarios. We propose Data-efficient CBMs (DCBMs), which reduce the need for large sample sizes during concept generation while preserving interpretability. DCBMs define concepts as image regions detected by segmentation or detection foundation models, allowing each image to generate multiple concepts across different granularities. This removes reliance on textual descriptions and large-scale pre-training, making DCBMs applicable for fine-grained classification and out-of-distribution tasks. Attribution analysis using Grad-CAM demonstrates that DCBMs deliver visual concepts that can be localized in test images. By leveraging dataset-specific concepts instead of predefined ones, DCBMs enhance adaptability to new domains.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11638v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, zero-shot methods like InstantID have revolutionized identity-preserving generation. Unlike multi-image finetuning approaches such as DreamBooth, these zero-shot methods leverage powerful facial encoders to extract identity information from a single portrait photo, enabling efficient identity-preserving generation through a single inference pass. However, this convenience introduces new threats to the facial identity protection. This paper aims to safeguard portrait photos from unauthorized encoder-based customization. We introduce IDProtector, an adversarial noise encoder that applies imperceptible adversarial noise to portrait photos in a single forward pass. Our approach offers universal protection for portraits against multiple state-of-the-art encoder-based methods, including InstantID, IP-Adapter, and PhotoMaker, while ensuring robustness to common image transformations such as JPEG compression, resizing, and affine transformations. Experiments across diverse portrait datasets and generative models reveal that IDProtector generalizes effectively to unseen data and even closed-source proprietary models.</description>

      <title>Faster Vision Mamba is Rebuilt in Minutes via Merged Token Re-training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12496v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vision Mamba (e.g., Vim) has successfully been integrated into computer vision, and token reduction has yielded promising outcomes in Vision Transformers (ViTs). However, token reduction performs less effectively on Vision Mamba compared to ViTs. Pruning informative tokens in Mamba leads to a high loss of key knowledge and bad performance. This makes it not a good solution for enhancing efficiency in Mamba. Token merging, which preserves more token information than pruning, has demonstrated commendable performance in ViTs. Nevertheless, vanilla merging performance decreases as the reduction ratio increases either, failing to maintain the key knowledge in Mamba. Re-training the token-reduced model enhances the performance of Mamba, by effectively rebuilding the key knowledge. Empirically, pruned Vims only drop up to 0.9% accuracy on ImageNet-1K, recovered by our proposed framework R-MeeTo in our main evaluation. We show how simple and effective the fast recovery can be achieved at minute-level, in particular, a 35.9% accuracy spike over 3 epochs of training on Vim-Ti. Moreover, Vim-Ti/S/B are re-trained within 5/7/17 minutes, and Vim-S only drop 1.3% with 1.2x (up to 1.5x) speed up in inference.</description>

      <title>A Black-Box Evaluation Framework for Semantic Robustness in Bird's Eye View Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13913v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Camera-based Bird's Eye View (BEV) perception models receive increasing attention for their crucial role in autonomous driving, a domain where concerns about the robustness and reliability of deep learning have been raised. While only a few works have investigated the effects of randomly generated semantic perturbations, aka natural corruptions, on the multi-view BEV detection task, we develop a black-box robustness evaluation framework that adversarially optimises three common semantic perturbations: geometric transformation, colour shifting, and motion blur, to deceive BEV models, serving as the first approach in this emerging field. To address the challenge posed by optimising the semantic perturbation, we design a smoothed, distance-based surrogate function to replace the mAP metric and introduce SimpleDIRECT, a deterministic optimisation algorithm that utilises observed slopes to guide the optimisation process. By comparing with randomised perturbation and two optimisation baselines, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Additionally, we provide a benchmark on the semantic robustness of ten recent BEV models. The results reveal that PolarFormer, which emphasises geometric information from multi-view images, exhibits the highest robustness, whereas BEVDet is fully compromised, with its precision reduced to zero.</description>

      <title>SeedVR: Seeding Infinity in Diffusion Transformer Towards Generic Video Restoration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01320v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Video restoration poses non-trivial challenges in maintaining fidelity while recovering temporally consistent details from unknown degradations in the wild. Despite recent advances in diffusion-based restoration, these methods often face limitations in generation capability and sampling efficiency. In this work, we present SeedVR, a diffusion transformer designed to handle real-world video restoration with arbitrary length and resolution. The core design of SeedVR lies in the shifted window attention that facilitates effective restoration on long video sequences. SeedVR further supports variable-sized windows near the boundary of both spatial and temporal dimensions, overcoming the resolution constraints of traditional window attention. Equipped with contemporary practices, including causal video autoencoder, mixed image and video training, and progressive training, SeedVR achieves highly-competitive performance on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks, as well as AI-generated videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate SeedVR's superiority over existing methods for generic video restoration.</description>

      <title>Balanced Multi-view Clustering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02564v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-view clustering (MvC) aims to integrate information from different views to enhance the capability of the model in capturing the underlying data structures. The widely used joint training paradigm in MvC is potentially not fully leverage the multi-view information, since the imbalanced and under-optimized view-specific features caused by the uniform learning objective for all views. For instance, particular views with more discriminative information could dominate the learning process in the joint training paradigm, leading to other views being under-optimized. To alleviate this issue, we first analyze the imbalanced phenomenon in the joint-training paradigm of multi-view clustering from the perspective of gradient descent for each view-specific feature extractor. Then, we propose a novel balanced multi-view clustering (BMvC) method, which introduces a view-specific contrastive regularization (VCR) to modulate the optimization of each view. Concretely, VCR preserves the sample similarities captured from the joint features and view-specific ones into the clustering distributions corresponding to view-specific features to enhance the learning process of view-specific feature extractors. Additionally, a theoretical analysis is provided to illustrate that VCR adaptively modulates the magnitudes of gradients for updating the parameters of view-specific feature extractors to achieve a balanced multi-view learning procedure. In such a manner, BMvC achieves a better trade-off between the exploitation of view-specific patterns and the exploration of view-invariance patterns to fully learn the multi-view information for the clustering task. Finally, a set of experiments are conducted to verify the superiority of the proposed method compared with state-of-the-art approaches on eight benchmark MvC datasets.</description>

      <title>TexHOI: Reconstructing Textures of 3D Unknown Objects in Monocular Hand-Object Interaction Scenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03525v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reconstructing 3D models of dynamic, real-world objects with high-fidelity textures from monocular frame sequences has been a challenging problem in recent years. This difficulty stems from factors such as shadows, indirect illumination, and inaccurate object-pose estimations due to occluding hand-object interactions. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach that predicts the hand's impact on environmental visibility and indirect illumination on the object's surface albedo. Our method first learns the geometry and low-fidelity texture of the object, hand, and background through composite rendering of radiance fields. Simultaneously, we optimize the hand and object poses to achieve accurate object-pose estimations. We then refine physics-based rendering parameters - including roughness, specularity, albedo, hand visibility, skin color reflections, and environmental illumination - to produce precise albedo, and accurate hand illumination and shadow regions. Our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods in texture reconstruction and, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to account for hand-object interactions in object texture reconstruction.</description>

      <title>ASCENT-ViT: Attention-based Scale-aware Concept Learning Framework for Enhanced Alignment in Vision Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09221v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As Vision Transformers (ViTs) are increasingly adopted in sensitive vision applications, there is a growing demand for improved interpretability. This has led to efforts to forward-align these models with carefully annotated abstract, human-understandable semantic entities - concepts. Concepts provide global rationales to the model predictions and can be quickly understood/intervened on by domain experts. Most current research focuses on designing model-agnostic, plug-and-play generic concept-based explainability modules that do not incorporate the inner workings of foundation models (e.g., inductive biases, scale invariance, etc.) during training. To alleviate this issue for ViTs, in this paper, we propose ASCENT-ViT, an attention-based, concept learning framework that effectively composes scale and position-aware representations from multiscale feature pyramids and ViT patch representations, respectively. Further, these representations are aligned with concept annotations through attention matrices - which incorporate spatial and global (semantic) concepts. ASCENT-ViT can be utilized as a classification head on top of standard ViT backbones for improved predictive performance and accurate and robust concept explanations as demonstrated on five datasets, including three widely used benchmarks (CUB, Pascal APY, Concept-MNIST) and 2 real-world datasets (AWA2, KITS).</description>

      <title>Textoon: Generating Vivid 2D Cartoon Characters from Text Descriptions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10020v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The 2D cartoon style is a prominent art form in digital character creation, particularly popular among younger audiences. While advancements in digital human technology have spurred extensive research into photorealistic digital humans and 3D characters, interactive 2D cartoon characters have received comparatively less attention. Unlike 3D counterparts, which require sophisticated construction and resource-intensive rendering, Live2D, a widely-used format for 2D cartoon characters, offers a more efficient alternative, which allows to animate 2D characters in a manner that simulates 3D movement without the necessity of building a complete 3D model. Furthermore, Live2D employs lightweight HTML5 (H5) rendering, improving both accessibility and efficiency. In this technical report, we introduce Textoon, an innovative method for generating diverse 2D cartoon characters in the Live2D format based on text descriptions. The Textoon leverages cutting-edge language and vision models to comprehend textual intentions and generate 2D appearance, capable of creating a wide variety of stunning and interactive 2D characters within one minute.

      <title>Efficient Attention-Sharing Information Distillation Transformer for Lightweight Single Image Super-Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15774v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transformer-based Super-Resolution (SR) methods have demonstrated superior performance compared to convolutional neural network (CNN)-based SR approaches due to their capability to capture long-range dependencies. However, their high computational complexity necessitates the development of lightweight approaches for practical use. To address this challenge, we propose the Attention-Sharing Information Distillation (ASID) network, a lightweight SR network that integrates attention-sharing and an information distillation structure specifically designed for Transformer-based SR methods. We modify the information distillation scheme, originally designed for efficient CNN operations, to reduce the computational load of stacked self-attention layers, effectively addressing the efficiency bottleneck. Additionally, we introduce attention-sharing across blocks to further minimize the computational cost of self-attention operations. By combining these strategies, ASID achieves competitive performance with existing SR methods while requiring only around 300K parameters - significantly fewer than existing CNN-based and Transformer-based SR models. Furthermore, ASID outperforms state-of-the-art SR methods when the number of parameters is matched, demonstrating its efficiency and effectiveness. The code and supplementary material are available on the project page.</description>

      <title>LoRA-X: Bridging Foundation Models with Training-Free Cross-Model Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16559v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rising popularity of large foundation models has led to a heightened demand for parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods, such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), which offer performance comparable to full model fine-tuning while requiring only a few additional parameters tailored to the specific base model. When such base models are deprecated and replaced, all associated LoRA modules must be retrained, requiring access to either the original training data or a substantial amount of synthetic data that mirrors the original distribution. However, the original data is often inaccessible due to privacy or licensing issues, and generating synthetic data may be impractical and insufficiently representative. These factors complicate the fine-tuning process considerably. To address this challenge, we introduce a new adapter, Cross-Model Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA-X), which enables the training-free transfer of LoRA parameters across source and target models, eliminating the need for original or synthetic training data. Our approach imposes the adapter to operate within the subspace of the source base model. This constraint is necessary because our prior knowledge of the target model is limited to its weights, and the criteria for ensuring the adapter's transferability are restricted to the target base model's weights and subspace. To facilitate the transfer of LoRA parameters of the source model to a target model, we employ the adapter only in the layers of the target model that exhibit an acceptable level of subspace similarity. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of LoRA-X for text-to-image generation, including Stable Diffusion v1.5 and Stable Diffusion XL.</description>

      <title>Contextual Self-paced Learning for Weakly Supervised Spatio-Temporal Video Grounding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17053v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we focus on Weakly Supervised Spatio-Temporal Video Grounding (WSTVG). It is a multimodal task aimed at localizing specific subjects spatio-temporally based on textual queries without bounding box supervision. Motivated by recent advancements in multi-modal foundation models for grounding tasks, we first explore the potential of state-of-the-art object detection models for WSTVG. Despite their robust zero-shot capabilities, our adaptation reveals significant limitations, including inconsistent temporal predictions, inadequate understanding of complex queries, and challenges in adapting to difficult scenarios. We propose CoSPaL (Contextual Self-Paced Learning), a novel approach which is designed to overcome these limitations. CoSPaL integrates three core components: (1) Tubelet Phrase Grounding (TPG), which introduces spatio-temporal prediction by linking textual queries to tubelets; (2) Contextual Referral Grounding (CRG), which improves comprehension of complex queries by extracting contextual information to refine object identification over time; and (3) Self-Paced Scene Understanding (SPS), a training paradigm that progressively increases task difficulty, enabling the model to adapt to complex scenarios by transitioning from coarse to fine-grained understanding.</description>

      <title>INSIGHT: Enhancing Autonomous Driving Safety through Vision-Language Models on Context-Aware Hazard Detection and Edge Case Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00262v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Autonomous driving systems face significant challenges in handling unpredictable edge-case scenarios, such as adversarial pedestrian movements, dangerous vehicle maneuvers, and sudden environmental changes. Current end-to-end driving models struggle with generalization to these rare events due to limitations in traditional detection and prediction approaches. To address this, we propose INSIGHT (Integration of Semantic and Visual Inputs for Generalized Hazard Tracking), a hierarchical vision-language model (VLM) framework designed to enhance hazard detection and edge-case evaluation. By using multimodal data fusion, our approach integrates semantic and visual representations, enabling precise interpretation of driving scenarios and accurate forecasting of potential dangers. Through supervised fine-tuning of VLMs, we optimize spatial hazard localization using attention-based mechanisms and coordinate regression techniques. Experimental results on the BDD100K dataset demonstrate a substantial improvement in hazard prediction straightforwardness and accuracy over existing models, achieving a notable increase in generalization performance. This advancement enhances the robustness and safety of autonomous driving systems, ensuring improved situational awareness and potential decision-making in complex real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>BiMaCoSR: Binary One-Step Diffusion Model Leveraging Flexible Matrix Compression for Real Super-Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00333v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While super-resolution (SR) methods based on diffusion models (DM) have demonstrated inspiring performance, their deployment is impeded due to the heavy request of memory and computation. Recent researchers apply two kinds of methods to compress or fasten the DM. One is to compress the DM into 1-bit, aka binarization, alleviating the storage and computation pressure. The other distills the multi-step DM into only one step, significantly speeding up inference process. Nonetheless, it remains impossible to deploy DM to resource-limited edge devices. To address this problem, we propose BiMaCoSR, which combines binarization and one-step distillation to obtain extreme compression and acceleration. To prevent the catastrophic collapse of the model caused by binarization, we proposed sparse matrix branch (SMB) and low rank matrix branch (LRMB). Both auxiliary branches pass the full-precision (FP) information but in different ways. SMB absorbs the extreme values and its output is high rank, carrying abundant FP information. Whereas, the design of LRMB is inspired by LoRA and is initialized with the top r SVD components, outputting low rank representation. The computation and storage overhead of our proposed branches can be safely ignored. Comprehensive comparison experiments are conducted to exhibit BiMaCoSR outperforms current state-of-the-art binarization methods and gains competitive performance compared with FP one-step model. BiMaCoSR achieves a 23.8x compression ratio and a 27.4x speedup ratio compared to FP counterpart. Our code and model are available at https://github.com/Kai-Liu001/BiMaCoSR.</description>

      <title>Video Latent Flow Matching: Optimal Polynomial Projections for Video Interpolation and Extrapolation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00500v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper considers an efficient video modeling process called Video Latent Flow Matching (VLFM). Unlike prior works, which randomly sampled latent patches for video generation, our method relies on current strong pre-trained image generation models, modeling a certain caption-guided flow of latent patches that can be decoded to time-dependent video frames. We first speculate multiple images of a video are differentiable with respect to time in some latent space. Based on this conjecture, we introduce the HiPPO framework to approximate the optimal projection for polynomials to generate the probability path. Our approach gains the theoretical benefits of the bounded universal approximation error and timescale robustness. Moreover, VLFM processes the interpolation and extrapolation abilities for video generation with arbitrary frame rates. We conduct experiments on several text-to-video datasets to showcase the effectiveness of our method.</description>

      <title>LoR-VP: Low-Rank Visual Prompting for Efficient Vision Model Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00896v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Visual prompting has gained popularity as a method for adapting pre-trained models to specific tasks, particularly in the realm of parameter-efficient tuning. However, existing visual prompting techniques often pad the prompt parameters around the image, limiting the interaction between the visual prompts and the original image to a small set of patches while neglecting the inductive bias present in shared information across different patches. In this study, we conduct a thorough preliminary investigation to identify and address these limitations. We propose a novel visual prompt design, introducing Low-Rank matrix multiplication for Visual Prompting (LoR-VP), which enables shared and patch-specific information across rows and columns of image pixels. Extensive experiments across seven network architectures and four datasets demonstrate significant improvements in both performance and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art visual prompting methods, achieving up to 6 times faster training times, utilizing 18 times fewer visual prompt parameters, and delivering a 3.1% improvement in performance. The code is available as https://github.com/jincan333/LoR-VP.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00954v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rise of vision-language foundation models marks an advancement in bridging the gap between human and machine capabilities in 3D scene reasoning. Existing 3D reasoning benchmarks assume real-time scene accessibility, which is impractical due to the high cost of frequent scene updates. To this end, we introduce Hypothetical 3D Reasoning, namely Hypo3D, a benchmark designed to evaluate models' ability to reason without access to real-time scene data. Models need to imagine the scene state based on a provided change description before reasoning. Hypo3D is formulated as a 3D Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmark, comprising 7,727 context changes across 700 indoor scenes, resulting in 14,885 question-answer pairs. An anchor-based world frame is established for all scenes, ensuring consistent reference to a global frame for directional terms in context changes and QAs. Extensive experiments show that state-of-the-art foundation models struggle to reason in hypothetically changed scenes. This reveals a substantial performance gap compared to humans, particularly in scenarios involving movement changes and directional reasoning. Even when the context change is irrelevant to the question, models often incorrectly adjust their answers.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Conformal Convolution : A Learnable Convolution for Deep Learning on Riemann Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01356v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep learning on non-Euclidean domains is important for analyzing complex geometric data that lacks common coordinate systems and familiar Euclidean properties. A central challenge in this field is to define convolution on domains, which inherently possess irregular and non-Euclidean structures. In this work, we introduce Quasi-conformal Convolution (QCC), a novel framework for defining convolution on Riemann surfaces using quasi-conformal theories. Each QCC operator is linked to a specific quasi-conformal mapping, enabling the adjustment of the convolution operation through manipulation of this mapping. By utilizing trainable estimator modules that produce Quasi-conformal mappings, QCC facilitates adaptive and learnable convolution operators that can be dynamically adjusted according to the underlying data structured on Riemann surfaces. QCC unifies a broad range of spatially defined convolutions, facilitating the learning of tailored convolution operators on each underlying surface optimized for specific tasks. Building on this foundation, we develop the Quasi-Conformal Convolutional Neural Network (QCCNN) to address a variety of tasks related to geometric data. We validate the efficacy of QCCNN through the classification of images defined on curvilinear Riemann surfaces, demonstrating superior performance in this context. Additionally, we explore its potential in medical applications, including craniofacial analysis using 3D facial data and lesion segmentation on 3D human faces, achieving enhanced accuracy and reliability.</description>

      <title>AdaSVD: Adaptive Singular Value Decomposition for Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01403v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in natural language processing (NLP) tasks, yet their substantial memory requirements present significant challenges for deployment on resource-constrained devices. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) has emerged as a promising compression technique for LLMs, offering considerable reductions in memory overhead. However, existing SVD-based methods often struggle to effectively mitigate the errors introduced by SVD truncation, leading to a noticeable performance gap when compared to the original models. Furthermore, applying a uniform compression ratio across all transformer layers fails to account for the varying importance of different layers. To address these challenges, we propose AdaSVD, an adaptive SVD-based LLM compression approach. Specifically, AdaSVD introduces adaComp, which adaptively compensates for SVD truncation errors by alternately updating the singular matrices U and V^T. Additionally, AdaSVD introduces adaCR, which adaptively assigns layer-specific compression ratios based on the relative importance of each layer. Extensive experiments across multiple LLM families and evaluation metrics demonstrate that AdaSVD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) SVD-based methods, achieving superior performance with significantly reduced memory requirements. The code and models will be available at https://github.com/ZHITENGLI/AdaSVD.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01445v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Defect detection in fabrics is critical for quality control, yet existing methods often struggle with complex backgrounds and shape-specific defects. In this paper, we propose an improved fabric defect detection model based on YOLOv11. To enhance the detection of strip defects, we introduce a Strip Perception Module (SPM) that improves feature capture through multi-scale convolution. We further enhance the spatial pyramid pooling fast (SPPF) by integrating a squeeze-and-excitation mechanism, resulting in the SE-SPPF module, which better integrates spatial and channel information for more effective defect feature extraction. Additionally, we propose a novel focal enhanced complete intersection over union (FECIoU) metric with adaptive weights, addressing scale differences and class imbalance by adjusting the weights of hard-to-detect instances through focal loss.

      <title>SelfFed: Self-Supervised Federated Learning for Data Heterogeneity and Label Scarcity in Medical Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.01514v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Self-supervised learning in the federated learning paradigm has been gaining a lot of interest both in industry and research due to the collaborative learning capability on unlabeled yet isolated data. However, self-supervised based federated learning strategies suffer from performance degradation due to label scarcity and diverse data distributions, i.e., data heterogeneity. In this paper, we propose the SelfFed framework for medical images to overcome data heterogeneity and label scarcity issues. The first phase of the SelfFed framework helps to overcome the data heterogeneity issue by leveraging the pre-training paradigm that performs augmentative modeling using Swin Transformer-based encoder in a decentralized manner. The label scarcity issue is addressed by fine-tuning paradigm that introduces a contrastive network and a novel aggregation strategy. We perform our experimental analysis on publicly available medical imaging datasets to show that SelfFed performs better when compared to existing baselines and works. Our method achieves a maximum improvement of 8.8% and 4.1% on Retina and COVID-FL datasets on non-IID datasets. Further, our proposed method outperforms existing baselines even when trained on a few (10%) labeled instances.</description>

      <title>Model Supply Chain Poisoning: Backdooring Pre-trained Models via Embedding Indistinguishability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15883v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pre-trained models (PTMs) are widely adopted across various downstream tasks in the machine learning supply chain. Adopting untrustworthy PTMs introduces significant security risks, where adversaries can poison the model supply chain by embedding hidden malicious behaviors (backdoors) into PTMs. However, existing backdoor attacks to PTMs can only achieve partially task-agnostic and the embedded backdoors are easily erased during the fine-tuning process. This makes it challenging for the backdoors to persist and propagate through the supply chain. In this paper, we propose a novel and severer backdoor attack, TransTroj, which enables the backdoors embedded in PTMs to efficiently transfer in the model supply chain. In particular, we first formalize this attack as an indistinguishability problem between poisoned and clean samples in the embedding space. We decompose embedding indistinguishability into pre- and post-indistinguishability, representing the similarity of the poisoned and reference embeddings before and after the attack. Then, we propose a two-stage optimization that separately optimizes triggers and victim PTMs to achieve embedding indistinguishability. We evaluate TransTroj on four PTMs and six downstream tasks. Experimental results show that our method significantly outperforms SOTA task-agnostic backdoor attacks -- achieving nearly 100% attack success rate on most downstream tasks -- and demonstrates robustness under various system settings. Our findings underscore the urgent need to secure the model supply chain against such transferable backdoor attacks. The code is available at https://github.com/haowang-cqu/TransTroj .</description>

      <title>Boundary Constraint-free Biomechanical Model-Based Surface Matching for Intraoperative Liver Deformation Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09964v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In image-guided liver surgery, 3D-3D non-rigid registration methods play a crucial role in estimating the mapping between the preoperative model and the intraoperative surface represented as point clouds, addressing the challenge of tissue deformation. Typically, these methods incorporate a biomechanical model, represented as a finite element model (FEM), used to regularize a surface matching term. This paper introduces a novel 3D-3D non-rigid registration method. In contrast to the preceding techniques, our method uniquely incorporates the FEM within the surface matching term itself, ensuring that the estimated deformation maintains geometric consistency throughout the registration process. Additionally, we eliminate the need to determine zero-boundary conditions and applied force locations in the FEM. We achieve this by integrating soft springs into the stiffness matrix and allowing forces to be distributed across the entire liver surface. To further improve robustness, we introduce a regularization technique focused on the gradient of the force magnitudes. This regularization imposes spatial smoothness and helps prevent the overfitting of irregular noise in intraoperative data. Optimization is achieved through an accelerated proximal gradient algorithm, further enhanced by our proposed method for determining the optimal step size. Our method is evaluated and compared to both a learning-based method and a traditional method that features FEM regularization using data collected on our custom-developed phantom, as well as two publicly available datasets. Our method consistently outperforms or is comparable to the baseline techniques. Our code and datasets will be available at https://github.com/zixinyang9109/BCF-FEM.</description>

      <title>UFID: A Unified Framework for Input-level Backdoor Detection on Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01101v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where malicious attackers inject backdoors by poisoning certain training samples during the training stage. This poses a significant threat to real-world applications in the Model-as-a-Service (MaaS) scenario, where users query diffusion models through APIs or directly download them from the internet. To mitigate the threat of backdoor attacks under MaaS, black-box input-level backdoor detection has drawn recent interest, where defenders aim to build a firewall that filters out backdoor samples in the inference stage, with access only to input queries and the generated results from diffusion models. Despite some preliminary explorations on the traditional classification tasks, these methods cannot be directly applied to the generative tasks due to two major challenges: (1) more diverse failures and (2) a multi-modality attack surface. In this paper, we propose a black-box input-level backdoor detection framework on diffusion models, called UFID. Our defense is motivated by an insightful causal analysis: Backdoor attacks serve as the confounder, introducing a spurious path from input to target images, which remains consistent even when we perturb the input samples with Gaussian noise. We further validate the intuition with theoretical analysis. Extensive experiments across different datasets on both conditional and unconditional diffusion models show that our method achieves superb performance on detection effectiveness and run-time efficiency.</description>

      <title>Coherence Awareness in Diffractive Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06681v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffractive neural networks hold great promise for applications requiring intensive computational processing. Considerable attention has focused on diffractive networks for either spatially coherent or spatially incoherent illumination. Here we illustrate that, as opposed to imaging systems, in diffractive networks the degree of spatial coherence has a dramatic effect. In particular, we show that when the spatial coherence length on the object is comparable to the minimal feature size preserved by the optical system, neither the incoherent nor the coherent extremes serve as acceptable approximations. Importantly, this situation is inherent to many settings involving active illumination, including reflected light microscopy, autonomous vehicles and smartphones. Following this observation, we propose a general framework for training diffractive networks for any specified degree of spatial and temporal coherence, supporting all types of linear and nonlinear layers. Using our method, we numerically optimize networks for image classification, and thoroughly investigate their performance dependence on the illumination coherence properties. We further introduce the concept of coherence-blind networks, which have enhanced resilience to changes in illumination conditions. Our findings serve as a steppingstone toward adopting all-optical neural networks in real-world applications, leveraging nothing but natural light.</description>

      <title>ChartMoE: Mixture of Expert Connector for Advanced Chart Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03277v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Automatic chart understanding is crucial for content comprehension and document parsing. Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in chart understanding through domain-specific alignment and fine-tuning. However, the application of alignment training within the chart domain is still underexplored. To address this, we propose ChartMoE, which employs the mixture of expert (MoE) architecture to replace the traditional linear projector to bridge the modality gap. Specifically, we train multiple linear connectors through distinct alignment tasks, which are utilized as the foundational initialization parameters for different experts. Additionally, we introduce ChartMoE-Align, a dataset with over 900K chart-table-JSON-code quadruples to conduct three alignment tasks (chart-table/JSON/code). Combined with the vanilla connector, we initialize different experts in four distinct ways and adopt high-quality knowledge learning to further refine the MoE connector and LLM parameters. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the MoE connector and our initialization strategy, e.g., ChartMoE improves the accuracy of the previous state-of-the-art from 80.48% to 84.64% on the ChartQA benchmark.</description>

      <title>InfantCryNet: A Data-driven Framework for Intelligent Analysis of Infant Cries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19689v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the meaning of infant cries is a significant challenge for young parents in caring for their newborns. The presence of background noise and the lack of labeled data present practical challenges in developing systems that can detect crying and analyze its underlying reasons. In this paper, we present a novel data-driven framework, "InfantCryNet," for accomplishing these tasks. To address the issue of data scarcity, we employ pre-trained audio models to incorporate prior knowledge into our model. We propose the use of statistical pooling and multi-head attention pooling techniques to extract features more effectively. Additionally, knowledge distillation and model quantization are applied to enhance model efficiency and reduce the model size, better supporting industrial deployment in mobile devices. Experiments on real-life datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed framework, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines by 4.4% in classification accuracy. The model compression effectively reduces the model size by 7% without compromising performance and by up to 28% with only an 8% decrease in accuracy, offering practical insights for model selection and system design.</description>

      <title>Posterior-Mean Rectified Flow: Towards Minimum MSE Photo-Realistic Image Restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00418v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Photo-realistic image restoration algorithms are typically evaluated by distortion measures (e.g., PSNR, SSIM) and by perceptual quality measures (e.g., FID, NIQE), where the desire is to attain the lowest possible distortion without compromising on perceptual quality. To achieve this goal, current methods commonly attempt to sample from the posterior distribution, or to optimize a weighted sum of a distortion loss (e.g., MSE) and a perceptual quality loss (e.g., GAN). Unlike previous works, this paper is concerned specifically with the optimal estimator that minimizes the MSE under a constraint of perfect perceptual index, namely where the distribution of the reconstructed images is equal to that of the ground-truth ones. A recent theoretical result shows that such an estimator can be constructed by optimally transporting the posterior mean prediction (MMSE estimate) to the distribution of the ground-truth images. Inspired by this result, we introduce Posterior-Mean Rectified Flow (PMRF), a simple yet highly effective algorithm that approximates this optimal estimator. In particular, PMRF first predicts the posterior mean, and then transports the result to a high-quality image using a rectified flow model that approximates the desired optimal transport map. We investigate the theoretical utility of PMRF and demonstrate that it consistently outperforms previous methods on a variety of image restoration tasks.</description>

      <title>Denoising with a Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03755v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Joint-embedding predictive architectures (JEPAs) have shown substantial promise in self-supervised representation learning, yet their application in generative modeling remains underexplored. Conversely, diffusion models have demonstrated significant efficacy in modeling arbitrary probability distributions. In this paper, we introduce Denoising with a Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (D-JEPA), pioneering the integration of JEPA within generative modeling. By recognizing JEPA as a form of masked image modeling, we reinterpret it as a generalized next-token prediction strategy, facilitating data generation in an auto-regressive manner. Furthermore, we incorporate diffusion loss to model the per-token probability distribution, enabling data generation in a continuous space. We also adapt flow matching loss as an alternative to diffusion loss, thereby enhancing the flexibility of D-JEPA. Empirically, with increased GFLOPs, D-JEPA consistently achieves lower FID scores with fewer training epochs, indicating its good scalability. Our base, large, and huge models outperform all previous generative models across all scales on ImageNet conditional generation benchmarks. Beyond image generation, D-JEPA is well-suited for other continuous data modeling, including video and audio.</description>

      <title>Calibration of Ordinal Regression Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15658v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have shown that deep neural networks are not well-calibrated and often produce over-confident predictions. The miscalibration issue primarily stems from using cross-entropy in classifications, which aims to align predicted softmax probabilities with one-hot labels. In ordinal regression tasks, this problem is compounded by an additional challenge: the expectation that softmax probabilities should exhibit unimodal distribution is not met with cross-entropy. The ordinal regression literature has focused on learning orders and overlooked calibration. To address both issues, we propose a novel loss function that introduces ordinal-aware calibration, ensuring that prediction confidence adheres to ordinal relationships between classes. It incorporates soft ordinal encoding and ordinal-aware regularization to enforce both calibration and unimodality. Extensive experiments across four popular ordinal regression benchmarks demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art calibration without compromising classification accuracy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09512v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have surfaced as a revolutionary element within the domain of low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) imaging, providing an advanced resolution to the enduring issue of reconciling radiation exposure with image quality. This comprehensive review synthesizes the rapid advancements in GAN-based LDCT denoising techniques, examining the evolution from foundational architectures to state-of-the-art models incorporating advanced features such as anatomical priors, perceptual loss functions, and innovative regularization strategies. We critically analyze various GAN architectures, including conditional GANs (cGANs), CycleGANs, and Super-Resolution GANs (SRGANs), elucidating their unique strengths and limitations in the context of LDCT denoising. The evaluation provides both qualitative and quantitative results related to the improvements in performance in benchmark and clinical datasets with metrics such as PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS. After highlighting the positive results, we discuss some of the challenges preventing a wider clinical use, including the interpretability of the images generated by GANs, synthetic artifacts, and the need for clinically relevant metrics. The review concludes by highlighting the essential significance of GAN-based methodologies in the progression of precision medicine via tailored LDCT denoising models, underlining the transformative possibilities presented by artificial intelligence within contemporary radiological practice.</description>

      <title>GRAPE: Generalizing Robot Policy via Preference Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19309v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the recent advancements of vision-language-action (VLA) models on a variety of robotics tasks, they suffer from critical issues such as poor generalizability to unseen tasks, due to their reliance on behavior cloning exclusively from successful rollouts. Furthermore, they are typically fine-tuned to replicate demonstrations collected by experts under different settings, thus introducing distribution bias and limiting their adaptability to diverse manipulation objectives, such as efficiency, safety, and task completion. To bridge this gap, we introduce GRAPE: Generalizing Robot Policy via Preference Alignment. Specifically, GRAPE aligns VLAs on a trajectory level and implicitly models reward from both successful and failure trials to boost generalizability to diverse tasks. Moreover, GRAPE breaks down complex manipulation tasks to independent stages and automatically guides preference modeling through customized spatiotemporal constraints with keypoints proposed by a large vision-language model. Notably, these constraints are flexible and can be customized to align the model with varying objectives, such as safety, efficiency, or task success. We evaluate GRAPE across a diverse array of tasks in both real-world and simulated environments. Experimental results demonstrate that GRAPE enhances the performance of state-of-the-art VLA models, increasing success rates on in-domain and unseen manipulation tasks by 51.79% and 58.20%, respectively. Additionally, GRAPE can be aligned with various objectives, such as safety and efficiency, reducing collision rates by 37.44% and rollout step-length by 11.15%, respectively.

      <title>Covariances for Free: Exploiting Mean Distributions for Federated Learning with Pre-Trained Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14326v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using pre-trained models has been found to reduce the effect of data heterogeneity and speed up federated learning algorithms. Recent works have investigated the use of first-order statistics and second-order statistics to aggregate local client data distributions at the server and achieve very high performance without any training. In this work we propose a training-free method based on an unbiased estimator of class covariance matrices. Our method, which only uses first-order statistics in the form of class means communicated by clients to the server, incurs only a fraction of the communication costs required by methods based on communicating second-order statistics. We show how these estimated class covariances can be used to initialize a linear classifier, thus exploiting the covariances without actually sharing them. When compared to state-of-the-art methods which also share only class means, our approach improves performance in the range of 4-26\% with exactly the same communication cost. Moreover, our method achieves performance competitive or superior to sharing second-order statistics with dramatically less communication overhead. Finally, using our method to initialize classifiers and then performing federated fine-tuning yields better and faster convergence.

      <title>Adaptive Prompt: Unlocking the Power of Visual Prompt Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18936</link>

Abstract: Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) has recently emerged as a powerful method for adapting pre-trained vision models to downstream tasks. By introducing learnable prompt tokens as task-specific instructions, VPT effectively guides pre-trained transformer models with minimal overhead. Despite its empirical success, a comprehensive theoretical understanding of VPT remains an active area of research. Building on recent insights into the connection between mixture of experts and prompt-based approaches, we identify a key limitation in VPT: the restricted functional expressiveness in prompt formulation. To address this limitation, we propose Visual Adaptive Prompt Tuning (VAPT), a new generation of prompts that redefines prompts as adaptive functions of the input. Our theoretical analysis shows that this simple yet intuitive approach achieves optimal sample efficiency. Empirical results on VTAB-1K and FGVC further demonstrate VAPT's effectiveness, with performance gains of 7.34% and 1.04% over fully fine-tuning baselines, respectively. Notably, VAPT also surpasses VPT by a substantial margin while using fewer parameters. These results highlight both the effectiveness and efficiency of our method and pave the way for future research to explore the potential of adaptive prompts.</description>

      <title>Prostate-Specific Foundation Models for Enhanced Detection of Clinically Significant Cancer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00366</link>

Abstract: Accurate prostate cancer diagnosis remains challenging. Even when using MRI, radiologists exhibit low specificity and significant inter-observer variability, leading to potential delays or inaccuracies in identifying clinically significant cancers. This leads to numerous unnecessary biopsies and risks of missing clinically significant cancers. Here we present prostate vision contrastive network (ProViCNet), prostate organ-specific vision foundation models for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Trans-Rectal Ultrasound imaging (TRUS) for comprehensive cancer detection. ProViCNet was trained and validated using 4,401 patients across six institutions, as a prostate cancer detection model on radiology images relying on patch-level contrastive learning guided by biopsy confirmed radiologist annotations. ProViCNet demonstrated consistent performance across multiple internal and external validation cohorts with area under the receiver operating curve values ranging from 0.875 to 0.966, significantly outperforming radiologists in the reader study (0.907 versus 0.805, p&lt;0.001) for mpMRI, while achieving 0.670 to 0.740 for TRUS. We also integrated ProViCNet with standard PSA to develop a virtual screening test, and we showed that we can maintain the high sensitivity for detecting clinically significant cancers while more than doubling specificity from 15% to 38% (p&lt;0.001), thereby substantially reducing unnecessary biopsies. These findings highlight that ProViCNet's potential for enhancing prostate cancer diagnosis accuracy and reduce unnecessary biopsies, thereby optimizing diagnostic pathways.</description>

      <title>Vision-centric Token Compression in Large Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00791v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing, excelling in handling longer sequences. However, the inefficiency and redundancy in processing extended in-context tokens remain a challenge. Many attempts to address this rely on compressing tokens with smaller text encoders, yet we question whether text encoders are truly indispensable. Our journey leads to an unexpected discovery-a much smaller vision encoder, applied directly to sequences of text tokens, can rival text encoders on text tasks. When pre-trained on large amounts of data and transferred to multiple mid-sized or small text understanding benchmarks, VIST leads to comparable results with 16% fewer FLOPs and 50% less memory usage. We further uncover significant token redundancy and devise a frequency-based masking strategy to guide the focus of the visual encoder toward the most critical tokens. Interestingly, we observe the trained visual encoder performs like a summarizer, selectively ignoring less important words such as prepositions and conjunctions. This approach delivers remarkable results, outperforming traditional text encoder-based methods by 5.7% on average over benchmarks like TriviaQA, NQ, PopQA, TREF, SST2, and SST5, setting a new standard for token efficiency in LLMs.</description>

      <title>Compressed Image Generation with Denoising Diffusion Codebook Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01189v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel generative approach based on Denoising Diffusion Models (DDMs), which produces high-quality image samples along with their losslessly compressed bit-stream representations. This is obtained by replacing the standard Gaussian noise sampling in the reverse diffusion with a selection of noise samples from pre-defined codebooks of fixed iid Gaussian vectors. Surprisingly, we find that our method, termed Denoising Diffusion Codebook Model (DDCM), retains sample quality and diversity of standard DDMs, even for extremely small codebooks. We leverage DDCM and pick the noises from the codebooks that best match a given image, converting our generative model into a highly effective lossy image codec achieving state-of-the-art perceptual image compression results. More generally, by setting other noise selections rules, we extend our compression method to any conditional image generation task (e.g., image restoration), where the generated images are produced jointly with their condensed bit-stream representations. Our work is accompanied by a mathematical interpretation of the proposed compressed conditional generation schemes, establishing a connection with score-based approximations of posterior samplers for the tasks considered.</description>
