      <title>Learning Physics Informed Neural ODEs With Partial Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning dynamics governing physical and spatiotemporal processes is a challenging problem, especially in scenarios where states are partially measured. In this work, we tackle the problem of learning dynamics governing these systems when parts of the system's states are not measured, specifically when the dynamics generating the non-measured states are unknown. Inspired by state estimation theory and Physics Informed Neural ODEs, we present a sequential optimization framework in which dynamics governing unmeasured processes can be learned. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed approach leveraging numerical simulations and a real dataset extracted from an electro-mechanical positioning system. We show how the underlying equations fit into our formalism and demonstrate the improved performance of the proposed method when compared with baselines.</description>

      <title>From MLP to NeoMLP: Leveraging Self-Attention for Neural Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural fields (NeFs) have recently emerged as a state-of-the-art method for encoding spatio-temporal signals of various modalities. Despite the success of NeFs in reconstructing individual signals, their use as representations in downstream tasks, such as classification or segmentation, is hindered by the complexity of the parameter space and its underlying symmetries, in addition to the lack of powerful and scalable conditioning mechanisms. In this work, we draw inspiration from the principles of connectionism to design a new architecture based on MLPs, which we term NeoMLP. We start from an MLP, viewed as a graph, and transform it from a multi-partite graph to a complete graph of input, hidden, and output nodes, equipped with high-dimensional features. We perform message passing on this graph and employ weight-sharing via self-attention among all the nodes. NeoMLP has a built-in mechanism for conditioning through the hidden and output nodes, which function as a set of latent codes, and as such, NeoMLP can be used straightforwardly as a conditional neural field. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by fitting high-resolution signals, including multi-modal audio-visual data. Furthermore, we fit datasets of neural representations, by learning instance-specific sets of latent codes using a single backbone architecture, and then use them for downstream tasks, outperforming recent state-of-the-art methods.

      <title>DeepNose: An Equivariant Convolutional Neural Network Predictive Of Human Olfactory Percepts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The olfactory system employs responses of an ensemble of odorant receptors (ORs) to sense molecules and to generate olfactory percepts. Here we hypothesized that ORs can be viewed as 3D spatial filters that extract molecular features relevant to the olfactory system, similarly to the spatio-temporal filters found in other sensory modalities. To build these filters, we trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict human olfactory percepts obtained from several semantic datasets. Our neural network, the DeepNose, produced responses that are approximately invariant to the molecules' orientation, due to its equivariant architecture. Our network offers high-fidelity perceptual predictions for different olfactory datasets. In addition, our approach allows us to identify molecular features that contribute to specific perceptual descriptors. Because the DeepNose network is designed to be aligned with the biological system, our approach predicts distinct perceptual qualities for different stereoisomers. The architecture of the DeepNose relying on the processing of several molecules at the same time permits inferring the perceptual quality of odor mixtures. We propose that the DeepNose network can use 3D molecular shapes to generate high-quality predictions for human olfactory percepts and help identify molecular features responsible for odor quality.</description>

      <title>Integrating Optimization Theory with Deep Learning for Wireless Network Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional wireless network design relies on optimization algorithms derived from domain-specific mathematical models, which are often inefficient and unsuitable for dynamic, real-time applications due to high complexity. Deep learning has emerged as a promising alternative to overcome complexity and adaptability concerns, but it faces challenges such as accuracy issues, delays, and limited interpretability due to its inherent black-box nature. This paper introduces a novel approach that integrates optimization theory with deep learning methodologies to address these issues. The methodology starts by constructing the block diagram of the optimization theory-based solution, identifying key building blocks corresponding to optimality conditions and iterative solutions. Selected building blocks are then replaced with deep neural networks, enhancing the adaptability and interpretability of the system. Extensive simulations show that this hybrid approach not only reduces runtime compared to optimization theory based approaches but also significantly improves accuracy and convergence rates, outperforming pure deep learning models.</description>

      <title>Bayesian optimized deep ensemble for uncertainty quantification of deep neural networks: a system safety case study on sodium fast reactor thermal stratification modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate predictions and uncertainty quantification (UQ) are essential for decision-making in risk-sensitive fields such as system safety modeling. Deep ensembles (DEs) are efficient and scalable methods for UQ in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs); however, their performance is limited when constructed by simply retraining the same DNN multiple times with randomly sampled initializations. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel method that combines Bayesian optimization (BO) with DE, referred to as BODE, to enhance both predictive accuracy and UQ.
  We apply BODE to a case study involving a Densely connected Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) trained on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) data to predict eddy viscosity in sodium fast reactor thermal stratification modeling. Compared to a manually tuned baseline ensemble, BODE estimates total uncertainty approximately four times lower in a noise-free environment, primarily due to the baseline's overestimation of aleatoric uncertainty. Specifically, BODE estimates aleatoric uncertainty close to zero, while aleatoric uncertainty dominates the total uncertainty in the baseline ensemble. We also observe a reduction of more than 30% in epistemic uncertainty. When Gaussian noise with standard deviations of 5% and 10% is introduced into the data, BODE accurately fits the data and estimates uncertainty that aligns with the data noise. These results demonstrate that BODE effectively reduces uncertainty and enhances predictions in data-driven models, making it a flexible approach for various applications requiring accurate predictions and robust UQ.</description>

      <title>Latent Safety-Constrained Policy Approach for Safe Offline Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In safe offline reinforcement learning (RL), the objective is to develop a policy that maximizes cumulative rewards while strictly adhering to safety constraints, utilizing only offline data. Traditional methods often face difficulties in balancing these constraints, leading to either diminished performance or increased safety risks. We address these issues with a novel approach that begins by learning a conservatively safe policy through the use of Conditional Variational Autoencoders, which model the latent safety constraints. Subsequently, we frame this as a Constrained Reward-Return Maximization problem, wherein the policy aims to optimize rewards while complying with the inferred latent safety constraints. This is achieved by training an encoder with a reward-Advantage Weighted Regression objective within the latent constraint space. Our methodology is supported by theoretical analysis, including bounds on policy performance and sample complexity. Extensive empirical evaluation on benchmark datasets, including challenging autonomous driving scenarios, demonstrates that our approach not only maintains safety compliance but also excels in cumulative reward optimization, surpassing existing methods. Additional visualizations provide further insights into the effectiveness and underlying mechanisms of our approach.</description>

      <title>Test-Time Alignment via Hypothesis Reweighting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large pretrained models often struggle with underspecified tasks -- situations where the training data does not fully define the desired behavior. For example, chatbots must handle diverse and often conflicting user preferences, requiring adaptability to various user needs. We propose a novel framework to address the general challenge of aligning models to test-time user intent, which is rarely fully specified during training. Our approach involves training an efficient ensemble, i.e., a single neural network with multiple prediction heads, each representing a different function consistent with the training data. Our main contribution is HyRe, a simple adaptation technique that dynamically reweights ensemble members at test time using a small set of labeled examples from the target distribution, which can be labeled in advance or actively queried from a larger unlabeled pool. By leveraging recent advances in scalable ensemble training, our method scales to large pretrained models, with computational costs comparable to fine-tuning a single model. We empirically validate HyRe in several underspecified scenarios, including personalization tasks and settings with distribution shifts. Additionally, with just five preference pairs from each target distribution, the same ensemble adapted via HyRe outperforms the prior state-of-the-art 2B-parameter reward model accuracy across 18 evaluation distributions.</description>

      <title>HARP: A challenging human-annotated math reasoning benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Math reasoning is becoming an ever increasing area of focus as we scale large language models. However, even the previously-toughest evals like MATH are now close to saturated by frontier models (90.0% for o1-mini and 86.5% for Gemini 1.5 Pro). We introduce HARP, Human Annotated Reasoning Problems (for Math), consisting of 5,409 problems from the US national math competitions (A(J)HSME, AMC, AIME, USA(J)MO). Of these, 4,780 have answers that are automatically check-able (with libraries such as SymPy). These problems range six difficulty levels, with frontier models performing relatively poorly on the hardest bracket of 197 problems (average accuracy 41.1% for o1-mini, and 9.6% for Gemini 1.5 Pro). Our dataset also features multiple choices (for 4,110 problems) and an average of two human-written, ground-truth solutions per problem, offering new avenues of research that we explore briefly. We report evaluations for many frontier models and share some interesting analyses, such as demonstrating that frontier models across families intrinsically scale their inference-time compute for more difficult problems. Finally, we open source all code used for dataset construction (including scraping) and all code for evaluation (including answer checking) to enable future research at: https://github.com/aadityasingh/HARP.</description>

      <title>Disentangling impact of capacity, objective, batchsize, estimators, and step-size on flow VI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Normalizing flow-based variational inference (flow VI) is a promising approximate inference approach, but its performance remains inconsistent across studies. Numerous algorithmic choices influence flow VI's performance. We conduct a step-by-step analysis to disentangle the impact of some of the key factors: capacity, objectives, gradient estimators, number of gradient estimates (batchsize), and step-sizes. Each step examines one factor while neutralizing others using insights from the previous steps and/or using extensive parallel computation. To facilitate high-fidelity evaluation, we curate a benchmark of synthetic targets that represent common posterior pathologies and allow for exact sampling. We provide specific recommendations for different factors and propose a flow VI recipe that matches or surpasses leading turnkey Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) methods.</description>

      <title>Grothendieck Graph Neural Networks Framework: An Algebraic Platform for Crafting Topology-Aware GNNs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the structural limitations of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), in particular with respect to conventional neighborhoods, alternative aggregation strategies have recently been investigated. This paper investigates graph structure in message passing, aimed to incorporate topological characteristics. While the simplicity of neighborhoods remains alluring, we propose a novel perspective by introducing the concept of 'cover' as a generalization of neighborhoods. We design the Grothendieck Graph Neural Networks (GGNN) framework, offering an algebraic platform for creating and refining diverse covers for graphs. This framework translates covers into matrix forms, such as the adjacency matrix, expanding the scope of designing GNN models based on desired message-passing strategies. Leveraging algebraic tools, GGNN facilitates the creation of models that outperform traditional approaches. Based on the GGNN framework, we propose Sieve Neural Networks (SNN), a new GNN model that leverages the notion of sieves from category theory. SNN demonstrates outstanding performance in experiments, particularly on benchmarks designed to test the expressivity of GNNs, and exemplifies the versatility of GGNN in generating novel architectures.</description>

      <title>Words of War: Exploring the Presidential Rhetorical Arsenal with Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In political discourse and geopolitical analysis, national leaders words hold profound significance, often serving as harbingers of pivotal historical moments. From impassioned rallying cries to calls for caution, presidential speeches preceding major conflicts encapsulate the multifaceted dynamics of decision-making at the apex of governance. This project aims to use deep learning techniques to decode the subtle nuances and underlying patterns of US presidential rhetoric that may signal US involvement in major wars. While accurate classification is desirable, we seek to take a step further and identify discriminative features between the two classes (i.e. interpretable learning).
  Through an interdisciplinary fusion of machine learning and historical inquiry, we aspire to unearth insights into the predictive capacity of neural networks in discerning the preparatory rhetoric of US presidents preceding war. Indeed, as the venerable Prussian General and military theorist Carl von Clausewitz admonishes, War is not merely an act of policy but a true political instrument, a continuation of political intercourse carried on with other means (Clausewitz, 1832).</description>

      <title>Towards modeling evolving longitudinal health trajectories with a transformer-based deep learning model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Health registers contain rich information about individuals' health histories. Here our interest lies in understanding how individuals' health trajectories evolve in a nationwide longitudinal dataset with coded features, such as clinical codes, procedures, and drug purchases. We introduce a straightforward approach for training a Transformer-based deep learning model in a way that lets us analyze how individuals' trajectories change over time. This is achieved by modifying the training objective and by applying a causal attention mask. We focus here on a general task of predicting the onset of a range of common diseases in a given future forecast interval. However, instead of providing a single prediction about diagnoses that could occur in this forecast interval, our approach enable the model to provide continuous predictions at every time point up until, and conditioned on, the time of the forecast period. We find that this model performs comparably to other models, including a bi-directional transformer model, in terms of basic prediction performance while at the same time offering promising trajectory modeling properties. We explore a couple of ways to use this model for analyzing health trajectories and aiding in early detection of events that forecast possible later disease onsets. We hypothesize that this method may be helpful in continuous monitoring of peoples' health trajectories and enabling interventions in ongoing health trajectories, as well as being useful in retrospective analyses.</description>

      <title>FAWAC: Feasibility Informed Advantage Weighted Regression for Persistent Safety in Offline Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Safe offline reinforcement learning aims to learn policies that maximize cumulative rewards while adhering to safety constraints, using only offline data for training. A key challenge is balancing safety and performance, particularly when the policy encounters out-of-distribution (OOD) states and actions, which can lead to safety violations or overly conservative behavior during deployment. To address these challenges, we introduce Feasibility Informed Advantage Weighted Actor-Critic (FAWAC), a method that prioritizes persistent safety in constrained Markov decision processes (CMDPs). FAWAC formulates policy optimization with feasibility conditions derived specifically for offline datasets, enabling safe policy updates in non-parametric policy space, followed by projection into parametric space for constrained actor training. By incorporating a cost-advantage term into Advantage Weighted Regression (AWR), FAWAC ensures that the safety constraints are respected while maximizing performance. Additionally, we propose a strategy to address a more challenging class of problems that involves tempting datasets where trajectories are predominantly high-rewarded but unsafe. Empirical evaluations on standard benchmarks demonstrate that FAWAC achieves strong results, effectively balancing safety and performance in learning policies from the static datasets.</description>

      <title>Lexico: Extreme KV Cache Compression via Sparse Coding over Universal Dictionaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Lexico, a novel KV cache compression method that leverages sparse coding with a universal dictionary. Our key finding is that key-value cache in modern LLMs can be accurately approximated using sparse linear combination from a small, input-agnostic dictionary of ~4k atoms, enabling efficient compression across different input prompts, tasks and models. Using orthogonal matching pursuit for sparse approximation, Lexico achieves flexible compression ratios through direct sparsity control. On GSM8K, across multiple model families (Mistral, Llama 3, Qwen2.5), Lexico maintains 90-95% of the original performance while using only 15-25% of the full KV-cache memory, outperforming both quantization and token eviction methods. Notably, Lexico remains effective in low memory regimes where 2-bit quantization fails, achieving up to 1.7x better compression on LongBench and GSM8K while maintaining high accuracy.</description>

Abstract: Reinforcement learning solves optimal control and sequential decision problems widely found in control systems engineering, robotics, and artificial intelligence. This work investigates optimal control over a sequence of natural images. The problem is formalized, and general conditions are derived for an image to be sufficient for implementing an optimal policy. Reinforcement learning is shown to be efficient only for certain types of image representations. This is demonstrated by developing a reinforcement learning benchmark that scales easily with number of states and length of horizon, and has optimal policies that are easily distinguished from suboptimal policies. Image representations given by overcomplete sparse codes are found to be computationally efficient for optimal control, using fewer computational resources to learn and evaluate optimal policies. For natural images of fixed size, representing each image as an overcomplete sparse code in a linear network is shown to increase network storage capacity by orders of magnitude beyond that possible for any complete code, allowing larger tasks with many more states to be solved. Sparse codes can be generated by devices with low energy requirements and low computational overhead.</description>

      <title>SMMF: Square-Matricized Momentum Factorization for Memory-Efficient Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose SMMF (Square-Matricized Momentum Factorization), a memory-efficient optimizer that reduces the memory requirement of the widely used adaptive learning rate optimizers, such as Adam, by up to 96%. SMMF enables flexible and efficient factorization of an arbitrary rank (shape) of the first and second momentum tensors during optimization, based on the proposed square-matricization and one-time single matrix factorization. From this, it becomes effectively applicable to any rank (shape) of momentum tensors, i.e., bias, matrix, and any rank-d tensors, prevalent in various deep model architectures, such as CNNs (high rank) and Transformers (low rank), in contrast to existing memory-efficient optimizers that applies only to a particular (rank-2) momentum tensor, e.g., linear layers. We conduct a regret bound analysis of SMMF, which shows that it converges similarly to non-memory-efficient adaptive learning rate optimizers, such as AdamNC, providing a theoretical basis for its competitive optimization capability. In our experiment, SMMF takes up to 96% less memory compared to state-of-the-art memory efficient optimizers, e.g., Adafactor, CAME, and SM3, while achieving comparable model performance on various CNN and Transformer tasks.</description>

      <title>Radiology Report Generation via Multi-objective Preference Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automatic Radiology Report Generation (RRG) is an important topic for alleviating the substantial workload of radiologists. Existing RRG approaches rely on supervised regression based on different architectures or additional knowledge injection,while the generated report may not align optimally with radiologists' preferences. Especially, since the preferences of radiologists are inherently heterogeneous and multidimensional, e.g., some may prioritize report fluency, while others emphasize clinical accuracy. To address this problem,we propose a new RRG method via Multi-objective Preference Optimization (MPO) to align the pre-trained RRG model with multiple human preferences, which can be formulated by multi-dimensional reward functions and optimized by multi-objective reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, we use a preference vector to represent the weight of preferences and use it as a condition for the RRG model. Then, a linearly weighed reward is obtained via a dot product between the preference vector and multi-dimensional reward.Next,the RRG model is optimized to align with the preference vector by optimizing such a reward via RL. In the training stage,we randomly sample diverse preference vectors from the preference space and align the model by optimizing the weighted multi-objective rewards, which leads to an optimal policy on the entire preference space. When inference,our model can generate reports aligned with specific preferences without further fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on two public datasets show the proposed method can generate reports that cater to different preferences in a single model and achieve state-of-the-art performance.</description>

      <title>Federated Foundation Models on Heterogeneous Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Training a general-purpose time series foundation models with robust generalization capabilities across diverse applications from scratch is still an open challenge. Efforts are primarily focused on fusing cross-domain time series datasets to extract shared subsequences as tokens for training models on Transformer architecture. However, due to significant statistical heterogeneity across domains, this cross-domain fusing approach doesn't work effectively as the same as fusing texts and images. To tackle this challenge, this paper proposes a novel federated learning approach to address the heterogeneity in time series foundation models training, namely FFTS. Specifically, each data-holding organization is treated as an independent client in a collaborative learning framework with federated settings, and then many client-specific local models will be trained to preserve the unique characteristics per dataset. Moreover, a new regularization mechanism will be applied to both client-side and server-side, thus to align the shared knowledge across heterogeneous datasets from different domains. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed federated learning approach. The newly learned time series foundation models achieve superior generalization capabilities on cross-domain time series analysis tasks, including forecasting, imputation, and anomaly detection.</description>

      <title>Goal-Conditioned Supervised Learning for Multi-Objective Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-objective learning endeavors to concurrently optimize multiple objectives using a single model, aiming to achieve high and balanced performance across these diverse objectives. However, it often involves a more complex optimization problem, particularly when navigating potential conflicts between objectives, leading to solutions with higher memory requirements and computational complexity. This paper introduces a Multi-Objective Goal-Conditioned Supervised Learning (MOGCSL) framework for automatically learning to achieve multiple objectives from offline sequential data. MOGCSL extends the conventional Goal-Conditioned Supervised Learning (GCSL) method to multi-objective scenarios by redefining goals from one-dimensional scalars to multi-dimensional vectors. The need for complex architectures and optimization constraints can be naturally eliminated. MOGCSL benefits from filtering out uninformative or noisy instances that do not achieve desirable long-term rewards. It also incorporates a novel goal-choosing algorithm to model and select "high" achievable goals for inference.
  While MOGCSL is quite general, we focus on its application to the next action prediction problem in commercial-grade recommender systems. In this context, any viable solution needs to be reasonably scalable and also be robust to large amounts of noisy data that is characteristic of this application space. We show that MOGCSL performs admirably on both counts. Specifically, extensive experiments conducted on real-world recommendation datasets validate its efficacy and efficiency. Also, analysis and experiments are included to explain its strength in discounting the noisier portions of training data in recommender systems.</description>

      <title>Multi-Scale Heterogeneous Text-Attributed Graph Datasets From Diverse Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heterogeneous Text-Attributed Graphs (HTAGs), where different types of entities are not only associated with texts but also connected by diverse relationships, have gained widespread popularity and application across various domains. However, current research on text-attributed graph learning predominantly focuses on homogeneous graphs, which feature a single node and edge type, thus leaving a gap in understanding how methods perform on HTAGs. One crucial reason is the lack of comprehensive HTAG datasets that offer original textual content and span multiple domains of varying sizes. To this end, we introduce a collection of challenging and diverse benchmark datasets for realistic and reproducible evaluation of machine learning models on HTAGs. Our HTAG datasets are multi-scale, span years in duration, and cover a wide range of domains, including movie, community question answering, academic, literature, and patent networks. We further conduct benchmark experiments on these datasets with various graph neural networks. All source data, dataset construction codes, processed HTAGs, data loaders, benchmark codes, and evaluation setup are publicly available at GitHub and Hugging Face.</description>

      <title>Deep Clustering using Dirichlet Process Gaussian Mixture and Alpha Jensen-Shannon Divergence Clustering Loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep clustering is an emerging topic in deep learning where traditional clustering is performed in deep learning feature space. However, clustering and deep learning are often mutually exclusive. In the autoencoder based deep clustering, the challenge is how to jointly optimize both clustering and dimension reduction together, so that the weights in the hidden layers are not only guided by reconstruction loss, but also by a loss function associated with clustering. The current state-of-the-art has two fundamental flaws. First, they rely on the mathematical convenience of Kullback-Leibler divergence for the clustering loss function but the former is asymmetric. Secondly, they assume the prior knowledge on the number of clusters is always available for their dataset of interest. This paper tries to improve on these problems. In the first problem, we use a Jensen-Shannon divergence to overcome the asymmetric issue, specifically using a closed form variant. Next, we introduce an infinite cluster representation using Dirichlet process Gaussian mixture model for joint clustering and model selection in the latent space which we called deep model selection. The number of clusters in the latent space are not fixed but instead vary accordingly as they gradually approach the optimal number during training. Thus, prior knowledge is not required. We evaluate our proposed deep model selection method with traditional model selection on large class number datasets such as MIT67 and CIFAR100 and also compare with both traditional variational Bayes model and deep clustering method with convincing results.</description>

      <title>Optimized Gradient Clipping for Noisy Label Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previous research has shown that constraining the gradient of loss function with respect to model-predicted probabilities can enhance the model robustness against noisy labels. These methods typically specify a fixed optimal threshold for gradient clipping through validation data to obtain the desired robustness against noise. However, this common practice overlooks the dynamic distribution of gradients from both clean and noisy-labeled samples at different stages of training, significantly limiting the model capability to adapt to the variable nature of gradients throughout the training process. To address this issue, we propose a simple yet effective approach called Optimized Gradient Clipping (OGC), which dynamically adjusts the clipping threshold based on the ratio of noise gradients to clean gradients after clipping, estimated by modeling the distributions of clean and noisy samples. This approach allows us to modify the clipping threshold at each training step, effectively controlling the influence of noise gradients. Additionally, we provide statistical analysis to certify the noise-tolerance ability of OGC. Our extensive experiments across various types of label noise, including symmetric, asymmetric, instance-dependent, and real-world noise, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. The code and a technical appendix for better digital viewing are included as supplementary materials and scheduled to be open-sourced upon publication.</description>

      <title>MoSLD: An Extremely Parameter-Efficient Mixture-of-Shared LoRAs for Multi-Task Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, LoRA has emerged as a crucial technique for fine-tuning large pre-trained models, yet its performance in multi-task learning scenarios often falls short. In contrast, the MoE architecture presents a natural solution to this issue. However, it introduces challenges such as mutual interference of data across multiple domains and knowledge forgetting of various tasks. Additionally, MoE significantly increases the number of parameters, posing a computational cost challenge. Therefore, in this paper, we propose MoSLD, a mixture-of-shared-LoRAs model with a dropout strategy. MoSLD addresses these challenges by sharing the upper projection matrix in LoRA among different experts, encouraging the model to learn general knowledge across tasks, while still allowing the lower projection matrix to focus on the unique features of each task. The application of dropout alleviates the imbalanced update of parameter matrix and mitigates parameter overfitting in LoRA. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model exhibits excellent performance in both single-task and multi-task scenarios, with robust out-of-domain generalization capabilities.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Learning of Non-Conjugate Variational Posterior for Image Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large scale Bayesian nonparametrics (BNP) learner such as stochastic variational inference (SVI) can handle datasets with large class number and large training size at fractional cost. Like its predecessor, SVI rely on the assumption of conjugate variational posterior to approximate the true posterior. A more challenging problem is to consider large scale learning on non-conjugate posterior. Recent works in this direction are mostly associated with using Monte Carlo methods for approximating the learner. However, these works are usually demonstrated on non-BNP related task and less complex models such as logistic regression, due to higher computational complexity. In order to overcome the issue faced by SVI, we develop a novel approach based on the recently proposed variational maximization-maximization (VMM) learner to allow large scale learning on non-conjugate posterior. Unlike SVI, our VMM learner does not require closed-form expression for the variational posterior expectatations. Our only requirement is that the variational posterior is differentiable. In order to ensure convergence in stochastic settings, SVI rely on decaying step-sizes to slow its learning. Inspired by SVI and Adam, we propose the novel use of decaying step-sizes on both gradient and ascent direction in our VMM to significantly improve its learning. We show that our proposed methods is compatible with ResNet features when applied to large class number datasets such as MIT67 and SUN397. Finally, we compare our proposed learner with several recent works such as deep clustering algorithms and showed we were able to produce on par or outperform the state-of-the-art methods in terms of clustering measures.</description>

      <title>A Wander Through the Multimodal Landscape: Efficient Transfer Learning via Low-rank Sequence Multimodal Adapter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient transfer learning methods such as adapter-based methods have shown great success in unimodal models and vision-language models. However, existing methods have two main challenges in fine-tuning multimodal models. Firstly, they are designed for vision-language tasks and fail to extend to situations where there are more than two modalities. Secondly, they exhibit limited exploitation of interactions between modalities and lack efficiency. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose the loW-rank sequence multimodal adapter (Wander). We first use the outer product to fuse the information from different modalities in an element-wise way effectively. For efficiency, we use CP decomposition to factorize tensors into rank-one components and achieve substantial parameter reduction. Furthermore, we implement a token-level low-rank decomposition to extract more fine-grained features and sequence relationships between modalities. With these designs, Wander enables token-level interactions between sequences of different modalities in a parameter-efficient way. We conduct extensive experiments on datasets with different numbers of modalities, where Wander outperforms state-of-the-art efficient transfer learning methods consistently. The results fully demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency and universality of Wander.</description>

      <title>A physics-informed transformer neural operator for learning generalized solutions of initial boundary value problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Initial boundary value problems arise commonly in applications with engineering and natural systems governed by nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs). Operator learning is an emerging field for solving these equations by using a neural network to learn a map between infinite dimensional input and output function spaces. These neural operators are trained using a combination of data (observations or simulations) and PDE-residuals (physics-loss). A major drawback of existing neural approaches is the requirement to retrain with new initial/boundary conditions, and the necessity for a large amount of simulation data for training. We develop a physics-informed transformer neural operator (named PINTO) that efficiently generalizes to unseen initial and boundary conditions, trained in a simulation-free setting using only physics loss. The main innovation lies in our new iterative kernel integral operator units, implemented using cross-attention, to transform the PDE solution's domain points into an initial/boundary condition-aware representation vector, enabling efficient learning of the solution function for new scenarios. The PINTO architecture is applied to simulate the solutions of important equations used in engineering applications: advection, Burgers, and steady and unsteady Navier-Stokes equations (three flow scenarios). For these five test cases, we show that the relative errors during testing under challenging conditions of unseen initial/boundary conditions are only one-fifth to one-third of other leading physics informed operator learning methods. Moreover, our PINTO model is able to accurately solve the advection and Burgers equations at time steps that are not included in the training collocation points. The code is available at $\texttt{https://github.com/quest-lab-iisc/PINTO}$</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In-memory computing (IMC) architectures mitigate the von Neumann bottleneck encountered in traditional deep learning accelerators. Its energy efficiency can realize deep learning-based edge applications. However, because IMC is implemented using analog circuits, inherent non-idealities in the hardware pose significant challenges. This paper presents physical neural networks (PNNs) for constructing physical models of IMC. PNNs can address the synaptic current's dependence on membrane potential, a challenge in charge-domain IMC systems. The proposed model is mathematically equivalent to spiking neural networks with reversal potentials. With a novel technique called differentiable spike-time discretization, the PNNs are efficiently trained. We show that hardware non-idealities traditionally viewed as detrimental can enhance the model's learning performance. This bottom-up methodology was validated by designing an IMC circuit with non-ideal characteristics using the sky130 process. When employing this bottom-up approach, the modeling error reduced by an order of magnitude compared to conventional top-down methods in post-layout simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Organic Solar Cells (OSCs) are a promising technology for sustainable energy production. However, the identification of molecules with desired OSC properties typically involves laborious experimental research. To accelerate progress in the field, it is crucial to develop machine learning models capable of accurately predicting the properties of OSC molecules. While graph representation learning has demonstrated success in molecular property prediction, it remains underexplored for OSC-specific tasks. Existing methods fail to capture the unique structural features of OSC molecules, particularly the intricate ring systems that critically influence OSC properties, leading to suboptimal performance. To fill the gap, we present RingFormer, a novel graph transformer framework specially designed to capture both atom and ring level structural patterns in OSC molecules. RingFormer constructs a hierarchical graph that integrates atomic and ring structures and employs a combination of local message passing and global attention mechanisms to generate expressive graph representations for accurate OSC property prediction. We evaluate RingFormer's effectiveness on five curated OSC molecule datasets through extensive experiments. The results demonstrate that RingFormer consistently outperforms existing methods, achieving a 22.77% relative improvement over the nearest competitor on the CEPDB dataset.</description>

      <title>Pulling the Carpet Below the Learner's Feet: Genetic Algorithm To Learn Ensemble Machine Learning Model During Concept Drift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data-driven models, in general, and machine learning (ML) models, in particular, have gained popularity over recent years with an increased usage of such models across the scientific and engineering domains. When using ML models in realistic and dynamic environments, users need to often handle the challenge of concept drift (CD). In this study, we explore the application of genetic algorithms (GAs) to address the challenges posed by CD in such settings. We propose a novel two-level ensemble ML model, which combines a global ML model with a CD detector, operating as an aggregator for a population of ML pipeline models, each one with an adjusted CD detector by itself responsible for re-training its ML model. In addition, we show one can further improve the proposed model by utilizing off-the-shelf automatic ML methods. Through extensive synthetic dataset analysis, we show that the proposed model outperforms a single ML pipeline with a CD algorithm, particularly in scenarios with unknown CD characteristics. Overall, this study highlights the potential of ensemble ML and CD models obtained through a heuristic and adaptive optimization process such as the GA one to handle complex CD events.</description>

      <title>Beyond Confusion: A Fine-grained Dialectical Examination of Human Activity Recognition Benchmark Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The research of machine learning (ML) algorithms for human activity recognition (HAR) has made significant progress with publicly available datasets. However, most research prioritizes statistical metrics over examining negative sample details. While recent models like transformers have been applied to HAR datasets with limited success from the benchmark metrics, their counterparts have effectively solved problems on similar levels with near 100% accuracy. This raises questions about the limitations of current approaches. This paper aims to address these open questions by conducting a fine-grained inspection of six popular HAR benchmark datasets. We identified for some parts of the data, none of the six chosen state-of-the-art ML methods can correctly classify, denoted as the intersect of false classifications (IFC). Analysis of the IFC reveals several underlying problems, including ambiguous annotations, irregularities during recording execution, and misaligned transition periods. We contribute to the field by quantifying and characterizing annotated data ambiguities, providing a trinary categorization mask for dataset patching, and stressing potential improvements for future data collections.</description>

      <title>Safe Active Learning for Gaussian Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gaussian Process differential equations (GPODE) have recently gained momentum due to their ability to capture dynamics behavior of systems and also represent uncertainty in predictions. Prior work has described the process of training the hyperparameters and, thereby, calibrating GPODE to data. How to design efficient algorithms to collect data for training GPODE models is still an open field of research. Nevertheless high-quality training data is key for model performance. Furthermore, data collection leads to time-cost and financial-cost and might in some areas even be safety critical to the system under test. Therefore, algorithms for safe and efficient data collection are central for building high quality GPODE models. Our novel Safe Active Learning (SAL) for GPODE algorithm addresses this challenge by suggesting a mechanism to propose efficient and non-safety-critical data to collect. SAL GPODE does so by sequentially suggesting new data, measuring it and updating the GPODE model with the new data. In this way, subsequent data points are iteratively suggested. The core of our SAL GPODE algorithm is a constrained optimization problem maximizing information of new data for GPODE model training constrained by the safety of the underlying system. We demonstrate our novel SAL GPODE's superiority compared to a standard, non-active way of measuring new data on two relevant examples.</description>

      <title>Go With the Flow: Fast Diffusion for Gaussian Mixture Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Schr\"{o}dinger Bridges (SB) are diffusion processes that steer, in finite time, a given initial distribution to another final one while minimizing a suitable cost functional. Although various methods for computing SBs have recently been proposed in the literature, most of these approaches require computationally expensive training schemes, even for solving low-dimensional problems. In this work, we propose an analytic parametrization of a set of feasible policies for steering the distribution of a dynamical system from one Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to another. Instead of relying on standard non-convex optimization techniques, the optimal policy within the set can be approximated as the solution of a low-dimensional linear program whose dimension scales linearly with the number of components in each mixture. Furthermore, our method generalizes naturally to more general classes of dynamical systems such as controllable Linear Time-Varying systems that cannot currently be solved using traditional neural SB approaches. We showcase the potential of this approach in low-to-moderate dimensional problems such as image-to-image translation in the latent space of an autoencoder, and various other examples. We also benchmark our approach on an Entropic Optimal Transport (EOT) problem and show that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods in cases where the boundary distributions are mixture models while requiring virtually no training.</description>

      <title>Multi-view Clustering via Unified Multi-kernel Learning and Matrix Factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-view clustering has become increasingly important due to the multi-source character of real-world data. Among existing multi-view clustering methods, multi-kernel clustering and matrix factorization-based multi-view clustering have gained widespread attention as mainstream approaches. However, multi-kernel clustering tends to learn an optimal kernel and then perform eigenvalue decomposition on it, which leads to high computational complexity. Matrix factorization-based multi-view clustering methods impose orthogonal constraints on individual views. This overly emphasizes the accuracy of clustering structures within single views and restricts the learning of individual views. Based on this analysis, we propose a multi-view clustering method that integrates multi-kernel learning with matrix factorization. This approach combines the advantages of both multi-kernel learning and matrix factorization. It removes the orthogonal constraints on individual views and imposes orthogonal constraints on the consensus matrix, resulting in an accurate final clustering structure. Ultimately, the method is unified into a simple form of multi-kernel clustering, but avoids learning an optimal kernel, thus reducing the time complexity. Furthermore, we propose an efficient three-step optimization algorithm to achieve a locally optimal solution. Experiments on widely-used real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.</description>

      <title>Neural Networks for Threshold Dynamics Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce two convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures, inspired by the Merriman-Bence-Osher (MBO) algorithm and by cellular automatons, to model and learn threshold dynamics for front evolution from video data. The first model, termed the (single-dynamics) MBO network, learns a specific kernel and threshold for each input video without adapting to new dynamics, while the second, a meta-learning MBO network, generalizes across diverse threshold dynamics by adapting its parameters per input. Both models are evaluated on synthetic and real-world videos (ice melting and fire front propagation), with performance metrics indicating effective reconstruction and extrapolation of evolving boundaries, even under noisy conditions. Empirical results highlight the robustness of both networks across varied synthetic and real-world dynamics.</description>

      <title>Integrated trucks assignment and scheduling problem with mixed service mode docks: A Q-learning based adaptive large neighborhood search algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mixed service mode docks enhance efficiency by flexibly handling both loading and unloading trucks in warehouses. However, existing research often predetermines the number and location of these docks prior to planning truck assignment and sequencing. This paper proposes a new model integrating dock mode decision, truck assignment, and scheduling, thus enabling adaptive dock mode arrangements. Specifically, we introduce a Q-learning-based adaptive large neighborhood search (Q-ALNS) algorithm to address the integrated problem. The algorithm adjusts dock modes via perturbation operators, while truck assignment and scheduling are solved using destroy and repair local search operators. Q-learning adaptively selects these operators based on their performance history and future gains, employing the epsilon-greedy strategy. Extensive experimental results and statistical analysis indicate that the Q-ALNS benefits from efficient operator combinations and its adaptive mechanism, consistently outperforming benchmark algorithms in terms of optimality gap and Pareto front discovery. In comparison to the predetermined service mode, our adaptive strategy results in lower average tardiness and makespan, highlighting its superior adaptability to varying demands.</description>

      <title>How to Re-enable PDE Loss for Physical Systems Modeling Under Partial Observation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In science and engineering, machine learning techniques are increasingly successful in physical systems modeling (predicting future states of physical systems). Effectively integrating PDE loss as a constraint of system transition can improve the model's prediction by overcoming generalization issues due to data scarcity, especially when data acquisition is costly. However, in many real-world scenarios, due to sensor limitations, the data we can obtain is often only partial observation, making the calculation of PDE loss seem to be infeasible, as the PDE loss heavily relies on high-resolution states. We carefully study this problem and propose a novel framework named Re-enable PDE Loss under Partial Observation (RPLPO). The key idea is that although enabling PDE loss to constrain system transition solely is infeasible, we can re-enable PDE loss by reconstructing the learnable high-resolution state and constraining system transition simultaneously. Specifically, RPLPO combines an encoding module for reconstructing learnable high-resolution states with a transition module for predicting future states. The two modules are jointly trained by data and PDE loss. We conduct experiments in various physical systems to demonstrate that RPLPO has significant improvement in generalization, even when observation is sparse, irregular, noisy, and PDE is inaccurate. The code is available on GitHub: RPLPO.</description>

      <title>An Algorithm-Centered Approach To Model Streaming Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Besides the classical offline setup of machine learning, stream learning constitutes a well-established setup where data arrives over time in potentially non-stationary environments. Concept drift, the phenomenon that the underlying distribution changes over time poses a significant challenge. Yet, despite high practical relevance, there is little to no foundational theory for learning in the drifting setup comparable to classical statistical learning theory in the offline setting. This can be attributed to the lack of an underlying object comparable to a probability distribution as in the classical setup. While there exist approaches to transfer ideas to the streaming setup, these start from a data perspective rather than an algorithmic one. In this work, we suggest a new model of data over time that is aimed at the algorithm's perspective. Instead of defining the setup using time points, we utilize a window-based approach that resembles the inner workings of most stream learning algorithms. We compare our framework to others from the literature on a theoretical basis, showing that in many cases both model the same situation. Furthermore, we perform a numerical evaluation and showcase an application in the domain of critical infrastructure.</description>

      <title>The Utility and Complexity of In- and Out-of-Distribution Machine Unlearning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine unlearning, the process of selectively removing data from trained models, is increasingly crucial for addressing privacy concerns and knowledge gaps post-deployment. Despite this importance, existing approaches are often heuristic and lack formal guarantees. In this paper, we analyze the fundamental utility, time, and space complexity trade-offs of approximate unlearning, providing rigorous certification analogous to differential privacy. For in-distribution forget data -- data similar to the retain set -- we show that a surprisingly simple and general procedure, empirical risk minimization with output perturbation, achieves tight unlearning-utility-complexity trade-offs, addressing a previous theoretical gap on the separation from unlearning "for free" via differential privacy, which inherently facilitates the removal of such data. However, such techniques fail with out-of-distribution forget data -- data significantly different from the retain set -- where unlearning time complexity can exceed that of retraining, even for a single sample. To address this, we propose a new robust and noisy gradient descent variant that provably amortizes unlearning time complexity without compromising utility.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose MMD-OPT: a sample-efficient approach for minimizing the risk of collision under arbitrary prediction distribution of the dynamic obstacles. MMD-OPT is based on embedding distribution in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) and the associated Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD). We show how these two concepts can be used to define a sample efficient surrogate for collision risk estimate. We perform extensive simulations to validate the effectiveness of MMD-OPT on both synthetic and real-world datasets. Importantly, we show that trajectory optimization with our MMD-based collision risk surrogate leads to safer trajectories at low sample regimes than popular alternatives based on Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient and effective service delivery in Public Administration (PA) relies on the development and utilization of key performance indicators (KPIs) for evaluating and measuring performance. This paper presents an innovative framework for KPI construction within performance evaluation systems, leveraging Random Forest algorithms and variable importance analysis. The proposed approach identifies key variables that significantly influence PA performance, offering valuable insights into the critical factors driving organizational success. By integrating variable importance analysis with expert consultation, relevant KPIs can be systematically developed, ensuring that improvement strategies address performance-critical areas. The framework incorporates continuous monitoring mechanisms and adaptive phases to refine KPIs in response to evolving administrative needs. This study aims to enhance PA performance through the application of machine learning techniques, fostering a more agile and results-driven approach to public administration.</description>

      <title>Uplift modeling with continuous treatments: A predict-then-optimize approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of uplift modeling is to recommend actions that optimize specific outcomes by determining which entities should receive treatment. One common approach involves two steps: first, an inference step that estimates conditional average treatment effects (CATEs), and second, an optimization step that ranks entities based on their CATE values and assigns treatment to the top k within a given budget. While uplift modeling typically focuses on binary treatments, many real-world applications are characterized by continuous-valued treatments, i.e., a treatment dose. This paper presents a predict-then-optimize framework to allow for continuous treatments in uplift modeling. First, in the inference step, conditional average dose responses (CADRs) are estimated from data using causal machine learning techniques. Second, in the optimization step, we frame the assignment task of continuous treatments as a dose-allocation problem and solve it using integer linear programming (ILP). This approach allows decision-makers to efficiently and effectively allocate treatment doses while balancing resource availability, with the possibility of adding extra constraints like fairness considerations or adapting the objective function to take into account instance-dependent costs and benefits to maximize utility. The experiments compare several CADR estimators and illustrate the trade-offs between policy value and fairness, as well as the impact of an adapted objective function. This showcases the framework's advantages and flexibility across diverse applications in healthcare, lending, and human resource management.

      <title>GeLoRA: Geometric Adaptive Ranks For Efficient LoRA Fine-tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) is computationally intensive because it requires updating all parameters. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) improves efficiency by modifying only a subset of weights but introduces a trade-off between expressivity and computational cost: lower ranks reduce resources but limit expressiveness, while higher ranks enhance expressivity at increased cost. Despite recent advances in adaptive LoRA techniques, existing methods fail to provide a theoretical basis for optimizing the trade-off between model performance and efficiency. We propose Geometric Low-Rank Adaptation (GeLoRA), a novel framework that computes the intrinsic dimensionality of hidden state representations to adaptively select LoRA ranks. We demonstrate that the intrinsic dimension provides a lower bound for the optimal rank of LoRA matrices, allowing for a principled selection that balances efficiency and expressivity. GeLoRA dynamically adjusts the rank for each layer based on the intrinsic dimensionality of its input and output representations, recognizing that not all model parameters equally impact fine-tuning. Empirical validation on multiple tasks shows that GeLoRA consistently outperforms recent baselines within the same parameter budget.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study to which extent additive fairness metrics (statistical parity, equal opportunity and equalized odds) can be influenced in a multi-class classification problem by memorizing a subset of the population. We give explicit expressions for the bias resulting from memorization in terms of the label and group membership distribution of the memorized dataset and the classifier bias on the unmemorized dataset. We also characterize the memorized datasets that eliminate the bias for all three metrics considered. Finally we provide upper and lower bounds on the total probability mass in the memorized dataset that is necessary for the complete elimination of these biases.</description>

      <title>Single-View Graph Contrastive Learning with Soft Neighborhood Awareness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most graph contrastive learning (GCL) methods heavily rely on cross-view contrast, thus facing several concomitant challenges, such as the complexity of designing effective augmentations, the potential for information loss between views, and increased computational costs. To mitigate reliance on cross-view contrasts, we propose \ttt{SIGNA}, a novel single-view graph contrastive learning framework. Regarding the inconsistency between structural connection and semantic similarity of neighborhoods, we resort to soft neighborhood awareness for GCL. Specifically, we leverage dropout to obtain structurally-related yet randomly-noised embedding pairs for neighbors, which serve as potential positive samples. At each epoch, the role of partial neighbors is switched from positive to negative, leading to probabilistic neighborhood contrastive learning effect. Furthermore, we propose a normalized Jensen-Shannon divergence estimator for a better effect of contrastive learning. Surprisingly, experiments on diverse node-level tasks demonstrate that our simple single-view GCL framework consistently outperforms existing methods by margins of up to 21.74% (PPI). In particular, with soft neighborhood awareness, SIGNA can adopt MLPs instead of complicated GCNs as the encoder to generate representations in transductive learning tasks, thus speeding up its inference process by 109 times to 331 times.

      <title>CRVQ: Channel-relaxed Vector Quantization for Extreme Compression of LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Powerful large language models (LLMs) are increasingly expected to be deployed with lower computational costs, enabling their capabilities on resource-constrained devices. Post-training quantization (PTQ) has emerged as a star approach to achieve this ambition, with best methods compressing weights to less than 2 bit on average. In this paper, we propose Channel-Relaxed Vector Quantization (CRVQ), a novel technique that significantly improves the performance of PTQ baselines at the cost of only minimal additional bits. This state-of-the-art extreme compression method achieves its results through two key innovations: (1) carefully selecting and reordering a very small subset of critical weight channels, and (2) leveraging multiple codebooks to relax the constraint of critical channels. With our method, we demonstrate a 38.9% improvement over the current strongest sub-2-bit PTQ baseline, enabling nearer lossless 1-bit compression. Furthermore, our approach offers flexible customization of quantization bit-width and performance, providing a wider range of deployment options for diverse hardware platforms.</description>

      <title>Optimising TinyML with Quantization and Distillation of Transformer and Mamba Models for Indoor Localisation on Edge Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes small and efficient machine learning models (TinyML) for resource-constrained edge devices, specifically for on-device indoor localisation. Typical approaches for indoor localisation rely on centralised remote processing of data transmitted from lower powered devices such as wearables. However, there are several benefits for moving this to the edge device itself, including increased battery life, enhanced privacy, reduced latency and lowered operational costs, all of which are key for common applications such as health monitoring. The work focuses on model compression techniques, including quantization and knowledge distillation, to significantly reduce the model size while maintaining high predictive performance. We base our work on a large state-of-the-art transformer-based model and seek to deploy it within low-power MCUs. We also propose a state-space-based architecture using Mamba as a more compact alternative to the transformer. Our results show that the quantized transformer model performs well within a 64 KB RAM constraint, achieving an effective balance between model size and localisation precision. Additionally, the compact Mamba model has strong performance under even tighter constraints, such as a 32 KB of RAM, without the need for model compression, making it a viable option for more resource-limited environments. We demonstrate that, through our framework, it is feasible to deploy advanced indoor localisation models onto low-power MCUs with restricted memory limitations. The application of these TinyML models in healthcare has the potential to revolutionize patient monitoring by providing accurate, real-time location data while minimizing power consumption, increasing data privacy, improving latency and reducing infrastructure costs.</description>

      <title>Transfer Learning of RSSI to Improve Indoor Localisation Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the growing demand for health monitoring systems, in-home localisation is essential for tracking patient conditions. The unique spatial characteristics of each house required annotated data for Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI)-based monitoring system. However, collecting annotated training data is time-consuming, particularly for patients with limited health conditions. To address this, we propose Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (ConGAN)-based augmentation, combined with our transfer learning framework (T-ConGAN), to enable the transfer of generic RSSI information between different homes, even when data is collected using different experimental protocols. This enhances the performance and scalability of such intelligent systems by reducing the need for annotation in each home. We are the first to demonstrate that BLE RSSI data can be shared across different homes, and that shared information can improve the indoor localisation performance. Our T-ConGAN enhances the macro F1 score of room-level indoor localisation by up to 12.2%, with a remarkable 51% improvement in challenging areas such as stairways or outside spaces. This state-of-the-art RSSI augmentation model significantly enhances the robustness of in-home health monitoring systems.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Prompt Allocation and Tuning for Continual Test-Time Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continual test-time adaptation (CTTA) has recently emerged to adapt a pre-trained source model to continuously evolving target distributions, which accommodates the dynamic nature of real-world environments. To mitigate the risk of catastrophic forgetting in CTTA, existing methods typically incorporate explicit regularization terms to constrain the variation of model parameters. However, they cannot fundamentally resolve catastrophic forgetting because they rely on a single shared model to adapt across all target domains, which inevitably leads to severe inter-domain interference. In this paper, we introduce learnable domain-specific prompts that guide the model to adapt to corresponding target domains, thereby partially disentangling the parameter space of different domains. In the absence of domain identity for target samples, we propose a novel dynamic Prompt AllocatIon aNd Tuning (PAINT) method, which utilizes a query mechanism to dynamically determine whether the current samples come from a known domain or an unexplored one. For known domains, the corresponding domain-specific prompt is directly selected, while for previously unseen domains, a new prompt is allocated. Prompt tuning is subsequently performed using mutual information maximization along with structural regularization. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our PAINT method for CTTA. We have released our code at https://github.com/Cadezzyr/PAINT.</description>

      <title>Auto-Regressive Moving Diffusion Models for Time Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time series forecasting (TSF) is essential in various domains, and recent advancements in diffusion-based TSF models have shown considerable promise. However, these models typically adopt traditional diffusion patterns, treating TSF as a noise-based conditional generation task. This approach neglects the inherent continuous sequential nature of time series, leading to a fundamental misalignment between diffusion mechanisms and the TSF objective, thereby severely impairing performance. To bridge this misalignment, and inspired by the classic Auto-Regressive Moving Average (ARMA) theory, which views time series as continuous sequential progressions evolving from previous data points, we propose a novel Auto-Regressive Moving Diffusion (ARMD) model to first achieve the continuous sequential diffusion-based TSF. Unlike previous methods that start from white Gaussian noise, our model employs chain-based diffusion with priors, accurately modeling the evolution of time series and leveraging intermediate state information to improve forecasting accuracy and stability. Specifically, our approach reinterprets the diffusion process by considering future series as the initial state and historical series as the final state, with intermediate series generated using a sliding-based technique during the forward process. This design aligns the diffusion model's sampling procedure with the forecasting objective, resulting in an unconditional, continuous sequential diffusion TSF model. Extensive experiments conducted on seven widely used datasets demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing diffusion-based TSF models. Our code is available on GitHub: https://github.com/daxin007/ARMD.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Evaluation of Motif Sets in Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time Series Motif Discovery (TSMD), which aims at finding recurring patterns in time series, is an important task in numerous application domains, and many methods for this task exist. These methods are usually evaluated qualitatively. A few metrics for quantitative evaluation, where discovered motifs are compared to some ground truth, have been proposed, but they typically make implicit assumptions that limit their applicability. This paper introduces PROM, a broadly applicable metric that overcomes those limitations, and TSMD-Bench, a benchmark for quantitative evaluation of time series motif discovery. Experiments with PROM and TSMD-Bench show that PROM provides a more comprehensive evaluation than existing metrics, that TSMD-Bench is a more challenging benchmark than earlier ones, and that the combination can help understand the relative performance of TSMD methods. More generally, the proposed approach enables large-scale, systematic performance comparisons in this field.</description>

      <title>A comprehensive interpretable machine learning framework for Mild Cognitive Impairment and Alzheimer's disease diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An interpretable machine learning (ML) framework is introduced to enhance the diagnosis of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) by ensuring robustness of the ML models' interpretations. The dataset used comprises volumetric measurements from brain MRI and genetic data from healthy individuals and patients with MCI/AD, obtained through the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. The existing class imbalance is addressed by an ensemble learning approach, while various attribution-based and counterfactual-based interpretability methods are leveraged towards producing diverse explanations related to the pathophysiology of MCI/AD. A unification method combining SHAP with counterfactual explanations assesses the interpretability techniques' robustness. The best performing model yielded 87.5% balanced accuracy and 90.8% F1-score. The attribution-based interpretability methods highlighted significant volumetric and genetic features related to MCI/AD risk. The unification method provided useful insights regarding those features' necessity and sufficiency, further showcasing their significance in MCI/AD diagnosis.</description>

      <title>Hybrid variable spiking graph neural networks for energy-efficient scientific machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph-based representations for samples of computational mechanics-related datasets can prove instrumental when dealing with problems like irregular domains or molecular structures of materials, etc. To effectively analyze and process such datasets, deep learning offers Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) that utilize techniques like message-passing within their architecture. The issue, however, is that as the individual graph scales and/ or GNN architecture becomes increasingly complex, the increased energy budget of the overall deep learning model makes it unsustainable and restricts its applications in applications like edge computing. To overcome this, we propose in this paper Hybrid Variable Spiking Graph Neural Networks (HVS-GNNs) that utilize Variable Spiking Neurons (VSNs) within their architecture to promote sparse communication and hence reduce the overall energy budget. VSNs, while promoting sparse event-driven computations, also perform well for regression tasks, which are often encountered in computational mechanics applications and are the main target of this paper. Three examples dealing with prediction of mechanical properties of material based on microscale/ mesoscale structures are shown to test the performance of the proposed HVS-GNNs in regression tasks. We have also compared the performance of HVS-GNN architectures with the performance of vanilla GNNs and GNNs utilizing leaky integrate and fire neurons. The results produced show that HVS-GNNs perform well for regression tasks, all while promoting sparse communication and, hence, energy efficiency.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Model with Representation Alignment for Protein Inverse Folding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protein inverse folding is a fundamental problem in bioinformatics, aiming to recover the amino acid sequences from a given protein backbone structure. Despite the success of existing methods, they struggle to fully capture the intricate inter-residue relationships critical for accurate sequence prediction. We propose a novel method that leverages diffusion models with representation alignment (DMRA), which enhances diffusion-based inverse folding by (1) proposing a shared center that aggregates contextual information from the entire protein structure and selectively distributes it to each residue; and (2) aligning noisy hidden representations with clean semantic representations during the denoising process. This is achieved by predefined semantic representations for amino acid types and a representation alignment method that utilizes type embeddings as semantic feedback to normalize each residue. In experiments, we conduct extensive evaluations on the CATH4.2 dataset to demonstrate that DMRA outperforms leading methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance and exhibiting strong generalization capabilities on the TS50 and TS500 datasets.</description>

      <title>A Geometry-Aware Message Passing Neural Network for Modeling Aerodynamics over Airfoils</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computational modeling of aerodynamics is a key problem in aerospace engineering, often involving flows interacting with solid objects such as airfoils. Deep surrogate models have emerged as purely data-driven approaches that learn direct mappings from simulation conditions to solutions based on either simulation or experimental data. Here, we consider modeling of incompressible flows over solid objects, wherein geometric structures are a key factor in determining aerodynamics. To effectively incorporate geometries, we propose a message passing scheme that efficiently and expressively integrates the airfoil shape with the mesh representation. Under this framework, we first obtain a representation of the geometry in the form of a latent graph on the airfoil surface. We subsequently propagate this representation to all collocation points through message passing on a directed, bipartite graph. We demonstrate that this framework supports efficient training by downsampling the solution mesh while avoiding distribution shifts at test time when evaluated on the full mesh. To enable our model to be able to distinguish between distinct spatial regimes of dynamics relative to the airfoil, we represent mesh points in both a leading edge and trailing edge coordinate system. We further enhance the expressiveness of our coordinate system representations by embedding our hybrid Polar-Cartesian coordinates using sinusoidal and spherical harmonics bases. We additionally find that a change of basis to canonicalize input representations with respect to inlet velocity substantially improves generalization. Altogether, these design choices lead to a purely data-driven machine learning framework known as GeoMPNN, which won the Best Student Submission award at the NeurIPS 2024 ML4CFD Competition, placing 4th overall. Our code is publicly available as part of the AIRS library (https://github.com/divelab/AIRS).</description>

      <title>Mixture of neural fields for heterogeneous reconstruction in cryo-EM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) is an experimental technique for protein structure determination that images an ensemble of macromolecules in near-physiological contexts. While recent advances enable the reconstruction of dynamic conformations of a single biomolecular complex, current methods do not adequately model samples with mixed conformational and compositional heterogeneity. In particular, datasets containing mixtures of multiple proteins require the joint inference of structure, pose, compositional class, and conformational states for 3D reconstruction. Here, we present Hydra, an approach that models both conformational and compositional heterogeneity fully ab initio by parameterizing structures as arising from one of K neural fields. We employ a new likelihood-based loss function and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on synthetic datasets composed of mixtures of proteins with large degrees of conformational variability. We additionally demonstrate Hydra on an experimental dataset of a cellular lysate containing a mixture of different protein complexes. Hydra expands the expressivity of heterogeneous reconstruction methods and thus broadens the scope of cryo-EM to increasingly complex samples.</description>

      <title>MOS: Model Surgery for Pre-Trained Model-Based Class-Incremental Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) requires models to continually acquire knowledge of new classes without forgetting old ones. Despite Pre-trained Models (PTMs) have shown excellent performance in CIL, catastrophic forgetting still occurs as the model learns new concepts. Existing work seeks to utilize lightweight components to adjust the PTM, while the forgetting phenomenon still comes from {\em parameter and retrieval} levels. Specifically, iterative updates of the model result in parameter drift, while mistakenly retrieving irrelevant modules leads to the mismatch during inference. To this end, we propose MOdel Surgery (MOS) to rescue the model from forgetting previous knowledge. By training task-specific adapters, we continually adjust the PTM to downstream tasks. To mitigate parameter-level forgetting, we present an adapter merging approach to learn task-specific adapters, which aims to bridge the gap between different components while reserve task-specific information. Besides, to address retrieval-level forgetting, we introduce a training-free self-refined adapter retrieval mechanism during inference, which leverages the model's inherent ability for better adapter retrieval. By jointly rectifying the model with those steps, MOS can robustly resist catastrophic forgetting in the learning process. Extensive experiments on seven benchmark datasets validate MOS's state-of-the-art performance. Code is available at: https://github.com/sun-hailong/AAAI25-MOS</description>

      <title>Search Strategy Generation for Branch and Bound Using Genetic Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Branch-and-Bound (B\&amp;B) is an exact method in integer programming that recursively divides the search space into a tree. During the resolution process, determining the next subproblem to explore within the tree-known as the search strategy-is crucial. Hand-crafted heuristics are commonly used, but none are effective over all problem classes. Recent approaches utilizing neural networks claim to make more intelligent decisions but are computationally expensive. In this paper, we introduce GP2S (Genetic Programming for Search Strategy), a novel machine learning approach that automatically generates a B\&amp;B search strategy heuristic, aiming to make intelligent decisions while being computationally lightweight. We define a policy as a function that evaluates the quality of a B\&amp;B node by combining features from the node and the problem; the search strategy policy is then defined by a best-first search based on this node ranking. The policy space is explored using a genetic programming algorithm, and the policy that achieves the best performance on a training set is selected. We compare our approach with the standard method of the SCIP solver, a recent graph neural network-based method, and handcrafted heuristics. Our first evaluation includes three types of primal hard problems, tested on instances similar to the training set and on larger instances. Our method is at most 2\% slower than the best baseline and consistently outperforms SCIP, achieving an average speedup of 11.3\%. Additionally, GP2S is tested on the MIPLIB 2017 dataset, generating multiple heuristics from different subsets of instances. It exceeds SCIP's average performance in 7 out of 10 cases across 15 times more instances and under a time limit 15 times longer, with some GP2S methods leading on most experiments in terms of the number of feasible solutions or optimality gap.</description>

      <title>STORM: A Spatio-Temporal Factor Model Based on Dual Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders for Financial Trading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In financial trading, factor models are widely used to price assets and capture excess returns from mispricing. Recently, we have witnessed the rise of variational autoencoder-based latent factor models, which learn latent factors self-adaptively. While these models focus on modeling overall market conditions, they often fail to effectively capture the temporal patterns of individual stocks. Additionally, representing multiple factors as single values simplifies the model but limits its ability to capture complex relationships and dependencies. As a result, the learned factors are of low quality and lack diversity, reducing their effectiveness and robustness across different trading periods. To address these issues, we propose a Spatio-Temporal factOR Model based on dual vector quantized variational autoencoders, named STORM, which extracts features of stocks from temporal and spatial perspectives, then fuses and aligns these features at the fine-grained and semantic level, and represents the factors as multi-dimensional embeddings. The discrete codebooks cluster similar factor embeddings, ensuring orthogonality and diversity, which helps distinguish between different factors and enables factor selection in financial trading. To show the performance of the proposed factor model, we apply it to two downstream experiments: portfolio management on two stock datasets and individual trading tasks on six specific stocks. The extensive experiments demonstrate STORM's flexibility in adapting to downstream tasks and superior performance over baseline models.</description>

      <title>A Novel Ensemble-Based Deep Learning Model with Explainable AI for Accurate Kidney Disease Diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) represents a significant global health challenge, characterized by the progressive decline in renal function, leading to the accumulation of waste products and disruptions in fluid balance within the body. Given its pervasive impact on public health, there is a pressing need for effective diagnostic tools to enable timely intervention. Our study delves into the application of cutting-edge transfer learning models for the early detection of CKD. Leveraging a comprehensive and publicly available dataset, we meticulously evaluate the performance of several state-of-the-art models, including EfficientNetV2, InceptionNetV2, MobileNetV2, and the Vision Transformer (ViT) technique. Remarkably, our analysis demonstrates superior accuracy rates, surpassing the 90% threshold with MobileNetV2 and achieving 91.5% accuracy with ViT. Moreover, to enhance predictive capabilities further, we integrate these individual methodologies through ensemble modeling, resulting in our ensemble model exhibiting a remarkable 96% accuracy in the early detection of CKD. This significant advancement holds immense promise for improving clinical outcomes and underscores the critical role of machine learning in addressing complex medical challenges.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Optimization via Continual Variational Last Layer Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gaussian Processes (GPs) are widely seen as the state-of-the-art surrogate models for Bayesian optimization (BO) due to their ability to model uncertainty and their performance on tasks where correlations are easily captured (such as those defined by Euclidean metrics) and their ability to be efficiently updated online. However, the performance of GPs depends on the choice of kernel, and kernel selection for complex correlation structures is often difficult or must be made bespoke. While Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) are a promising direction for higher capacity surrogate models, they have so far seen limited use due to poor performance on some problem types. In this paper, we propose an approach which shows competitive performance on many problem types, including some that BNNs typically struggle with. We build on variational Bayesian last layers (VBLLs), and connect training of these models to exact conditioning in GPs. We exploit this connection to develop an efficient online training algorithm that interleaves conditioning and optimization. Our findings suggest that VBLL networks significantly outperform GPs and other BNN architectures on tasks with complex input correlations, and match the performance of well-tuned GPs on established benchmark tasks.</description>

      <title>Early Detection of At-Risk Students Using Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research presents preliminary work to address the challenge of identifying at-risk students using supervised machine learning and three unique data categories: engagement, demographics, and performance data collected from Fall 2023 using Canvas and the California State University, Fullerton dashboard. We aim to tackle the persistent challenges of higher education retention and student dropout rates by screening for at-risk students and building a high-risk identification system. By focusing on previously overlooked behavioral factors alongside traditional metrics, this work aims to address educational gaps, enhance student outcomes, and significantly boost student success across disciplines at the University. Pre-processing steps take place to establish a target variable, anonymize student information, manage missing data, and identify the most significant features. Given the mixed data types in the datasets and the binary classification nature of this study, this work considers several machine learning models, including Support Vector Machines (SVM), Naive Bayes, K-nearest neighbors (KNN), Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest. These models predict at-risk students and identify critical periods of the semester when student performance is most vulnerable. We will use validation techniques such as train test split and k-fold cross-validation to ensure the reliability of the models. Our analysis indicates that all algorithms generate an acceptable outcome for at-risk student predictions, while Naive Bayes performs best overall.</description>

      <title>Capturing the Temporal Dependence of Training Data Influence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional data influence estimation methods, like influence function, assume that learning algorithms are permutation-invariant with respect to training data. However, modern training paradigms, especially for foundation models using stochastic algorithms and multi-stage curricula, are sensitive to data ordering, thus violating this assumption. This mismatch renders influence functions inadequate for answering a critical question in machine learning: How can we capture the dependence of data influence on the optimization trajectory during training? To address this gap, we formalize the concept of trajectory-specific leave-one-out (LOO) influence, which quantifies the impact of removing a data point from a specific iteration during training, accounting for the exact sequence of data encountered and the model's optimization trajectory. However, exactly evaluating the trajectory-specific LOO presents a significant computational challenge. To address this, we propose data value embedding, a novel technique enabling efficient approximation of trajectory-specific LOO. Specifically, we compute a training data embedding that encapsulates the cumulative interactions between data and the evolving model parameters. The LOO can then be efficiently approximated through a simple dot-product between the data value embedding and the gradient of the given test data. As data value embedding captures training data ordering, it offers valuable insights into model training dynamics. In particular, we uncover distinct phases of data influence, revealing that data points in the early and late stages of training exert a greater impact on the final model. These insights translate into actionable strategies for managing the computational overhead of data selection by strategically timing the selection process, potentially opening new avenues in data curation research.</description>

      <title>Sail into the Headwind: Alignment via Robust Rewards and Dynamic Labels against Reward Hacking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aligning AI systems with human preferences typically suffers from the infamous reward hacking problem, where optimization of an imperfect reward model leads to undesired behaviors. In this paper, we investigate reward hacking in offline preference optimization, which aims to improve an initial model using a preference dataset. We identify two types of reward hacking stemming from statistical fluctuations in the dataset: Type I Reward Hacking due to subpar choices appearing more favorable, and Type II Reward Hacking due to decent choices appearing less favorable. We prove that many (mainstream or theoretical) preference optimization methods suffer from both types of reward hacking. To mitigate Type I Reward Hacking, we propose POWER, a new preference optimization method that combines Guiasu's weighted entropy with a robust reward maximization objective. POWER enjoys finite-sample guarantees under general function approximation, competing with the best covered policy in the data. To mitigate Type II Reward Hacking, we analyze the learning dynamics of preference optimization and develop a novel technique that dynamically updates preference labels toward certain "stationary labels", resulting in diminishing gradients for untrustworthy samples. Empirically, POWER with dynamic labels (POWER-DL) consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on alignment benchmarks, achieving improvements of up to 13.0 points on AlpacaEval 2.0 and 11.5 points on Arena-Hard over DPO, while also improving or maintaining performance on downstream tasks such as mathematical reasoning. Strong theoretical guarantees and empirical results demonstrate the promise of POWER-DL in mitigating reward hacking.</description>

      <title>Does Representation Matter? Exploring Intermediate Layers in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding what defines a good representation in large language models (LLMs) is fundamental to both theoretical understanding and practical applications. In this paper, we investigate the quality of intermediate representations in various LLM architectures, including Transformers and State Space Models (SSMs). We find that intermediate layers often yield more informative representations for downstream tasks than the final layers. To measure the representation quality, we adapt and apply a suite of metrics - such as prompt entropy, curvature, and augmentation-invariance - originally proposed in other contexts. Our empirical study reveals significant architectural differences, how representations evolve throughout training, and how factors like input randomness and prompt length affect each layer. Notably, we observe a bimodal pattern in the entropy of some intermediate layers and consider potential explanations tied to training data. Overall, our results illuminate the internal mechanics of LLMs and guide strategies for architectural optimization and training.</description>

      <title>Obfuscated Activations Bypass LLM Latent-Space Defenses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent latent-space monitoring techniques have shown promise as defenses against LLM attacks. These defenses act as scanners that seek to detect harmful activations before they lead to undesirable actions. This prompts the question: Can models execute harmful behavior via inconspicuous latent states? Here, we study such obfuscated activations. We show that state-of-the-art latent-space defenses -- including sparse autoencoders, representation probing, and latent OOD detection -- are all vulnerable to obfuscated activations. For example, against probes trained to classify harmfulness, our attacks can often reduce recall from 100% to 0% while retaining a 90% jailbreaking rate. However, obfuscation has limits: we find that on a complex task (writing SQL code), obfuscation reduces model performance. Together, our results demonstrate that neural activations are highly malleable: we can reshape activation patterns in a variety of ways, often while preserving a network's behavior. This poses a fundamental challenge to latent-space defenses.</description>

      <title>A Theoretical Analysis of Soft-Label vs Hard-Label Training in Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowledge distillation, where a small student model learns from a pre-trained large teacher model, has achieved substantial empirical success since the seminal work of \citep{hinton2015distilling}. Despite prior theoretical studies exploring the benefits of knowledge distillation, an important question remains unanswered: why does soft-label training from the teacher require significantly fewer neurons than directly training a small neural network with hard labels? To address this, we first present motivating experimental results using simple neural network models on a binary classification problem. These results demonstrate that soft-label training consistently outperforms hard-label training in accuracy, with the performance gap becoming more pronounced as the dataset becomes increasingly difficult to classify. We then substantiate these observations with a theoretical contribution based on two-layer neural network models. Specifically, we show that soft-label training using gradient descent requires only $O\left(\frac{1}{\gamma^2 \epsilon}\right)$ neurons to achieve a classification loss averaged over epochs smaller than some $\epsilon &gt; 0$, where $\gamma$ is the separation margin of the limiting kernel. In contrast, hard-label training requires $O\left(\frac{1}{\gamma^4} \cdot \ln\left(\frac{1}{\epsilon}\right)\right)$ neurons, as derived from an adapted version of the gradient descent analysis in \citep{ji2020polylogarithmic}. This implies that when $\gamma \leq \epsilon$, i.e., when the dataset is challenging to classify, the neuron requirement for soft-label training can be significantly lower than that for hard-label training. Finally, we present experimental results on deep neural networks, further validating these theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Neptune: The Long Orbit to Benchmarking Long Video Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper describes a semi-automatic pipeline to generate challenging question-answer-decoy sets for understanding long videos. Many existing video datasets and models are focused on short clips (10s-30s). While some long video datasets do exist, they can often be solved by powerful image models applied per frame (and often to very few frames) in a video, and are usually manually annotated at high cost. In order to mitigate both these problems, we propose a scalable dataset creation pipeline which leverages large models (VLMs and LLMs), to automatically generate dense, time-aligned video captions, as well as tough question answer decoy sets for video segments (up to 15 minutes in length). Our dataset Neptune covers a broad range of long video reasoning abilities and consists of a subset that emphasizes multimodal reasoning. Since existing metrics for open-ended question answering are either rule-based or may rely on proprietary models, we provide a new open source model-based metric GEM to score open-ended responses on Neptune. Benchmark evaluations reveal that most current open-source long video models perform poorly on Neptune, particularly on questions testing temporal ordering, counting and state changes. Through Neptune, we aim to spur the development of more advanced models capable of understanding long videos. The dataset is available at https://github.com/google-deepmind/neptune</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05781v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stable diffusion plays a crucial role in generating high-quality images. However, image generation is time-consuming and memory-intensive. To address this, stable-diffusion.cpp (Sdcpp) emerges as an efficient inference framework to accelerate the diffusion models. Although it is lightweight, the current implementation of ggml_conv_2d operator in Sdcpp is suboptimal, exhibiting both high inference latency and massive memory usage. To address this, in this work, we present an optimized version of Sdcpp leveraging the Winograd algorithm to accelerate 2D convolution operations, which is the primary bottleneck in the pipeline. By analyzing both dependent and independent computation graphs, we exploit the device's locality and parallelism to achieve substantial performance improvements. Our framework delivers correct end-to-end results across various stable diffusion models, including SDv1.4, v1.5, v2.1, SDXL, and SDXL-Turbo. Our evaluation results demonstrate a speedup up to 2.76x for individual convolutional layers and an inference speedup up to 4.79x for the overall image generation process, compared with the original Sdcpp on M1 pro.

      <title>Multi-modal Representation Learning Enables Accurate Protein Function Prediction in Low-Data Setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we propose HOPER (HOlistic ProtEin Representation), a novel multimodal learning framework designed to enhance protein function prediction (PFP) in low-data settings. The challenge of predicting protein functions is compounded by the limited availability of labeled data. Traditional machine learning models already struggle in such cases, and while deep learning models excel with abundant data, they also face difficulties when data is scarce. HOPER addresses this issue by integrating three distinct modalities - protein sequences, biomedical text, and protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks - to create a comprehensive protein representation. The model utilizes autoencoders to generate holistic embeddings, which are then employed for PFP tasks using transfer learning. HOPER outperforms existing methods on a benchmark dataset across all Gene Ontology categories, i.e., molecular function, biological process, and cellular component. Additionally, we demonstrate its practical utility by identifying new immune-escape proteins in lung adenocarcinoma, offering insights into potential therapeutic targets. Our results highlight the effectiveness of multimodal representation learning for overcoming data limitations in biological research, potentially enabling more accurate and scalable protein function prediction.

      <title>Capacitive Touch Sensor Modeling With a Physics-informed Neural Network and Maxwell's Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Maxwell's equations are the fundamental equations for understanding electric and magnetic field interactions and play a crucial role in designing and optimizing sensor systems like capacitive touch sensors, which are widely prevalent in automotive switches and smartphones. Ensuring robust functionality and stability of the sensors in dynamic environments necessitates profound domain expertise and computationally intensive multi-physics simulations. This paper introduces a novel approach using a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) based surrogate model to accelerate the design process. The PINN model solves the governing electrostatic equations describing the interaction between a finger and a capacitive sensor. Inputs include spatial coordinates from a 3D domain encompassing the finger, sensor, and PCB, along with finger distances. By incorporating the electrostatic equations directly into the neural network's loss function, the model captures the underlying physics. The learned model thus serves as a surrogate sensor model on which inference can be carried out in seconds for different experimental setups without the need to run simulations. Efficacy results evaluated on unseen test cases demonstrate the significant potential of PINNs in accelerating the development and design optimization of capacitive touch sensors.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Code-Switching ASR Leveraging Non-Peaky CTC Loss and Deep Language Posterior Injection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Code-switching-where multilingual speakers alternately switch between languages during conversations-still poses significant challenges to end-to-end (E2E) automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems due to phenomena of both acoustic and semantic confusion. This issue arises because ASR systems struggle to handle the rapid alternation of languages effectively, which often leads to significant performance degradation. Our main contributions are at least threefold: First, we incorporate language identification (LID) information into several intermediate layers of the encoder, aiming to enrich output embeddings with more detailed language information. Secondly, through the novel application of language boundary alignment loss, the subsequent ASR modules are enabled to more effectively utilize the knowledge of internal language posteriors. Third, we explore the feasibility of using language posteriors to facilitate deep interaction between shared encoder and language-specific encoders. Through comprehensive experiments on the SEAME corpus, we have verified that our proposed method outperforms the prior-art method, disentangle based mixture-of-experts (D-MoE), further enhancing the acuity of the encoder to languages.</description>

      <title>GeoConformal prediction: a model-agnostic framework of measuring the uncertainty of spatial prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatial prediction is a fundamental task in geography. In recent years, with advances in geospatial artificial intelligence (GeoAI), numerous models have been developed to improve the accuracy of geographic variable predictions. Beyond achieving higher accuracy, it is equally important to obtain predictions with uncertainty measures to enhance model credibility and support responsible spatial prediction. Although geostatistic methods like Kriging offer some level of uncertainty assessment, such as Kriging variance, these measurements are not always accurate and lack general applicability to other spatial models. To address this issue, we propose a model-agnostic uncertainty assessment method called GeoConformal Prediction, which incorporates geographical weighting into conformal prediction. We applied it to two classic spatial prediction cases, spatial regression and spatial interpolation, to evaluate its reliability. First, in the spatial regression case, we used XGBoost to predict housing prices, followed by GeoConformal to calculate uncertainty. Our results show that GeoConformal achieved a coverage rate of 93.67%, while Bootstrap methods only reached a maximum coverage of 68.33% after 2000 runs. Next, we applied GeoConformal to spatial interpolation models. We found that the uncertainty obtained from GeoConformal aligned closely with the variance in Kriging. Finally, using GeoConformal, we analyzed the sources of uncertainty in spatial prediction. We found that explicitly including local features in AI models can significantly reduce prediction uncertainty, especially in areas with strong local dependence. Our findings suggest that GeoConformal holds potential not only for geographic knowledge discovery but also for guiding the design of future GeoAI models, paving the way for more reliable and interpretable spatial prediction frameworks.</description>

      <title>A feature refinement module for light-weight semantic segmentation network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low computational complexity and high segmentation accuracy are both essential to the real-world semantic segmentation tasks. However, to speed up the model inference, most existing approaches tend to design light-weight networks with a very limited number of parameters, leading to a considerable degradation in accuracy due to the decrease of the representation ability of the networks. To solve the problem, this paper proposes a novel semantic segmentation method to improve the capacity of obtaining semantic information for the light-weight network. Specifically, a feature refinement module (FRM) is proposed to extract semantics from multi-stage feature maps generated by the backbone and capture non-local contextual information by utilizing a transformer block. On Cityscapes and Bdd100K datasets, the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves a promising trade-off between accuracy and computational cost, especially for Cityscapes test set where 80.4% mIoU is achieved and only 214.82 GFLOPs are required.</description>

      <title>A Deep Semantic Segmentation Network with Semantic and Contextual Refinements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semantic segmentation is a fundamental task in multimedia processing, which can be used for analyzing, understanding, editing contents of images and videos, among others. To accelerate the analysis of multimedia data, existing segmentation researches tend to extract semantic information by progressively reducing the spatial resolutions of feature maps. However, this approach introduces a misalignment problem when restoring the resolution of high-level feature maps. In this paper, we design a Semantic Refinement Module (SRM) to address this issue within the segmentation network. Specifically, SRM is designed to learn a transformation offset for each pixel in the upsampled feature maps, guided by high-resolution feature maps and neighboring offsets. By applying these offsets to the upsampled feature maps, SRM enhances the semantic representation of the segmentation network, particularly for pixels around object boundaries. Furthermore, a Contextual Refinement Module (CRM) is presented to capture global context information across both spatial and channel dimensions. To balance dimensions between channel and space, we aggregate the semantic maps from all four stages of the backbone to enrich channel context information. The efficacy of these proposed modules is validated on three widely used datasets-Cityscapes, Bdd100K, and ADE20K-demonstrating superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, this paper extends these modules to a lightweight segmentation network, achieving an mIoU of 82.5% on the Cityscapes validation set with only 137.9 GFLOPs.</description>

      <title>Efficient Gravitational Wave Parameter Estimation via Knowledge Distillation: A ResNet1D-IAF Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rapid development of gravitational wave astronomy, the increasing number of detected events necessitates efficient methods for parameter estimation and model updates. This study presents a novel approach using knowledge distillation techniques to enhance computational efficiency in gravitational wave analysis. We develop a framework combining ResNet1D and Inverse Autoregressive Flow (IAF) architectures, where knowledge from a complex teacher model is transferred to a lighter student model. Our experimental results show that the student model achieves a validation loss of 3.70 with optimal configuration (40,100,0.75), compared to the teacher model's 4.09, while reducing the number of parameters by 43\%. The Jensen-Shannon divergence between teacher and student models remains below 0.0001 across network layers, indicating successful knowledge transfer. By optimizing ResNet layers (7-16) and hidden features (70-120), we achieve a 35\% reduction in inference time while maintaining parameter estimation accuracy. This work demonstrates significant improvements in computational efficiency for gravitational wave data analysis, providing valuable insights for real-time event processing.</description>

      <title>LatentQA: Teaching LLMs to Decode Activations Into Natural Language</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interpretability methods seek to understand language model representations, yet the outputs of most such methods -- circuits, vectors, scalars -- are not immediately human-interpretable. In response, we introduce LatentQA, the task of answering open-ended questions about model activations in natural language. Towards solving LatentQA, we propose Latent Interpretation Tuning (LIT), which finetunes a decoder LLM on a dataset of activations and associated question-answer pairs, similar to how visual instruction tuning trains on question-answer pairs associated with images. We use the decoder for diverse reading applications, such as extracting relational knowledge from representations or uncovering system prompts governing model behavior. Our decoder also specifies a differentiable loss that we use to control models, such as debiasing models on stereotyped sentences and controlling the sentiment of generations. Finally, we extend LatentQA to reveal harmful model capabilities, such as generating recipes for bioweapons and code for hacking.</description>

      <title>A quantum-classical reinforcement learning model to play Atari games</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning have demonstrated the potential of quantum learning models based on parametrized quantum circuits as an alternative to deep learning models. On the one hand, these findings have shown the ultimate exponential speed-ups in learning that full-blown quantum models can offer in certain -- artificially constructed -- environments. On the other hand, they have demonstrated the ability of experimentally accessible PQCs to solve OpenAI Gym benchmarking tasks. However, it remains an open question whether these near-term QRL techniques can be successfully applied to more complex problems exhibiting high-dimensional observation spaces. In this work, we bridge this gap and present a hybrid model combining a PQC with classical feature encoding and post-processing layers that is capable of tackling Atari games. A classical model, subjected to architectural restrictions similar to those present in the hybrid model is constructed to serve as a reference. Our numerical investigation demonstrates that the proposed hybrid model is capable of solving the Pong environment and achieving scores comparable to the classical reference in Breakout. Furthermore, our findings shed light on important hyperparameter settings and design choices that impact the interplay of the quantum and classical components. This work contributes to the understanding of near-term quantum learning models and makes an important step towards their deployment in real-world RL scenarios.</description>

      <title>DocVLM: Make Your VLM an Efficient Reader</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel in diverse visual tasks but face challenges in document understanding, which requires fine-grained text processing. While typical visual tasks perform well with low-resolution inputs, reading-intensive applications demand high-resolution, resulting in significant computational overhead. Using OCR-extracted text in VLM prompts partially addresses this issue but underperforms compared to full-resolution counterpart, as it lacks the complete visual context needed for optimal performance. We introduce DocVLM, a method that integrates an OCR-based modality into VLMs to enhance document processing while preserving original weights. Our approach employs an OCR encoder to capture textual content and layout, compressing these into a compact set of learned queries incorporated into the VLM. Comprehensive evaluations across leading VLMs show that DocVLM significantly reduces reliance on high-resolution images for document understanding. In limited-token regimes (448$\times$448), DocVLM with 64 learned queries improves DocVQA results from 56.0% to 86.6% when integrated with InternVL2 and from 84.4% to 91.2% with Qwen2-VL. In LLaVA-OneVision, DocVLM achieves improved results while using 80% less image tokens. The reduced token usage allows processing multiple pages effectively, showing impressive zero-shot results on DUDE and state-of-the-art performance on MP-DocVQA, highlighting DocVLM's potential for applications requiring high-performance and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Sampling-based Continuous Optimization with Coupled Variables for RNA Design</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The task of RNA design given a target structure aims to find a sequence that can fold into that structure. It is a computationally hard problem where some version(s) have been proven to be NP-hard. As a result, heuristic methods such as local search have been popular for this task, but by only exploring a fixed number of candidates. They can not keep up with the exponential growth of the design space, and often perform poorly on longer and harder-to-design structures. We instead formulate these discrete problems as continuous optimization, which starts with a distribution over all possible candidate sequences, and uses gradient descent to improve the expectation of an objective function. We define novel distributions based on coupled variables to rule out invalid sequences given the target structure and to model the correlation between nucleotides. To make it universally applicable to any objective function, we use sampling to approximate the expected objective function, to estimate the gradient, and to select the final candidate. Compared to the state-of-the-art methods, our work consistently outperforms them in key metrics such as Boltzmann probability, ensemble defect, and energy gap, especially on long and hard-to-design puzzles in the Eterna100 benchmark. Our code is available at: http://github.com/weiyutang1010/ncrna_design.</description>

      <title>Proactive Adversarial Defense: Harnessing Prompt Tuning in Vision-Language Models to Detect Unseen Backdoored Images</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Backdoor attacks pose a critical threat by embedding hidden triggers into inputs, causing models to misclassify them into target labels. While extensive research has focused on mitigating these attacks in object recognition models through weight fine-tuning, much less attention has been given to detecting backdoored samples directly. Given the vast datasets used in training, manual inspection for backdoor triggers is impractical, and even state-of-the-art defense mechanisms fail to fully neutralize their impact. To address this gap, we introduce a groundbreaking method to detect unseen backdoored images during both training and inference. Leveraging the transformative success of prompt tuning in Vision Language Models (VLMs), our approach trains learnable text prompts to differentiate clean images from those with hidden backdoor triggers. Experiments demonstrate the exceptional efficacy of this method, achieving an impressive average accuracy of 86% across two renowned datasets for detecting unseen backdoor triggers, establishing a new standard in backdoor defense.</description>

      <title>Beyond Knowledge Silos: Task Fingerprinting for Democratization of Medical Imaging AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The field of medical imaging AI is currently undergoing rapid transformations, with methodical research increasingly translated into clinical practice. Despite these successes, research suffers from knowledge silos, hindering collaboration and progress: Existing knowledge is scattered across publications and many details remain unpublished, while privacy regulations restrict data sharing. In the spirit of democratizing of AI, we propose a framework for secure knowledge transfer in the field of medical image analysis. The key to our approach is dataset "fingerprints", structured representations of feature distributions, that enable quantification of task similarity. We tested our approach across 71 distinct tasks and 12 medical imaging modalities by transferring neural architectures, pretraining, augmentation policies, and multi-task learning. According to comprehensive analyses, our method outperforms traditional methods for identifying relevant knowledge and facilitates collaborative model training. Our framework fosters the democratization of AI in medical imaging and could become a valuable tool for promoting faster scientific advancement.</description>

      <title>LLaVA-Zip: Adaptive Visual Token Compression with Intrinsic Image Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) utilizing instruction-following data, such as LLaVA, have achieved great progress in the industry. A major limitation in these models is that visual tokens consume a substantial portion of the maximum token limit in large language models (LLMs), leading to increased computational demands and decreased performance when prompts include multiple images or videos. Industry solutions often mitigate this issue by increasing computational power, but this approach is less feasible in academic environments with limited resources. In this study, we propose Dynamic Feature Map Reduction (DFMR) based on LLaVA-1.5 to address the challenge of visual token overload. DFMR dynamically compresses the visual tokens, freeing up token capacity. Our experimental results demonstrate that integrating DFMR into LLaVA-1.5 significantly improves the performance of LLaVA in varied visual token lengths, offering a promising solution for extending LLaVA to handle multi-image and video scenarios in resource-constrained academic environments and it can also be applied in industry settings for data augmentation to help mitigate the scarcity of open-domain image-text pair datasets in the continued pretraining stage.</description>

      <title>Reducing Popularity Influence by Addressing Position Bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Position bias poses a persistent challenge in recommender systems, with much of the existing research focusing on refining ranking relevance and driving user engagement. However, in practical applications, the mitigation of position bias does not always result in detectable short-term improvements in ranking relevance. This paper provides an alternative, practically useful view of what position bias reduction methods can achieve. It demonstrates that position debiasing can spread visibility and interactions more evenly across the assortment, effectively reducing a skew in the popularity of items induced by the position bias through a feedback loop. We offer an explanation of how position bias affects item popularity. This includes an illustrative model of the item popularity histogram and the effect of the position bias on its skewness. Through offline and online experiments on our large-scale e-commerce platform, we show that position debiasing can significantly improve assortment utilization, without any degradation in user engagement or financial metrics. This makes the ranking fairer and helps attract more partners or content providers, benefiting the customers and the business in the long term.</description>

      <title>Generative Modeling with Explicit Memory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies indicate that the denoising process in deep generative diffusion models implicitly learns and memorizes semantic information from the data distribution. These findings suggest that capturing more complex data distributions requires larger neural networks, leading to a substantial increase in computational demands, which in turn become the primary bottleneck in both training and inference of diffusion models. To this end, we introduce \textbf{G}enerative \textbf{M}odeling with \textbf{E}xplicit \textbf{M}emory (GMem), leveraging an external memory bank in both training and sampling phases of diffusion models. This approach preserves semantic information from data distributions, reducing reliance on neural network capacity for learning and generalizing across diverse datasets. The results are significant: our GMem enhances both training, sampling efficiency, and generation quality. For instance, on ImageNet at $256 \times 256$ resolution, GMem accelerates SiT training by over $46.7\times$, achieving the performance of a SiT model trained for $7M$ steps in fewer than $150K$ steps. Compared to the most efficient existing method, REPA, GMem still offers a $16\times$ speedup, attaining an FID score of 5.75 within $250K$ steps, whereas REPA requires over $4M$ steps. Additionally, our method achieves state-of-the-art generation quality, with an FID score of {3.56} without classifier-free guidance on ImageNet $256\times256$.

      <title>On the Precise Asymptotics and Refined Regret of the Variance-Aware UCB Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the behavior of the Upper Confidence Bound-Variance (UCB-V) algorithm for Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) problems, a variant of the canonical Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm that incorporates variance estimates into its decision-making process. More precisely, we provide an asymptotic characterization of the arm-pulling rates of UCB-V, extending recent results for the canonical UCB in Kalvit and Zeevi (2021) and Khamaru and Zhang (2024). In an interesting contrast to the canonical UCB, we show that the behavior of UCB-V can exhibit instability, meaning that the arm-pulling rates may not always be asymptotically deterministic. Besides the asymptotic characterization, we also provide non-asymptotic bounds for arm-pulling rates in the high probability regime, offering insights into regret analysis. As an application of this high probability result, we show that UCB-V can achieve a refined regret bound, previously unknown even for more complicate and advanced variance-aware online decision-making algorithms.</description>

      <title>MOPI-HFRS: A Multi-objective Personalized Health-aware Food Recommendation System with LLM-enhanced Interpretation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The prevalence of unhealthy eating habits has become an increasingly concerning issue in the United States. However, major food recommendation platforms (e.g., Yelp) continue to prioritize users' dietary preferences over the healthiness of their choices. Although efforts have been made to develop health-aware food recommendation systems, the personalization of such systems based on users' specific health conditions remains under-explored. In addition, few research focus on the interpretability of these systems, which hinders users from assessing the reliability of recommendations and impedes the practical deployment of these systems. In response to this gap, we first establish two large-scale personalized health-aware food recommendation benchmarks at the first attempt. We then develop a novel framework, Multi-Objective Personalized Interpretable Health-aware Food Recommendation System (MOPI-HFRS), which provides food recommendations by jointly optimizing the three objectives: user preference, personalized healthiness and nutritional diversity, along with an large language model (LLM)-enhanced reasoning module to promote healthy dietary knowledge through the interpretation of recommended results. Specifically, this holistic graph learning framework first utilizes two structure learning and a structure pooling modules to leverage both descriptive features and health data. Then it employs Pareto optimization to achieve designed multi-facet objectives. Finally, to further promote the healthy dietary knowledge and awareness, we exploit an LLM by utilizing knowledge-infusion, prompting the LLMs with knowledge obtained from the recommendation model for interpretation.</description>

      <title>Emulating the Global Change Analysis Model with Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Global Change Analysis Model (GCAM) simulates complex interactions between the coupled Earth and human systems, providing valuable insights into the co-evolution of land, water, and energy sectors under different future scenarios. Understanding the sensitivities and drivers of this multisectoral system can lead to more robust understanding of the different pathways to particular outcomes. The interactions and complexity of the coupled human-Earth systems make GCAM simulations costly to run at scale - a requirement for large ensemble experiments which explore uncertainty in model parameters and outputs. A differentiable emulator with similar predictive power, but greater efficiency, could provide novel scenario discovery and analysis of GCAM and its outputs, requiring fewer runs of GCAM. As a first use case, we train a neural network on an existing large ensemble that explores a range of GCAM inputs related to different relative contributions of energy production sources, with a focus on wind and solar. We complement this existing ensemble with interpolated input values and a wider selection of outputs, predicting 22,528 GCAM outputs across time, sectors, and regions. We report a median $R^2$ score of 0.998 for the emulator's predictions and an $R^2$ score of 0.812 for its input-output sensitivity.</description>

      <title>Quantum Kernel-Based Long Short-term Memory for Climate Time-Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the Quantum Kernel-Based Long short-memory (QK-LSTM) network, which integrates quantum kernel methods into classical LSTM architectures to enhance predictive accuracy and computational efficiency in climate time-series forecasting tasks, such as Air Quality Index (AQI) prediction. By embedding classical inputs into high-dimensional quantum feature spaces, QK-LSTM captures intricate nonlinear dependencies and temporal dynamics with fewer trainable parameters. Leveraging quantum kernel methods allows for efficient computation of inner products in quantum spaces, addressing the computational challenges faced by classical models and variational quantum circuit-based models. Designed for the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era, QK-LSTM supports scalable hybrid quantum-classical implementations. Experimental results demonstrate that QK-LSTM outperforms classical LSTM networks in AQI forecasting, showcasing its potential for environmental monitoring and resource-constrained scenarios, while highlighting the broader applicability of quantum-enhanced machine learning frameworks in tackling large-scale, high-dimensional climate datasets.</description>

      <title>Beyond Reweighting: On the Predictive Role of Covariate Shift in Effect Generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many existing approaches to generalizing statistical inference amidst distribution shift operate under the covariate shift assumption, which posits that the conditional distribution of unobserved variables given observable ones is invariant across populations. However, recent empirical investigations have demonstrated that adjusting for shift in observed variables (covariate shift) is often insufficient for generalization. In other words, covariate shift does not typically ``explain away'' the distribution shift between settings. As such, addressing the unknown yet non-negligible shift in the unobserved variables given observed ones (conditional shift) is crucial for generalizable inference.
  In this paper, we present a series of empirical evidence from two large-scale multi-site replication studies to support a new role of covariate shift in ``predicting'' the strength of the unknown conditional shift. Analyzing 680 studies across 65 sites, we find that even though the conditional shift is non-negligible, its strength can often be bounded by that of the observable covariate shift. However, this pattern only emerges when the two sources of shifts are quantified by our proposed standardized, ``pivotal'' measures. We then interpret this phenomenon by connecting it to similar patterns that can be theoretically derived from a random distribution shift model. Finally, we demonstrate that exploiting the predictive role of covariate shift leads to reliable and efficient uncertainty quantification for target estimates in generalization tasks with partially observed data. Overall, our empirical and theoretical analyses suggest a new way to approach the problem of distributional shift, generalizability, and external validity.</description>

      <title>Multi-objective Combinatorial Methodology for Nuclear Reactor Site Assessment: A Case Study for the United States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the global demand for clean energy intensifies to achieve sustainability and net-zero carbon emission goals, nuclear energy stands out as a reliable solution. However, fully harnessing its potential requires overcoming key challenges, such as the high capital costs associated with nuclear power plants (NPPs). One promising strategy to mitigate these costs involves repurposing sites with existing infrastructure, including coal power plant (CPP) locations, which offer pre-built facilities and utilities. Additionally, brownfield sites - previously developed or underutilized lands often impacted by industrial activity - present another compelling alternative. These sites typically feature valuable infrastructure that can significantly reduce the costs of NPP development. This study introduces a novel multi-objective optimization methodology, leveraging combinatorial search to evaluate over 30,000 potential NPP sites in the United States. Our approach addresses gaps in the current practice of assigning pre-determined weights to each site attribute that could lead to bias in the ranking. Each site is assigned a performance-based score, derived from a detailed combinatorial analysis of its site attributes. The methodology generates a comprehensive database comprising site locations (inputs), attributes (outputs), site score (outputs), and the contribution of each attribute to the site score (outputs). We then use this database to train a machine learning neural network model, enabling rapid predictions of nuclear siting suitability across any location in the contiguous United States.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of how a trusted, but computationally bounded agent (a 'verifier') can learn to interact with one or more powerful but untrusted agents ('provers') in order to solve a given task. More specifically, we study the case in which agents are represented using neural networks and refer to solutions of this problem as neural interactive proofs. First we introduce a unifying framework based on prover-verifier games, which generalises previously proposed interaction protocols. We then describe several new protocols for generating neural interactive proofs, and provide a theoretical comparison of both new and existing approaches. Finally, we support this theory with experiments in two domains: a toy graph isomorphism problem that illustrates the key ideas, and a code validation task using large language models. In so doing, we aim to create a foundation for future work on neural interactive proofs and their application in building safer AI systems.</description>

      <title>Interpreting Graphic Notation with MusicLDM: An AI Improvisation of Cornelius Cardew's Treatise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a novel method for composing and improvising music inspired by Cornelius Cardew's Treatise, using AI to bridge graphic notation and musical expression. By leveraging OpenAI's ChatGPT to interpret the abstract visual elements of Treatise, we convert these graphical images into descriptive textual prompts. These prompts are then input into MusicLDM, a pre-trained latent diffusion model designed for music generation. We introduce a technique called "outpainting," which overlaps sections of AI-generated music to create a seamless and cohesive composition. We demostrate a new perspective on performing and interpreting graphic scores, showing how AI can transform visual stimuli into sound and expand the creative possibilities in contemporary/experimental music composition.

      <title>Belted and Ensembled Neural Network for Linear and Nonlinear Sufficient Dimension Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a unified, flexible, and easy-to-implement framework of sufficient dimension reduction that can accommodate both linear and nonlinear dimension reduction, and both the conditional distribution and the conditional mean as the targets of estimation. This unified framework is achieved by a specially structured neural network -- the Belted and Ensembled Neural Network (BENN) -- that consists of a narrow latent layer, which we call the belt, and a family of transformations of the response, which we call the ensemble. By strategically placing the belt at different layers of the neural network, we can achieve linear or nonlinear sufficient dimension reduction, and by choosing the appropriate transformation families, we can achieve dimension reduction for the conditional distribution or the conditional mean. Moreover, thanks to the advantage of the neural network, the method is very fast to compute, overcoming a computation bottleneck of the traditional sufficient dimension reduction estimators, which involves the inversion of a matrix of dimension either p or n. We develop the algorithm and convergence rate of our method, compare it with existing sufficient dimension reduction methods, and apply it to two data examples.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Facial Consistency in Conditional Video Generation via Facial Landmark Transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Landmark-guided character animation generation is an important field. Generating character animations with facial features consistent with a reference image remains a significant challenge in conditional video generation, especially involving complex motions like dancing. Existing methods often fail to maintain facial feature consistency due to mismatches between the facial landmarks extracted from source videos and the target facial features in the reference image. To address this problem, we propose a facial landmark transformation method based on the 3D Morphable Model (3DMM). We obtain transformed landmarks that align with the target facial features by reconstructing 3D faces from the source landmarks and adjusting the 3DMM parameters to match the reference image. Our method improves the facial consistency between the generated videos and the reference images, effectively improving the facial feature mismatch problem.</description>

      <title>Predicting Emergency Department Visits for Patients with Type II Diabetes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over 30 million Americans are affected by Type II diabetes (T2D), a treatable condition with significant health risks. This study aims to develop and validate predictive models using machine learning (ML) techniques to estimate emergency department (ED) visits among patients with T2D. Data for these patients was obtained from the HealthShare Exchange (HSX), focusing on demographic details, diagnoses, and vital signs. Our sample contained 34,151 patients diagnosed with T2D which resulted in 703,065 visits overall between 2017 and 2021. A workflow integrated EMR data with SDoH for ML predictions. A total of 87 out of 2,555 features were selected for model construction. Various machine learning algorithms, including CatBoost, Ensemble Learning, K-nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Classification (SVC), Random Forest, and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), were employed with tenfold cross-validation to predict whether a patient is at risk of an ED visit. The ROC curves for Random Forest, XGBoost, Ensemble Learning, CatBoost, KNN, and SVC, were 0.82, 0.82, 0.82, 0.81, 0.72, 0.68, respectively. Ensemble Learning and Random Forest models demonstrated superior predictive performance in terms of discrimination, calibration, and clinical applicability. These models are reliable tools for predicting risk of ED visits among patients with T2D. They can estimate future ED demand and assist clinicians in identifying critical factors associated with ED utilization, enabling early interventions to reduce such visits. The top five important features were age, the difference between visitation gaps, visitation gaps, R10 or abdominal and pelvic pain, and the Index of Concentration at the Extremes (ICE) for income.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We applied machine learning to the entire data history of ESO's High Accuracy Radial Velocity Planet Searcher (HARPS) instrument. Our primary goal was to recover the physical properties of the observed objects, with a secondary emphasis on simulating spectra. We systematically investigated the impact of various factors on the accuracy and fidelity of the results, including the use of simulated data, the effect of varying amounts of real training data, network architectures, and learning paradigms. Our approach integrates supervised and unsupervised learning techniques within autoencoder frameworks. Our methodology leverages an existing simulation model that utilizes a library of existing stellar spectra in which the emerging flux is computed from first principles rooted in physics and a HARPS instrument model to generate simulated spectra comparable to observational data. We trained standard and variational autoencoders on HARPS data to predict spectral parameters and generate spectra. Our models excel at predicting spectral parameters and compressing real spectra, and they achieved a mean prediction error of approximately 50 K for effective temperatures, making them relevant for most astrophysical applications. Furthermore, the models predict metallicity ([M/H]) and surface gravity (log g) with an accuracy of approximately 0.03 dex and 0.04 dex, respectively, underscoring their broad applicability in astrophysical research. The models' computational efficiency, with processing times of 779.6 ms on CPU and 3.97 ms on GPU, makes them valuable for high-throughput applications like massive spectroscopic surveys and large archival studies. By achieving accuracy comparable to classical methods with significantly reduced computation time, our methodology enhances the scope and efficiency of spectroscopic analysis.</description>

      <title>Motor Imagery Classification for Asynchronous EEG-Based Brain-Computer Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motor imagery (MI) based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) enable the direct control of external devices through the imagined movements of various body parts. Unlike previous systems that used fixed-length EEG trials for MI decoding, asynchronous BCIs aim to detect the user's MI without explicit triggers. They are challenging to implement, because the algorithm needs to first distinguish between resting-states and MI trials, and then classify the MI trials into the correct task, all without any triggers. This paper proposes a sliding window prescreening and classification (SWPC) approach for MI-based asynchronous BCIs, which consists of two modules: a prescreening module to screen MI trials out of the resting-state, and a classification module for MI classification. Both modules are trained with supervised learning followed by self-supervised learning, which refines the feature extractors. Within-subject and cross-subject asynchronous MI classifications on four different EEG datasets validated the effectiveness of SWPC, i.e., it always achieved the highest average classification accuracy, and outperformed the best state-of-the-art baseline on each dataset by about 2%.</description>

      <title>Dial-In LLM: Human-Aligned Dialogue Intent Clustering with LLM-in-the-loop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of customer intention from dialogue plays an important role in automated support system. However, traditional text clustering methods are poorly aligned with human perceptions due to the shift from embedding distance to semantic distance, and existing quantitative metrics for text clustering may not accurately reflect the true quality of intent clusters. In this paper, we leverage the superior language understanding capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) for designing better-calibrated intent clustering algorithms. We first establish the foundation by verifying the robustness of fine-tuned LLM utility in semantic coherence evaluation and cluster naming, resulting in an accuracy of 97.50% and 94.40%, respectively, when compared to the human-labeled ground truth. Then, we propose an iterative clustering algorithm that facilitates cluster-level refinement and the continuous discovery of high-quality intent clusters. Furthermore, we present several LLM-in-the-loop semi-supervised clustering techniques tailored for intent discovery from customer service dialogue. Experiments on a large-scale industrial dataset comprising 1,507 intent clusters demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques. The methods outperformed existing counterparts, achieving 6.25% improvement in quantitative metrics and 12% enhancement in application-level performance when constructing an intent classifier.</description>

      <title>SVasP: Self-Versatility Adversarial Style Perturbation for Cross-Domain Few-Shot Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cross-Domain Few-Shot Learning (CD-FSL) aims to transfer knowledge from seen source domains to unseen target domains, which is crucial for evaluating the generalization and robustness of models. Recent studies focus on utilizing visual styles to bridge the domain gap between different domains. However, the serious dilemma of gradient instability and local optimization problem occurs in those style-based CD-FSL methods. This paper addresses these issues and proposes a novel crop-global style perturbation method, called \underline{\textbf{S}}elf-\underline{\textbf{V}}ersatility \underline{\textbf{A}}dversarial \underline{\textbf{S}}tyle \underline{\textbf{P}}erturbation (\textbf{SVasP}), which enhances the gradient stability and escapes from poor sharp minima jointly. Specifically, SVasP simulates more diverse potential target domain adversarial styles via diversifying input patterns and aggregating localized crop style gradients, to serve as global style perturbation stabilizers within one image, a concept we refer to as self-versatility. Then a novel objective function is proposed to maximize visual discrepancy while maintaining semantic consistency between global, crop, and adversarial features. Having the stabilized global style perturbation in the training phase, one can obtain a flattened minima in the loss landscape, boosting the transferability of the model to the target domains. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

      <title>Filter-then-Generate: Large Language Models with Structure-Text Adapter for Knowledge Graph Completion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) present massive inherent knowledge and superior semantic comprehension capability, which have revolutionized various tasks in natural language processing. Despite their success, a critical gap remains in enabling LLMs to perform knowledge graph completion (KGC). Empirical evidence suggests that LLMs consistently perform worse than conventional KGC approaches, even through sophisticated prompt design or tailored instruction-tuning. Fundamentally, applying LLMs on KGC introduces several critical challenges, including a vast set of entity candidates, hallucination issue of LLMs, and under-exploitation of the graph structure. To address these challenges, we propose a novel instruction-tuning-based method, namely FtG. Specifically, we present a \textit{filter-then-generate} paradigm and formulate the KGC task into a multiple-choice question format. In this way, we can harness the capability of LLMs while mitigating the issue casused by hallucinations. Moreover, we devise a flexible ego-graph serialization prompt and employ a structure-text adapter to couple structure and text information in a contextualized manner. Experimental results demonstrate that FtG achieves substantial performance gain compared to existing state-of-the-art methods. The instruction dataset and code are available at \url{https://github.com/LB0828/FtG}.</description>

      <title>In-Dataset Trajectory Return Regularization for Offline Preference-based Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Offline preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL) typically operates in two phases: first, use human preferences to learn a reward model and annotate rewards for a reward-free offline dataset; second, learn a policy by optimizing the learned reward via offline RL. However, accurately modeling step-wise rewards from trajectory-level preference feedback presents inherent challenges. The reward bias introduced, particularly the overestimation of predicted rewards, leads to optimistic trajectory stitching, which undermines the pessimism mechanism critical to the offline RL phase. To address this challenge, we propose In-Dataset Trajectory Return Regularization (DTR) for offline PbRL, which leverages conditional sequence modeling to mitigate the risk of learning inaccurate trajectory stitching under reward bias. Specifically, DTR employs Decision Transformer and TD-Learning to strike a balance between maintaining fidelity to the behavior policy with high in-dataset trajectory returns and selecting optimal actions based on high reward labels. Additionally, we introduce an ensemble normalization technique that effectively integrates multiple reward models, balancing the tradeoff between reward differentiation and accuracy. Empirical evaluations on various benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of DTR over other state-of-the-art baselines</description>

      <title>Vision CNNs trained to estimate spatial latents learned similar ventral-stream-aligned representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Studies of the functional role of the primate ventral visual stream have traditionally focused on object categorization, often ignoring -- despite much prior evidence -- its role in estimating "spatial" latents such as object position and pose. Most leading ventral stream models are derived by optimizing networks for object categorization, which seems to imply that the ventral stream is also derived under such an objective. Here, we explore an alternative hypothesis: Might the ventral stream be optimized for estimating spatial latents? And a closely related question: How different -- if at all -- are representations learned from spatial latent estimation compared to categorization? To ask these questions, we leveraged synthetic image datasets generated by a 3D graphic engine and trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to estimate different combinations of spatial and category latents. We found that models trained to estimate just a few spatial latents achieve neural alignment scores comparable to those trained on hundreds of categories, and the spatial latent performance of models strongly correlates with their neural alignment. Spatial latent and category-trained models have very similar -- but not identical -- internal representations, especially in their early and middle layers. We provide evidence that this convergence is partly driven by non-target latent variability in the training data, which facilitates the implicit learning of representations of those non-target latents. Taken together, these results suggest that many training objectives, such as spatial latents, can lead to similar models aligned neurally with the ventral stream. Thus, one should not assume that the ventral stream is optimized for object categorization only. As a field, we need to continue to sharpen our measures of comparing models to brains to better understand the functional roles of the ventral stream.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Modality Representation and Alignment for Multimodal Cold-start Active Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Training multimodal models requires a large amount of labeled data. Active learning (AL) aim to reduce labeling costs. Most AL methods employ warm-start approaches, which rely on sufficient labeled data to train a well-calibrated model that can assess the uncertainty and diversity of unlabeled data. However, when assembling a dataset, labeled data are often scarce initially, leading to a cold-start problem. Additionally, most AL methods seldom address multimodal data, highlighting a research gap in this field. Our research addresses these issues by developing a two-stage method for Multi-Modal Cold-Start Active Learning (MMCSAL).
  Firstly, we observe the modality gap, a significant distance between the centroids of representations from different modalities, when only using cross-modal pairing information as self-supervision signals. This modality gap affects data selection process, as we calculate both uni-modal and cross-modal distances. To address this, we introduce uni-modal prototypes to bridge the modality gap. Secondly, conventional AL methods often falter in multimodal scenarios where alignment between modalities is overlooked. Therefore, we propose enhancing cross-modal alignment through regularization, thereby improving the quality of selected multimodal data pairs in AL. Finally, our experiments demonstrate MMCSAL's efficacy in selecting multimodal data pairs across three multimodal datasets.</description>

      <title>Student-Informed Teacher Training</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Imitation learning with a privileged teacher has proven effective for learning complex control behaviors from high-dimensional inputs, such as images. In this framework, a teacher is trained with privileged task information, while a student tries to predict the actions of the teacher with more limited observations, e.g., in a robot navigation task, the teacher might have access to distances to nearby obstacles, while the student only receives visual observations of the scene. However, privileged imitation learning faces a key challenge: the student might be unable to imitate the teacher's behavior due to partial observability. This problem arises because the teacher is trained without considering if the student is capable of imitating the learned behavior. To address this teacher-student asymmetry, we propose a framework for joint training of the teacher and student policies, encouraging the teacher to learn behaviors that can be imitated by the student despite the latters' limited access to information and its partial observability. Based on the performance bound in imitation learning, we add (i) the approximated action difference between teacher and student as a penalty term to the reward function of the teacher, and (ii) a supervised teacher-student alignment step. We motivate our method with a maze navigation task and demonstrate its effectiveness on complex vision-based quadrotor flight and manipulation tasks.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Adversarial Attacks on Traffic Sign Classifiers beyond Standard Baselines</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adversarial attacks on traffic sign classification models were among the first successfully tried in the real world. Since then, the research in this area has been mainly restricted to repeating baseline models, such as LISA-CNN or GTSRB-CNN, and similar experiment settings, including white and black patches on traffic signs. In this work, we decouple model architectures from the datasets and evaluate on further generic models to make a fair comparison. Furthermore, we compare two attack settings, inconspicuous and visible, which are usually regarded without direct comparison. Our results show that standard baselines like LISA-CNN or GTSRB-CNN are significantly more susceptible than the generic ones. We, therefore, suggest evaluating new attacks on a broader spectrum of baselines in the future. Our code is available at \url{https://github.com/KASTEL-MobilityLab/attacks-on-traffic-sign-recognition/}.</description>

      <title>$(\epsilon, \delta)$-Differentially Private Partial Least Squares Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As data-privacy requirements are becoming increasingly stringent and statistical models based on sensitive data are being deployed and used more routinely, protecting data-privacy becomes pivotal. Partial Least Squares (PLS) regression is the premier tool for building such models in analytical chemistry, yet it does not inherently provide privacy guarantees, leaving sensitive (training) data vulnerable to privacy attacks. To address this gap, we propose an $(\epsilon, \delta)$-differentially private PLS (edPLS) algorithm, which integrates well-studied and theoretically motivated Gaussian noise-adding mechanisms into the PLS algorithm to ensure the privacy of the data underlying the model. Our approach involves adding carefully calibrated Gaussian noise to the outputs of four key functions in the PLS algorithm: the weights, scores, $X$-loadings, and $Y$-loadings. The noise variance is determined based on the global sensitivity of each function, ensuring that the privacy loss is controlled according to the $(\epsilon, \delta)$-differential privacy framework. Specifically, we derive the sensitivity bounds for each function and use these bounds to calibrate the noise added to the model components. Experimental results demonstrate that edPLS effectively renders privacy attacks, aimed at recovering unique sources of variability in the training data, ineffective. Application of edPLS to the NIR corn benchmark dataset shows that the root mean squared error of prediction (RMSEP) remains competitive even at strong privacy levels (i.e., $\epsilon=1$), given proper pre-processing of the corresponding spectra. These findings highlight the practical utility of edPLS in creating privacy-preserving multivariate calibrations and for the analysis of their privacy-utility trade-offs.</description>

      <title>Dimensionality Reduction Techniques for Global Bayesian Optimisation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bayesian Optimisation (BO) is a state-of-the-art global optimisation technique for black-box problems where derivative information is unavailable, and sample efficiency is crucial. However, improving the general scalability of BO has proved challenging. Here, we explore Latent Space Bayesian Optimisation (LSBO), that applies dimensionality reduction to perform BO in a reduced-dimensional subspace. While early LSBO methods used (linear) random projections (Wang et al., 2013), we employ Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) to manage more complex data structures and general DR tasks. Building on Grosnit et. al. (2021), we analyse the VAE-based LSBO framework, focusing on VAE retraining and deep metric loss. We suggest a few key corrections in their implementation, originally designed for tasks such as molecule generation, and reformulate the algorithm for broader optimisation purposes. Our numerical results show that structured latent manifolds improve BO performance. Additionally, we examine the use of the Mat\'{e}rn-$\frac{5}{2}$ kernel for Gaussian Processes in this LSBO context. We also integrate Sequential Domain Reduction (SDR), a standard global optimization efficiency strategy, into BO. SDR is included in a GPU-based environment using \textit{BoTorch}, both in the original and VAE-generated latent spaces, marking the first application of SDR within LSBO.</description>

      <title>On the Generation and Removal of Speaker Adversarial Perturbation for Voice-Privacy Protection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural networks are commonly known to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks mounted through subtle perturbation on the input data. Recent development in voice-privacy protection has shown the positive use cases of the same technique to conceal speaker's voice attribute with additive perturbation signal generated by an adversarial network. This paper examines the reversibility property where an entity generating the adversarial perturbations is authorized to remove them and restore original speech (e.g., the speaker him/herself). A similar technique could also be used by an investigator to deanonymize a voice-protected speech to restore criminals' identities in security and forensic analysis. In this setting, the perturbation generative module is assumed to be known in the removal process. To this end, a joint training of perturbation generation and removal modules is proposed. Experimental results on the LibriSpeech dataset demonstrated that the subtle perturbations added to the original speech can be predicted from the anonymized speech while achieving the goal of privacy protection. By removing these perturbations from the anonymized sample, the original speech can be restored. Audio samples can be found in \url{https://voiceprivacy.github.io/Perturbation-Generation-Removal/}.</description>

      <title>Score and Distribution Matching Policy: Advanced Accelerated Visuomotor Policies via Matched Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Visual-motor policy learning has advanced with architectures like diffusion-based policies, known for modeling complex robotic trajectories. However, their prolonged inference times hinder high-frequency control tasks requiring real-time feedback. While consistency distillation (CD) accelerates inference, it introduces errors that compromise action quality. To address these limitations, we propose the Score and Distribution Matching Policy (SDM Policy), which transforms diffusion-based policies into single-step generators through a two-stage optimization process: score matching ensures alignment with true action distributions, and distribution matching minimizes KL divergence for consistency. A dual-teacher mechanism integrates a frozen teacher for stability and an unfrozen teacher for adversarial training, enhancing robustness and alignment with target distributions. Evaluated on a 57-task simulation benchmark, SDM Policy achieves a 6x inference speedup while having state-of-the-art action quality, providing an efficient and reliable framework for high-frequency robotic tasks.</description>

      <title>Learning Novel Skills from Language-Generated Demonstrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current robot learning algorithms for acquiring novel skills often rely on demonstration datasets or environment interactions, resulting in high labor costs and potential safety risks. To address these challenges, this study proposes a skill-learning framework that enables robots to acquire novel skills from natural language instructions. The proposed pipeline leverages vision-language models to generate demonstration videos of novel skills, which are processed by an inverse dynamics model to extract actions from the unlabeled demonstrations. These actions are subsequently mapped to environmental contexts via imitation learning, enabling robots to learn new skills effectively. Experimental evaluations in the MetaWorld simulation environments demonstrate the pipeline's capability to generate high-fidelity and reliable demonstrations. Using the generated demonstrations, various skill learning algorithms achieve an accomplishment rate three times the original on novel tasks. These results highlight a novel approach to robot learning, offering a foundation for the intuitive and intelligent acquisition of novel robotic skills.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Predictive Control with Constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have recently gained popularity for policy learning in robotics due to their ability to capture high-dimensional and multimodal distributions. However, diffusion policies are inherently stochastic and typically trained offline, limiting their ability to handle unseen and dynamic conditions where novel constraints not represented in the training data must be satisfied. To overcome this limitation, we propose diffusion predictive control with constraints (DPCC), an algorithm for diffusion-based control with explicit state and action constraints that can deviate from those in the training data. DPCC uses constraint tightening and incorporates model-based projections into the denoising process of a trained trajectory diffusion model. This allows us to generate constraint-satisfying, dynamically feasible, and goal-reaching trajectories for predictive control. We show through simulations of a robot manipulator that DPCC outperforms existing methods in satisfying novel test-time constraints while maintaining performance on the learned control task.</description>

      <title>Distribution free uncertainty quantification in neuroscience-inspired deep operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Energy-efficient deep learning algorithms are essential for a sustainable future and feasible edge computing setups. Spiking neural networks (SNNs), inspired from neuroscience, are a positive step in the direction of achieving the required energy efficiency. However, in a bid to lower the energy requirements, accuracy is marginally sacrificed. Hence, predictions of such deep learning algorithms require an uncertainty measure that can inform users regarding the bounds of a certain output. In this paper, we introduce the Conformalized Randomized Prior Operator (CRP-O) framework that leverages Randomized Prior (RP) networks and Split Conformal Prediction (SCP) to quantify uncertainty in both conventional and spiking neural operators. To further enable zero-shot super-resolution in UQ, we propose an extension incorporating Gaussian Process Regression. This enhanced super-resolution-enabled CRP-O framework is integrated with the recently developed Variable Spiking Wavelet Neural Operator (VSWNO). To test the performance of the obtained calibrated uncertainty bounds, we discuss four different examples covering both one-dimensional and two-dimensional partial differential equations. Results demonstrate that the uncertainty bounds produced by the conformalized RP-VSWNO significantly enhance UQ estimates compared to vanilla RP-VSWNO, Quantile WNO (Q-WNO), and Conformalized Quantile WNO (CQ-WNO). These findings underscore the potential of the proposed approach for practical applications.</description>

      <title>Multi-Stage Segmentation and Cascade Classification Methods for Improving Cardiac MRI Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The segmentation and classification of cardiac magnetic resonance imaging are critical for diagnosing heart conditions, yet current approaches face challenges in accuracy and generalizability. In this study, we aim to further advance the segmentation and classification of cardiac magnetic resonance images by introducing a novel deep learning-based approach. Using a multi-stage process with U-Net and ResNet models for segmentation, followed by Gaussian smoothing, the method improved segmentation accuracy, achieving a Dice coefficient of 0.974 for the left ventricle and 0.947 for the right ventricle. For classification, a cascade of deep learning classifiers was employed to distinguish heart conditions, including hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, myocardial infarction, and dilated cardiomyopathy, achieving an average accuracy of 97.2%. The proposed approach outperformed existing models, enhancing segmentation accuracy and classification precision. These advancements show promise for clinical applications, though further validation and interpretation across diverse imaging protocols is necessary.</description>

      <title>Opinion de-polarization of social networks with GNNs</title>

Abstract: Nowadays, social media is the ground for political debate and exchange of opinions. There is a significant amount of research that suggests that social media are highly polarized. A phenomenon that is commonly observed is the echo chamber structure, where users are organized in polarized communities and form connections only with similar-minded individuals, limiting themselves to consume specific content. In this paper we explore a way to decrease the polarization of networks with two echo chambers. Particularly, we observe that if some users adopt a moderate opinion about a topic, the polarization of the network decreases. Based on this observation, we propose an efficient algorithm to identify a good set of K users, such that if they adopt a moderate stance around a topic, the polarization is minimized. Our algorithm employs a Graph Neural Network and thus it can handle large graphs more effectively than other approaches</description>

      <title>Learned Compression for Compressed Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern sensors produce increasingly rich streams of high-resolution data. Due to resource constraints, machine learning systems discard the vast majority of this information via resolution reduction. Compressed-domain learning allows models to operate on compact latent representations, allowing higher effective resolution for the same budget. However, existing compression systems are not ideal for compressed learning. Linear transform coding and end-to-end learned compression systems reduce bitrate, but do not uniformly reduce dimensionality; thus, they do not meaningfully increase efficiency. Generative autoencoders reduce dimensionality, but their adversarial or perceptual objectives lead to significant information loss. To address these limitations, we introduce WaLLoC (Wavelet Learned Lossy Compression), a neural codec architecture that combines linear transform coding with nonlinear dimensionality-reducing autoencoders. WaLLoC sandwiches a shallow, asymmetric autoencoder and entropy bottleneck between an invertible wavelet packet transform. Across several key metrics, WaLLoC outperforms the autoencoders used in state-of-the-art latent diffusion models. WaLLoC does not require perceptual or adversarial losses to represent high-frequency detail, providing compatibility with modalities beyond RGB images and stereo audio. WaLLoC's encoder consists almost entirely of linear operations, making it exceptionally efficient and suitable for mobile computing, remote sensing, and learning directly from compressed data. We demonstrate WaLLoC's capability for compressed-domain learning across several tasks, including image classification, colorization, document understanding, and music source separation. Our code, experiments, and pre-trained audio and image codecs are available at https://ut-sysml.org/walloc</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning Within the Classical Robotics Stack: A Case Study in Robot Soccer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robot decision-making in partially observable, real-time, dynamic, and multi-agent environments remains a difficult and unsolved challenge. Model-free reinforcement learning (RL) is a promising approach to learning decision-making in such domains, however, end-to-end RL in complex environments is often intractable. To address this challenge in the RoboCup Standard Platform League (SPL) domain, we developed a novel architecture integrating RL within a classical robotics stack, while employing a multi-fidelity sim2real approach and decomposing behavior into learned sub-behaviors with heuristic selection. Our architecture led to victory in the 2024 RoboCup SPL Challenge Shield Division. In this work, we fully describe our system's architecture and empirically analyze key design decisions that contributed to its success. Our approach demonstrates how RL-based behaviors can be integrated into complete robot behavior architectures.</description>

      <title>Data Efficient Prediction of excited-state properties using Quantum Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the properties of excited states of complex molecules is crucial for many chemical and physical processes. Calculating these properties is often significantly more resource-intensive than calculating their ground state counterparts. We present a quantum machine learning model that predicts excited-state properties from the molecular ground state for different geometric configurations. The model comprises a symmetry-invariant quantum neural network and a conventional neural network and is able to provide accurate predictions with only a few training data points. The proposed procedure is fully NISQ compatible. This is achieved by using a quantum circuit that requires a number of parameters linearly proportional to the number of molecular orbitals, along with a parameterized measurement observable, thereby reducing the number of necessary measurements. We benchmark the algorithm on three different molecules by evaluating its performance in predicting excited state transition energies and transition dipole moments. We show that, in many instances, the procedure is able to outperform various classical models that rely solely on classical features.</description>

      <title>Finite-PINN: A Physics-Informed Neural Network Architecture for Solving Solid Mechanics Problems with General Geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: PINN models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in addressing fluid PDE problems, and their potential in solid mechanics is beginning to emerge. This study identifies two key challenges when using PINN to solve general solid mechanics problems. These challenges become evident when comparing the limitations of PINN with the well-established numerical methods commonly used in solid mechanics, such as the finite element method (FEM). Specifically: a) PINN models generate solutions over an infinite domain, which conflicts with the finite boundaries typical of most solid structures; and b) the solution space utilised by PINN is Euclidean, which is inadequate for addressing the complex geometries often present in solid structures.
  This work proposes a PINN architecture used for general solid mechanics problems, termed the Finite-PINN model. The proposed model aims to effectively address these two challenges while preserving as much of the original implementation of PINN as possible. The unique architecture of the Finite-PINN model addresses these challenges by separating the approximation of stress and displacement fields, and by transforming the solution space from the traditional Euclidean space to a Euclidean-topological joint space. Several case studies presented in this paper demonstrate that the Finite-PINN model provides satisfactory results for a variety of problem types, including both forward and inverse problems, in both 2D and 3D contexts. The developed Finite-PINN model offers a promising tool for addressing general solid mechanics problems, particularly those not yet well-explored in current research.</description>

      <title>Regression and Classification with Single-Qubit Quantum Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since classical machine learning has become a powerful tool for developing data-driven algorithms, quantum machine learning is expected to similarly impact the development of quantum algorithms. The literature reflects a mutually beneficial relationship between machine learning and quantum computing, where progress in one field frequently drives improvements in the other. Motivated by the fertile connection between machine learning and quantum computing enabled by parameterized quantum circuits, we use a resource-efficient and scalable Single-Qubit Quantum Neural Network (SQQNN) for both regression and classification tasks. The SQQNN leverages parameterized single-qubit unitary operators and quantum measurements to achieve efficient learning. To train the model, we use gradient descent for regression tasks. For classification, we introduce a novel training method inspired by the Taylor series, which can efficiently find a global minimum in a single step. This approach significantly accelerates training compared to iterative methods. Evaluated across various applications, the SQQNN exhibits virtually error-free and strong performance in regression and classification tasks, including the MNIST dataset. These results demonstrate the versatility, scalability, and suitability of the SQQNN for deployment on near-term quantum devices.</description>

      <title>A novel ML-fuzzy control system for optimizing PHEV fuel efficiency and extending electric range under diverse driving conditions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aiming for a greener transportation future, this study introduces an innovative control system for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) that utilizes machine learning (ML) techniques to forecast energy usage in the pure electric mode of the vehicle and optimize power allocation across different operational modes, including pure electric, series hybrid, parallel hybrid, and internal combustion operation. The fuzzy logic decision-making process governs the vehicle control system. The performance was assessed under various driving conditions. Key findings include a significant enhancement in pure electric mode efficiency, achieving an extended full-electric range of approximately 84 kilometers on an 80% utilization of a 20-kWh battery pack. During the WLTC driving cycle, the control system reduced fuel consumption to 2.86 L/100km, representing a 20% reduction in gasoline-equivalent fuel consumption. Evaluations of vehicle performance at discrete driving speeds, highlighted effective energy management, with the vehicle battery charging at lower speeds and discharging at higher speeds, showing optimized energy recovery and consumption strategies. Initial battery charge levels notably influenced vehicle performance. A 90% initial charge enabled prolonged all-electric operation, minimizing fuel consumption to 2 L/100km less than that of the base control system. Real-world driving pattern analysis revealed significant variations, with shorter, slower cycles requiring lower fuel consumption due to prioritized electric propulsion, while longer, faster cycles increased internal combustion engine usage. The control system also adapted to different battery state of health (SOH) conditions, with higher SOH facilitating extended electric mode usage, reducing total fuel consumption by up to 2.87 L/100km.</description>

Abstract: We construct a surrogate loss to directly optimise the significance metric used in particle physics. We evaluate our loss function for a simple event classification task using a linear model and show that it produces decision boundaries that change according to the cross sections of the processes involved. We find that the models trained with the new loss have higher signal efficiency for similar values of estimated signal significance compared to ones trained with a cross-entropy loss, showing promise to improve sensitivity of particle physics searches at colliders.</description>

      <title>GainAdaptor: Learning Quadrupedal Locomotion with Dual Actors for Adaptable and Energy-Efficient Walking on Various Terrains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has emerged as an innovative solution for controlling legged robots in challenging environments using minimalist architectures. Traditional control methods for legged robots, such as inverse dynamics, either directly manage joint torques or use proportional-derivative (PD) controllers to regulate joint positions at a higher level. In case of DRL, direct torque control presents significant challenges, leading to a preference for joint position control. However, this approach necessitates careful adjustment of joint PD gains, which can limit both adaptability and efficiency. In this paper, we propose GainAdaptor, an adaptive gain control framework that autonomously tunes joint PD gains to enhance terrain adaptability and energy efficiency. The framework employs a dual-actor algorithm to dynamically adjust the PD gains based on varying ground conditions. By utilizing a divided action space, GainAdaptor efficiently learns stable and energy-efficient locomotion. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed method through experiments conducted on a Unitree Go1 robot, demonstrating improved locomotion performance across diverse terrains.</description>

      <title>SimAvatar: Simulation-Ready Avatars with Layered Hair and Clothing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce SimAvatar, a framework designed to generate simulation-ready clothed 3D human avatars from a text prompt. Current text-driven human avatar generation methods either model hair, clothing, and the human body using a unified geometry or produce hair and garments that are not easily adaptable for simulation within existing simulation pipelines. The primary challenge lies in representing the hair and garment geometry in a way that allows leveraging established prior knowledge from foundational image diffusion models (e.g., Stable Diffusion) while being simulation-ready using either physics or neural simulators. To address this task, we propose a two-stage framework that combines the flexibility of 3D Gaussians with simulation-ready hair strands and garment meshes. Specifically, we first employ three text-conditioned 3D generative models to generate garment mesh, body shape and hair strands from the given text prompt. To leverage prior knowledge from foundational diffusion models, we attach 3D Gaussians to the body mesh, garment mesh, as well as hair strands and learn the avatar appearance through optimization. To drive the avatar given a pose sequence, we first apply physics simulators onto the garment meshes and hair strands. We then transfer the motion onto 3D Gaussians through carefully designed mechanisms for each body part. As a result, our synthesized avatars have vivid texture and realistic dynamic motion. To the best of our knowledge, our method is the first to produce highly realistic, fully simulation-ready 3D avatars, surpassing the capabilities of current approaches.</description>

Abstract: We study decentralized multiagent optimization over networks, modeled as undirected graphs. The optimization problem consists of minimizing a nonconvex smooth function plus a convex extended-value function, which enforces constraints or extra structure on the solution (e.g., sparsity, low-rank). We further assume that the objective function satisfies the Kurdyka-{\L}ojasiewicz (KL) property, with given exponent $\theta\in [0,1)$. The KL property is satisfied by several (nonconvex) functions of practical interest, e.g., arising from machine learning applications; in the centralized setting, it permits to achieve strong convergence guarantees. Here we establish convergence of the same type for the notorious decentralized gradient-tracking-based algorithm SONATA. Specifically, $\textbf{(i)}$ when $\theta\in (0,1/2]$, the sequence generated by SONATA converges to a stationary solution of the problem at R-linear rate;$ \textbf{(ii)} $when $\theta\in (1/2,1)$, sublinear rate is certified; and finally $\textbf{(iii)}$ when $\theta=0$, the iterates will either converge in a finite number of steps or converges at R-linear rate. This matches the convergence behavior of centralized proximal-gradient algorithms except when $\theta=0$. Numerical results validate our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Experimental Machine Learning with Classical and Quantum Data via NMR Quantum Kernels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kernel methods map data into high-dimensional spaces, enabling linear algorithms to learn nonlinear functions without explicitly storing the feature vectors. Quantum kernel methods promise efficient learning by encoding feature maps into exponentially large Hilbert spaces inherent in quantum systems. In this work we implement quantum kernels on a 10-qubit star-topology register in a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) platform. We experimentally encode classical data in the evolution of multiple quantum coherence orders using data-dependent unitary transformations and then demonstrate one-dimensional regression and two-dimensional classification tasks. By extending the register to a double-layered star configuration, we propose an extended quantum kernel to handle non-parametrized operator inputs. By numerically simulating the extended quantum kernel, we show classification of entangling and nonentangling unitaries. These results confirm that quantum kernels exhibit strong capabilities in classical as well as quantum machine learning tasks.</description>

      <title>Improving the Reliability of Cable Broadband Networks via Proactive Network Maintenance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cable broadband networks are one of the few "last-mile" broadband technologies widely available in the U.S. Unfortunately, they have poor reliability after decades of deployment. The cable industry proposed a framework called Proactive Network Maintenance (PNM) to diagnose the cable networks. However, there is little public knowledge or systematic study on how to use these data to detect and localize cable network problems. Existing tools in the public domain have prohibitive high false-positive rates. In this paper, we propose CableMon, the first public-domain system that applies machine learning techniques to PNM data to improve the reliability of cable broadband networks. CableMon tackles two key challenges faced by cable ISPs: accurately detecting failures, and distinguishing whether a failure occurs within a network or at a subscriber's premise. CableMon uses statistical models to generate features from time series data and uses customer trouble tickets as hints to infer abnormal/failure thresholds for these generated features. Further, CableMon employs an unsupervised learning model to group cable devices sharing similar anomalous patterns and effectively identify impairments that occur inside a cable network and impairments occur at a subscriber's premise, as these two different faults require different types of technical personnel to repair them. We use eight months of PNM data and customer trouble tickets from an ISP and experimental deployment to evaluate CableMon's performance. Our evaluation results show that CableMon can effectively detect and distinguish failures from PNM data and outperforms existing public-domain tools.</description>

      <title>JuStRank: Benchmarking LLM Judges for System Ranking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given the rapid progress of generative AI, there is a pressing need to systematically compare and choose between the numerous models and configurations available. The scale and versatility of such evaluations make the use of LLM-based judges a compelling solution for this challenge. Crucially, this approach requires first to validate the quality of the LLM judge itself. Previous work has focused on instance-based assessment of LLM judges, where a judge is evaluated over a set of responses, or response pairs, while being agnostic to their source systems. We argue that this setting overlooks critical factors affecting system-level ranking, such as a judge's positive or negative bias towards certain systems. To address this gap, we conduct the first large-scale study of LLM judges as system rankers. System scores are generated by aggregating judgment scores over multiple system outputs, and the judge's quality is assessed by comparing the resulting system ranking to a human-based ranking. Beyond overall judge assessment, our analysis provides a fine-grained characterization of judge behavior, including their decisiveness and bias.</description>

      <title>Wait-Less Offline Tuning and Re-solving for Online Decision Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Online linear programming (OLP) has found broad applications in revenue management and resource allocation. State-of-the-art OLP algorithms achieve low regret by repeatedly solving linear programming (LP) subproblems that incorporate updated resource information. However, LP-based methods are computationally expensive and often inefficient for large-scale applications. In contrast, recent first-order OLP algorithms are more computationally efficient but typically suffer from worse regret guarantees. To address these shortcomings, we propose a new algorithm that combines the strengths of LP-based and first-order OLP methods. The algorithm re-solves the LP subproblems periodically at a predefined frequency $f$ and uses the latest dual prices to guide online decision-making. In addition, a first-order method runs in parallel during each interval between LP re-solves, smoothing resource consumption. Our algorithm achieves $\mathscr{O}(\log (T/f) + \sqrt{f})$ regret, delivering a "wait-less" online decision-making process that balances the computational efficiency of first-order methods and the superior regret guarantee of LP-based methods.</description>

      <title>Owl-1: Omni World Model for Consistent Long Video Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Video generation models (VGMs) have received extensive attention recently and serve as promising candidates for general-purpose large vision models. While they can only generate short videos each time, existing methods achieve long video generation by iteratively calling the VGMs, using the last-frame output as the condition for the next-round generation. However, the last frame only contains short-term fine-grained information about the scene, resulting in inconsistency in the long horizon. To address this, we propose an Omni World modeL (Owl-1) to produce long-term coherent and comprehensive conditions for consistent long video generation. As videos are observations of the underlying evolving world, we propose to model the long-term developments in a latent space and use VGMs to film them into videos. Specifically, we represent the world with a latent state variable which can be decoded into explicit video observations. These observations serve as a basis for anticipating temporal dynamics which in turn update the state variable. The interaction between evolving dynamics and persistent state enhances the diversity and consistency of the long videos. Extensive experiments show that Owl-1 achieves comparable performance with SOTA methods on VBench-I2V and VBench-Long, validating its ability to generate high-quality video observations.

      <title>Hidden Biases of End-to-End Driving Datasets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: End-to-end driving systems have made rapid progress, but have so far not been applied to the challenging new CARLA Leaderboard 2.0. Further, while there is a large body of literature on end-to-end architectures and training strategies, the impact of the training dataset is often overlooked. In this work, we make a first attempt at end-to-end driving for Leaderboard 2.0. Instead of investigating architectures, we systematically analyze the training dataset, leading to new insights: (1) Expert style significantly affects downstream policy performance. (2) In complex data sets, the frames should not be weighted on the basis of simplistic criteria such as class frequencies. (3) Instead, estimating whether a frame changes the target labels compared to previous frames can reduce the size of the dataset without removing important information. By incorporating these findings, our model ranks first and second respectively on the map and sensors tracks of the 2024 CARLA Challenge, and sets a new state-of-the-art on the Bench2Drive test routes. Finally, we uncover a design flaw in the current evaluation metrics and propose a modification for future challenges. Our dataset, code, and pre-trained models are publicly available at https://github.com/autonomousvision/carla_garage.</description>

      <title>Spectral Image Tokenizer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Image tokenizers map images to sequences of discrete tokens, and are a crucial component of autoregressive transformer-based image generation. The tokens are typically associated with spatial locations in the input image, arranged in raster scan order, which is not ideal for autoregressive modeling. In this paper, we propose to tokenize the image spectrum instead, obtained from a discrete wavelet transform (DWT), such that the sequence of tokens represents the image in a coarse-to-fine fashion. Our tokenizer brings several advantages: 1) it leverages that natural images are more compressible at high frequencies, 2) it can take and reconstruct images of different resolutions without retraining, 3) it improves the conditioning for next-token prediction -- instead of conditioning on a partial line-by-line reconstruction of the image, it takes a coarse reconstruction of the full image, 4) it enables partial decoding where the first few generated tokens can reconstruct a coarse version of the image, 5) it enables autoregressive models to be used for image upsampling. We evaluate the tokenizer reconstruction metrics as well as multiscale image generation, text-guided image upsampling and editing.</description>

      <title>Doe-1: Closed-Loop Autonomous Driving with Large World Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving has received increasing attention due to its potential to learn from large amounts of data. However, most existing methods are still open-loop and suffer from weak scalability, lack of high-order interactions, and inefficient decision-making. In this paper, we explore a closed-loop framework for autonomous driving and propose a large Driving wOrld modEl (Doe-1) for unified perception, prediction, and planning. We formulate autonomous driving as a next-token generation problem and use multi-modal tokens to accomplish different tasks. Specifically, we use free-form texts (i.e., scene descriptions) for perception and generate future predictions directly in the RGB space with image tokens. For planning, we employ a position-aware tokenizer to effectively encode action into discrete tokens. We train a multi-modal transformer to autoregressively generate perception, prediction, and planning tokens in an end-to-end and unified manner. Experiments on the widely used nuScenes dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of Doe-1 in various tasks including visual question-answering, action-conditioned video generation, and motion planning.

      <title>SimVPv2: Towards Simple yet Powerful Spatiotemporal Predictive Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.12509v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent years have witnessed remarkable advances in spatiotemporal predictive learning, with methods incorporating auxiliary inputs, complex neural architectures, and sophisticated training strategies. While SimVP has introduced a simpler, CNN-based baseline for this task, it still relies on heavy Unet-like architectures for spatial and temporal modeling, which still suffers from high complexity and computational overhead. In this paper, we propose SimVPv2, a streamlined model that eliminates the need for Unet architectures and demonstrates that plain stacks of convolutional layers, enhanced with an efficient Gated Spatiotemporal Attention mechanism, can deliver state-of-the-art performance. SimVPv2 not only simplifies the model architecture but also improves both performance and computational efficiency. On the standard Moving MNIST benchmark, SimVPv2 achieves superior performance compared to SimVP, with fewer FLOPs, about half the training time, and 60% faster inference efficiency. Extensive experiments across eight diverse datasets, including real-world tasks such as traffic forecasting and climate prediction, further demonstrate that SimVPv2 offers a powerful yet straightforward solution, achieving robust generalization across various spatiotemporal learning scenarios. We believe the proposed SimVPv2 can serve as a solid baseline to benefit the spatiotemporal predictive learning community.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Survey on Test-Time Adaptation under Distribution Shifts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.15361v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning methods strive to acquire a robust model during the training process that can effectively generalize to test samples, even in the presence of distribution shifts. However, these methods often suffer from performance degradation due to unknown test distributions. Test-time adaptation (TTA), an emerging paradigm, has the potential to adapt a pre-trained model to unlabeled data during testing, before making predictions. Recent progress in this paradigm has highlighted the significant benefits of using unlabeled data to train self-adapted models prior to inference. In this survey, we categorize TTA into several distinct groups based on the form of test data, namely, test-time domain adaptation, test-time batch adaptation, and online test-time adaptation. For each category, we provide a comprehensive taxonomy of advanced algorithms and discuss various learning scenarios. Furthermore, we analyze relevant applications of TTA and discuss open challenges and promising areas for future research. For a comprehensive list of TTA methods, kindly refer to \url{https://github.com/tim-learn/awesome-test-time-adaptation}.</description>

      <title>AdaStop: adaptive statistical testing for sound comparisons of Deep RL agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.10882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.10882v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, the scientific community has questioned the statistical reproducibility of many empirical results, especially in the field of machine learning. To contribute to the resolution of this reproducibility crisis, we propose a theoretically sound methodology for comparing the performance of a set of algorithms. We exemplify our methodology in Deep Reinforcement Learning (Deep RL). The performance of one execution of a Deep RL algorithm is a random variable. Therefore, several independent executions are needed to evaluate its performance. When comparing algorithms with random performance, a major question concerns the number of executions to perform to ensure that the result of the comparison is theoretically sound. Researchers in Deep RL often use less than 5 independent executions to compare algorithms: we claim that this is not enough in general. Moreover, when comparing more than 2 algorithms at once, we have to use a multiple tests procedure to preserve low error guarantees. We introduce AdaStop, a new statistical test based on multiple group sequential tests. When used to compare algorithms, AdaStop adapts the number of executions to stop as early as possible while ensuring that enough information has been collected to distinguish algorithms that have different score distributions. We prove theoretically that AdaStop has a low probability of making a (family-wise) error. We illustrate the effectiveness of AdaStop in various use-cases, including toy examples and Deep RL algorithms on challenging Mujoco environments. AdaStop is the first statistical test fitted to this sort of comparisons: it is both a significant contribution to statistics, and an important contribution to computational studies performed in reinforcement learning and in other domains.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.15194v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: \textit{Objective:} Diagnosing pain in research and clinical practices still relies on self-report. This study aims to develop an automatic approach that works on resting-state raw EEG data for chronic knee pain prediction. \textit{Method:} A new feature selection algorithm called ``modified Sequential Floating Forward Selection'' (mSFFS) is proposed. The improved feature selection scheme can better avoid local minima and explore alternative search routes. \textit{Results:} The feature selection obtained by mSFFS displays better class separability as indicated by the Bhattacharyya distance measures and better visualization results. It also outperforms selections generated by other benchmark methods, boosting the test accuracy to 97.5\%. \textit{Conclusion:} The improved feature selection searches out a compact, effective subset of connectivity features that produces competitive performance on chronic knee pain prediction. \textit{Significance:} We have shown that an automatic approach can be employed to find a compact connectivity feature set that effectively predicts chronic knee pain from EEG. It may shed light on the research of chronic pains and lead to future clinical solutions for diagnosis and treatment.</description>

      <title>NeuralFuse: Learning to Recover the Accuracy of Access-Limited Neural Network Inference in Low-Voltage Regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.16869v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have become ubiquitous in machine learning, but their energy consumption remains problematically high. An effective strategy for reducing such consumption is supply-voltage reduction, but if done too aggressively, it can lead to accuracy degradation. This is due to random bit-flips in static random access memory (SRAM), where model parameters are stored. To address this challenge, we have developed NeuralFuse, a novel add-on module that handles the energy-accuracy tradeoff in low-voltage regimes by learning input transformations and using them to generate error-resistant data representations, thereby protecting DNN accuracy in both nominal and low-voltage scenarios. As well as being easy to implement, NeuralFuse can be readily applied to DNNs with limited access, such cloud-based APIs that are accessed remotely or non-configurable hardware. Our experimental results demonstrate that, at a 1% bit-error rate, NeuralFuse can reduce SRAM access energy by up to 24% while recovering accuracy by up to 57%. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach to addressing low-voltage-induced bit errors that requires no model retraining.</description>

Abstract: Transfer learning has emerged as an effective approach to accelerate learning by integrating knowledge from related source agents. However, challenges arise due to data heterogeneity-such as differences in feature sets or incomplete datasets-which often results in the nonidentifiability of causal effects. In this paper, we investigate transfer learning in partially observable contextual bandits, where agents operate with incomplete information and limited access to hidden confounders. To address the challenges posed by unobserved confounders, we formulate optimization problems to derive tight bounds on the nonidentifiable causal effects. We then propose an efficient method that discretizes the functional constraints of unknown distributions into linear constraints, allowing us to sample compatible causal models through a sequential process of solving linear programs. This method takes into account estimation errors and exhibits strong convergence properties, ensuring robust and reliable causal bounds. Leveraging these causal bounds, we improve classical bandit algorithms, achieving tighter regret upper and lower bounds relative to the sizes of action sets and function spaces. In tasks involving function approximation, which are crucial for handling complex context spaces, our method significantly improves the dependence on function space size compared to previous work. We formally prove that our causally enhanced algorithms outperform classical bandit algorithms, achieving notably faster convergence rates. The applicability of our approach is further illustrated through an example of offline pricing policy learning with censored demand.Simulations confirm the superiority of our approach over state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating its potential to enhance contextual bandit agents in real-world applications, especially when data is scarce, costly, or restricted due to privacy concerns.</description>

      <title>STARC: A General Framework For Quantifying Differences Between Reward Functions</title>

Abstract: In order to solve a task using reinforcement learning, it is necessary to first formalise the goal of that task as a reward function. However, for many real-world tasks, it is very difficult to manually specify a reward function that never incentivises undesirable behaviour. As a result, it is increasingly popular to use reward learning algorithms, which attempt to learn a reward function from data. However, the theoretical foundations of reward learning are not yet well-developed. In particular, it is typically not known when a given reward learning algorithm with high probability will learn a reward function that is safe to optimise. This means that reward learning algorithms generally must be evaluated empirically, which is expensive, and that their failure modes are difficult to anticipate in advance. One of the roadblocks to deriving better theoretical guarantees is the lack of good methods for quantifying the difference between reward functions. In this paper we provide a solution to this problem, in the form of a class of pseudometrics on the space of all reward functions that we call STARC (STAndardised Reward Comparison) metrics. We show that STARC metrics induce both an upper and a lower bound on worst-case regret, which implies that our metrics are tight, and that any metric with the same properties must be bilipschitz equivalent to ours. Moreover, we also identify a number of issues with reward metrics proposed by earlier works. Finally, we evaluate our metrics empirically, to demonstrate their practical efficacy. STARC metrics can be used to make both theoretical and empirical analysis of reward learning algorithms both easier and more principled.</description>

      <title>OneAdapt: Fast Configuration Adaptation for Video Analytics Applications via Backpropagation</title>

Abstract: Deep learning inference on streaming media data, such as object detection in video or LiDAR feeds and text extraction from audio waves, is now ubiquitous. To achieve high inference accuracy, these applications typically require significant network bandwidth to gather high-fidelity data and extensive GPU resources to run deep neural networks (DNNs). While the high demand for network bandwidth and GPU resources could be substantially reduced by optimally adapting the configuration knobs, such as video resolution and frame rate, current adaptation techniques fail to meet three requirements simultaneously: adapt configurations (i) with minimum extra GPU or bandwidth overhead; (ii) to reach near-optimal decisions based on how the data affects the final DNN's accuracy, and (iii) do so for a range of configuration knobs. This paper presents OneAdapt, which meets these requirements by leveraging a gradient-ascent strategy to adapt configuration knobs. The key idea is to embrace DNNs' differentiability to quickly estimate the accuracy's gradient to each configuration knob, called AccGrad. Specifically, OneAdapt estimates AccGrad by multiplying two gradients: InputGrad (i.e. how each configuration knob affects the input to the DNN) and DNNGrad (i.e. how the DNN input affects the DNN inference output). We evaluate OneAdapt across five types of configurations, four analytic tasks, and five types of input data. Compared to state-of-the-art adaptation schemes, OneAdapt cuts bandwidth usage and GPU usage by 15-59% while maintaining comparable accuracy or improves accuracy by 1-5% while using equal or fewer resources.</description>

      <title>Nearly Minimax Optimal Submodular Maximization with Bandit Feedback</title>

Abstract: We consider maximizing an unknown monotonic, submodular set function $f: 2^{[n]} \rightarrow [0,1]$ with cardinality constraint under stochastic bandit feedback. At each time $t=1,\dots,T$ the learner chooses a set $S_t \subset [n]$ with $|S_t| \leq k$ and receives reward $f(S_t) + \eta_t$ where $\eta_t$ is mean-zero sub-Gaussian noise. The objective is to minimize the learner's regret with respect to an approximation of the maximum $f(S_*)$ with $|S_*| = k$, obtained through robust greedy maximization of $f$. To date, the best regret bound in the literature scales as $k n^{1/3} T^{2/3}$. And by trivially treating every set as a unique arm one deduces that $\sqrt{ {n \choose k} T }$ is also achievable using standard multi-armed bandit algorithms. In this work, we establish the first minimax lower bound for this setting that scales like $\tilde{\Omega}(\min_{L \le k}(L^{1/3}n^{1/3}T^{2/3} + \sqrt{{n \choose k - L}T}))$. For a slightly restricted algorithm class, we prove a stronger regret lower bound of $\tilde{\Omega}(\min_{L \le k}(Ln^{1/3}T^{2/3} + \sqrt{{n \choose k - L}T}))$. Moreover, we propose an algorithm Sub-UCB that achieves regret $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\min_{L \le k}(Ln^{1/3}T^{2/3} + \sqrt{{n \choose k - L}T}))$ capable of matching the lower bound on regret for the restricted class up to logarithmic factors.</description>

      <title>PowerInfer: Fast Large Language Model Serving with a Consumer-grade GPU</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12456v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces PowerInfer, a high-speed Large Language Model (LLM) inference engine on a personal computer (PC) equipped with a single consumer-grade GPU. The key principle underlying the design of PowerInfer is exploiting the high locality inherent in LLM inference, characterized by a power-law distribution in neuron activation. This distribution indicates that a small subset of neurons, termed hot neurons, are consistently activated across inputs, while the majority, cold neurons, vary based on specific inputs. PowerInfer exploits such an insight to design a GPU-CPU hybrid inference engine: hot-activated neurons are preloaded onto the GPU for fast access, while cold-activated neurons are computed on the CPU, thus significantly reducing GPU memory demands and CPU-GPU data transfers. PowerInfer further integrates adaptive predictors and neuron-aware sparse operators, optimizing the efficiency of neuron activation and computational sparsity. The evaluation shows that PowerInfer significantly outperforms llama.cpp by up to 11.69x while retaining model accuracy across various LLMs (including OPT-175B) on a single NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU. For the OPT-30B model, PowerInfer achieves performance comparable to that of a high-end server-grade A100 GPU, reaching 82% of its token generation rate on a single consumer-grade RTX 4090 GPU.</description>

      <title>Vanilla Bayesian Optimization Performs Great in High Dimensions</title>

Abstract: High-dimensional problems have long been considered the Achilles' heel of Bayesian optimization algorithms. Spurred by the curse of dimensionality, a large collection of algorithms aim to make it more performant in this setting, commonly by imposing various simplifying assumptions on the objective. In this paper, we identify the degeneracies that make vanilla Bayesian optimization poorly suited to high-dimensional tasks, and further show how existing algorithms address these degeneracies through the lens of lowering the model complexity. Moreover, we propose an enhancement to the prior assumptions that are typical to vanilla Bayesian optimization algorithms, which reduces the complexity to manageable levels without imposing structural restrictions on the objective. Our modification - a simple scaling of the Gaussian process lengthscale prior with the dimensionality - reveals that standard Bayesian optimization works drastically better than previously thought in high dimensions, clearly outperforming existing state-of-the-art algorithms on multiple commonly considered real-world high-dimensional tasks.</description>

      <title>FedAA: A Reinforcement Learning Perspective on Adaptive Aggregation for Fair and Robust Federated Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05541v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising approach for privacy-preserving model training across decentralized devices. However, it faces challenges such as statistical heterogeneity and susceptibility to adversarial attacks, which can impact model robustness and fairness. Personalized FL attempts to provide some relief by customizing models for individual clients. However, it falls short in addressing server-side aggregation vulnerabilities. We introduce a novel method called \textbf{FedAA}, which optimizes client contributions via \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{A}ggregation to enhance model robustness against malicious clients and ensure fairness across participants in non-identically distributed settings. To achieve this goal, we propose an approach involving a Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient-based algorithm for continuous control of aggregation weights, an innovative client selection method based on model parameter distances, and a reward mechanism guided by validation set performance. Empirically, extensive experiments demonstrate that, in terms of robustness, \textbf{FedAA} outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, while maintaining comparable levels of fairness, offering a promising solution to build resilient and fair federated systems.

Abstract: Conformal Prediction (CP) has attracted great attention from the research community due to its strict theoretical guarantees. However, researchers and developers still face challenges of applicability and efficiency when applying CP algorithms to deep learning models. In this paper, we introduce \torchcp, a comprehensive PyTorch-based toolkit to strengthen the usability of CP for deep learning models. \torchcp implements a wide range of post-hoc and training methods of conformal prediction for various machine learning tasks, including classification, regression, GNN, and LLM. Moreover, we provide user-friendly interfaces and extensive evaluations to easily integrate CP algorithms into specific tasks. Our \torchcp toolkit, built entirely with PyTorch, enables high-performance GPU acceleration for deep learning models and mini-batch computation on large-scale datasets. With the LGPL license, the code is open-sourced at \url{https://github.com/ml-stat-Sustech/TorchCP} and will be continuously updated.</description>

      <title>ProSparse: Introducing and Enhancing Intrinsic Activation Sparsity within Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13516v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Activation sparsity refers to the existence of considerable weakly-contributed elements among activation outputs. As a prevalent property of the models using the ReLU activation function, activation sparsity has been proven a promising paradigm to boost model inference efficiency. Nevertheless, most large language models (LLMs) adopt activation functions without intrinsic activation sparsity (e.g., GELU and Swish). Some recent efforts have explored introducing ReLU or its variants as the substitutive activation function to help LLMs achieve activation sparsity and inference acceleration, but few can simultaneously obtain high sparsity and comparable model performance. This paper introduces a simple and effective sparsification method named "ProSparse" to push LLMs for higher activation sparsity while maintaining comparable performance. Specifically, after substituting the activation function of LLMs with ReLU, ProSparse adopts progressive sparsity regularization with a factor smoothly increasing along the multi-stage sine curves. This can enhance activation sparsity and mitigate performance degradation by avoiding radical shifts in activation distributions. With ProSparse, we obtain high sparsity of 89.32% for LLaMA2-7B, 88.80% for LLaMA2-13B, and 87.89% for end-size MiniCPM-1B, respectively, achieving comparable performance to their original Swish-activated versions. These present the most sparsely activated models among open-source LLaMA versions and competitive end-size models, considerably surpassing ReluLLaMA-7B (66.98%) and ReluLLaMA-13B (71.56%). Our inference acceleration experiments further demonstrate the significant practical acceleration potential of LLMs with higher activation sparsity, obtaining up to 4.52$\times$ inference speedup.</description>

      <title>Achieving Constant Regret in Linear Markov Decision Processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10745v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the constant regret guarantees in reinforcement learning (RL). Our objective is to design an algorithm that incurs only finite regret over infinite episodes with high probability. We introduce an algorithm, Cert-LSVI-UCB, for misspecified linear Markov decision processes (MDPs) where both the transition kernel and the reward function can be approximated by some linear function up to misspecification level $\zeta$. At the core of Cert-LSVI-UCB is an innovative \method, which facilitates a fine-grained concentration analysis for multi-phase value-targeted regression, enabling us to establish an instance-dependent regret bound that is constant w.r.t. the number of episodes. Specifically, we demonstrate that for a linear MDP characterized by a minimal suboptimality gap $\Delta$, Cert-LSVI-UCB has a cumulative regret of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d^3H^5/\Delta)$ with high probability, provided that the misspecification level $\zeta$ is below $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\Delta / (\sqrt{d}H^2))$. Here $d$ is the dimension of the feature space and $H$ is the horizon. Remarkably, this regret bound is independent of the number of episodes $K$. To the best of our knowledge, Cert-LSVI-UCB is the first algorithm to achieve a constant, instance-dependent, high-probability regret bound in RL with linear function approximation without relying on prior distribution assumptions.</description>

Abstract: Biological neural networks seem qualitatively superior (e.g. in learning, flexibility, robustness) to current artificial like Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) or Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN). Simultaneously, in contrast to them: biological have fundamentally multidirectional signal propagation \cite{axon}, also of probability distributions e.g. for uncertainty estimation, and are believed not being able to use standard backpropagation training \cite{backprop}. There are proposed novel artificial neurons based on HCR (Hierarchical Correlation Reconstruction) allowing to remove the above low level differences: with neurons containing local joint distribution model (of its connections), representing joint density on normalized variables as just linear combination of $(f_\mathbf{j})$ orthonormal polynomials: $\rho(\mathbf{x})=\sum_{\mathbf{j}\in B} a_\mathbf{j} f_\mathbf{j}(\mathbf{x})$ for $\mathbf{x} \in [0,1]^d$ and $B\subset \mathbb{N}^d$ some chosen basis. By various index summations of such $(a_\mathbf{j})_{\mathbf{j}\in B}$ tensor as neuron parameters, we get simple formulas for e.g. conditional expected values for propagation in any direction, like $E[x|y,z]$, $E[y|x]$, which degenerate to KAN-like parametrization if restricting to pairwise dependencies. Such HCR network can also propagate probability distributions (also joint) like $\rho(y,z|x)$. It also allows for additional training approaches, like direct $(a_\mathbf{j})$ estimation, through tensor decomposition, or more biologically plausible information bottleneck training: layers directly influencing only neighbors, optimizing content to maximize information about the next layer, and minimizing about the previous to remove noise, extract crucial information.</description>

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed an increasing global population affected by neurodegenerative diseases (NDs), which traditionally require extensive healthcare resources and human effort for medical diagnosis and monitoring. As a crucial disease-related motor symptom, human gait can be exploited to characterize different NDs. The current advances in artificial intelligence (AI) models enable automatic gait analysis for NDs identification and classification, opening a new avenue to facilitate faster and more cost-effective diagnosis of NDs. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey on recent progress of machine learning and deep learning based AI techniques applied to diagnosis of five typical NDs through gait. We provide an overview of the process of AI-assisted NDs diagnosis, and present a systematic taxonomy of existing gait data and AI models. Meanwhile, a novel quality evaluation criterion is proposed to quantitatively assess the quality of existing studies. Through an extensive review and analysis of 169 studies, we present recent technical advancements, discuss existing challenges, potential solutions, and future directions in this field. Finally, we envision the prospective utilization of 3D skeleton data for human gait representation and the development of more efficient AI models for NDs diagnosis.</description>

Abstract: Offline data are both valuable and practical resources for teaching robots complex behaviors. Ideally, learning agents should not be constrained by the scarcity of available demonstrations, but rather generalize beyond the training distribution. However, the complexity of real-world scenarios typically requires huge amounts of data to prevent neural network policies from picking up on spurious correlations and learning non-causal relationships. We propose CAIAC, a data augmentation method that can create feasible synthetic transitions from a fixed dataset without having access to online environment interactions. By utilizing principled methods for quantifying causal influence, we are able to perform counterfactual reasoning by swapping $\it{action}$-unaffected parts of the state-space between independent trajectories in the dataset. We empirically show that this leads to a substantial increase in robustness of offline learning algorithms against distributional shift.</description>

Abstract: Heterogeneous data from multiple populations, sub-groups, or sources is often represented as a ``mixture model'' with a single latent class influencing all of the observed covariates. Heterogeneity can be resolved at multiple levels by grouping populations according to different notions of similarity. This paper proposes grouping with respect to the causal response of an intervention or perturbation on the system. This definition is distinct from previous notions, such as similar covariate values (e.g. clustering) or similar correlations between covariates (e.g. Gaussian mixture models). To solve the problem, we ``synthetically sample'' from a counterfactual distribution using higher-order multi-linear moments of the observable data. To understand how these ``causal mixtures'' fit in with more classical notions, we develop a hierarchy of mixture identifiability.</description>

      <title>PowerInfer-2: Fast Large Language Model Inference on a Smartphone</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06282v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) on smartphones enable real-time AI assistance and privacy-preserving, offline operation. However, resource constraints of smartphones limit current deployments to small language models (SLMs), significantly compromising their capabilities. This paper introduces PowerInfer-2, a smartphone-based framework that enables fast inference for LLMs exceeding the memory capacity. The key insight is decomposing matrix operations into neuron clusters as the basic processing unit, which enables flexible scheduling and efficient I/O-computation pipelining. PowerInfer-2 leverages this neuron-cluster-based design in both computation and storage. For computation, neuron clusters with dense activations are processed on NPU, while sparse clusters use CPU. The storage engine provides a fine-grained pipeline mechanism that coordinates cluster-level computation and I/O operations, enhanced by a segmented neuron cache to reduce I/O activities. PowerInfer-2 achieves up to a 27.8x speed increase compared to state-of-the-art frameworks. PowerInfer-2 is the first system to serve a 47B LLM on a smartphone, achieving 11.68 tokens/s. Notably, these performance improvements preserve model quality with negligible accuracy degradation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01619v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Enterprises have a growing need to identify relevant tables in data lakes; e.g. tables that are unionable, joinable, or subsets of each other. Tabular neural models can be helpful for such data discovery tasks. In this paper, we present TabSketchFM, a neural tabular model for data discovery over data lakes. First, we propose novel pre-training: a sketch-based approach to enhance the effectiveness of data discovery in neural tabular models. Second, we finetune the pretrained model for identifying unionable, joinable, and subset table pairs and show significant improvement over previous tabular neural models. Third, we present a detailed ablation study to highlight which sketches are crucial for which tasks. Fourth, we use these finetuned models to perform table search; i.e., given a query table, find other tables in a corpus that are unionable, joinable, or that are subsets of the query. Our results demonstrate significant improvements in F1 scores for search compared to state-of-the-art techniques. Finally, we show significant transfer across datasets and tasks establishing that our model can generalize across different tasks and over different data lakes.</description>

      <title>Forecasting GPU Performance for Deep Learning Training and Inference</title>

Abstract: Deep learning kernels exhibit predictable memory accesses and compute patterns, making GPUs' parallel architecture well-suited for their execution. Software and runtime systems for GPUs are optimized to better utilize the stream multiprocessors, on-chip cache, and off-chip high-bandwidth memory. As deep learning models and GPUs evolve, access to newer GPUs is often limited, raising questions about the performance of new model architectures on existing GPUs, existing models on new GPUs, and new model architectures on new GPUs. To address these questions, we introduce NeuSight, a framework to predict the performance of various deep learning models, for both training and inference, on unseen GPUs without requiring actual execution. The framework leverages both GPU hardware behavior and software library optimizations to estimate end-to-end performance. Previous work uses regression models that capture linear trends or multilayer perceptrons to predict the overall latency of deep learning kernels on GPUs. These approaches suffer from higher error percentages when forecasting performance on unseen models and new GPUs. Instead, NeuSight decomposes the prediction problem into smaller problems, bounding the prediction through fundamental performance laws. NeuSight decomposes a single deep learning kernel prediction into smaller working sets called tiles, which are executed independently on the GPU. Tile-granularity predictions are determined using a machine learning approach and aggregated to estimate end-to-end latency. NeuSight outperforms prior work across various deep learning workloads and the latest GPUs. It reduces the percentage error from 121.4% and 30.8% to 2.3% in predicting the latency of GPT3 model for training and inference on H100, compared to state-of-the-art prior work, where both GPT3 and H100 were not used to train the framework.</description>

Abstract: In the field of machine unlearning, certified unlearning has been extensively studied in convex machine learning models due to its high efficiency and strong theoretical guarantees. However, its application to deep neural networks (DNNs), known for their highly nonconvex nature, still poses challenges. To bridge the gap between certified unlearning and DNNs, we propose several simple techniques to extend certified unlearning methods to nonconvex objectives. To reduce the time complexity, we develop an efficient computation method by inverse Hessian approximation without compromising certification guarantees. In addition, we extend our discussion of certification to nonconvergence training and sequential unlearning, considering that real-world users can send unlearning requests at different time points. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our method and the advantages of certified unlearning in DNNs.</description>

      <title>Can Large Language Models Understand Symbolic Graphics Programs?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08313v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Against the backdrop of enthusiasm for large language models (LLMs), there is an urgent need to scientifically assess their capabilities and shortcomings. This is nontrivial in part because it is difficult to find tasks which the models have not encountered during training. Utilizing symbolic graphics programs, we propose a domain well-suited to test multiple spatial-semantic reasoning skills of LLMs. Popular in computer graphics, these programs procedurally generate visual data. While LLMs exhibit impressive skills in general program synthesis and analysis, symbolic graphics programs offer a new layer of evaluation: they allow us to test an LLM's ability to answer different-grained semantic-level questions of the images or 3D geometries without a vision encoder. To semantically understand the symbolic programs, LLMs would need to possess the ability to "imagine" and reason how the corresponding graphics content would look with only the symbolic description. We use this task to evaluate LLMs by creating a large benchmark for the semantic visual understanding of symbolic graphics programs, built procedurally with minimal human effort. Particular emphasis is placed on transformations of images that leave the image level semantics invariant while introducing significant changes to the underlying program. We evaluate commercial and open-source LLMs on our benchmark to assess their ability to reason about visual output of programs, finding that LLMs considered stronger at reasoning generally perform better. Lastly, we introduce a novel method to improve this ability -- Symbolic Instruction Tuning (SIT), in which the LLM is finetuned with pre-collected instruction data on symbolic graphics programs. Interestingly, we find that SIT not only improves LLM's understanding on symbolic programs, but it also improves general reasoning ability on various other benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Self-Explainable Graph Transformer for Link Sign Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08754v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Signed Graph Neural Networks (SGNNs) have been shown to be effective in analyzing complex patterns in real-world situations where positive and negative links coexist. However, SGNN models suffer from poor explainability, which limit their adoptions in critical scenarios that require understanding the rationale behind predictions. To the best of our knowledge, there is currently no research work on the explainability of the SGNN models. Our goal is to address the explainability of decision-making for the downstream task of link sign prediction specific to signed graph neural networks. Since post-hoc explanations are not derived directly from the models, they may be biased and misrepresent the true explanations. Therefore, in this paper we introduce a Self-Explainable Signed Graph transformer (SE-SGformer) framework, which can not only outputs explainable information while ensuring high prediction accuracy. Specifically, We propose a new Transformer architecture for signed graphs and theoretically demonstrate that using positional encoding based on signed random walks has greater expressive power than current SGNN methods and other positional encoding graph Transformer-based approaches. We constructs a novel explainable decision process by discovering the $K$-nearest (farthest) positive (negative) neighbors of a node to replace the neural network-based decoder for predicting edge signs. These $K$ positive (negative) neighbors represent crucial information about the formation of positive (negative) edges between nodes and thus can serve as important explanatory information in the decision-making process. We conducted experiments on several real-world datasets to validate the effectiveness of SE-SGformer, which outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by improving 2.2\% prediction accuracy and 73.1\% explainablity accuracy in the best-case scenario.</description>

      <title>GARLIC: GPT-Augmented Reinforcement Learning with Intelligent Control for Vehicle Dispatching</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10286v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As urban residents demand higher travel quality, vehicle dispatch has become a critical component of online ride-hailing services. However, current vehicle dispatch systems struggle to navigate the complexities of urban traffic dynamics, including unpredictable traffic conditions, diverse driver behaviors, and fluctuating supply and demand patterns. These challenges have resulted in travel difficulties for passengers in certain areas, while many drivers in other areas are unable to secure orders, leading to a decline in the overall quality of urban transportation services. To address these issues, this paper introduces GARLIC: a framework of GPT-Augmented Reinforcement Learning with Intelligent Control for vehicle dispatching. GARLIC utilizes multiview graphs to capture hierarchical traffic states, and learns a dynamic reward function that accounts for individual driving behaviors. The framework further integrates a GPT model trained with a custom loss function to enable high-precision predictions and optimize dispatching policies in real-world scenarios. Experiments conducted on two real-world datasets demonstrate that GARLIC effectively aligns with driver behaviors while reducing the empty load rate of vehicles.</description>

      <title>Unlearning or Concealment? A Critical Analysis and Evaluation Metrics for Unlearning in Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05668v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent research has seen significant interest in methods for concept removal and targeted forgetting in text-to-image diffusion models. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive white-box analysis showing the vulnerabilities in existing diffusion model unlearning methods. We show that existing unlearning methods lead to decoupling of the targeted concepts (meant to be forgotten) for the corresponding prompts. This is concealment and not actual forgetting, which was the original goal. This paper presents a rigorous theoretical and empirical examination of five commonly used techniques for unlearning in diffusion models, while showing their potential weaknesses. We introduce two new evaluation metrics: Concept Retrieval Score (\textbf{CRS}) and Concept Confidence Score (\textbf{CCS}). These metrics are based on a successful adversarial attack setup that can recover \textit{forgotten} concepts from unlearned diffusion models. \textbf{CRS} measures the similarity between the latent representations of the unlearned and fully trained models after unlearning. It reports the extent of retrieval of the \textit{forgotten} concepts with increasing amount of guidance. CCS quantifies the confidence of the model in assigning the target concept to the manipulated data. It reports the probability of the \textit{unlearned} model's generations to be aligned with the original domain knowledge with increasing amount of guidance. The \textbf{CCS} and \textbf{CRS} enable a more robust evaluation of concept erasure methods. Evaluating existing five state-of-the-art methods with our metrics, reveal significant shortcomings in their ability to truly \textit{unlearn}.

      <description>arXiv:2409.18417v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the cost-efficiency aspect of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). RLHF leverages datasets of human preferences over outputs of large language models (LLM)s to instill human expectations into LLMs. Although preference annotation comes with a monetized cost, the economic utility of a preference dataset has not been considered by far. What exacerbates this situation is that, given complex intransitive or cyclic relationships in preference datasets, existing algorithms for fine-tuning LLMs are still far from capturing comprehensive preferences. This raises severe cost-efficiency concerns in production environments, where preference data accumulate over time. In this paper, we discuss the fine-tuning of LLMs as a monetized economy and introduce an auction mechanism to improve the efficiency of preference data collection in dollar terms. We show that introducing an auction mechanism can play an essential role in enhancing the cost-efficiency of RLHF, while maintaining satisfactory model performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed auction-based protocol is cost-effective for fine-tuning LLMs concentrating on high-quality feedback.</description>

      <title>Challenges of Generating Structurally Diverse Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18859v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For many graph-related problems, it can be essential to have a set of structurally diverse graphs. For instance, such graphs can be used for testing graph algorithms or their neural approximations. However, to the best of our knowledge, the problem of generating structurally diverse graphs has not been explored in the literature. In this paper, we fill this gap. First, we discuss how to define diversity for a set of graphs, why this task is non-trivial, and how one can choose a proper diversity measure. Then, for a given diversity measure, we propose and compare several algorithms optimizing it: we consider approaches based on standard random graph models, local graph optimization, genetic algorithms, and neural generative models. We show that it is possible to significantly improve diversity over basic random graph generators. Additionally, our analysis of generated graphs allows us to better understand the properties of graph distances: depending on which diversity measure is used for optimization, the obtained graphs may possess very different structural properties which gives a better understanding of the graph distance underlying the diversity measure.</description>

      <title>Localizing Memorization in SSL Vision Encoders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19069v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent work on studying memorization in self-supervised learning (SSL) suggests that even though SSL encoders are trained on millions of images, they still memorize individual data points. While effort has been put into characterizing the memorized data and linking encoder memorization to downstream utility, little is known about where the memorization happens inside SSL encoders. To close this gap, we propose two metrics for localizing memorization in SSL encoders on a per-layer (layermem) and per-unit basis (unitmem). Our localization methods are independent of the downstream task, do not require any label information, and can be performed in a forward pass. By localizing memorization in various encoder architectures (convolutional and transformer-based) trained on diverse datasets with contrastive and non-contrastive SSL frameworks, we find that (1) while SSL memorization increases with layer depth, highly memorizing units are distributed across the entire encoder, (2) a significant fraction of units in SSL encoders experiences surprisingly high memorization of individual data points, which is in contrast to models trained under supervision, (3) atypical (or outlier) data points cause much higher layer and unit memorization than standard data points, and (4) in vision transformers, most memorization happens in the fully-connected layers. Finally, we show that localizing memorization in SSL has the potential to improve fine-tuning and to inform pruning strategies.</description>

      <title>Model Developmental Safety: A Retention-Centric Method and Applications in Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03955v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the real world, a learning-enabled system usually undergoes multiple cycles of model development to enhance the system's ability to handle difficult or emerging tasks. This continual model development process raises a significant issue that the model development for acquiring new or improving existing capabilities may inadvertently lose capabilities of the old model, also known as catastrophic forgetting. Existing continual learning studies focus on mitigating catastrophic forgetting by trading off performance on previous tasks and new tasks to ensure good average performance. However, they are inadequate for many applications especially in safety-critical domains, as failure to strictly preserve the good performance of the old model not only introduces safety risks and uncertainties but also imposes substantial expenses in the re-improving and re-validation of existing properties. To address this issue, we introduce model developmental safety as a guarantee of a learning system such that in the model development process the new model should strictly preserve the existing protected capabilities of the old model while improving its performance on target tasks. To ensure the model developmental safety, we present a retention-centric framework by formulating the model developmental safety as data-dependent constraints. Under this framework, we study how to develop a pretrained vision-language model, specifically the CLIP model, for acquiring new capabilities or improving existing capabilities of image classification. We propose an efficient constrained optimization algorithm with theoretical guarantee and use its insights to finetune a CLIP model with task-dependent heads for promoting the model developmental safety. Our experiments on improving vision perception capabilities on autonomous driving and scene recognition datasets demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach.</description>

Abstract: In this empirical article, we introduce INNAprop, an optimization algorithm that combines the INNA method with the RMSprop adaptive gradient scaling. It leverages second-order information and rescaling while keeping the memory requirements of standard DL methods as AdamW or SGD with momentum. After giving geometrical insights, we evaluate INNAprop on CIFAR-10, Food101, and ImageNet with ResNets, VGG, DenseNet, and ViT, and on GPT-2 (OpenWebText) train from scratch and with LoRA fine-tuning (E2E). INNAprop consistently matches or outperforms AdamW both in training speed and accuracy, with minimal hyperparameter tuning in large-scale settings.

      <title>Unlocking FedNL: Self-Contained Compute-Optimized Implementation</title>

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is an emerging paradigm that enables intelligent agents to collaboratively train Machine Learning (ML) models in a distributed manner, eliminating the need for sharing their local data. The recent work (arXiv:2106.02969) introduces a family of Federated Newton Learn (FedNL) algorithms, marking a significant step towards applying second-order methods to FL and large-scale optimization. However, the reference FedNL prototype exhibits three serious practical drawbacks: (i) It requires 4.8 hours to launch a single experiment in a sever-grade workstation; (ii) The prototype only simulates multi-node setting; (iii) Prototype integration into resource-constrained applications is challenging. To bridge the gap between theory and practice, we present a self-contained implementation of FedNL, FedNL-LS, FedNL-PP for single-node and multi-node settings. Our work resolves the aforementioned issues and reduces the wall clock time by x1000. With this FedNL outperforms alternatives for training logistic regression in a single-node -- CVXPY (arXiv:1603.00943), and in a multi-node -- Apache Spark (arXiv:1505.06807), Ray/Scikit-Learn (arXiv:1712.05889). Finally, we propose two practical-orientated compressors for FedNL - adaptive TopLEK and cache-aware RandSeqK, which fulfill the theory of FedNL.</description>

Abstract: Controlled generation with pre-trained Diffusion and Flow Matching models has vast applications. One strategy for guiding ODE-based generative models is through optimizing a target loss $R(x_1)$ while staying close to the prior distribution. Along this line, some recent work showed the effectiveness of guiding flow model by differentiating through its ODE sampling process. Despite the superior performance, the theoretical understanding of this line of methods is still preliminary, leaving space for algorithm improvement. Moreover, existing methods predominately focus on Euclidean data manifold, and there is a compelling need for guided flow methods on complex geometries such as SO(3), which prevails in high-stake scientific applications like protein design. We present OC-Flow, a general and theoretically grounded training-free framework for guided flow matching using optimal control. Building upon advances in optimal control theory, we develop effective and practical algorithms for solving optimal control in guided ODE-based generation and provide a systematic theoretical analysis of the convergence guarantee in both Euclidean and SO(3). We show that existing backprop-through-ODE methods can be interpreted as special cases of Euclidean OC-Flow. OC-Flow achieved superior performance in extensive experiments on text-guided image manipulation, conditional molecule generation, and all-atom peptide design.</description>

      <title>LLMs are Highly-Constrained Biophysical Sequence Optimizers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22296v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently shown significant potential in various biological tasks such as protein engineering and molecule design. These tasks typically involve black-box discrete sequence optimization, where the challenge lies in generating sequences that are not only biologically feasible but also adhere to hard fine-grained constraints. However, LLMs often struggle with such constraints, especially in biological contexts where verifying candidate solutions is costly and time-consuming. In this study, we explore the possibility of employing LLMs as highly-constrained bilevel optimizers through a methodology we refer to as Language Model Optimization with Margin Expectation (LLOME). This approach combines both offline and online optimization, utilizing limited oracle evaluations to iteratively enhance the sequences generated by the LLM. We additionally propose a novel training objective -- Margin-Aligned Expectation (MargE) -- that trains the LLM to smoothly interpolate between the reward and reference distributions. Lastly, we introduce a synthetic test suite that bears strong geometric similarity to real biophysical problems and enables rapid evaluation of LLM optimizers without time-consuming lab validation. Our findings reveal that, in comparison to genetic algorithm baselines, LLMs achieve significantly lower regret solutions while requiring fewer test function evaluations. However, we also observe that LLMs exhibit moderate miscalibration, are susceptible to generator collapse, and have difficulty finding the optimal solution when no explicit ground truth rewards are available.</description>

      <title>Unpacking SDXL Turbo: Interpreting Text-to-Image Models with Sparse Autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22366v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have become a core ingredient in the reverse engineering of large-language models (LLMs). For LLMs, they have been shown to decompose intermediate representations that often are not interpretable directly into sparse sums of interpretable features, facilitating better control and subsequent analysis. However, similar analyses and approaches have been lacking for text-to-image models. We investigated the possibility of using SAEs to learn interpretable features for a few-step text-to-image diffusion models, such as SDXL Turbo. To this end, we train SAEs on the updates performed by transformer blocks within SDXL Turbo's denoising U-net. We find that their learned features are interpretable, causally influence the generation process, and reveal specialization among the blocks. In particular, we find one block that deals mainly with image composition, one that is mainly responsible for adding local details, and one for color, illumination, and style. Therefore, our work is an important first step towards better understanding the internals of generative text-to-image models like SDXL Turbo and showcases the potential of features learned by SAEs for the visual domain.

      <title>ASER: Activation Smoothing and Error Reconstruction for Large Language Model Quantization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07762v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantization stands as a pivotal technique for large language model (LLM) serving, yet it poses significant challenges particularly in achieving effective low-bit quantization. The limited numerical mapping makes the quantized model produce a non-trivial error, bringing out intolerable performance degration. This paper is anchored in the basic idea of model compression objectives, and delves into the layer-wise error distribution of LLMs during post-training quantization. Subsequently, we introduce ASER, an algorithm consisting of (1) Error Reconstruction: low-rank compensation for quantization error with LoRA-style matrices constructed by whitening SVD; (2) Activation Smoothing: outlier extraction to gain smooth activation and better error compensation. ASER is capable of quantizing typical LLMs to low-bit ones, particularly preserving accuracy even in W4A8 per-channel setup. Experimental results show that ASER is competitive among the state-of-the-art quantization algorithms, showing potential to activation quantization, with minor overhead.</description>

      <title>Golden Noise for Diffusion Models: A Learning Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09502v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion model is a popular paradigm that synthesizes personalized images by providing a text prompt and a random Gaussian noise. While people observe that some noises are ``golden noises'' that can achieve better text-image alignment and higher human preference than others, we still lack a machine learning framework to obtain those golden noises. To learn golden noises for diffusion sampling, we mainly make three contributions in this paper. First, we identify a new concept termed the \textit{noise prompt}, which aims at turning a random Gaussian noise into a golden noise by adding a small desirable perturbation derived from the text prompt. Following the concept, we first formulate the \textit{noise prompt learning} framework that systematically learns ``prompted'' golden noise associated with a text prompt for diffusion models. Second, we design a noise prompt data collection pipeline and collect a large-scale \textit{noise prompt dataset}~(NPD) that contains 100k pairs of random noises and golden noises with the associated text prompts. With the prepared NPD as the training dataset, we trained a small \textit{noise prompt network}~(NPNet) that can directly learn to transform a random noise into a golden noise. The learned golden noise perturbation can be considered as a kind of prompt for noise, as it is rich in semantic information and tailored to the given text prompt. Third, our extensive experiments demonstrate the impressive effectiveness and generalization of NPNet on improving the quality of synthesized images across various diffusion models, including SDXL, DreamShaper-xl-v2-turbo, and Hunyuan-DiT. Moreover, NPNet is a small and efficient controller that acts as a plug-and-play module with very limited additional inference and computational costs, as it just provides a golden noise instead of a random noise without accessing the original pipeline.</description>

      <title>Non-IID data in Federated Learning: A Survey with Taxonomy, Metrics, Methods, Frameworks and Future Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12377v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning have highlighted Federated Learning (FL) as a promising approach that enables multiple distributed users (so-called clients) to collectively train ML models without sharing their private data. While this privacy-preserving method shows potential, it struggles when data across clients is not independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data. The latter remains an unsolved challenge that can result in poorer model performance and slower training times. Despite the significance of non-IID data in FL, there is a lack of consensus among researchers about its classification and quantification. This technical survey aims to fill that gap by providing a detailed taxonomy for non-IID data, partition protocols, and metrics to quantify data heterogeneity. Additionally, we describe popular solutions to address non-IID data and standardized frameworks employed in FL with heterogeneous data. Based on our state-of-the-art survey, we present key lessons learned and suggest promising future research directions.</description>

      <title>Differential learning kinetics govern the transition from memorization to generalization during in-context learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00104v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transformers exhibit in-context learning (ICL): the ability to use novel information presented in the context without additional weight updates. Recent work shows that ICL emerges when models are trained on a sufficiently diverse set of tasks and the transition from memorization to generalization is sharp with increasing task diversity. One interpretation is that a network's limited capacity to memorize favors generalization. Here, we examine the mechanistic underpinnings of this transition using a small transformer applied to a synthetic ICL task. Using theory and experiment, we show that the sub-circuits that memorize and generalize can be viewed as largely independent. The relative rates at which these sub-circuits learn explains the transition from memorization to generalization, rather than capacity constraints. We uncover a memorization scaling law, which determines the task diversity threshold at which the network generalizes. The theory quantitatively explains a variety of other ICL-related phenomena, including the long-tailed distribution of when ICL is acquired, the bimodal behavior of solutions close to the task diversity threshold, the influence of contextual and data distributional statistics on ICL, and the transient nature of ICL.</description>

      <title>Perturb and Recover: Fine-tuning for Effective Backdoor Removal from CLIP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00727v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vision-Language models like CLIP have been shown to be highly effective at linking visual perception and natural language understanding, enabling sophisticated image-text capabilities, including strong retrieval and zero-shot classification performance. Their widespread use, as well as the fact that CLIP models are trained on image-text pairs from the web, make them both a worthwhile and relatively easy target for backdoor attacks. As training foundational models, such as CLIP, from scratch is very expensive, this paper focuses on cleaning potentially poisoned models via fine-tuning. We first show that existing cleaning techniques are not effective against simple structured triggers used in Blended or BadNet backdoor attacks, exposing a critical vulnerability for potential real-world deployment of these models. Then, we introduce PAR, Perturb and Recover, a surprisingly simple yet effective mechanism to remove backdoors from CLIP models. Through extensive experiments across different encoders and types of backdoor attacks, we show that PAR achieves high backdoor removal rate while preserving good standard performance. Finally, we illustrate that our approach is effective even only with synthetic text-image pairs, i.e. without access to real training data.

      <title>Personalized Coupled Tensor Decomposition for Multimodal Data Fusion: Uniqueness and Algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01102v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coupled tensor decompositions (CTDs) perform data fusion by linking factors from different datasets. Although many CTDs have been already proposed, current works do not address important challenges of data fusion, where: 1) the datasets are often heterogeneous, constituting different "views" of a given phenomena (multimodality); and 2) each dataset can contain personalized or dataset-specific information, constituting distinct factors that are not coupled with other datasets. In this work, we introduce a personalized CTD framework tackling these challenges. A flexible model is proposed where each dataset is represented as the sum of two components, one related to a common tensor through a multilinear measurement model, and another specific to each dataset. Both the common and distinct components are assumed to admit a polyadic decomposition. This generalizes several existing CTD models. We provide conditions for specific and generic uniqueness of the decomposition that are easy to interpret. These conditions employ uni-mode uniqueness of different individual datasets and properties of the measurement model. Two algorithms are proposed to compute the common and distinct components: a semi-algebraic one and a coordinate-descent optimization method. Experimental results illustrate the advantage of the proposed framework compared with the state of the art approaches.</description>

      <title>Distance-Adaptive Quaternion Knowledge Graph Embedding with Bidirectional Rotation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04076v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quaternion contains one real part and three imaginary parts, which provided a more expressive hypercomplex space for learning knowledge graph. Existing quaternion embedding models measure the plausibility of a triplet either through semantic matching or geometric distance scoring functions. However, it appears that semantic matching diminishes the separability of entities, while the distance scoring function weakens the semantics of entities. To address this issue, we propose a novel quaternion knowledge graph embedding model. Our model combines semantic matching with entity's geometric distance to better measure the plausibility of triplets. Specifically, in the quaternion space, we perform a right rotation on head entity and a reverse rotation on tail entity to learn rich semantic features. Then, we utilize distance adaptive translations to learn geometric distance between entities. Furthermore, we provide mathematical proofs to demonstrate our model can handle complex logical relationships. Extensive experimental results and analyses show our model significantly outperforms previous models on well-known knowledge graph completion benchmark datasets.

Abstract: In recent years, there has been growing interest in leveraging machine learning for homeless service assignment. However, the categorical nature of administrative data recorded for homeless individuals hinders the development of accurate machine learning methods for this task. This work asserts that deriving latent representations of such features, while at the same time leveraging underlying relationships between instances is crucial in algorithmically enhancing the existing assignment decision-making process. Our proposed approach learns temporal and functional relationships between services from historical data, as well as unobserved but relevant relationships between individuals to generate features that significantly improve the prediction of the next service assignment compared to the state-of-the-art.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08114v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of modeling a non-linear dynamical system when given a time series by deriving equations directly from the data. Despite the fact that time series data are given as input, models for dynamics and estimation algorithms that incorporate long-term temporal dependencies are largely absent from existing studies. In this paper, we introduce a latent state to allow time-dependent modeling and formulate this problem as a dynamics estimation problem in latent states. We face multiple technical challenges, including (1) modeling latent non-linear dynamics and (2) solving circular dependencies caused by the presence of latent states. To tackle these challenging problems, we propose a new method, Latent Non-Linear equation modeling (LaNoLem), that can model a latent non-linear dynamical system and a novel alternating minimization algorithm for effectively estimating latent states and model parameters. In addition, we introduce criteria to control model complexity without human intervention. Compared with the state-of-the-art model, LaNoLem achieves competitive performance for estimating dynamics while outperforming other methods in prediction.</description>

      <title>Learn How to Query from Unlabeled Data Streams in Federated Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08138v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative learning among decentralized clients while safeguarding the privacy of their local data. Existing studies on FL typically assume offline labeled data available at each client when the training starts. Nevertheless, the training data in practice often arrive at clients in a streaming fashion without ground-truth labels. Given the expensive annotation cost, it is critical to identify a subset of informative samples for labeling on clients. However, selecting samples locally while accommodating the global training objective presents a challenge unique to FL. In this work, we tackle this conundrum by framing the data querying process in FL as a collaborative decentralized decision-making problem and proposing an effective solution named LeaDQ, which leverages multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms. In particular, under the implicit guidance from global information, LeaDQ effectively learns the local policies for distributed clients and steers them towards selecting samples that can enhance the global model's accuracy. Extensive simulations on image and text tasks show that LeaDQ advances the model performance in various FL scenarios, outperforming the benchmarking algorithms.</description>

      <title>Watermarking Training Data of Music Generation Models</title>

Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen-AI) models are increasingly used to produce content across domains, including text, images, and audio. While these models represent a major technical breakthrough, they gain their generative capabilities from being trained on enormous amounts of human-generated content, which often includes copyrighted material. In this work, we investigate whether audio watermarking techniques can be used to detect an unauthorized usage of content to train a music generation model. We compare outputs generated by a model trained on watermarked data to a model trained on non-watermarked data. We study factors that impact the model's generation behaviour: the watermarking technique, the proportion of watermarked samples in the training set, and the robustness of the watermarking technique against the model's tokenizer. Our results show that audio watermarking techniques, including some that are imperceptible to humans, can lead to noticeable shifts in the model's outputs. We also study the robustness of a state-of-the-art watermarking technique to removal techniques.</description>

      <title>Merging versus Ensembling in Multi-Study Prediction: Theoretical Insight from Random Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.07382</link>
      <description>arXiv:1905.07382v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A critical decision point when training predictors using multiple studies is whether studies should be combined or treated separately. We compare two multi-study prediction approaches in the presence of potential heterogeneity in predictor-outcome relationships across datasets: 1) merging all of the datasets and training a single learner, and 2) multi-study ensembling, which involves training a separate learner on each dataset and combining the predictions resulting from each learner. For ridge regression, we show analytically and confirm via simulation that merging yields lower prediction error than ensembling when the predictor-outcome relationships are relatively homogeneous across studies. However, as cross-study heterogeneity increases, there exists a transition point beyond which ensembling outperforms merging. We provide analytic expressions for the transition point in various scenarios, study asymptotic properties, and illustrate how transition point theory can be used for deciding when studies should be combined with an application from metagenomics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1912.02182v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: People involved in mass emergencies increasingly publish information-rich contents in online social networks (OSNs), thus acting as a distributed and resilient network of human sensors. In this work we present HERMES, a system designed to enrich the information spontaneously disclosed by OSN users in the aftermath of disasters. HERMES leverages a mixed data collection strategy, called hybrid sensing, and state-of-the-art AI techniques. Evaluated in real-world emergencies, HERMES proved to increase: (i) the amount of the available damage information; (ii) the density (up to 7x) and the variety (up to 18x) of the retrieved geographic information; (iii) the geographic coverage (up to 30%) and granularity.</description>

      <title>Alternating minimization algorithm with initialization analysis for r-local and k-sparse unlabeled sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.07621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.07621v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unlabeled sensing is a linear inverse problem with permuted measurements. We propose an alternating minimization (AltMin) algorithm with a suitable initialization for two widely considered permutation models: partially shuffled/$k$-sparse permutations and $r$-local/block diagonal permutations. Key to the performance of the AltMin algorithm is the initialization. For the exact unlabeled sensing problem, assuming either a Gaussian measurement matrix or a sub-Gaussian signal, we bound the initialization error in terms of the number of blocks $s$ and the number of shuffles $k$. Experimental results show that our algorithm is fast, applicable to both permutation models, and robust to choice of measurement matrix. We also test our algorithm on several real datasets for the linked linear regression problem and show superior performance compared to baseline methods.</description>

      <title>The rate of convergence of Bregman proximal methods: Local geometry vs. regularity vs. sharpness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.08043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.08043v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine the last-iterate convergence rate of Bregman proximal methods - from mirror descent to mirror-prox and its optimistic variants - as a function of the local geometry induced by the prox-mapping defining the method. For generality, we focus on local solutions of constrained, non-monotone variational inequalities, and we show that the convergence rate of a given method depends sharply on its associated Legendre exponent, a notion that measures the growth rate of the underlying Bregman function (Euclidean, entropic, or other) near a solution. In particular, we show that boundary solutions exhibit a stark separation of regimes between methods with a zero and non-zero Legendre exponent: the former converge at a linear rate, while the latter converge, in general, sublinearly. This dichotomy becomes even more pronounced in linearly constrained problems where methods with entropic regularization achieve a linear convergence rate along sharp directions, compared to convergence in a finite number of steps under Euclidean regularization.</description>

      <title>ELBA: Learning by Asking for Embodied Visual Navigation and Task Completion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.04865v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The research community has shown increasing interest in designing intelligent embodied agents that can assist humans in accomplishing tasks. Although there have been significant advancements in related vision-language benchmarks, most prior work has focused on building agents that follow instructions rather than endowing agents the ability to ask questions to actively resolve ambiguities arising naturally in embodied environments. To address this gap, we propose an Embodied Learning-By-Asking (ELBA) model that learns when and what questions to ask to dynamically acquire additional information for completing the task. We evaluate ELBA on the TEACh vision-dialog navigation and task completion dataset. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves improved task performance compared to baseline models without question-answering capabilities.</description>

      <title>Injectivity of ReLU networks: perspectives from statistical physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.14112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.14112v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When can the input of a ReLU neural network be inferred from its output? In other words, when is the network injective? We consider a single layer, $x \mapsto \mathrm{ReLU}(Wx)$, with a random Gaussian $m \times n$ matrix $W$, in a high-dimensional setting where $n, m \to \infty$. Recent work connects this problem to spherical integral geometry giving rise to a conjectured sharp injectivity threshold for $\alpha = \frac{m}{n}$ by studying the expected Euler characteristic of a certain random set. We adopt a different perspective and show that injectivity is equivalent to a property of the ground state of the spherical perceptron, an important spin glass model in statistical physics. By leveraging the (non-rigorous) replica symmetry-breaking theory, we derive analytical equations for the threshold whose solution is at odds with that from the Euler characteristic. Furthermore, we use Gordon's min--max theorem to prove that a replica-symmetric upper bound refutes the Euler characteristic prediction. Along the way we aim to give a tutorial-style introduction to key ideas from statistical physics in an effort to make the exposition accessible to a broad audience. Our analysis establishes a connection between spin glasses and integral geometry but leaves open the problem of explaining the discrepancies.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Multi-scale Approach for Speech and Dynamics Synchrony in Talking Head Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.03270v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Animating still face images with deep generative models using a speech input signal is an active research topic and has seen important recent progress.However, much of the effort has been put into lip syncing and rendering quality while the generation of natural head motion, let alone the audio-visual correlation between head motion and speech, has often been neglected.In this work, we propose a multi-scale audio-visual synchrony loss and a multi-scale autoregressive GAN to better handle short and long-term correlation between speech and the dynamics of the head and lips.In particular, we train a stack of syncer models on multimodal input pyramids and use these models as guidance in a multi-scale generator network to produce audio-aligned motion unfolding over diverse time scales.Both the pyramid of audio-visual syncers and the generative models are trained in a low-dimensional space that fully preserves dynamics cues.The experiments show significant improvements over the state-of-the-art in head motion dynamics quality and especially in multi-scale audio-visual synchrony on a collection of benchmark datasets.</description>

      <title>High-Rate Phase Association with Travel Time Neural Fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.07572v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Earthquake science and seismology rely on the ability to associate seismic waves with their originating earthquakes. Earthquake detection algorithms based on deep learning have progressed rapidly and now routinely detect microearthquakes with unprecedented clarity, providing information about fault dynamics on increasingly finer spatiotemporal scales. However, this densification of detections can overwhelm existing techniques for phase association which rely on fixed wave speed models and associate events one by one. These methods fail when the event rates become high or where the 4D complexity of elastic wave speeds cannot be ignored. Here, we introduce HARPA, a deep learning solution to this problem. HARPA is a high-rate association framework which incorporates wave physics by leveraging deep generative models and travel time neural fields. Instead of associating events one by one, it lifts arrival sequences to probability distributions and compares them using an optimal transport metric. The generative travel time neural fields are used to estimate the wave speed simultaneously with association. HARPA outperforms state-of-the-art association methods for both real seismic data and complex synthetic models and paves the way for improved understanding of seismicity while establishing a new seismic data analysis paradigm.</description>

      <title>A simple thinking about the application of the attention mechanism in medical ultrasound image segmentation task</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.00919v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The AI-based assisted diagnosis programs have been widely investigated on medical ultrasound images. Complex scenario of ultrasound image, in which the coupled interference of internal and external factors is severe, brings a unique challenge for localize the object region automatically and precisely in ultrasound images. In this study, we seek to propose a more general and robust Benchmark Attention Adaptive Framework (BAAF) to assist doctors segment or diagnose lesions and tissues in ultrasound images more quickly and accurately. Different from existing attention schemes, the BAAF consists of a parallel hybrid attention module (PHAM) and an adaptive calibration mechanism (ACM). Specifically, BAAF first coarsely calibrates the input features from the channel and spatial dimensions, and then adaptively selects more robust lesion or tissue characterizations from the coarse-calibrated feature maps. The design of BAAF further optimizes the "what" and "where" focus and selection problems in CNNs and seeks to improve the segmentation accuracy of lesions or tissues in medical ultrasound images. The method is evaluated on four medical ultrasound segmentation tasks, and the adequate experimental results demonstrate the remarkable performance improvement over existing state-of-the-art methods. In addition, the comparison with existing attention mechanisms also demonstrates the superiority of BAAF. This work provides the possibility for automated medical ultrasound assisted diagnosis and reduces reliance on human accuracy and precision.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.13094v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we consider a nonconvex unconstrained optimization problem minimizing a twice differentiable objective function with H\"older continuous Hessian. Specifically, we first propose a Newton-conjugate gradient (Newton-CG) method for finding an approximate first- and second-order stationary point of this problem, assuming the associated the H\"older parameters are explicitly known. Then we develop a parameter-free Newton-CG method without requiring any prior knowledge of these parameters. To the best of our knowledge, this method is the first parameter-free second-order method achieving the best-known iteration and operation complexity for finding an approximate first- and second-order stationary point of this problem. Finally, we present preliminary numerical results to demonstrate the superior practical performance of our parameter-free Newton-CG method over a well-known regularized Newton method.</description>

      <title>Avoiding strict saddle points of nonconvex regularized problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09274v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a class of non-convex and non-smooth sparse optimization problems, which encompass most existing nonconvex sparsity-inducing terms. We show the second-order optimality conditions only depend on the nonzeros of the stationary points. We propose two damped iterative reweighted algorithms including the iteratively reweighted $\ell_1$ algorithm (DIRL$_1$) and the iteratively reweighted $\ell_2$ (DIRL$_2$) algorithm, to solve these problems. For DIRL$_1$, we show the reweighted $\ell_1$ subproblem has support identification property so that DIRL$_1$ locally reverts to a gradient descent algorithm around a stationary point. For DIRL$_2$, we show the solution map of the reweighted $\ell_2$ subproblem is differentiable and Lipschitz continuous everywhere. Therefore, the map of DIRL$_1$ and DIRL$_2$ and their inverse are Lipschitz continuous, and the strict saddle points are their unstable fixed points. By applying the stable manifold theorem, these algorithms are shown to converge only to local minimizers with randomly initialization when the strictly saddle point property is assumed.</description>

      <title>Learn To be Efficient: Build Structured Sparsity in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06126v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success with their billion-level parameters, yet they incur high inference overheads. The emergence of activation sparsity in LLMs provides a natural approach to reduce this cost by involving only parts of the parameters for inference. However, existing methods only focus on utilizing this naturally formed activation sparsity in a post-training setting, overlooking the potential for further amplifying this inherent sparsity. In this paper, we hypothesize that LLMs can learn to be efficient by achieving more structured activation sparsity. To achieve this, we introduce a novel training algorithm, Learn-To-be-Efficient (LTE), designed to train efficiency-aware LLMs to learn to activate fewer neurons and achieve a better trade-off between sparsity and performance. Furthermore, unlike SOTA MoEfication methods, which mainly focus on ReLU-based models, LTE can also be applied to LLMs like LLaMA using non-ReLU activations. Extensive evaluation on language understanding, language generation, and instruction tuning tasks show that LTE consistently outperforms SOTA baselines. Along with our hardware-aware custom kernel implementation, LTE reduces LLaMA2-7B inference latency by 25% at 50% sparsity.</description>

      <title>AICAttack: Adversarial Image Captioning Attack with Attention-Based Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11940v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning research have shown remarkable achievements across many tasks in computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP). At the intersection of CV and NLP is the problem of image captioning, where the related models' robustness against adversarial attacks has not been well studied. This paper presents a novel adversarial attack strategy, AICAttack (Attention-based Image Captioning Attack), designed to attack image captioning models through subtle perturbations on images. Operating within a black-box attack scenario, our algorithm requires no access to the target model's architecture, parameters, or gradient information. We introduce an attention-based candidate selection mechanism that identifies the optimal pixels to attack, followed by a customised differential evolution method to optimise the perturbations of pixels' RGB values. We demonstrate AICAttack's effectiveness through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets against multiple victim models. The experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms current leading-edge techniques by achieving consistently higher attack success rates.</description>

      <title>How Likely Do LLMs with CoT Mimic Human Reasoning?</title>

Abstract: Chain-of-thought emerges as a promising technique for eliciting reasoning capabilities from Large Language Models (LLMs). However, it does not always improve task performance or accurately represent reasoning processes, leaving unresolved questions about its usage. In this paper, we diagnose the underlying mechanism by comparing the reasoning process of LLMs with humans, using causal analysis to understand the relationships between the problem instruction, reasoning, and the answer in LLMs. Our empirical study reveals that LLMs often deviate from the ideal causal chain, resulting in spurious correlations and potential consistency errors (inconsistent reasoning and answers). We also examine various factors influencing the causal structure, finding that in-context learning with examples strengthens it, while post-training techniques like supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning on human feedback weaken it. To our surprise, the causal structure cannot be strengthened by enlarging the model size only, urging research on new techniques. We hope that this preliminary study will shed light on understanding and improving the reasoning process in LLM.</description>

      <title>CGGM: A conditional graph generation model with adaptive sparsity for node anomaly detection in IoT networks</title>

Abstract: Dynamic graphs are extensively employed for detecting anomalous behavior in nodes within the Internet of Things (IoT). Graph generative models are often used to address the issue of imbalanced node categories in dynamic graphs. Nevertheless, the constraints it faces include the monotonicity of adjacency relationships, the difficulty in constructing multi-dimensional features for nodes, and the lack of a method for end-to-end generation of multiple categories of nodes. In this paper, we propose a novel graph generation model, called CGGM, specifically for generating samples belonging to the minority class. The framework consists two core module: a conditional graph generation module and a graph-based anomaly detection module. The generative module adapts to the sparsity of the matrix by downsampling a noise adjacency matrix, and incorporates a multi-dimensional feature encoder based on multi-head self-attention to capture latent dependencies among features. Additionally, a latent space constraint is combined with the distribution distance to approximate the latent distribution of real data. The graph-based anomaly detection module utilizes the generated balanced dataset to predict the node behaviors. Extensive experiments have shown that CGGM outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and divergence. The results also demonstrate CGGM can generated diverse data categories, that enhancing the performance of multi-category classification task.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Low-Dose CT Image Reconstruction by Domain and Task Shifting Gaussian Denoisers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03551v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Computed tomography from a low radiation dose (LDCT) is challenging due to high noise in the projection data. Popular approaches for LDCT image reconstruction are two-stage methods, typically consisting of the filtered backprojection (FBP) algorithm followed by a neural network for LDCT image enhancement. Two-stage methods are attractive for their simplicity and potential for computational efficiency, typically requiring only a single FBP and a neural network forward pass for inference. However, the best reconstruction quality is currently achieved by unrolled iterative methods (Learned Primal-Dual and ItNet), which are more complex and thus have a higher computational cost for training and inference. We propose a method combining the simplicity and efficiency of two-stage methods with state-of-the-art reconstruction quality. Our strategy utilizes a neural network pretrained for Gaussian noise removal from natural grayscale images, fine-tuned for LDCT image enhancement. We call this method FBP-DTSGD (Domain and Task Shifted Gaussian Denoisers) as the fine-tuning is a task shift from Gaussian denoising to enhancing LDCT images and a domain shift from natural grayscale to LDCT images. An ablation study with three different pretrained Gaussian denoisers indicates that the performance of FBP-DTSGD does not depend on a specific denoising architecture, suggesting future advancements in Gaussian denoising could benefit the method. The study also shows that pretraining on natural images enhances LDCT reconstruction quality, especially with limited training data. Notably, pretraining involves no additional cost, as existing pretrained models are used. The proposed method currently holds the top mean position in the LoDoPaB-CT challenge.</description>

      <title>Attention-based Class-Conditioned Alignment for Multi-Source Domain Adaptation of Object Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09918v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Domain adaptation methods for object detection (OD) strive to mitigate the impact of distribution shifts by promoting feature alignment across source and target domains. Multi-source domain adaptation (MSDA) allows leveraging multiple annotated source datasets and unlabeled target data to improve the accuracy and robustness of the detection model. Most state-of-the-art MSDA methods for OD perform feature alignment in a class-agnostic manner. This is challenging since the objects have unique modality information due to variations in object appearance across domains. A recent prototype-based approach proposed a class-wise alignment, yet it suffers from error accumulation caused by noisy pseudo-labels that can negatively affect adaptation with imbalanced data. To overcome these limitations, we propose an attention-based class-conditioned alignment method for MSDA, designed to align instances of each object category across domains. In particular, an attention module combined with an adversarial domain classifier allows learning domain-invariant and class-specific instance representations. Experimental results on multiple benchmarking MSDA datasets indicate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods and exhibits robustness to class imbalance, achieved through a conceptually simple class-conditioning strategy.

      <title>A Multi-Stage Framework for Joint Chest X-Ray Diagnosis and Visual Attention Prediction Using Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16970v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Purpose: As visual inspection is an inherent process during radiological screening, the associated eye gaze data can provide valuable insights into relevant clinical decisions. As deep learning has become the state-of-the-art for computer-assisted diagnosis, integrating human behavior, such as eye gaze data, into these systems is instrumental to help align machine predictions with clinical diagnostic criteria, thus enhancing the quality of automatic radiological diagnosis. Methods: We propose a novel deep learning framework for joint disease diagnosis and prediction of corresponding clinical visual attention maps for chest X-ray scans. Specifically, we introduce a new dual-encoder multi-task UNet, which leverages both a DenseNet201 backbone and a Residual and Squeeze-and-Excitation block-based encoder to extract diverse features for visual attention map prediction, and a multi-scale feature-fusion classifier to perform disease classification. To tackle the issue of asynchronous training schedules of individual tasks in multi-task learning, we proposed a multi-stage cooperative learning strategy, with contrastive learning for feature encoder pretraining to boost performance. Results: Our proposed method is shown to significantly outperform existing techniques for chest X-ray diagnosis (AUC=0.93) and the quality of visual attention map prediction (Correlation coefficient=0.58). Conclusion: Benefiting from the proposed multi-task multi-stage cooperative learning, our technique demonstrates the benefit of integrating clinicians' eye gaze into clinical AI systems to boost performance and potentially explainability.</description>

      <title>Large language models as oracles for instantiating ontologies with domain-specific knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04108v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Background. Endowing intelligent systems with semantic data commonly requires designing and instantiating ontologies with domain-specific knowledge. Especially in the early phases, those activities are typically performed manually by human experts possibly leveraging on their own experience. The resulting process is therefore time-consuming, error-prone, and often biased by the personal background of the ontology designer. Objective. To mitigate that issue, we propose a novel domain-independent approach to automatically instantiate ontologies with domain-specific knowledge, by leveraging on large language models (LLMs) as oracles. Method. Starting from (i) an initial schema composed by inter-related classes and properties and (ii) a set of query templates, our method queries the LLM multiple times, and generates instances for both classes and properties from its replies. Thus, the ontology is automatically filled with domain-specific knowledge, compliant to the initial schema. As a result, the ontology is quickly and automatically enriched with manifold instances, which experts may consider to keep, adjust, discard, or complement according to their own needs and expertise. Contribution. We formalise our method in general way and instantiate it over various LLMs, as well as on a concrete case study. We report experiments rooted in the nutritional domain where an ontology of food meals and their ingredients is automatically instantiated from scratch, starting from a categorisation of meals and their relationships. There, we analyse the quality of the generated ontologies and compare ontologies attained by exploiting different LLMs. Experimentally, our approach achieves a quality metric that is up to five times higher than the state-of-the-art, while reducing erroneous entities and relations by up to ten times. Finally, we provide a SWOT analysis of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Annotation-guided Protein Design with Multi-Level Domain Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16866v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The core challenge of de novo protein design lies in creating proteins with specific functions or properties, guided by certain conditions. Current models explore to generate protein using structural and evolutionary guidance, which only provide indirect conditions concerning functions and properties. However, textual annotations of proteins, especially the annotations for protein domains, which directly describe the protein's high-level functionalities, properties, and their correlation with target amino acid sequences, remain unexplored in the context of protein design tasks. In this paper, we propose Protein-Annotation Alignment Generation, PAAG, a multi-modality protein design framework that integrates the textual annotations extracted from protein database for controllable generation in sequence space. Specifically, within a multi-level alignment module, PAAG can explicitly generate proteins containing specific domains conditioned on the corresponding domain annotations, and can even design novel proteins with flexible combinations of different kinds of annotations. Our experimental results underscore the superiority of the aligned protein representations from PAAG over 7 prediction tasks. Furthermore, PAAG demonstrates a significant increase in generation success rate (24.7% vs 4.7% in zinc finger, and 54.3% vs 22.0% in the immunoglobulin domain) in comparison to the existing model. We anticipate that PAAG will broaden the horizons of protein design by leveraging the knowledge from between textual annotation and proteins.</description>

      <title>Accurate Link Prediction for Edge-Incomplete Graphs via PU Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11911v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given an edge-incomplete graph, how can we accurately find the missing links? The link prediction in edge-incomplete graphs aims to discover the missing relations between entities when their relationships are represented as a graph. Edge-incomplete graphs are prevalent in real-world due to practical limitations, such as not checking all users when adding friends in a social network. Addressing the problem is crucial for various tasks, including recommending friends in social networks and finding references in citation networks. However, previous approaches rely heavily on the given edge-incomplete (observed) graph, making it challenging to consider the missing (unobserved) links during training. In this paper, we propose PULL (PU-Learning-based Link predictor), an accurate link prediction method based on the positive-unlabeled (PU) learning. PULL treats the observed edges in the training graph as positive examples, and the unconnected node pairs as unlabeled ones. PULL effectively prevents the link predictor from overfitting to the observed graph by proposing latent variables for every edge, and leveraging the expected graph structure with respect to the variables. Extensive experiments on five real-world datasets show that PULL consistently outperforms the baselines for predicting links in edge-incomplete graphs.</description>

      <title>CommonPower: A Framework for Safe Data-Driven Smart Grid Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03231v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The growing complexity of power system management has led to an increased interest in reinforcement learning (RL). However, vanilla RL controllers cannot themselves ensure satisfaction of system constraints. Therefore, combining them with formally correct safeguarding mechanisms is an important aspect when studying RL for power system management. Integrating safeguarding into complex use cases requires tool support. To address this need, we introduce the Python tool CommonPower. CommonPower's unique contribution lies in its symbolic modeling approach, which enables flexible, model-based safeguarding of RL controllers. Moreover, CommonPower offers a unified interface for single-agent RL, multi-agent RL, and optimal control, with seamless integration of different forecasting methods. This allows users to validate the effectiveness of safe RL controllers across a large variety of case studies and investigate the influence of specific aspects on overall performance. We demonstrate CommonPower's versatility through a numerical case study that compares RL agents featuring different safeguards with a model predictive controller in the context of building energy management.</description>

      <title>Pre-trained Transformer Uncovers Meaningful Patterns in Human Mobility Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04029v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We empirically demonstrate that a transformer pre-trained on country-scale unlabeled human mobility data learns embeddings capable, through fine-tuning, of developing a deep understanding of the target geography and its corresponding mobility patterns. Utilizing an adaptation framework, we evaluate the performance of our pre-trained embeddings in encapsulating a broad spectrum of concepts directly and indirectly related to human mobility. This includes basic notions, such as geographic location and distance, and extends to more complex constructs, such as administrative divisions and land cover. Our extensive empirical analysis reveals a substantial performance boost gained from pre-training, reaching up to 38% in tasks such as tree-cover regression. We attribute this result to the ability of the pre-training to uncover meaningful patterns hidden in the raw data, beneficial for modeling relevant high-level concepts. The pre-trained embeddings emerge as robust representations of regions and trajectories, potentially valuable for a wide range of downstream applications.</description>

      <title>Improve Mathematical Reasoning in Language Models by Automated Process Supervision</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06592v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Complex multi-step reasoning tasks, such as solving mathematical problems or generating code, remain a significant hurdle for even the most advanced large language models (LLMs). Verifying LLM outputs with an Outcome Reward Model (ORM) is a standard inference-time technique aimed at enhancing the reasoning performance of LLMs. However, this still proves insufficient for reasoning tasks with a lengthy or multi-hop reasoning chain, where the intermediate outcomes are neither properly rewarded nor penalized. Process supervision addresses this limitation by assigning intermediate rewards during the reasoning process. To date, the methods used to collect process supervision data have relied on either human annotation or per-step Monte Carlo estimation, both prohibitively expensive to scale, thus hindering the broad application of this technique. In response to this challenge, we propose a novel divide-and-conquer style Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm named \textit{OmegaPRM} for the efficient collection of high-quality process supervision data. This algorithm swiftly identifies the first error in the Chain of Thought (CoT) with binary search and balances the positive and negative examples, thereby ensuring both efficiency and quality. As a result, we are able to collect over 1.5 million process supervision annotations to train Process Reward Models (PRMs). This fully automated process supervision alongside the weighted self-consistency algorithm is able to enhance LLMs' math reasoning performances. We improved the success rates of the instruction-tuned Gemini Pro model from 51\% to 69.4\% on MATH500 and from 86.4\% to 93.6\% on GSM8K. Similarly, we boosted the success rates of Gemma2 27B from 42.3\% to 58.2\% on MATH500 and from 74.0\% to 92.2\% on GSM8K. The entire process operates without any human intervention or supervision, making our method both financially and ...</description>

      <title>LLAVIDAL: A Large LAnguage VIsion Model for Daily Activities of Living</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09390v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current Large Language Vision Models (LLVMs) trained on web videos perform well in general video understanding but struggle with fine-grained details, complex human-object interactions (HOI), and view-invariant representation learning essential for Activities of Daily Living (ADL). This limitation stems from a lack of specialized ADL video instruction-tuning datasets and insufficient modality integration to capture discriminative action representations. To address this, we propose a semi-automated framework for curating ADL datasets, creating ADL-X, a multiview, multimodal RGBS instruction-tuning dataset. Additionally, we introduce LLAVIDAL, an LLVM integrating videos, 3D skeletons, and HOIs to model ADL's complex spatiotemporal relationships. For training LLAVIDAL a simple joint alignment of all modalities yields suboptimal results; thus, we propose a Multimodal Progressive (MMPro) training strategy, incorporating modalities in stages following a curriculum. We also establish ADL MCQ and video description benchmarks to assess LLVM performance in ADL tasks. Trained on ADL-X, LLAVIDAL achieves state-of-the-art performance across ADL benchmarks. Code and data will be made publicly available at: https://adl-x.github.io/.</description>

Abstract: RNA plays a pivotal role in translating genetic instructions into functional outcomes, underscoring its importance in biological processes and disease mechanisms. Despite the emergence of numerous deep learning approaches for RNA, particularly universal RNA language models, there remains a significant lack of standardized benchmarks to assess the effectiveness of these methods. In this study, we introduce the first comprehensive RNA benchmark BEACON (\textbf{BE}nchm\textbf{A}rk for \textbf{CO}mprehensive R\textbf{N}A Task and Language Models). First, BEACON comprises 13 distinct tasks derived from extensive previous work covering structural analysis, functional studies, and engineering applications, enabling a comprehensive assessment of the performance of methods on various RNA understanding tasks. Second, we examine a range of models, including traditional approaches like CNNs, as well as advanced RNA foundation models based on language models, offering valuable insights into the task-specific performances of these models. Third, we investigate the vital RNA language model components from the tokenizer and positional encoding aspects. Notably, our findings emphasize the superiority of single nucleotide tokenization and the effectiveness of Attention with Linear Biases (ALiBi) over traditional positional encoding methods. Based on these insights, a simple yet strong baseline called BEACON-B is proposed, which can achieve outstanding performance with limited data and computational resources. The datasets and source code of our benchmark are available at https://github.com/terry-r123/RNABenchmark.</description>

      <title>Measuring Sample Importance in Data Pruning for Language Models based on Information Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14124v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Compute-efficient training of language models has become an important issue. We consider data pruning for data-efficient training of LLMs. In this work, we consider a data pruning method based on information entropy. We propose that the samples in the training corpus be ranked in terms of their informativeness which we estimate through entropy functions. The key idea is that, less informative samples are likely to contain redundant information, and thus should be pruned first. We use the entropy functions based on the negative log-likelihood and the average inverse word frequency of a sample as a surrogate to measure its informativeness. Experiments reveal that the proposed information-based pruning can improve upon various language modeling and downstream tasks, and enhance the generalization capability of language models.</description>

      <title>KANQAS: Kolmogorov-Arnold Network for Quantum Architecture Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17630v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum architecture Search (QAS) is a promising direction for optimization and automated design of quantum circuits towards quantum advantage. Recent techniques in QAS emphasize Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)-based deep Q-networks. However, their interpretability remains challenging due to the large number of learnable parameters and the complexities involved in selecting appropriate activation functions. In this work, to overcome these challenges, we utilize the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) in the QAS algorithm, analyzing their efficiency in the task of quantum state preparation and quantum chemistry. In quantum state preparation, our results show that in a noiseless scenario, the probability of success is 2 to 5 times higher than MLPs. In noisy environments, KAN outperforms MLPs in fidelity when approximating these states, showcasing its robustness against noise. In tackling quantum chemistry problems, we enhance the recently proposed QAS algorithm by integrating curriculum reinforcement learning with a KAN structure. This facilitates a more efficient design of parameterized quantum circuits by reducing the number of required 2-qubit gates and circuit depth. Further investigation reveals that KAN requires a significantly smaller number of learnable parameters compared to MLPs; however, the average time of executing each episode for KAN is higher.</description>

      <title>Training on the Test Task Confounds Evaluation and Emergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07890v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a fundamental problem in the evaluation of large language models that we call training on the test task. Unlike wrongful practices like training on the test data, leakage, or data contamination, training on the test task is not a malpractice. Rather, the term describes a growing set of practices that utilize knowledge about evaluation tasks at training time. We demonstrate that training on the test task confounds both relative model evaluations and claims about emergent capabilities. We argue that the seeming superiority of one model family over another may be explained by a different degree of training on the test task. To this end, we propose an effective method to adjust for the effect of training on the test task on benchmark evaluations. Put simply, to fine-tune each model under comparison on the same task-relevant data before evaluation. We then show that instances of emergent behavior disappear gradually as models train on the test task. Our work promotes a new perspective on the evaluation of large language models with broad implications for benchmarking and the study of emergent capabilities</description>

      <title>From Imitation to Refinement -- Residual RL for Precise Assembly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16677v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in Behavior Cloning (BC) have made it easy to teach robots new tasks. However, we find that the ease of teaching comes at the cost of unreliable performance that saturates with increasing data for tasks requiring precision. The performance saturation can be attributed to two critical factors: (a) distribution shift resulting from the use of offline data and (b) the lack of closed-loop corrective control caused by action chucking (predicting a set of future actions executed open-loop) critical for BC performance. Our key insight is that by predicting action chunks, BC policies function more like trajectory "planners" than closed-loop controllers necessary for reliable execution. To address these challenges, we devise a simple yet effective method, ResiP (Residual for Precise Manipulation), that overcomes the reliability problem while retaining BC's ease of teaching and long-horizon capabilities. ResiP augments a frozen, chunked BC model with a fully closed-loop residual policy trained with reinforcement learning (RL) that addresses distribution shifts and introduces closed-loop corrections over open-loop execution of action chunks predicted by the BC trajectory planner.

      <title>Using GPT-4 to guide causal machine learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18607v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since its introduction to the public, ChatGPT has had an unprecedented impact. While some experts praised AI advancements and highlighted their potential risks, others have been critical about the accuracy and usefulness of Large Language Models (LLMs). In this paper, we are interested in the ability of LLMs to identify causal relationships. We focus on the well-established GPT-4 (Turbo) and evaluate its performance under the most restrictive conditions, by isolating its ability to infer causal relationships based solely on the variable labels without being given any other context by humans, demonstrating the minimum level of effectiveness one can expect when it is provided with label-only information. We show that questionnaire participants judge the GPT-4 graphs as the most accurate in the evaluated categories, closely followed by knowledge graphs constructed by domain experts, with causal Machine Learning (ML) far behind. We use these results to highlight the important limitation of causal ML, which often produces causal graphs that violate common sense, affecting trust in them. However, we show that pairing GPT-4 with causal ML overcomes this limitation, resulting in graphical structures learnt from real data that align more closely with those identified by domain experts, compared to structures learnt by causal ML alone. Overall, our findings suggest that despite GPT-4 not being explicitly designed to reason causally, it can still be a valuable tool for causal representation, as it improves the causal discovery process of causal ML algorithms that are designed to do just that.</description>

      <title>Application of Neural Ordinary Differential Equations for ITER Burning Plasma Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14404v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of burning plasmas in tokamaks are crucial for advancing controlled thermonuclear fusion. This study applies the NeuralPlasmaODE, a multi-region multi-timescale transport model, to simulate the complex energy transfer processes in ITER deuterium-tritium (D-T) plasmas. Our model captures the interactions between energetic alpha particles, electrons, and ions, which are vital for understanding phenomena such as thermal runaway instability. We employ neural ordinary differential equations (Neural ODEs) for the numerical derivation of diffusivity parameters, enabling precise modeling of energy interactions between different plasma regions. By leveraging transfer learning, we utilize model parameters derived from DIII-D experimental data, enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of our simulations without training from scratch. Applying this model to ITER's inductive and non-inductive operational scenarios, our results demonstrate that radiation and transport processes effectively remove excess heat from the core plasma, preventing thermal runaway instability. This study underscores the potential of machine learning in advancing our understanding and control of burning plasma dynamics in fusion reactors.</description>

      <title>Disentangling Mean Embeddings for Better Diagnostics of Image Generators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01314v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The evaluation of image generators remains a challenge due to the limitations of traditional metrics in providing nuanced insights into specific image regions. This is a critical problem as not all regions of an image may be learned with similar ease. In this work, we propose a novel approach to disentangle the cosine similarity of mean embeddings into the product of cosine similarities for individual pixel clusters via central kernel alignment. Consequently, we can quantify the contribution of the cluster-wise performance to the overall image generation performance. We demonstrate how this enhances the explainability and the likelihood of identifying pixel regions of model misbehavior across various real-world use cases.</description>

      <title>Guiding Vision-Language Model Selection for Visual Question-Answering Across Tasks, Domains, and Knowledge Types</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09269v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Visual Question-Answering (VQA) has become key to user experience, particularly after improved generalization capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). But evaluating VLMs for an application requirement using a standardized framework in practical settings is still challenging. This paper aims to solve that using an end-to-end framework. We present VQA360 - a novel dataset derived from established VQA benchmarks, annotated with task types, application domains, and knowledge types, for a comprehensive evaluation. We also introduce GoEval, a multimodal evaluation metric developed using GPT-4o, achieving a correlation factor of 56.71% with human judgments. Our experiments with state-of-the-art VLMs reveal that no single model excels universally, thus, making a right choice a key design decision. Proprietary models such as Gemini-1.5-Pro and GPT-4o-mini generally outperform others, but open-source models like InternVL-2-8B and CogVLM-2-Llama-3-19B also demonstrate competitive strengths, while providing additional advantages. Our framework can also be extended to other tasks.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Goal Detection and Cessation in Reinforcement Learning: A Case Study on Source Term Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09541v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning has revolutionized decision-making processes in dynamic environments, yet it often struggles with autonomously detecting and achieving goals without clear feedback signals. For example, in a Source Term Estimation problem, the lack of precise environmental information makes it challenging to provide clear feedback signals and to define and evaluate how the source's location is determined. To address this challenge, the Autonomous Goal Detection and Cessation (AGDC) module was developed, enhancing various RL algorithms by incorporating a self-feedback mechanism for autonomous goal detection and cessation upon task completion. Our method effectively identifies and ceases undefined goals by approximating the agent's belief, significantly enhancing the capabilities of RL algorithms in environments with limited feedback. To validate effectiveness of our approach, we integrated AGDC with deep Q-Network, proximal policy optimization, and deep deterministic policy gradient algorithms, and evaluated its performance on the Source Term Estimation problem. The experimental results showed that AGDC-enhanced RL algorithms significantly outperformed traditional statistical methods such as infotaxis, entrotaxis, and dual control for exploitation and exploration, as well as a non-statistical random action selection method. These improvements were evident in terms of success rate, mean traveled distance, and search time, highlighting AGDC's effectiveness and efficiency in complex, real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>Group &amp; Reweight: A Novel Cost-Sensitive Approach to Mitigating Class Imbalance in Network Traffic Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19214v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Internet services have led to the eruption of network traffic, and machine learning on these Internet data has become an indispensable tool, especially when the application is risk-sensitive. This paper focuses on network traffic classification in the presence of severe class imbalance. Such a distributional trait mostly drifts the optimal decision boundary and results in an unsatisfactory solution. This raises safety concerns in the network traffic field when previous class imbalance methods hardly deal with numerous minority malicious classes. To alleviate these effects, we design a \textit{group \&amp; reweight} strategy for alleviating class imbalance. Inspired by the group distributionally optimization framework, our approach heuristically clusters classes into groups, iteratively updates the non-parametric weights for separate classes, and optimizes the learning model by minimizing reweighted losses. We theoretically interpret the optimization process from a Stackelberg game and perform extensive experiments on typical benchmarks. Results show that our approach can not only suppress the negative effect of class imbalance but also improve the comprehensive performance in prediction.</description>

      <title>Annealing Flow Generative Model Towards Sampling High-Dimensional and Multi-Modal Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20547v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sampling from high dimensional, multimodal distributions remains a fundamental challenge across domains such as statistical Bayesian inference and physics based machine learning. In this paper, we propose Annealing Flow, a continuous normalizing flow based approach designed to sample from high dimensional and multimodal distributions. The key idea is to learn a continuous normalizing flow based transport map, guided by annealing, to transition samples from an easy to sample distribution to the target distribution, facilitating effective exploration of modes in high dimensional spaces. Unlike many existing methods, AF training does not rely on samples from the target distribution. AF ensures effective and balanced mode exploration, achieves linear complexity in sample size and dimensions, and circumvents inefficient mixing times. We demonstrate the superior performance of AF compared to state of the art methods through extensive experiments on various challenging distributions and real world datasets, particularly in high-dimensional and multimodal settings. We also highlight the potential of AF for sampling the least favorable distributions.</description>

      <title>Modeling the Human Visual System: Comparative Insights from Response-Optimized and Task-Optimized Vision Models, Language Models, and different Readout Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14031v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Over the past decade, predictive modeling of neural responses in the primate visual system has advanced significantly, largely driven by various DNN approaches. These include models optimized directly for visual recognition, cross-modal alignment through contrastive objectives, neural response prediction from scratch, and large language model embeddings.Likewise, different readout mechanisms, ranging from fully linear to spatial-feature factorized methods have been explored for mapping network activations to neural responses. Despite the diversity of these approaches, it remains unclear which method performs best across different visual regions. In this study, we systematically compare these approaches for modeling the human visual system and investigate alternative strategies to improve response predictions. Our findings reveal that for early to mid-level visual areas, response-optimized models with visual inputs offer superior prediction accuracy, while for higher visual regions, embeddings from LLMs based on detailed contextual descriptions of images and task-optimized models pretrained on large vision datasets provide the best fit. Through comparative analysis of these modeling approaches, we identified three distinct regions in the visual cortex: one sensitive primarily to perceptual features of the input that are not captured by linguistic descriptions, another attuned to fine-grained visual details representing semantic information, and a third responsive to abstract, global meanings aligned with linguistic content. We also highlight the critical role of readout mechanisms, proposing a novel scheme that modulates receptive fields and feature maps based on semantic content, resulting in an accuracy boost of 3-23% over existing SOTAs for all models and brain regions. Together, these findings offer key insights into building more precise models of the visual system.</description>

      <title>Learning $k$-body Hamiltonians via compressed sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18928v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of learning a $k$-body Hamiltonian with $M$ unknown Pauli terms that are not necessarily geometrically local. We propose a protocol that learns the Hamiltonian to precision $\epsilon$ with total evolution time ${\mathcal{O}}(M^{1/2+1/p}/\epsilon)$ up to logarithmic factors, where the error is quantified by the $\ell^p$-distance between Pauli coefficients. Our learning protocol uses only single-qubit control operations and a GHZ state initial state, is non-adaptive, is robust against SPAM errors, and performs well even if $M$ and $k$ are not precisely known in advance or if the Hamiltonian is not exactly $M$-sparse. Methods from the classical theory of compressed sensing are used for efficiently identifying the $M$ terms in the Hamiltonian from among all possible $k$-body Pauli operators. We also provide a lower bound on the total evolution time needed in this learning task, and we discuss the operational interpretations of the $\ell^1$ and $\ell^2$ error metrics. In contrast to most previous works, our learning protocol requires neither geometric locality nor any other relaxed locality conditions.</description>

      <title>The Effects of Multi-Task Learning on ReLU Neural Network Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21696v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the properties of solutions to multi-task shallow ReLU neural network learning problems, wherein the network is trained to fit a dataset with minimal sum of squared weights. Remarkably, the solutions learned for each individual task resemble those obtained by solving a kernel regression problem, revealing a novel connection between neural networks and kernel methods. It is known that single-task neural network learning problems are equivalent to a minimum norm interpolation problem in a non-Hilbertian Banach space, and that the solutions of such problems are generally non-unique. In contrast, we prove that the solutions to univariate-input, multi-task neural network interpolation problems are almost always unique, and coincide with the solution to a minimum-norm interpolation problem in a Sobolev (Reproducing Kernel) Hilbert Space. We also demonstrate a similar phenomenon in the multivariate-input case; specifically, we show that neural network learning problems with large numbers of tasks are approximately equivalent to an $\ell^2$ (Hilbert space) minimization problem over a fixed kernel determined by the optimal neurons.</description>

      <title>Evaluating GPT-4 at Grading Handwritten Solutions in Math Exams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05231v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in generative artificial intelligence (AI) have shown promise in accurately grading open-ended student responses. However, few prior works have explored grading handwritten responses due to a lack of data and the challenge of combining visual and textual information. In this work, we leverage state-of-the-art multi-modal AI models, in particular GPT-4o, to automatically grade handwritten responses to college-level math exams. Using real student responses to questions in a probability theory exam, we evaluate GPT-4o's alignment with ground-truth scores from human graders using various prompting techniques. We find that while providing rubrics improves alignment, the model's overall accuracy is still too low for real-world settings, showing there is significant room for growth in this task.</description>

      <title>Compression of Higher Order Ambisonics with Multichannel RVQGAN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12008v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A multichannel extension to the RVQGAN neural coding method is proposed, and realized for data-driven compression of third-order Ambisonics audio. The input- and output layers of the generator and discriminator models are modified to accept multiple (16) channels without increasing the model bitrate. We also propose a loss function for accounting for spatial perception in immersive reproduction, and transfer learning from single-channel models. Listening test results with 7.1.4 immersive playback show that the proposed extension is suitable for coding scene-based, 16-channel Ambisonics content with good quality at 16 kbps when trained and tested on the EigenScape database. The model has potential applications for learning other types of content and multichannel formats.</description>

      <title>MT3DNet: Multi-Task learning Network for 3D Surgical Scene Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03928v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In image-assisted minimally invasive surgeries (MIS), understanding surgical scenes is vital for real-time feedback to surgeons, skill evaluation, and improving outcomes through collaborative human-robot procedures. Within this context, the challenge lies in accurately detecting, segmenting, and estimating the depth of surgical scenes depicted in high-resolution images, while simultaneously reconstructing the scene in 3D and providing segmentation of surgical instruments along with detection labels for each instrument. To address this challenge, a novel Multi-Task Learning (MTL) network is proposed for performing these tasks concurrently. A key aspect of this approach involves overcoming the optimization hurdles associated with handling multiple tasks concurrently by integrating a Adversarial Weight Update into the MTL framework, the proposed MTL model achieves 3D reconstruction through the integration of segmentation, depth estimation, and object detection, thereby enhancing the understanding of surgical scenes, which marks a significant advancement compared to existing studies that lack 3D capabilities. Comprehensive experiments on the EndoVis2018 benchmark dataset underscore the adeptness of the model in efficiently addressing all three tasks, demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed techniques.</description>

      <title>Missing Melodies: AI Music Generation and its "Nearly" Complete Omission of the Global South</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04100v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in generative AI have sparked renewed interest and expanded possibilities for music generation. However, the performance and versatility of these systems across musical genres are heavily influenced by the availability of training data. We conducted an extensive analysis of over one million hours of audio datasets used in AI music generation research and manually reviewed more than 200 papers from eleven prominent AI and music conferences and organizations (AAAI, ACM, EUSIPCO, EURASIP, ICASSP, ICML, IJCAI, ISMIR, NeurIPS, NIME, SMC) to identify a critical gap in the fair representation and inclusion of the musical genres of the Global South in AI research. Our findings reveal a stark imbalance: approximately 86% of the total dataset hours and over 93% of researchers focus primarily on music from the Global North. However, around 40% of these datasets include some form of non-Western music, genres from the Global South account for only 14.6% of the data. Furthermore, approximately 51% of the papers surveyed concentrate on symbolic music generation, a method that often fails to capture the cultural nuances inherent in music from regions such as South Asia, the Middle East, and Africa. As AI increasingly shapes the creation and dissemination of music, the significant underrepresentation of music genres in datasets and research presents a serious threat to global musical diversity. We also propose some important steps to mitigate these risks and foster a more inclusive future for AI-driven music generation.</description>

      <title>AdaptiveMDL-GenClust: A Robust Clustering Framework Integrating Normalized Mutual Information and Evolutionary Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05305v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Clustering algorithms are pivotal in data analysis, enabling the organization of data into meaningful groups. However, individual clustering methods often exhibit inherent limitations and biases, preventing the development of a universal solution applicable to diverse datasets. To address these challenges, we introduce a robust clustering framework that integrates the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle with a genetic optimization algorithm. The framework begins with an ensemble clustering approach to generate an initial clustering solution, which is then refined using MDL-guided evaluation functions and optimized through a genetic algorithm. This integration allows the method to adapt to the dataset's intrinsic properties, minimizing dependency on the initial clustering input and ensuring a data-driven, robust clustering process. We evaluated the proposed method on thirteen benchmark datasets using four established validation metrics: accuracy, normalized mutual information (NMI), Fisher score, and adjusted Rand index (ARI). Experimental results demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms traditional clustering methods, yielding higher accuracy, improved stability, and reduced bias. The methods adaptability makes it effective across datasets with diverse characteristics, highlighting its potential as a versatile and reliable tool for complex clustering tasks. By combining the MDL principle with genetic optimization, this study offers a significant advancement in clustering methodology, addressing key limitations and delivering superior performance in varied applications.</description>

      <title>Generalized Least Squares Kernelized Tensor Factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07041v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Real-world datasets often contain missing or corrupted values. Completing multidimensional tensor-structured data with missing entries is essential for numerous applications. Smoothness-constrained low-rank factorization models have shown superior performance with reduced computational costs. While effective at capturing global and long-range correlations, these models struggle to reproduce short-scale, high-frequency variations in the data. In this paper, we introduce the Generalized Least Squares Kernelized Tensor Factorization (GLSKF) framework for tensor completion. GLSKF integrates smoothness-constrained low-rank factorization with a locally correlated residual process; the resulting additive structure can effectively characterize both global dependencies and local variations. In particular, we define the covariance norm to enforce the smoothness of factor matrices in the global low-rank factorization, and use structured covariance/kernel functions to model the local processes. For model estimation, we develop an alternating least squares (ALS) procedure with closed-form solutions for each subproblem. To efficiently handle missing data, GLSKF utilizes projection matrices that preserve the Kronecker structure of covariances, facilitating fast computations through conjugate gradient (CG) and preconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG) algorithms. The proposed framework is evaluated on four real-world datasets across diverse tasks: traffic speed imputation, color image inpainting, video completion, and MRI image reconstruction. Experimental results confirm that GLSKF delivers superior effectiveness and scalability, establishing it as a robust solution for multidimensional tensor completion.</description>

      <title>Parallel simulation for sampling under isoperimetry and score-based diffusion models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07435v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been a surge of interest in proving discretization bounds for sampling under isoperimetry and for diffusion models. As data size grows, reducing the iteration cost becomes an important goal. Inspired by the great success of the parallel simulation of the initial value problem in scientific computation, we propose parallel Picard methods for sampling tasks. Rigorous theoretical analysis reveals that our algorithm achieves better dependence on dimension $d$ than prior works in iteration complexity (i.e., reduced from $\widetilde{O}(\log^2 d)$ to $\widetilde{O}(\log d)$), which is even optimal for sampling under isoperimetry with specific iteration complexity. Our work highlights the potential advantages of simulation methods in scientific computation for dynamics-based sampling and diffusion models.</description>

      <title>FLRONet: Deep Operator Learning for High-Fidelity Fluid Flow Field Reconstruction from Sparse Sensor Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08009v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ability to reconstruct high-fidelity fluid flow fields from sparse sensor measurement is critical for many science and engineering applications, but remains a huge challenge. This challenge is caused by the large difference between the dimensions of the state space and the observational space, making the operator that provides the mapping from the state space to the observational space ill-conditioned and non-invertible. As a result, deriving the forward map from the observational space to the state space as the inverse of the measurement operator is nearly impossible. While traditional methods, including sparse optimization, data assimilation, or machine learning based regressive reconstruction, are available, they often struggle with generalization and computational efficiency, particularly when non-uniform or varying discretization of the domain are considered. In this work, we propose FLRONet, a novel operator learning framework designed to reconstruct full-state flow fields from sparse sensor measurements in space and time. FLRONet utilizes a branch-trunk architecture, where the branch network integrates sensor observations from multiple time instances, and the trunk network encodes the entire temporal domain. This design allows FLRONet to achieve highly accurate, discretization-independent reconstructions at any time within the observation window. Although the popular three-dimensional Fourier Neural Operator offers similar functionalities, our results show that FLRONet surpasses it in both accuracy and efficiency. FLRONet not only achieves superior performance in approximating the true operator but also exhibits significantly faster inference at high-fidelity discretizations.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Prompting for Continual Relation Extraction: A Within-Task Variance Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08285v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To address catastrophic forgetting in Continual Relation Extraction (CRE), many current approaches rely on memory buffers to rehearse previously learned knowledge while acquiring new tasks. Recently, prompt-based methods have emerged as potent alternatives to rehearsal-based strategies, demonstrating strong empirical performance. However, upon analyzing existing prompt-based approaches for CRE, we identified several critical limitations, such as inaccurate prompt selection, inadequate mechanisms for mitigating forgetting in shared parameters, and suboptimal handling of cross-task and within-task variances. To overcome these challenges, we draw inspiration from the relationship between prefix-tuning and mixture of experts, proposing a novel approach that employs a prompt pool for each task, capturing variations within each task while enhancing cross-task variances. Furthermore, we incorporate a generative model to consolidate prior knowledge within shared parameters, eliminating the need for explicit data storage. Extensive experiments validate the efficacy of our approach, demonstrating superior performance over state-of-the-art prompt-based and rehearsal-free methods in continual relation extraction.</description>
