      <title>Domain-Specific Self-Supervised Pre-training for Agricultural Disease Classification: A Hierarchical Vision Transformer Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of domain-specific self-supervised pre-training on agricultural disease classification using hierarchical vision transformers. Our key finding is that SimCLR pre-training on just 3,000 unlabeled agricultural images provides a +4.57% accuracy improvement--exceeding the +3.70% gain from hierarchical architecture design. Critically, we show this SSL benefit is architecture-agnostic: applying the same pre-training to Swin-Base yields +4.08%, to ViT-Base +4.20%, confirming practitioners should prioritize domain data collection over architectural choices. Using HierarchicalViT (HVT), a Swin-style hierarchical transformer, we evaluate on three datasets: Cotton Leaf Disease (7 classes, 90.24%), PlantVillage (38 classes, 96.3%), and PlantDoc (27 classes, 87.1%). At matched parameter counts, HVT-Base (78M) achieves 88.91% vs. Swin-Base (88M) at 87.23%, a +1.68% improvement. For deployment reliability, we report calibration analysis showing HVT achieves 3.56% ECE (1.52% after temperature scaling). Code: https://github.com/w2sg-arnav/HierarchicalViT</description>

      <title>Multi-modal MRI-Based Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis with Transformer-based Image Synthesis and Transfer Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder in which pathological changes begin many years before the onset of clinical symptoms, making early detection essential for timely intervention. T1-weighted (T1w) Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is routinely used in clinical practice to identify macroscopic brain alterations, but these changes typically emerge relatively late in the disease course. Diffusion MRI (dMRI), in contrast, is sensitive to earlier microstructural abnormalities by probing water diffusion in brain tissue. dMRI metrics, including fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD), provide complementary information about white matter integrity and neurodegeneration. However, dMRI acquisitions are time-consuming and susceptible to motion artifacts, limiting their routine use in clinical populations. To bridge this gap, I propose a 3D TransUNet image synthesis framework that predicts FA and MD maps directly from T1w MRI. My model generates high-fidelity maps, achieving a structural similarity index (SSIM) exceeding 0.93 and a strong Pearson correlation (&gt;0.94) with ground-truth dMRI. When integrated into a multi-modal diagnostic model, these synthetic features boost AD classification accuracy by 5% (78.75%-&gt;83.75%) and, most importantly, improve mild cognitive impairment (MCI) detection by 12.5%. This study demonstrates that high-quality diffusion microstructural information can be inferred from routinely acquired T1w MRI, effectively transferring the benefits of multi-modality imaging to settings where diffusion data are unavailable. By reducing scan time while preserving complementary structural and microstructural information, the proposed approach has the potential to improve the accessibility, efficiency, and accuracy of AD diagnosis in clinical practice.</description>

      <title>PointSLAM++: Robust Dense Neural Gaussian Point Cloud-based SLAM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-time 3D reconstruction is crucial for robotics and augmented reality, yet current simultaneous localization and mapping(SLAM) approaches often struggle to maintain structural consistency and robust pose estimation in the presence of depth noise. This work introduces PointSLAM++, a novel RGB-D SLAM system that leverages a hierarchically constrained neural Gaussian representation to preserve structural relationships while generating Gaussian primitives for scene mapping. It also employs progressive pose optimization to mitigate depth sensor noise, significantly enhancing localization accuracy. Furthermore, it utilizes a dynamic neural representation graph that adjusts the distribution of Gaussian nodes based on local geometric complexity, enabling the map to adapt to intricate scene details in real time. This combination yields high-precision 3D mapping and photorealistic scene rendering. Experimental results show PointSLAM++ outperforms existing 3DGS-based SLAM methods in reconstruction accuracy and rendering quality, demonstrating its advantages for large-scale AR and robotics.</description>

      <title>Handcrafted Feature-Assisted One-Class Learning for Artist Authentication in Historical Drawings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Authentication and attribution of works on paper remain persistent challenges in cultural heritage, particularly when the available reference corpus is small and stylistic cues are primarily expressed through line and limited tonal variation. We present a verification-based computational framework for historical drawing authentication using one-class autoencoders trained on a compact set of interpretable handcrafted features. Ten artist-specific verifiers are trained using authenticated sketches from the Metropolitan Museum of Art open-access collection, the Ashmolean Collections Catalogue, the Morgan Library and Museum, the Royal Collection Trust (UK), the Victoria and Albert Museum Collections, and an online catalogue of the Casa Buonarroti collection and evaluated under a biometric-style protocol with genuine and impostor trials. Feature vectors comprise Fourier-domain energy, Shannon entropy, global contrast, GLCM-based homogeneity, and a box-counting estimate of fractal complexity. Across 900 verification decisions (90 genuine and 810 impostor trials), the pooled system achieves a True Acceptance Rate of 83.3% with a False Acceptance Rate of 9.5% at the chosen operating point. Performance varies substantially by artist, with near-zero false acceptance for some verifiers and elevated confusability for others. A pairwise attribution of false accepts indicates structured error pathways consistent with stylistic proximity and shared drawing conventions, whilst also motivating tighter control of digitisation artefacts and threshold calibration. The proposed methodology is designed to complement, rather than replace, connoisseurship by providing reproducible, quantitative evidence suitable for data-scarce settings common in historical sketch attribution.</description>

      <title>A one-step generation model with a Single-Layer Transformer: Layer number re-distillation of FreeFlow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Currently, Flow matching methods aim to compress the iterative generation process of diffusion models into a few or even a single step, with MeanFlow and FreeFlow being representative achievements of one-step generation based on Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs). We observe that the 28-layer Transformer architecture of FreeFlow can be characterized as an Euler discretization scheme for an ODE along the depth axis, where the layer index serves as the discrete time step. Therefore, we distill the number of layers of the FreeFlow model, following the same derivation logic as FreeFlow, and propose SLT (Single-Layer Transformer), which uses a single shared DiT block to approximate the depth-wise feature evolution of the 28-layer teacher. During training, it matches the teacher's intermediate features at several depth patches, fuses those patch-level representations, and simultaneously aligns the teacher's final velocity prediction. Through distillation training, we compress the 28 independent Transformer Blocks of the teacher model DiT-XL/2 into a single Transformer Block, reducing the parameter count from 675M to 4.3M. Furthermore, leveraging its minimal parameters and rapid sampling speed, SLT can screen more candidate points in the noise space within the same timeframe, thereby selecting higher-quality initial points for the teacher model FreeFlow and ultimately enhancing the quality of generated images. Experimental results demonstrate that within a time budget comparable to two random samplings of the teacher model, our method performs over 100 noise screenings and produces a high-quality sample through the teacher model using the selected points. Quality fluctuations caused by low-quality initial noise under a limited number of FreeFlow sampling calls are effectively avoided, substantially improving the stability and average generation quality of one-step generation.</description>

      <title>Compress to Focus: Efficient Coordinate Compression for Policy Optimization in Multi-Turn GUI Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-turn GUI agents enable complex task completion through sequential decision-making, but suffer from severe context inflation as interaction history accumulates. Existing strategies either sacrifice long-term context via truncation or compromise spatial structure through token pruning. In this paper, we propose Coordinate Compression Policy Optimization (CCPO), an efficient policy optimization framework that couples visual compression with policy optimization for multi-turn GUI agents. CCPO introduces Coordinate-Aware Spatial Compression (CASC), which aggregates coordinates from multiple rollouts to capture target-relevant regions and progressively narrow historical attention around key visual areas. From interactions across rollouts, CASC adaptively constructs attention boundaries that concentrate computation on the most informative regions of the scene. We further design a Distance-Based Advantage that provides fine-grained learning signals based on distance rather than binary correctness, improving both grounding accuracy and compression quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CCPO achieves SOTA performance across four benchmarks with up to 55% token compression and 3.8$\times$ training speedup.</description>

      <title>KG-ViP: Bridging Knowledge Grounding and Visual Perception in Multi-modal LLMs for Visual Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for Visual Question Answering (VQA) often suffer from dual limitations: knowledge hallucination and insufficient fine-grained visual perception. Crucially, we identify that commonsense graphs and scene graphs provide precisely complementary solutions to these respective deficiencies by providing rich external knowledge and capturing fine-grained visual details. However, prior works typically treat them in isolation, overlooking their synergistic potential. To bridge this gap, we propose KG-ViP, a unified framework that empowers MLLMs by fusing scene graphs and commonsense graphs. The core of the KG-ViP framework is a novel retrieval-and-fusion pipeline that utilizes the query as a semantic bridge to progressively integrate both graphs, synthesizing a unified structured context that facilitates reliable multi-modal reasoning. Extensive experiments on FVQA 2.0+ and MVQA benchmarks demonstrate that KG-ViP significantly outperforms existing VQA methods.</description>

      <title>Beyond Accuracy: Evaluating Grounded Visual Evidence in Thinking with Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the remarkable progress of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in adopting "Thinking-with-Images" capabilities, accurately evaluating the authenticity of their reasoning process remains a critical challenge. Existing benchmarks mainly rely on outcome-oriented accuracy, lacking the capability to assess whether models can accurately leverage fine-grained visual cues for multi-step reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose ViEBench, a process-verifiable benchmark designed to evaluate faithful visual reasoning. Comprising 200 multi-scenario high-resolution images with expert-annotated visual evidence, ViEBench uniquely categorizes tasks by difficulty into perception and reasoning dimensions, where reasoning tasks require utilizing localized visual details with prior knowledge. To establish comprehensive evaluation criteria, we introduce a dual-axis matrix that provides fine-grained metrics through four diagnostic quadrants, enabling transparent diagnosis of model behavior across varying task complexities. Our experiments yield several interesting observations: (1) VLMs can sometimes produce correct final answers despite grounding on irrelevant regions, and (2) they may successfully locate the correct evidence but still fail to utilize it to reach accurate conclusions. Our findings demonstrate that ViEBench can serve as a more explainable and practical benchmark for comprehensively evaluating the effectiveness agentic VLMs. The codes will be released at: https://github.com/Xuchen-Li/ViEBench.</description>

      <title>When Rules Fall Short: Agent-Driven Discovery of Emerging Content Issues in Short Video Platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trends on short-video platforms evolve at a rapid pace, with new content issues emerging every day that fall outside the coverage of existing annotation policies. However, traditional human-driven discovery of emerging issues is too slow, which leads to delayed updates of annotation policies and poses a major challenge for effective content governance. In this work, we propose an automatic issue discovery method based on multimodal LLM agents. Our approach automatically recalls short videos containing potential new issues and applies a two-stage clustering strategy to group them, with each cluster corresponding to a newly discovered issue. The agent then generates updated annotation policies from these clusters, thereby extending coverage to these emerging issues. Our agent has been deployed in the real system. Both offline and online experiments demonstrate that this agent-based method significantly improves the effectiveness of emerging-issue discovery (with an F1 score improvement of over 20%) and enhances the performance of subsequent issue governance (reducing the view count of problematic videos by approximately 15%). More importantly, compared to manual issue discovery, it greatly reduces time costs and substantially accelerates the iteration of annotation policies.</description>

      <title>Now You See Me, Now You Don't: A Unified Framework for Expression Consistent Anonymization in Talking Head Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Face video anonymization is aimed at privacy preservation while allowing for the analysis of videos in a number of computer vision downstream tasks such as expression recognition, people tracking, and action recognition. We propose here a novel unified framework referred to as Anon-NET, streamlined to de-identify facial videos, while preserving age, gender, race, pose, and expression of the original video. Specifically, we inpaint faces by a diffusion-based generative model guided by high-level attribute recognition and motion-aware expression transfer. We then animate deidentified faces by video-driven animation, which accepts the de-identified face and the original video as input. Extensive experiments on the datasets VoxCeleb2, CelebV-HQ, and HDTF, which include diverse facial dynamics, demonstrate the effectiveness of AnonNET in obfuscating identity while retaining visual realism and temporal consistency. The code of AnonNet will be publicly released.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Self-Correcting Vision Agents Through Quantitative and Qualitative Metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent progress in multimodal foundation models has enabled Vision-Language Agents (VLAs) to decompose complex visual tasks into executable tool-based plans. While recent benchmarks have begun to evaluate iterative self-correction, its quantitative limits and dominant reasoning bottlenecks remain poorly characterized. This work introduces a Diagnostic Micro-Benchmark. Our analysis decouples Task Success Rate (TSR = 62 percent) from Correction Success Rate (CSR = 25 to 33 percent), revealing that initial competence does not predict repair ability. We explicitly quantify the diminishing returns of correction, which saturates after three retries. Our Failure Taxonomy reveals a frequent factor is Semantic Drift (about 28 percent of failures), a loss of contextual state. By isolating this reasoning bottleneck, this benchmark defines a reproducible framework toward stateful, trustworthy multimodal agents.</description>

      <title>Confident Learning for Object Detection under Model Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Agricultural weed detection on edge devices is subject to strict constraints on model capacity, computational resources, and real-time inference latency, which prevent performance improvements through model scaling or ensembling. This paper proposes Model-Driven Data Correction (MDDC), a data-centric framework that enhances detection performance by iteratively diagnosing and correcting data quality deficiencies. An automated error analysis procedure categorizes detection failures into four types: false negatives, false positives, class confusion, and localization errors. These error patterns are systematically addressed through a structured train-fix-retrain pipeline with version-controlled data management. Experimental results on multiple weed detection datasets demonstrate consistent improvements of 5-25 percent in mAP at 0.5 using a fixed lightweight detector (YOLOv8n), indicating that systematic data quality optimization can effectively alleviate performance bottlenecks under fixed model capacity constraints.</description>

      <title>Mixture of Distributions Matters: Dynamic Sparse Attention for Efficient Video Diffusion Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have achieved notable progress in video generation, this long-sequence generation task remains constrained by the quadratic complexity inherent to self-attention mechanisms, creating significant barriers to practical deployment. Although sparse attention methods attempt to address this challenge, existing approaches either rely on oversimplified static patterns or require computationally expensive sampling operations to achieve dynamic sparsity, resulting in inaccurate pattern predictions and degraded generation quality. To overcome these limitations, we propose a \underline{\textbf{M}}ixtrue-\underline{\textbf{O}}f-\underline{\textbf{D}}istribution \textbf{DiT} (\textbf{MOD-DiT}), a novel sampling-free dynamic attention framework that accurately models evolving attention patterns through a two-stage process. First, MOD-DiT leverages prior information from early denoising steps and adopts a {distributed mixing approach} to model an efficient linear approximation model, which is then used to predict mask patterns for a specific denoising interval. Second, an online block masking strategy dynamically applies these predicted masks while maintaining historical sparsity information, eliminating the need for repetitive sampling operations. Extensive evaluations demonstrate consistent acceleration and quality improvements across multiple benchmarks and model architectures, validating MOD-DiT's effectiveness for efficient, high-quality video generation while overcoming the computational limitations of traditional sparse attention approaches.</description>

      <title>PSSF: Early osteoarthritis detection using physical synthetic knee X-ray scans and AI radiomics models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a major cause of disability worldwide and is still largely assessed using subjective radiographic grading, most commonly the Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) scale. Artificial intelligence (AI) and radiomics offer quantitative tools for OA assessment but depend on large, well-annotated image datasets, mainly X-ray scans, that are often difficult to obtain because of privacy, governance and resourcing constraints. In this research, we introduce a physics-based synthetic simulation framework (PSSF) to fully generate controllable X-ray scans without patients' involvement and violating their privacy and institutional constraints. This PSSF is a 2D X-ray projection simulator of anteroposterior knee radiographs from a parametric anatomical model of the distal femur and proximal tibia. Using PSSF, we create a virtual cohort of 180 subjects (260 knees), each is imaged under three protocols (reference, low-dose, and geometry-shift). Medial joint regions are automatically localized, preprocessed, and processed with the Image Biomarker Standardisation Initiative (IBSI). Practically, three machine learning (ML) models are utilized, logistic regression, random forest, and gradient boosting, to train binary (KL-like "0" vs. "2") and three-class (0-2) prediction radiographic images. Robustness is assessed within IBSI protocol, cross-protocol, and multi-protocol scenarios. Finally, features stability is then evaluated using intraclass correlation coefficients across acquisition changes.</description>

      <title>Predicting When to Trust Vision-Language Models for Spatial Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities across multimodal tasks, yet exhibit systematic spatial reasoning failures, achieving only 49% (CLIP) to 54% (BLIP-2) accuracy on basic directional relationships. For safe deployment in robotics and autonomous systems, we need to predict when to trust VLM spatial predictions rather than accepting all outputs. We propose a vision-based confidence estimation framework that validates VLM predictions through independent geometric verification using object detection. Unlike text-based approaches relying on self-assessment, our method fuses four signals via gradient boosting: geometric alignment between VLM claims and coordinates, spatial ambiguity from overlap, detection quality, and VLM internal uncertainty. We achieve 0.674 AUROC on BLIP-2 (34.0% improvement over text-based baselines) and 0.583 AUROC on CLIP (16.1% improvement), generalizing across generative and classification architectures. Our framework enables selective prediction: at 60% target accuracy, we achieve 61.9% coverage versus 27.6% baseline (2.2x improvement) on BLIP-2. Feature analysis reveals vision-based signals contribute 87.4% of model importance versus 12.7% from VLM confidence, validating that external geometric verification outperforms self-assessment. We demonstrate reliable scene graph construction where confidence-based pruning improves precision from 52.1% to 78.3% while retaining 68.2% of edges.</description>

      <title>IMSAHLO: Integrating Multi-Scale Attention and Hybrid Loss Optimization Framework for Robust Neuronal Brain Cell Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate segmentation of neuronal cells in fluorescence microscopy is a fundamental task for quantitative analysis in computational neuroscience. However, it is significantly impeded by challenges such as the coexistence of densely packed and sparsely distributed cells, complex overlapping morphologies, and severe class imbalance. Conventional deep learning models often fail to preserve fine topological details or accurately delineate boundaries under these conditions. To address these limitations, we propose a novel deep learning framework, IMSAHLO (Integrating Multi-Scale Attention and Hybrid Loss Optimization), for robust and adaptive neuronal segmentation. The core of our model features Multi-Scale Dense Blocks (MSDBs) to capture features at various receptive fields, effectively handling variations in cell density, and a Hierarchical Attention (HA) mechanism that adaptively focuses on salient morphological features to preserve Region of Interest (ROI) boundary details. Furthermore, we introduce a novel hybrid loss function synergistically combining Tversky and Focal loss to combat class imbalance, alongside a topology-aware Centerline Dice (clDice) loss and a Contour-Weighted Boundary loss to ensure topological continuity and precise separation of adjacent cells. Large-scale experiments on the public Fluorescent Neuronal Cells (FNC) dataset demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art architectures, achieving precision of 81.4%, macro F1 score of 82.7%, micro F1 score of 83.3%, and balanced accuracy of 99.5% on difficult dense and sparse cases. Ablation studies validate the synergistic benefits of multi-scale attention and hybrid loss terms. This work establishes a foundation for generalizable segmentation models applicable to a wide range of biomedical imaging modalities, pushing AI-assisted analysis toward high-throughput neurobiological pipelines.</description>

      <title>Aesthetics as Structural Harm: Algorithmic Lookism Across Text-to-Image Generation and Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines algorithmic lookism-the systematic preferential treatment based on physical appearance-in text-to-image (T2I) generative AI and a downstream gender classification task. Through the analysis of 26,400 synthetic faces created with Stable Diffusion 2.1 and 3.5 Medium, we demonstrate how generative AI models systematically associate facial attractiveness with positive attributes and vice-versa, mirroring socially constructed biases rather than evidence-based correlations. Furthermore, we find significant gender bias in three gender classification algorithms depending on the attributes of the input faces. Our findings reveal three critical harms: (1) the systematic encoding of attractiveness-positive attribute associations in T2I models; (2) gender disparities in classification systems, where women's faces, particularly those generated with negative attributes, suffer substantially higher misclassification rates than men's; and (3) intensifying aesthetic constraints in newer models through age homogenization, gendered exposure patterns, and geographic reductionism. These convergent patterns reveal algorithmic lookism as systematic infrastructure operating across AI vision systems, compounding existing inequalities through both representation and recognition.
  Disclaimer: This work includes visual and textual content that reflects stereotypical associations between physical appearance and socially constructed attributes, including gender, race, and traits associated with social desirability. Any such associations found in this study emerge from the biases embedded in generative AI systems-not from empirical truths or the authors' views.</description>

      <title>PSSI-MaxST: An Efficient Pixel-Segment Similarity Index Using Intensity and Smoothness Features for Maximum Spanning Tree Based Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interactive graph-based segmentation methods partition an image into foreground and background regions with the aid of user inputs. However, existing approaches often suffer from high computational costs, sensitivity to user interactions, and degraded performance when the foreground and background share similar color distributions. A key factor influencing segmentation performance is the similarity measure used for assigning edge weights in the graph. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Pixel Segment Similarity Index (PSSI), which leverages the harmonic mean of inter-channel similarities by incorporating both pixel intensity and spatial smoothness features. The harmonic mean effectively penalizes dissimilarities in any individual channel, enhancing robustness. The computational complexity of PSSI is $\mathcal{O}(B)$, where $B$ denotes the number of histogram bins. Our segmentation framework begins with low-level segmentation using MeanShift, which effectively captures color, texture, and segment shape. Based on the resulting pixel segments, we construct a pixel-segment graph with edge weights determined by PSSI. For partitioning, we employ the Maximum Spanning Tree (MaxST), which captures strongly connected local neighborhoods beneficial for precise segmentation. The integration of the proposed PSSI, MeanShift, and MaxST allows our method to jointly capture color similarity, smoothness, texture, shape, and strong local connectivity. Experimental evaluations on the GrabCut and Images250 datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms current graph-based interactive segmentation methods such as AMOE, OneCut, and SSNCut in terms of segmentation quality, as measured by Jaccard Index (IoU), $F_1$ score, execution time and Mean Error (ME). Code is publicly available at: https://github.com/KaustubhShejole/PSSI-MaxST.</description>

      <title>Zeros can be Informative: Masked Binary U-Net for Image Segmentation on Tensor Cores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-time image segmentation is a key enabler for AR/VR, robotics, drones, and autonomous systems, where tight accuracy, latency, and energy budgets must be met on resource-constrained edge devices. While U-Net offers a favorable balance of accuracy and efficiency compared to large transformer-based models, achieving real-time performance on high-resolution input remains challenging due to compute, memory, and power limits. Extreme quantization, particularly binary networks, is appealing for its hardware-friendly operations. However, two obstacles limit practicality: (1) severe accuracy degradation, and (2) a lack of end-to-end implementations that deliver efficiency on general-purpose GPUs.
  We make two empirical observations that guide our design. (1) An explicit zero state is essential: training with zero masking to binary U-Net weights yields noticeable sparsity. (2) Quantization sensitivity is uniform across layers. Motivated by these findings, we introduce Masked Binary U-Net (MBU-Net), obtained through a cost-aware masking strategy that prioritizes masking where it yields the highest accuracy-per-cost, reconciling accuracy with near-binary efficiency.
  To realize these gains in practice, we develop a GPU execution framework that maps MBU-Net to Tensor Cores via a subtractive bit-encoding scheme, efficiently implementing masked binary weights with binary activations. This design leverages native binary Tensor Core BMMA instructions, enabling high throughput and energy savings on widely available GPUs. Across 3 segmentation benchmarks, MBU-Net attains near full-precision accuracy (3% average drop) while delivering 2.04x speedup and 3.54x energy reductions over a 16-bit floating point U-Net.</description>

      <title>LTV-YOLO: A Lightweight Thermal Object Detector for Young Pedestrians in Adverse Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting vulnerable road users (VRUs), particularly children and adolescents, in low light and adverse weather conditions remains a critical challenge in computer vision, surveillance, and autonomous vehicle systems. This paper presents a purpose-built lightweight object detection model designed to identify young pedestrians in various environmental scenarios. To address these challenges, our approach leverages thermal imaging from long-wave infrared (LWIR) cameras, which enhances detection reliability in conditions where traditional RGB cameras operating in the visible spectrum fail. Based on the YOLO11 architecture and customized for thermal detection, our model, termed LTV-YOLO (Lightweight Thermal Vision YOLO), is optimized for computational efficiency, accuracy and real-time performance on edge devices. By integrating separable convolutions in depth and a feature pyramid network (FPN), LTV-YOLO achieves strong performance in detecting small-scale, partially occluded, and thermally distinct VRUs while maintaining a compact architecture. This work contributes a practical and scalable solution to improve pedestrian safety in intelligent transportation systems, particularly in school zones, autonomous navigation, and smart city infrastructure. Unlike prior thermal detectors, our contribution is task-specific: a thermally only edge-capable design designed for young and small VRUs (children and distant adults). Although FPN and depthwise separable convolutions are standard components, their integration into a thermal-only pipeline optimized for short/occluded VRUs under adverse conditions is, to the best of our knowledge, novel.</description>

      <title>UAV-Based Infrastructure Inspections: A Literature Review and Proposed Framework for AEC+FM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are transforming infrastructure inspections in the Architecture, Engineering, Construction, and Facility Management (AEC+FM) domain. By synthesizing insights from over 150 studies, this review paper highlights UAV-based methodologies for data acquisition, photogrammetric modeling, defect detection, and decision-making support. Key innovations include path optimization, thermal integration, and advanced machine learning (ML) models such as YOLO and Faster R-CNN for anomaly detection. UAVs have demonstrated value in structural health monitoring (SHM), disaster response, urban infrastructure management, energy efficiency evaluations, and cultural heritage preservation. Despite these advancements, challenges in real-time processing, multimodal data fusion, and generalizability remain. A proposed workflow framework, informed by literature and a case study, integrates RGB imagery, LiDAR, and thermal sensing with transformer-based architectures to improve accuracy and reliability in detecting structural defects, thermal anomalies, and geometric inconsistencies. The proposed framework ensures precise and actionable insights by fusing multimodal data and dynamically adapting path planning for complex environments, presented as a comprehensive step-by-step guide to address these challenges effectively. This paper concludes with future research directions emphasizing lightweight AI models, adaptive flight planning, synthetic datasets, and richer modality fusion to streamline modern infrastructure inspections.</description>

      <title>MATEX: Multi-scale Attention and Text-guided Explainability of Medical Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce MATEX (Multi-scale Attention and Text-guided Explainability), a novel framework that advances interpretability in medical vision-language models by incorporating anatomically informed spatial reasoning. MATEX synergistically combines multi-layer attention rollout, text-guided spatial priors, and layer consistency analysis to produce precise, stable, and clinically meaningful gradient attribution maps. By addressing key limitations of prior methods, such as spatial imprecision, lack of anatomical grounding, and limited attention granularity, MATEX enables more faithful and interpretable model explanations. Evaluated on the MS-CXR dataset, MATEX outperforms the state-of-the-art M2IB approach in both spatial precision and alignment with expert-annotated findings. These results highlight MATEX's potential to enhance trust and transparency in radiological AI applications.</description>

      <title>Generating metamers of human scene understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human vision combines low-resolution "gist" information from the visual periphery with sparse but high-resolution information from fixated locations to construct a coherent understanding of a visual scene. In this paper, we introduce MetamerGen, a tool for generating scenes that are aligned with latent human scene representations. MetamerGen is a latent diffusion model that combines peripherally obtained scene gist information with information obtained from scene-viewing fixations to generate image metamers for what humans understand after viewing a scene. Generating images from both high and low resolution (i.e. "foveated") inputs constitutes a novel image-to-image synthesis problem, which we tackle by introducing a dual-stream representation of the foveated scenes consisting of DINOv2 tokens that fuse detailed features from fixated areas with peripherally degraded features capturing scene context. To evaluate the perceptual alignment of MetamerGen generated images to latent human scene representations, we conducted a same-different behavioral experiment where participants were asked for a "same" or "different" response between the generated and the original image. With that, we identify scene generations that are indeed metamers for the latent scene representations formed by the viewers. MetamerGen is a powerful tool for understanding scene understanding. Our proof-of-concept analyses uncovered specific features at multiple levels of visual processing that contributed to human judgments. While it can generate metamers even conditioned on random fixations, we find that high-level semantic alignment most strongly predicts metamerism when the generated scenes are conditioned on viewers' own fixated regions.</description>

      <title>Telling Human and Machine Handwriting Apart</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Handwriting movements can be leveraged as a unique form of behavioral biometrics, to verify whether a real user is operating a device or application. This task can be framed as a reverse Turing test in which a computer has to detect if an input instance has been generated by a human or artificially. To tackle this task, we study ten public datasets of handwritten symbols (isolated characters, digits, gestures, pointing traces, and signatures) that are artificially reproduced using seven different synthesizers, including, among others, the Kinematic Theory (Sigma h model), generative adversarial networks, Transformers, and Diffusion models. We train a shallow recurrent neural network that achieves excellent performance (98.3 percent Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) score and 1.4 percent equal error rate on average across all synthesizers and datasets) using nonfeaturized trajectory data as input. In few-shot settings, we show that our classifier achieves such an excellent performance when trained on just 10 percent of the data, as evaluated on the remaining 90% of the data as a test set. We further challenge our classifier in out-of-domain settings, and observe very competitive results as well. Our work has implications for computerized systems that need to verify human presence, and adds an additional layer of security to keep attackers at bay.</description>

      <title>SemAlign: Language Guided Semi-supervised Domain Generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semi-supervised Domain Generalization (SSDG) addresses the challenge of generalizing to unseen target domains with limited labeled data. Existing SSDG methods highlight the importance of achieving high pseudo-labeling (PL) accuracy and preventing model overfitting as the main challenges in SSDG. In this light, we show that the SSDG literature's excessive focus on PL accuracy, without consideration for maximum data utilization during training, limits potential performance improvements. We propose a novel approach to the SSDG problem by aligning the intermediate features of our model with the semantically rich and generalized feature space of a Vision Language Model (VLM) in a way that promotes domain-invariance. The above approach is enhanced with effective image-level augmentation and output-level regularization strategies to improve data utilization and minimize overfitting. Extensive experimentation across four benchmarks against existing SSDG baselines suggests that our method achieves SOTA results both qualitatively and quantitatively. The code will be made publicly available.</description>

      <title>SpaRRTa: A Synthetic Benchmark for Evaluating Spatial Intelligence in Visual Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visual Foundation Models (VFMs), such as DINO and CLIP, excel in semantic understanding of images but exhibit limited spatial reasoning capabilities, which limits their applicability to embodied systems. As a result, recent work incorporates some 3D tasks (such as depth estimation) into VFM training. However, VFM performance remains inconsistent across other spatial tasks, raising the question of whether these models truly have spatial awareness or overfit to specific 3D objectives. To address this question, we introduce the Spatial Relation Recognition Task (SpaRRTa) benchmark, which evaluates the ability of VFMs to identify relative positions of objects in the image. Unlike traditional 3D objectives that focus on precise metric prediction (e.g., surface normal estimation), SpaRRTa probes a fundamental capability underpinning more advanced forms of human-like spatial understanding. SpaRRTa generates an arbitrary number of photorealistic images with diverse scenes and fully controllable object arrangements, along with freely accessible spatial annotations. Evaluating a range of state-of-the-art VFMs, we reveal significant disparities between their spatial reasoning abilities. Through our analysis, we provide insights into the mechanisms that support or hinder spatial awareness in modern VFMs. We hope that SpaRRTa will serve as a useful tool for guiding the development of future spatially aware visual models.</description>

      <title>From Pixels to Purchase: Building and Evaluating a Taxonomy-Decoupled Visual Search Engine for Home Goods E-commerce</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visual search is critical for e-commerce, especially in style-driven domains where user intent is subjective and open-ended. Existing industrial systems typically couple object detection with taxonomy-based classification and rely on catalog data for evaluation, which is prone to noise that limits robustness and scalability. We propose a taxonomy-decoupled architecture that uses classification-free region proposals and unified embeddings for similarity retrieval, enabling a more flexible and generalizable visual search. To overcome the evaluation bottleneck, we propose an LLM-as-a-Judge framework that assesses nuanced visual similarity and category relevance for query-result pairs in a zero-shot manner, removing dependence on human annotations or noise-prone catalog data. Deployed at scale on a global home goods platform, our system improves retrieval quality and yields a measurable uplift in customer engagement, while our offline evaluation metrics strongly correlate with real-world outcomes.</description>

      <title>studentSplat: Your Student Model Learns Single-view 3D Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advance in feed-forward 3D Gaussian splatting has enable remarkable multi-view 3D scene reconstruction or single-view 3D object reconstruction but single-view 3D scene reconstruction remain under-explored due to inherited ambiguity in single-view. We present \textbf{studentSplat}, a single-view 3D Gaussian splatting method for scene reconstruction. To overcome the scale ambiguity and extrapolation problems inherent in novel-view supervision from a single input, we introduce two techniques: 1) a teacher-student architecture where a multi-view teacher model provides geometric supervision to the single-view student during training, addressing scale ambiguity and encourage geometric validity; and 2) an extrapolation network that completes missing scene context, enabling high-quality extrapolation. Extensive experiments show studentSplat achieves state-of-the-art single-view novel-view reconstruction quality and comparable performance to multi-view methods at the scene level. Furthermore, studentSplat demonstrates competitive performance as a self-supervised single-view depth estimation method, highlighting its potential for general single-view 3D understanding tasks.</description>

      <title>Cross-Domain Object Detection Using Unsupervised Image Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation for object detection addresses the adaption of detectors trained in a source domain to work accurately in an unseen target domain. Recently, methods approaching the alignment of the intermediate features proven to be promising, achieving state-of-the-art results. However, these methods are laborious to implement and hard to interpret. Although promising, there is still room for improvements to close the performance gap toward the upper-bound (when training with the target data). In this work, we propose a method to generate an artificial dataset in the target domain to train an object detector. We employed two unsupervised image translators (CycleGAN and an AdaIN-based model) using only annotated data from the source domain and non-annotated data from the target domain. Our key contributions are the proposal of a less complex yet more effective method that also has an improved interpretability. Results on real-world scenarios for autonomous driving show significant improvements, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in most cases, further closing the gap toward the upper-bound.</description>

      <title>Digital FAST: An AI-Driven Multimodal Framework for Rapid and Early Stroke Screening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Early identification of stroke symptoms is essential for enabling timely intervention and improving patient outcomes, particularly in prehospital settings. This study presents a fast, non-invasive multimodal deep learning framework for automatic binary stroke screening based on data collected during the F.A.S.T. assessment. The proposed approach integrates complementary information from facial expressions, speech signals, and upper-body movements to enhance diagnostic robustness. Facial dynamics are represented using landmark based features and modeled with a Transformer architecture to capture temporal dependencies. Speech signals are converted into mel spectrograms and processed using an Audio Spectrogram Transformer, while upper-body pose sequences are analyzed with an MLP-Mixer network to model spatiotemporal motion patterns. The extracted modality specific representations are combined through an attention-based fusion mechanism to effectively learn cross modal interactions. Experiments conducted on a self-collected dataset of 222 videos from 37 subjects demonstrate that the proposed multimodal model consistently outperforms unimodal baselines, achieving 95.83% accuracy and a 96.00% F1-score. The model attains a strong balance between sensitivity and specificity and successfully detects all stroke cases in the test set. These results highlight the potential of multimodal learning and transfer learning for early stroke screening, while emphasizing the need for larger, clinically representative datasets to support reliable real-world deployment.</description>

      <title>RemoteVAR: Autoregressive Visual Modeling for Remote Sensing Change Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Remote sensing change detection aims to localize and characterize scene changes between two time points and is central to applications such as environmental monitoring and disaster assessment. Meanwhile, visual autoregressive models (VARs) have recently shown impressive image generation capability, but their adoption for pixel-level discriminative tasks remains limited due to weak controllability, suboptimal dense prediction performance and exposure bias. We introduce RemoteVAR, a new VAR-based change detection framework that addresses these limitations by conditioning autoregressive prediction on multi-resolution fused bi-temporal features via cross-attention, and by employing an autoregressive training strategy designed specifically for change map prediction. Extensive experiments on standard change detection benchmarks show that RemoteVAR delivers consistent and significant improvements over strong diffusion-based and transformer-based baselines, establishing a competitive autoregressive alternative for remote sensing change detection. Code will be available \href{https://github.com/yilmazkorkmaz1/RemoteVAR}{\underline{here}}.</description>

      <title>Towards Airborne Object Detection: A Deep Learning Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid proliferation of airborne platforms, including commercial aircraft, drones, and UAVs, has intensified the need for real-time, automated threat assessment systems. Current approaches depend heavily on manual monitoring, resulting in limited scalability and operational inefficiencies. This work introduces a dual-task model based on EfficientNetB4 capable of performing airborne object classification and threat-level prediction simultaneously. To address the scarcity of clean, balanced training data, we constructed the AODTA Dataset by aggregating and refining multiple public sources. We benchmarked our approach on both the AVD Dataset and the newly developed AODTA Dataset and further compared performance against a ResNet-50 baseline, which consistently underperformed EfficientNetB4. Our EfficientNetB4 model achieved 96% accuracy in object classification and 90% accuracy in threat-level prediction, underscoring its promise for applications in surveillance, defense, and airspace management. Although the title references detection, this study focuses specifically on classification and threat-level inference using pre-localized airborne object images provided by existing datasets.</description>

      <title>Effects of the retina-inspired light intensity encoding on color discrimination performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Color is an important source of information for visual functions such as object recognition, but it is greatly affected by the color of illumination. The ability to perceive the color of a visual target independent of illumination color is called color constancy (CC), and is an important feature for vision systems that use color information. In this study, we investigated the effects of the light intensity encoding function on the performance of CC of the center/surround (C/S) retinex model, which is a well-known model inspired by CC of the visual nervous system. The functions used to encode light intensity are the logarithmic function used in the original C/S retinex model and the Naka-Rushton (N-R) function, which is a model of retinal photoreceptor response. Color-variable LEDs were used to illuminate visual targets with various lighting colors, and color information computed by each model was used to evaluate the degree to which the color of visual targets illuminated with different lighting colors could be discriminated. Color information was represented using the HSV color space and a color plane based on the classical opponent color theory. The results showed that the combination of the N-R function and the double opponent color plane representation provided superior discrimination performance.</description>

      <title>A Training-Free Guess What Vision Language Model from Snippets to Open-Vocabulary Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open-Vocabulary Object Detection (OVOD) aims to develop the capability to detect anything. Although myriads of large-scale pre-training efforts have built versatile foundation models that exhibit impressive zero-shot capabilities to facilitate OVOD, the necessity of creating a universal understanding for any object cognition according to already pretrained foundation models is usually overlooked. Therefore, in this paper, a training-free Guess What Vision Language Model, called GW-VLM, is proposed to form a universal understanding paradigm based on our carefully designed Multi-Scale Visual Language Searching (MS-VLS) coupled with Contextual Concept Prompt (CCP) for OVOD. This approach can engage a pre-trained Vision Language Model (VLM) and a Large Language Model (LLM) in the game of "guess what". Wherein, MS-VLS leverages multi-scale visual-language soft-alignment for VLM to generate snippets from the results of class-agnostic object detection, while CCP can form the concept of flow referring to MS-VLS and then make LLM understand snippets for OVOD. Finally, the extensive experiments are carried out on natural and remote sensing datasets, including COCO val, Pascal VOC, DIOR, and NWPU-10, and the results indicate that our proposed GW-VLM can achieve superior OVOD performance compared to the-state-of-the-art methods without any training step.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.11911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in image recognition tasks but often involve complex architectures that may overfit on small datasets. In this study, we evaluate a compact CNN across five publicly available, real-world image datasets from Bangladesh, including urban encroachment, vehicle detection, road damage, and agricultural crops. The network demonstrates high classification accuracy, efficient convergence, and low computational overhead. Quantitative metrics and saliency analyses indicate that the model effectively captures discriminative features and generalizes robustly across diverse scenarios, highlighting the suitability of streamlined CNN architectures for small-class image classification tasks.</description>

      <title>From Spurious to Causal: Low-rank Orthogonal Subspace Intervention for Generalizable Face Forgery Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generalization problem remains a critical challenge in face forgery detection. Some researches have discovered that ``a backdoor path" in the representations from forgery-irrelevant information to labels induces biased learning, thereby hindering the generalization. In this paper, these forgery-irrelevant information are collectively termed spurious correlations factors. Previous methods predominantly focused on identifying concrete, specific spurious correlation and designing corresponding solutions to address them. However, spurious correlations arise from unobservable confounding factors, making it impractical to identify and address each one individually. To address this, we propose an intervention paradigm for representation space. Instead of tracking and blocking various instance-level spurious correlation one by one, we uniformly model them as a low-rank subspace and intervene in them. Specifically, we decompose spurious correlation features into a low-rank subspace via orthogonal low-rank projection, subsequently removing this subspace from the original representation and training its orthogonal complement to capture forgery-related features. This low-rank projection removal effectively eliminates spurious correlation factors, ensuring that classification decision is based on authentic forgery cues. With only 0.43M trainable parameters, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across several benchmarks, demonstrating excellent robustness and generalization.</description>

      <title>Effects of Gabor Filters on Classification Performance of CNNs Trained on a Limited Number of Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we propose a technique to improve the accuracy and reduce the size of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) running on edge devices for real-world robot vision applications. CNNs running on edge devices must have a small architecture, and CNNs for robot vision applications involving on-site object recognition must be able to be trained efficiently to identify specific visual targets from data obtained under a limited variation of conditions. The visual nervous system (VNS) is a good example that meets the above requirements because it learns from few visual experiences. Therefore, we used a Gabor filter, a model of the feature extractor of the VNS, as a preprocessor for CNNs to investigate the accuracy of the CNNs trained with small amounts of data. To evaluate how well CNNs trained on image data acquired under a limited variation of conditions generalize to data acquired under other conditions, we created an image dataset consisting of images acquired from different camera positions, and investigated the accuracy of the CNNs that trained using images acquired at a certain distance. The results were compared after training on multiple CNN architectures with and without Gabor filters as preprocessing. The results showed that preprocessing with Gabor filters improves the generalization performance of CNNs and contributes to reducing the size of CNNs.</description>

      <title>SupScene: Learning Overlap-Aware Global Descriptor for Unconstrained SfM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image retrieval is a critical step for alleviating the quadratic complexity of image matching in unconstrained Structure-from-Motion (SfM). However, in this context, image retrieval typically focuses more on the image pairs of geometric matchability than on those of semantic similarity, a nuance that most existing deep learning-based methods guided by batched binaries (overlapping vs. non-overlapping pairs) fail to capture. In this paper, we introduce SupScene, a novel solution that learns global descriptors tailored for finding overlapping image pairs of similar geometric nature for SfM. First, to better underline co-visible regions, we employ a subgraph-based training strategy that moves beyond equally important isolated pairs, leveraging ground-truth geometric overlapping relationships with various weights to provide fine-grained supervision via a soft supervised contrastive loss. Second, we introduce DiVLAD, a DINO-inspired VLAD aggregator that leverages the inherent multi-head attention maps from the last block of ViT. And then, a learnable gating mechanism is designed to adaptively utilize these semantically salient cues with visual features, enabling a more discriminative global descriptor. Extensive experiments on the GL3D dataset demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming NetVLAD while introducing a negligible number of additional trainable parameters. Furthermore, we show that the proposed training strategy brings consistent gains across different aggregation techniques. Code and models are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/SupScene-5B73.</description>

Abstract: Gait recognition is emerging as a promising technology and an innovative field within computer vision. However, existing methods typically rely on complex architectures to directly extract features from images and apply pooling operations to obtain sequence-level representations. Such designs often lead to overfitting on static noise (e.g., clothing), while failing to effectively capture dynamic motion regions.To address the above challenges, we present a Language guided and Motion-aware gait recognition framework, named LMGait.In particular, we utilize designed gait-related language cues to capture key motion features in gait sequences.</description>

      <title>Deep learning-based neurodevelopmental assessment in preterm infants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Preterm infants (born between 28 and 37 weeks of gestation) face elevated risks of neurodevelopmental delays, making early identification crucial for timely intervention. While deep learning-based volumetric segmentation of brain MRI scans offers a promising avenue for assessing neonatal neurodevelopment, achieving accurate segmentation of white matter (WM) and gray matter (GM) in preterm infants remains challenging due to their comparable signal intensities (isointense appearance) on MRI during early brain development. To address this, we propose a novel segmentation neural network, named Hierarchical Dense Attention Network. Our architecture incorporates a 3D spatial-channel attention mechanism combined with an attention-guided dense upsampling strategy to enhance feature discrimination in low-contrast volumetric data. Quantitative experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior segmentation performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines, effectively tackling the challenge of isointense tissue differentiation. Furthermore, application of our algorithm confirms that WM and GM volumes in preterm infants are significantly lower than those in term infants, providing additional imaging evidence of the neurodevelopmental delays associated with preterm birth. The code is available at: https://github.com/ICL-SUST/HDAN.</description>

      <title>Decoder Gradient Shields: A Family of Provable and High-Fidelity Methods Against Gradient-Based Box-Free Watermark Removal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Box-free model watermarking has gained significant attention in deep neural network (DNN) intellectual property protection due to its model-agnostic nature and its ability to flexibly manage high-entropy image outputs from generative models. Typically operating in a black-box manner, it employs an encoder-decoder framework for watermark embedding and extraction. While existing research has focused primarily on the encoders for the robustness to resist various attacks, the decoders have been largely overlooked, leading to attacks against the watermark. In this paper, we identify one such attack against the decoder, where query responses are utilized to obtain backpropagated gradients to train a watermark remover. To address this issue, we propose Decoder Gradient Shields (DGSs), a family of defense mechanisms, including DGS at the output (DGS-O), at the input (DGS-I), and in the layers (DGS-L) of the decoder, with a closed-form solution for DGS-O and provable performance for all DGS. Leveraging the joint design of reorienting and rescaling of the gradients from watermark channel gradient leaking queries, the proposed DGSs effectively prevent the watermark remover from achieving training convergence to the desired low-loss value, while preserving image quality of the decoder output. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed DGSs in diverse application scenarios. Our experimental results on deraining and image generation tasks with the state-of-the-art box-free watermarking show that our DGSs achieve a defense success rate of 100% under all settings.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Multi-Modal Embedded Vision Framework for Object Detection Facial Emotion Recognition and Biometric Identification on Low-Power Edge Platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intelligent surveillance systems often handle perceptual tasks such as object detection, facial recognition, and emotion analysis independently, but they lack a unified, adaptive runtime scheduler that dynamically allocates computational resources based on contextual triggers. This limits their holistic understanding and efficiency on low-power edge devices. To address this, we present a real-time multi-modal vision framework that integrates object detection, owner-specific face recognition, and emotion detection into a unified pipeline deployed on a Raspberry Pi 5 edge platform. The core of our system is an adaptive scheduling mechanism that reduces computational load by 65\% compared to continuous processing by selectively activating modules such as, YOLOv8n for object detection, a custom FaceNet-based embedding system for facial recognition, and DeepFace's CNN for emotion classification. Experimental results demonstrate the system's efficacy, with the object detection module achieving an Average Precision (AP) of 0.861, facial recognition attaining 88\% accuracy, and emotion detection showing strong discriminatory power (AUC up to 0.97 for specific emotions), while operating at 5.6 frames per second. Our work demonstrates that context-aware scheduling is the key to unlocking complex multi-modal AI on cost-effective edge hardware, making intelligent perception more accessible and privacy-preserving.</description>

      <title>AVIR: Adaptive Visual In-Document Retrieval for Efficient Multi-Page Document Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-page Document Visual Question Answering (MP-DocVQA) remains challenging because long documents not only strain computational resources but also reduce the effectiveness of the attention mechanism in large vision-language models (LVLMs). We tackle these issues with an Adaptive Visual In-document Retrieval (AVIR) framework. A lightweight retrieval model first scores each page for question relevance. Pages are then clustered according to the score distribution to adaptively select relevant content. The clustered pages are screened again by Top-K to keep the context compact. However, for short documents, clustering reliability decreases, so we use a relevance probability threshold to select pages. The selected pages alone are fed to a frozen LVLM for answer generation, eliminating the need for model fine-tuning. The proposed AVIR framework reduces the average page count required for question answering by 70%, while achieving an ANLS of 84.58% on the MP-DocVQA dataset-surpassing previous methods with significantly lower computational cost. The effectiveness of the proposed AVIR is also verified on the SlideVQA and DUDE benchmarks. The code is available at https://github.com/Li-yachuan/AVIR.</description>

      <title>Nip Rumors in the Bud: Retrieval-Guided Topic-Level Adaptation for Test-Time Fake News Video Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fake News Video Detection (FNVD) is critical for social stability. Existing methods typically assume consistent news topic distribution between training and test phases, failing to detect fake news videos tied to emerging events and unseen topics. To bridge this gap, we introduce RADAR, the first framework that enables test-time adaptation to unseen news videos. RADAR pioneers a new retrieval-guided adaptation paradigm that leverages stable (source-close) videos from the target domain to guide robust adaptation of semantically related but unstable instances. Specifically, we propose an Entropy Selection-Based Retrieval mechanism that provides videos with stable (low-entropy), relevant references for adaptation. We also introduce a Stable Anchor-Guided Alignment module that explicitly aligns unstable instances' representations to the source domain via distribution-level matching with their stable references, mitigating severe domain discrepancies. Finally, our novel Target-Domain Aware Self-Training paradigm can generate informative pseudo-labels augmented by stable references, capturing varying and imbalanced category distributions in the target domain and enabling RADAR to adapt to the fast-changing label distributions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RADAR achieves superior performance for test-time FNVD, enabling strong on-the-fly adaptation to unseen fake news video topics.</description>

      <title>An AI-IoT Based Smart Wheelchair with Gesture-Controlled Mobility, Deep Learning-Based Obstacle Detection, Multi-Sensor Health Monitoring, and Emergency Alert System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing number of differently-abled and elderly individuals demands affordable, intelligent wheelchairs that combine safe navigation with health monitoring. Traditional wheelchairs lack dynamic features, and many smart alternatives remain costly, single-modality, and limited in health integration. Motivated by the pressing demand for advanced, personalized, and affordable assistive technologies, we propose a comprehensive AI-IoT based smart wheelchair system that incorporates glove-based gesture control for hands-free navigation, real-time object detection using YOLOv8 with auditory feedback for obstacle avoidance, and ultrasonic for immediate collision avoidance. Vital signs (heart rate, SpO$_2$, ECG, temperature) are continuously monitored, uploaded to ThingSpeak, and trigger email alerts for critical conditions. Built on a modular and low-cost architecture, the gesture control achieved a 95.5\% success rate, ultrasonic obstacle detection reached 94\% accuracy, and YOLOv8-based object detection delivered 91.5\% Precision, 90.2\% Recall, and a 90.8\% F1-score. This integrated, multi-modal approach offers a practical, scalable, and affordable solution, significantly enhancing user autonomy, safety, and independence by bridging the gap between innovative research and real-world deployment.</description>

      <title>Structural Graph Neural Networks with Anatomical Priors for Explainable Chest X-ray Diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a structural graph reasoning framework that incorporates explicit anatomical priors for explainable vision-based diagnosis. Convolutional feature maps are reinterpreted as patch-level graphs, where nodes encode both appearance and spatial coordinates, and edges reflect local structural adjacency. Unlike conventional graph neural networks that rely on generic message passing, we introduce a custom structural propagation mechanism that explicitly models relative spatial relations as part of the reasoning process. This design enables the graph to act as an inductive bias for structured inference rather than a passive relational representation. The proposed model jointly supports node-level lesion-aware predictions and graph-level diagnostic reasoning, yielding intrinsic explainability through learned node importance scores without relying on post-hoc visualization techniques. We demonstrate the approach through a chest X-ray case study, illustrating how structural priors guide relational reasoning and improve interpretability. While evaluated in a medical imaging context, the framework is domain-agnostic and aligns with the broader vision of graph-based reasoning across artificial intelligence systems. This work contributes to the growing body of research exploring graphs as computational substrates for structure-aware and explainable learning.</description>

      <title>DAOS: A Multimodal In-cabin Behavior Monitoring with Driver Action-Object Synergy Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In driver activity monitoring, movements are mostly limited to the upper body, which makes many actions look similar. To tell these actions apart, human often rely on the objects the driver is using, such as holding a phone compared with gripping the steering wheel. However, most existing driver-monitoring datasets lack accurate object-location annotations or do not link objects to their associated actions, leaving a critical gap for reliable action recognition. To address this, we introduce the Driver Action with Object Synergy (DAOS) dataset, comprising 9,787 video clips annotated with 36 fine-grained driver actions and 15 object classes, totaling more than 2.5 million corresponding object instances. DAOS offers multi-modal, multi-view data (RGB, IR, and depth) from front, face, left, and right perspectives. Although DAOS captures a wide range of cabin objects, only a few are directly relevant to each action for prediction, so focusing on task-specific human-object relations is essential. To tackle this challenge, we propose the Action-Object-Relation Network (AOR-Net). AOR-Net comprehends complex driver actions through multi-level reasoning and a chain-of-action prompting mechanism that models the logical relationships among actions, objects, and their relations. Additionally, the Mixture of Thoughts module is introduced to dynamically select essential knowledge at each stage, enhancing robustness in object-rich and object-scarce conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms other state-of-the-art methods on various datasets.</description>

      <title>SMc2f: Robust Scenario Mining for Robotic Autonomy from Coarse to Fine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The safety validation of autonomous robotic vehicles hinges on systematically testing their planning and control stacks against rare, safety-critical scenarios. Mining these long-tail events from massive real-world driving logs is therefore a critical step in the robotic development lifecycle. The goal of the Scenario Mining task is to retrieve useful information to enable targeted re-simulation, regression testing, and failure analysis of the robot's decision-making algorithms. RefAV, introduced by the Argoverse team, is an end-to-end framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to spatially and temporally localize scenarios described in natural language. However, this process performs retrieval on trajectory labels, ignoring the direct connection between natural language and raw RGB images, which runs counter to the intuition of video retrieval; it also depends on the quality of upstream 3D object detection and tracking. Further, inaccuracies in trajectory data lead to inaccuracies in downstream spatial and temporal localization. To address these issues, we propose Robust Scenario Mining for Robotic Autonomy from Coarse to Fine (SMc2f), a coarse-to-fine pipeline that employs vision-language models (VLMs) for coarse image-text filtering, builds a database of successful mining cases on top of RefAV and automatically retrieves exemplars to few-shot condition the LLM for more robust retrieval, and introduces text-trajectory contrastive learning to pull matched pairs together and push mismatched pairs apart in a shared embedding space, yielding a fine-grained matcher that refines the LLM's candidate trajectories. Experiments on public datasets demonstrate substantial gains in both retrieval quality and efficiency.</description>

      <title>SAR-Based Marine Oil Spill Detection Using the DeepSegFusion Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detection of oil spills from satellite images is essential for both environmental surveillance and maritime safety. Traditional threshold-based methods frequently encounter performance degradation due to very high false alarm rates caused by look-alike phenomena such as wind slicks and ship wakes. Here, a hybrid deep learning model, DeepSegFusion, is presented for oil spill segmentation in Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images. The model uses SegNet and DeepLabV3+ integrated with an attention-based feature fusion mechanism to achieve better boundary precision as well as improved contextual understanding. Results obtained on SAR oil spill datasets, including ALOS PALSAR imagery, confirm that the proposed DeepSegFusion model achieves an accuracy of 94.85%, an Intersection over Union (IoU) of 0.5685, and a ROC-AUC score of 0.9330. The proposed method delivers more than three times fewer false detections compared to individual baseline models and traditional non-segmentation methods, achieving a reduction of 64.4%. These results indicate that DeepSegFusion is a stable model under various marine conditions and can therefore be used in near real-time oil spill monitoring scenarios.</description>

      <title>DIAMOND-SSS: Diffusion-Augmented Multi-View Optimization for Data-efficient SubSurface Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Subsurface scattering (SSS) gives translucent materials -- such as wax, jade, marble, and skin -- their characteristic soft shadows, color bleeding, and diffuse glow. Modeling these effects in neural rendering remains challenging due to complex light transport and the need for densely captured multi-view, multi-light datasets (often more than 100 views and 112 OLATs).
  We present DIAMOND-SSS, a data-efficient framework for high-fidelity translucent reconstruction from extremely sparse supervision -- even as few as ten images. We fine-tune diffusion models for novel-view synthesis and relighting, conditioned on estimated geometry and trained on less than 7 percent of the dataset, producing photorealistic augmentations that can replace up to 95 percent of missing captures. To stabilize reconstruction under sparse or synthetic supervision, we introduce illumination-independent geometric priors: a multi-view silhouette consistency loss and a multi-view depth consistency loss.
  Across all sparsity regimes, DIAMOND-SSS achieves state-of-the-art quality in relightable Gaussian rendering, reducing real capture requirements by up to 90 percent compared to SSS-3DGS.</description>

      <title>\textit{FocaLogic}: Logic-Based Interpretation of Visual Model Decisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interpretability of modern visual models is crucial, particularly in high-stakes applications. However, existing interpretability methods typically suffer from either reliance on white-box model access or insufficient quantitative rigor. To address these limitations, we introduce FocaLogic, a novel model-agnostic framework designed to interpret and quantify visual model decision-making through logic-based representations. FocaLogic identifies minimal interpretable subsets of visual regions-termed visual focuses-that decisively influence model predictions. It translates these visual focuses into precise and compact logical expressions, enabling transparent and structured interpretations. Additionally, we propose a suite of quantitative metrics, including focus precision, recall, and divergence, to objectively evaluate model behavior across diverse scenarios. Empirical analyses demonstrate FocaLogic's capability to uncover critical insights such as training-induced concentration, increasing focus accuracy through generalization, and anomalous focuses under biases and adversarial attacks. Overall, FocaLogic provides a systematic, scalable, and quantitative solution for interpreting visual models.</description>

      <title>A Unified Masked Jigsaw Puzzle Framework for Vision and Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In federated learning, Transformer, as a popular architecture, faces critical challenges in defending against gradient attacks and improving model performance in both Computer Vision (CV) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. It has been revealed that the gradient of Position Embeddings (PEs) in Transformer contains sufficient information, which can be used to reconstruct the input data. To mitigate this issue, we introduce a Masked Jigsaw Puzzle (MJP) framework. MJP starts with random token shuffling to break the token order, and then a learnable \textit{unknown (unk)} position embedding is used to mask out the PEs of the shuffled tokens. In this manner, the local spatial information which is encoded in the position embeddings is disrupted, and the models are forced to learn feature representations that are less reliant on the local spatial information. Notably, with the careful use of MJP, we can not only improve models' robustness against gradient attacks, but also boost their performance in both vision and text application scenarios, such as classification for images (\textit{e.g.,} ImageNet-1K) and sentiment analysis for text (\textit{e.g.,} Yelp and Amazon). Experimental results suggest that MJP is a unified framework for different Transformer-based models in both vision and language tasks.

      <title>Task-Driven Prompt Learning: A Joint Framework for Multi-modal Cloud Removal and Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical remote sensing imagery is indispensable for Earth observation, yet persistent cloud occlusion limits its downstream utility. Most cloud removal (CR) methods are optimized for low-level fidelity and can over-smooth textures and boundaries that are critical for analysis-ready data (ARD), leading to a mismatch between visually plausible restoration and semantic utility. To bridge this gap, we propose TDP-CR, a task-driven multimodal framework that jointly performs cloud removal and land-cover segmentation. Central to our approach is a Prompt-Guided Fusion (PGF) mechanism, which utilizes a learnable degradation prompt to encode cloud thickness and spatial uncertainty. By combining global channel context with local prompt-conditioned spatial bias, PGF adaptively integrates Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) information only where optical data is corrupted. We further introduce a parameter-efficient two-phase training strategy that decouples reconstruction and semantic representation learning. Experiments on the LuojiaSET-OSFCR dataset demonstrate the superiority of our framework: TDP-CR surpasses heavy state-of-the-art baselines by 0.18 dB in PSNR while using only 15\% of the parameters, and achieves a 1.4\% improvement in mIoU consistently against multi-task competitors, effectively delivering analysis-ready data.</description>

      <title>Automating Parameter Selection in Deep Image Prior for Fluorescence Microscopy Image Denoising via Similarity-Based Parameter Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unsupervised deep image prior (DIP) addresses shortcomings of training data requirements and limited generalization associated with supervised deep learning. The performance of DIP depends on the network architecture and the stopping point of its iterative process. Optimizing these parameters for a new image requires time, restricting DIP application in domains where many images need to be processed. Focusing on fluorescence microscopy data, we hypothesize that similar images share comparable optimal parameter configurations for DIP-based denoising, potentially enabling optimization-free DIP for fluorescence microscopy. We generated a calibration (n=110) and validation set (n=55) of semantically different images from an open-source dataset for a network architecture search targeted towards ideal U-net architectures and stopping points. The calibration set represented our transfer basis. The validation set enabled the assessment of which image similarity criterion yields the best results. We then implemented AUTO-DIP, a pipeline for automatic parameter transfer, and compared it to the originally published DIP configuration (baseline) and a state-of-the-art image-specific variational denoising approach. We show that a parameter transfer from the calibration dataset to a test image based on only image metadata similarity (e.g., microscope type, imaged specimen) leads to similar and better performance than a transfer based on quantitative image similarity measures. AUTO-DIP outperforms the baseline DIP (DIP with original DIP parameters) as well as the variational denoising approaches for several open-source test datasets of varying complexity, particularly for very noisy inputs. Applications to locally acquired fluorescence microscopy images further proved superiority of AUTO-DIP.</description>

      <title>Learning Language-Driven Sequence-Level Modal-Invariant Representations for Video-Based Visible-Infrared Person Re-Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The core of video-based visible-infrared person re-identification (VVI-ReID) lies in learning sequence-level modal-invariant representations across different modalities. Recent research tends to use modality-shared language prompts generated by CLIP to guide the learning of modal-invariant representations. Despite achieving optimal performance, such methods still face limitations in efficient spatial-temporal modeling, sufficient cross-modal interaction, and explicit modality-level loss guidance. To address these issues, we propose the language-driven sequence-level modal-invariant representation learning (LSMRL) method, which includes spatial-temporal feature learning (STFL) module, semantic diffusion (SD) module and cross-modal interaction (CMI) module. To enable parameter- and computation-efficient spatial-temporal modeling, the STFL module is built upon CLIP with minimal modifications. To achieve sufficient cross-modal interaction and enhance the learning of modal-invariant features, the SD module is proposed to diffuse modality-shared language prompts into visible and infrared features to establish preliminary modal consistency. The CMI module is further developed to leverage bidirectional cross-modal self-attention to eliminate residual modality gaps and refine modal-invariant representations. To explicitly enhance the learning of modal-invariant representations, two modality-level losses are introduced to improve the features' discriminative ability and their generalization to unseen categories. Extensive experiments on large-scale VVI-ReID datasets demonstrate the superiority of LSMRL over AOTA methods.</description>

      <title>Learning Stochastic Bridges for Video Object Removal via Video-to-Video Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing video object removal methods predominantly rely on diffusion models following a noise-to-data paradigm, where generation starts from uninformative Gaussian noise. This approach discards the rich structural and contextual priors present in the original input video. Consequently, such methods often lack sufficient guidance, leading to incomplete object erasure or the synthesis of implausible content that conflicts with the scene's physical logic. In this paper, we reformulate video object removal as a video-to-video translation task via a stochastic bridge model. Unlike noise-initialized methods, our framework establishes a direct stochastic path from the source video (with objects) to the target video (objects removed). This bridge formulation effectively leverages the input video as a strong structural prior, guiding the model to perform precise removal while ensuring that the filled regions are logically consistent with the surrounding environment. To address the trade-off where strong bridge priors hinder the removal of large objects, we propose a novel adaptive mask modulation strategy. This mechanism dynamically modulates input embeddings based on mask characteristics, balancing background fidelity with generative flexibility. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods in both visual quality and temporal consistency.</description>

      <title>ARMARecon: An ARMA Convolutional Filter based Graph Neural Network for Neurodegenerative Dementias Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Early detection of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD) is essential for reducing the risk of progression to severe disease stages. As AD and FTD propagate along white-matter regions in a global, graph-dependent manner, graph-based neural networks are well suited to capture these patterns. Hence, we introduce ARMARecon, a unified graph learning framework that integrates Autoregressive Moving Average (ARMA) graph filtering with a reconstruction-driven objective to enhance feature representation and improve classification accuracy. ARMARecon effectively models both local and global connectivity by leveraging 20-bin Fractional Anisotropy (FA) histogram features extracted from white-matter regions, while mitigating over-smoothing. Overall, ARMARecon achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods on the multi-site dMRI datasets ADNI and NIFD.</description>

      <title>CroBIM-V: Memory-Quality Controlled Remote Sensing Referring Video Object Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Remote sensing video referring object segmentation (RS-RVOS) is challenged by weak target saliency and severe visual information truncation in dynamic scenes, making it extremely difficult to maintain discriminative target representations during segmentation. Moreover, progress in this field is hindered by the absence of large-scale dedicated benchmarks, while existing models are often affected by biased initial memory construction that impairs accurate instance localization in complex scenarios, as well as indiscriminate memory accumulation that encodes noise from occlusions or misclassifications, leading to persistent error propagation. This paper advances RS-RVOS research through dual contributions in data and methodology. First, we construct RS-RVOS Bench, the first large-scale benchmark comprising 111 video sequences, about 25,000 frames, and 213,000 temporal referring annotations. Unlike common RVOS benchmarks where many expressions are written with access to the full video context, our dataset adopts a strict causality-aware annotation strategy in which linguistic references are generated solely from the target state in the initial frame. Second, we propose a memory-quality-aware online referring segmentation framework, termed Memory Quality Control with Segment Anything Model (MQC-SAM). MQC-SAM introduces a temporal motion consistency module for initial memory calibration, leveraging short-term motion trajectory priors to correct structural deviations and establish accurate memory anchoring. Furthermore, it incorporates a decoupled attention-based memory integration mechanism with dynamic quality assessment, selectively updating high-confidence semantic features while filtering unreliable information, thereby effectively preventing error accumulation and propagation. Extensive experiments on RS-RVOS Bench demonstrate that MQC-SAM achieves state-of-the-art performance.</description>

      <title>EmoLat: Text-driven Image Sentiment Transfer via Emotion Latent Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose EmoLat, a novel emotion latent space that enables fine-grained, text-driven image sentiment transfer by modeling cross-modal correlations between textual semantics and visual emotion features. Within EmoLat, an emotion semantic graph is constructed to capture the relational structure among emotions, objects, and visual attributes. To enhance the discriminability and transferability of emotion representations, we employ adversarial regularization, aligning the latent emotion distributions across modalities. Building upon EmoLat, a cross-modal sentiment transfer framework is proposed to manipulate image sentiment via joint embedding of text and EmoLat features. The network is optimized using a multi-objective loss incorporating semantic consistency, emotion alignment, and adversarial regularization. To support effective modeling, we construct EmoSpace Set, a large-scale benchmark dataset comprising images with dense annotations on emotions, object semantics, and visual attributes. Extensive experiments on EmoSpace Set demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative metrics and qualitative transfer fidelity, establishing a new paradigm for controllable image sentiment editing guided by textual input. The EmoSpace Set and all the code are available at http://github.com/JingVIPLab/EmoLat.</description>

      <title>Toward Real-World High-Precision Image Matting and Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-precision scene parsing tasks, including image matting and dichotomous segmentation, aim to accurately predict masks with extremely fine details (such as hair). Most existing methods focus on salient, single foreground objects. While interactive methods allow for target adjustment, their class-agnostic design restricts generalization across different categories. Furthermore, the scarcity of high-quality annotation has led to a reliance on inharmonious synthetic data, resulting in poor generalization to real-world scenarios. To this end, we propose a Foreground Consistent Learning model, dubbed as FCLM, to address the aforementioned issues. Specifically, we first introduce a Depth-Aware Distillation strategy where we transfer the depth-related knowledge for better foreground representation. Considering the data dilemma, we term the processing of synthetic data as domain adaptation problem where we propose a domain-invariant learning strategy to focus on foreground learning. To support interactive prediction, we contribute an Object-Oriented Decoder that can receive both visual and language prompts to predict the referring target. Experimental results show that our method quantitatively and qualitatively outperforms SOTA methods.</description>

      <title>Conditional Random Fields for Interactive Refinement of Histopathological Predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assisting pathologists in the analysis of histopathological images has high clinical value, as it supports cancer detection and staging. In this context, histology foundation models have recently emerged. Among them, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) provide strong yet imperfect zero-shot predictions. We propose to refine these predictions by adapting Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) to histopathological applications, requiring no additional model training. We present HistoCRF, a CRF-based framework, with a novel definition of the pairwise potential that promotes label diversity and leverages expert annotations. We consider three experiments: without annotations, with expert annotations, and with iterative human-in-the-loop annotations that progressively correct misclassified patches. Experiments on five patch-level classification datasets covering different organs and diseases demonstrate average accuracy gains of 16.0% without annotations and 27.5% with only 100 annotations, compared to zero-shot predictions. Moreover, integrating a human in the loop reaches a further gain of 32.6% with the same number of annotations. The code will be made available on https://github.com/tgodelaine/HistoCRF.</description>

      <title>Detecting 3D Line Segments for 6DoF Pose Estimation with Limited Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The task of 6DoF object pose estimation is one of the fundamental problems of 3D vision with many practical applications such as industrial automation. Traditional deep learning approaches for this task often require extensive training data or CAD models, limiting their application in real-world industrial settings where data is scarce and object instances vary. We propose a novel method for 6DoF pose estimation focused specifically on bins used in industrial settings. We exploit the cuboid geometry of bins by first detecting intermediate 3D line segments corresponding to their top edges. Our approach extends the 2D line segment detection network LeTR to operate on structured point cloud data. The detected 3D line segments are then processed using a simple geometric procedure to robustly determine the bin's 6DoF pose. To evaluate our method, we extend an existing dataset with a newly collected and annotated dataset, which we make publicly available. We show that incorporating synthetic training data significantly improves pose estimation accuracy on real scans. Moreover, we show that our method significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art 6DoF pose estimation methods in terms of the pose accuracy (3 cm translation error, 8.2$^\circ$ rotation error) while not requiring instance-specific CAD models during inference.</description>

      <title>Energy-Aware Ensemble Learning for Coffee Leaf Disease Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coffee yields are contingent on the timely and accurate diagnosis of diseases; however, assessing leaf diseases in the field presents significant challenges. Although Artificial Intelligence (AI) vision models achieve high accuracy, their adoption is hindered by the limitations of constrained devices and intermittent connectivity. This study aims to facilitate sustainable on-device diagnosis through knowledge distillation: high-capacity Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) trained in data centers transfer knowledge to compact CNNs through Ensemble Learning (EL). Furthermore, dense tiny pairs were integrated through simple and optimized ensembling to enhance accuracy while adhering to strict computational and energy constraints. On a curated coffee leaf dataset, distilled tiny ensembles achieved competitive with prior work with significantly reduced energy consumption and carbon footprint. This indicates that lightweight models, when properly distilled and ensembled, can provide practical diagnostic solutions for Internet of Things (IoT) applications.</description>

      <title>RCDN: Real-Centered Detection Network for Robust Face Forgery Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image forgery has become a critical threat with the rapid proliferation of AI-based generation tools, which make it increasingly easy to synthesize realistic but fraudulent facial content. Existing detection methods achieve near-perfect performance when training and testing are conducted within the same domain, yet their effectiveness deteriorates substantially in crossdomain scenarios. This limitation is problematic, as new forgery techniques continuously emerge and detectors must remain reliable against unseen manipulations. To address this challenge, we propose the Real-Centered Detection Network (RCDN), a frequency spatial convolutional neural networks(CNN) framework with an Xception backbone that anchors its representation space around authentic facial images. Instead of modeling the diverse and evolving patterns of forgeries, RCDN emphasizes the consistency of real images, leveraging a dual-branch architecture and a real centered loss design to enhance robustness under distribution shifts. Extensive experiments on the DiFF dataset, focusing on three representative forgery types (FE, I2I, T2I), demonstrate that RCDN achieves both state-of-the-art in-domain accuracy and significantly stronger cross-domain generalization. Notably, RCDN reduces the generalization gap compared to leading baselines and achieves the highest cross/in-domain stability ratio, highlighting its potential as a practical solution for defending against evolving and unseen image forgery techniques.</description>

      <title>CARLA-Round: A Multi-Factor Simulation Dataset for Roundabout Trajectory Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate trajectory prediction of vehicles at roundabouts is critical for reducing traffic accidents, yet it remains highly challenging due to their circular road geometry, continuous merging and yielding interactions, and absence of traffic signals. Developing accurate prediction algorithms relies on reliable, multimodal, and realistic datasets; however, such datasets for roundabout scenarios are scarce, as real-world data collection is often limited by incomplete observations and entangled factors that are difficult to isolate. We present CARLA-Round, a systematically designed simulation dataset for roundabout trajectory prediction. The dataset varies weather conditions (five types) and traffic density levels (spanning Level-of-Service A-E) in a structured manner, resulting in 25 controlled scenarios. Each scenario incorporates realistic mixtures of driving behaviors and provides explicit annotations that are largely absent from existing datasets. Unlike randomly sampled simulation data, this structured design enables precise analysis of how different conditions influence trajectory prediction performance. Validation experiments using standard baselines (LSTM, GCN, GRU+GCN) reveal traffic density dominates prediction difficulty with strong monotonic effects, while weather shows non-linear impacts. The best model achieves 0.312m ADE on real-world rounD dataset, demonstrating effective sim-to-real transfer. This systematic approach quantifies factor impacts impossible to isolate in confounded real-world datasets. Our CARLA-Round dataset is available at https://github.com/Rebecca689/CARLA-Round.</description>

      <title>Segment and Matte Anything in a Unified Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Segment Anything (SAM) has recently pushed the boundaries of segmentation by demonstrating zero-shot generalization and flexible prompting after training on over one billion masks. Despite this, its mask prediction accuracy often falls short of the precision required in real-world applications. While several refinement modules have been proposed to boost SAM's segmentation quality, achieving highly accurate object delineation within a single, unified framework remains an open challenge. Furthermore, interactive image matting, which aims to generate fine-grained alpha mattes guided by diverse user hints, has not yet been explored in the context of SAM. Insights from recent studies highlight strong correlations between segmentation and matting, suggesting the feasibility of a unified model capable of both tasks. In this paper, we introduce Segment And Matte Anything (SAMA), a lightweight extension of SAM that delivers high-quality interactive image segmentation and matting with minimal extra parameters. Our Multi-View Localization Encoder (MVLE) captures detailed features from local views, while the Localization Adapter (Local-Adapter) refines mask outputs by recovering subtle boundary details. We also incorporate two prediction heads for each task into the architecture to generate segmentation and matting masks, simultaneously. Trained on a diverse dataset aggregated from publicly available sources, SAMA achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple segmentation and matting benchmarks, showcasing its adaptability and effectiveness in a wide range of downstream tasks.</description>

      <title>Principal Component Analysis-Based Terahertz Self-Supervised Denoising and Deblurring Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Terahertz (THz) systems inherently introduce frequency-dependent degradation effects, resulting in low-frequency blurring and high-frequency noise in amplitude images. Conventional image processing techniques cannot simultaneously address both issues, and manual intervention is often required due to the unknown boundary between denoising and deblurring. To tackle this challenge, we propose a principal component analysis (PCA)-based THz self-supervised denoising and deblurring network (THz-SSDD). The network employs a Recorrupted-to-Recorrupted self-supervised learning strategy to capture the intrinsic features of noise by exploiting invariance under repeated corruption. PCA decomposition and reconstruction are then applied to restore images across both low and high frequencies. The performance of the THz-SSDD network was evaluated on four types of samples. Training requires only a small set of unlabeled noisy images, and testing across samples with different material properties and measurement modes demonstrates effective denoising and deblurring. Quantitative analysis further validates the network feasibility, showing improvements in image quality while preserving the physical characteristics of the original signals.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Diagnostic Performance via Large-Resolution Inference Optimization for Pathology Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite their prominent performance on tasks such as ROI classification and segmentation, many pathology foundation models remain constrained by a specific input size e.g. 224 x 224, creating substantial inefficiencies when applied to whole-slide images (WSIs), which span thousands of resolutions. A naive strategy is to either enlarge inputs or downsample the WSIs. However, enlarging inputs results in prohibitive GPU memory consumption, while downsampling alters the microns-per-pixel resolution and obscures critical morphological details. To overcome these limitations, we propose an space- and time- efficient inference strategy that sparsifies attention using spatially aware neighboring blocks and filters out non-informative tokens through global attention scores. This design substantially reduces GPU memory and runtime during high-resolution WSI inference while preserving and even improving the downstream performance, enabling inference at higher resolutions under the same GPU budget. The experimental results show that our method can achieves up to an 7.67% improvement in the ROI classification and compatible results in segmentation.</description>

      <title>Inverse Rendering for High-Genus 3D Surface Meshes from Multi-view Images with Persistent Homology Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconstructing 3D objects from images is inherently an ill-posed problem due to ambiguities in geometry, appearance, and topology. This paper introduces collaborative inverse rendering with persistent homology priors, a novel strategy that leverages topological constraints to resolve these ambiguities. By incorporating priors that capture critical features such as tunnel loops and handle loops, our approach directly addresses the difficulty of reconstructing high-genus surfaces. The collaboration between photometric consistency from multi-view images and homology-based guidance enables recovery of complex high-genus geometry while circumventing catastrophic failures such as collapsing tunnels or losing high-genus structure. Instead of neural networks, our method relies on gradient-based optimization within a mesh-based inverse rendering framework to highlight the role of topological priors. Experimental results show that incorporating persistent homology priors leads to lower Chamfer Distance (CD) and higher Volume IoU compared to state-of-the-art mesh-based methods, demonstrating improved geometric accuracy and robustness against topological failure.</description>

      <title>VIRTUE: Versatile Video Retrieval Through Unified Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern video retrieval systems are expected to handle diverse tasks ranging from corpus-level retrieval and fine-grained moment localization to flexible multimodal querying. Specialized architectures achieve strong retrieval performance by training modality-specific encoders on massive datasets, but they lack the ability to process composed multimodal queries. In contrast, multimodal LLM (MLLM)-based methods support rich multimodal search but their retrieval performance remains well below that of specialized systems. We present VIRTUE, an MLLM-based versatile video retrieval framework that integrates corpus and moment-level retrieval capabilities while accommodating composed multimodal queries within a single architecture. We use contrastive alignment of visual and textual embeddings generated using a shared MLLM backbone to facilitate efficient embedding-based candidate search. Our embedding model, trained efficiently using low-rank adaptation (LoRA) on 700K paired visual-text data samples, surpasses other MLLM-based methods on zero-shot video retrieval tasks. Additionally, we demonstrate that the same model can be adapted without further training to achieve competitive results on zero-shot moment retrieval, and state of the art results for zero-shot composed video retrieval. With additional training for reranking candidates identified in the embedding-based search, our model substantially outperforms existing MLLM-based retrieval systems and achieves retrieval performance comparable to state of the art specialized models which are trained on orders of magnitude larger data.</description>

      <title>Where It Moves, It Matters: Referring Surgical Instrument Segmentation via Motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enabling intuitive, language-driven interaction with surgical scenes is a critical step toward intelligent operating rooms and autonomous surgical robotic assistance. However, the task of referring segmentation, localizing surgical instruments based on natural language descriptions, remains underexplored in surgical videos, with existing approaches struggling to generalize due to reliance on static visual cues and predefined instrument names. In this work, we introduce SurgRef, a novel motion-guided framework that grounds free-form language expressions in instrument motion, capturing how tools move and interact across time, rather than what they look like. This allows models to understand and segment instruments even under occlusion, ambiguity, or unfamiliar terminology. To train and evaluate SurgRef, we present Ref-IMotion, a diverse, multi-institutional video dataset with dense spatiotemporal masks and rich motion-centric expressions. SurgRef achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and generalization across surgical procedures, setting a new benchmark for robust, language-driven surgical video segmentation.</description>

      <title>DiffusionQC: Artifact Detection in Histopathology via Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital pathology plays a vital role across modern medicine, offering critical insights for disease diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment. However, histopathology images often contain artifacts introduced during slide preparation and digitization. Detecting and excluding them is essential to ensure reliable downstream analysis. Traditional supervised models typically require large annotated datasets, which is resource-intensive and not generalizable to novel artifact types. To address this, we propose DiffusionQC, which detects artifacts as outliers among clean images using a diffusion model. It requires only a set of clean images for training rather than pixel-level artifact annotations and predefined artifact types. Furthermore, we introduce a contrastive learning module to explicitly enlarge the distribution separation between artifact and clean images, yielding an enhanced version of our method. Empirical results demonstrate superior performance to state-of-the-art and offer cross-stain generalization capacity, with significantly less data and annotations.</description>

      <title>Less is More: Label-Guided Summarization of Procedural and Instructional Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video summarization helps turn long videos into clear, concise representations that are easier to review, document, and analyze, especially in high-stakes domains like surgical training. Prior work has progressed from using basic visual features like color, motion, and structural changes to using pre-trained vision-language models that can better understand what's happening in the video (semantics) and capture temporal flow, resulting in more context-aware video summarization. We propose a three-stage framework, PRISM: Procedural Representation via Integrated Semantic and Multimodal analysis, that produces semantically grounded video summaries. PRISM combines adaptive visual sampling, label-driven keyframe anchoring, and contextual validation using a large language model (LLM). Our method ensures that selected frames reflect meaningful and procedural transitions while filtering out generic or hallucinated content, resulting in contextually coherent summaries across both domain-specific and instructional videos. We evaluate our method on instructional and activity datasets, using reference summaries for instructional videos. Despite sampling fewer than 5% of the original frames, our summaries retain 84% semantic content while improving over baselines by as much as 33%. Our approach generalizes across procedural and domain-specific video tasks, achieving strong performance with both semantic alignment and precision.</description>

      <title>An Innovative Framework for Breast Cancer Detection Using Pyramid Adaptive Atrous Convolution, Transformer Integration, and Multi-Scale Feature Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers among women worldwide, and its accurate and timely diagnosis plays a critical role in improving treatment outcomes. This thesis presents an innovative framework for detecting malignant masses in mammographic images by integrating the Pyramid Adaptive Atrous Convolution (PAAC) and Transformer architectures. The proposed approach utilizes Multi-Scale Feature Fusion to enhance the extraction of features from benign and malignant tissues and combines Dice Loss and Focal Loss functions to improve the model's learning process, effectively reducing errors in binary breast cancer classification and achieving high accuracy and efficiency. In this study, a comprehensive dataset of breast cancer images from INbreast, MIAS, and DDSM was preprocessed through data augmentation and contrast enhancement and resized to 227x227 pixels for model training. Leveraging the Transformer's ability to manage long-range dependencies with Self-Attention mechanisms, the proposed model achieved high accuracy in detecting cancerous masses, outperforming foundational models such as BreastNet, DeepMammo, Multi-Scale CNN, Swin-Unet, and SegFormer. The final evaluation results for the proposed model include an accuracy of 98.5\%, sensitivity of 97.8\%, specificity of 96.3\%, F1-score of 98.2\%, and overall precision of 97.9\%. These metrics demonstrate a significant improvement over traditional methods and confirm the model's effectiveness in identifying cancerous masses in complex scenarios and large datasets. This model shows potential as a reliable and efficient tool for breast cancer diagnosis and can be effectively integrated into medical diagnostic systems.</description>

      <title>Federated Joint Learning for Domain and Class Generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient fine-tuning of visual-language models like CLIP has become crucial due to their large-scale parameter size and extensive pretraining requirements. Existing methods typically address either the issue of unseen classes or unseen domains in isolation, without considering a joint framework for both. In this paper, we propose \textbf{Fed}erated Joint Learning for \textbf{D}omain and \textbf{C}lass \textbf{G}eneralization, termed \textbf{FedDCG}, a novel approach that addresses both class and domain generalization in federated learning settings. Our method introduces a domain grouping strategy where class-generalized networks are trained within each group to prevent decision boundary confusion. During inference, we aggregate class-generalized results based on domain similarity, effectively integrating knowledge from both class and domain generalization. Specifically, a learnable network is employed to enhance class generalization capabilities, and a decoupling mechanism separates general and domain-specific knowledge, improving generalization to unseen domains. Extensive experiments across various datasets show that \textbf{FedDCG} outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of accuracy and robustness.</description>

      <title>Soft Shadow Diffusion (SSD): Physics-inspired Learning for 3D Computational Periscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional imaging requires a line of sight to create accurate visual representations of a scene. In certain circumstances, however, obtaining a suitable line of sight may be impractical, dangerous, or even impossible. Non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging addresses this challenge by reconstructing the scene from indirect measurements. Recently, passive NLOS methods that use an ordinary photograph of the subtle shadow cast onto a visible wall by the hidden scene have gained interest. These methods are currently limited to 1D or low-resolution 2D color imaging or to localizing a hidden object whose shape is approximately known. Here, we generalize this class of methods and demonstrate a 3D reconstruction of a hidden scene from an ordinary NLOS photograph. To achieve this, we propose a novel reformulation of the light transport model that conveniently decomposes the hidden scene into \textit{light-occluding} and \textit{non-light-occluding} components to yield a separable non-linear least squares (SNLLS) inverse problem. We develop two solutions: A gradient-based optimization method and a physics-inspired neural network approach, which we call Soft Shadow diffusion (SSD). Despite the challenging ill-conditioned inverse problem encountered here, our approaches are effective on numerous 3D scenes in real experimental scenarios. Moreover, SSD is trained in simulation but generalizes well to unseen classes in simulation and real-world NLOS scenes. SSD also shows surprising robustness to noise and ambient illumination.</description>

      <title>AgenticPruner: MAC-Constrained Neural Network Compression via LLM-Driven Strategy Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural network pruning remains essential for deploying deep learning models on resource-constrained devices, yet existing approaches primarily target parameter reduction without directly controlling computational cost. This yields unpredictable inference latency in deployment scenarios where strict Multiply-Accumulate (MAC) operation budgets must be met. We propose AgenticPruner, a framework utilizing large language models to achieve MAC-constrained optimization through iterative strategy learning. Our approach coordinates three specialized agents: a Profiling Agent that analyzes model architecture and MAC distributions, a Master Agent that orchestrates the workflow with divergence monitoring, and an Analysis Agent powered by Claude 3.5 Sonnet that learns optimal strategies from historical attempts. Through in-context learning, the Analysis Agent improves convergence success rate from 48% to 71% compared to grid search. Building upon isomorphic pruning's graph-based structural grouping, our method adds context-aware adaptation by analyzing patterns across pruning iterations, enabling automatic convergence to target MAC budgets within user-defined tolerance bands.
  We validate our framework on ImageNet-1K across ResNet, ConvNeXt, and DeiT architectures. On CNNs, our approach achieves MAC targeting while maintaining or improving accuracy: ResNet-50 reaches 1.77G MACs with 77.04% accuracy (+0.91% vs baseline); ResNet-101 achieves 4.22G MACs with 78.94% accuracy (+1.56% vs baseline). For ConvNeXt-Small, pruning to 8.17G MACs yields 1.41x GPU and 1.07x CPU speedup with 45% parameter reduction. On Vision Transformers, we demonstrate MAC-budget compliance within user-defined tolerance bands (typically +1% to +5% overshoot, -5% to -15% undershoot), establishing feasibility for deployment scenarios requiring strict computational guarantees.</description>

      <title>CytoCLIP: Learning Cytoarchitectural Characteristics in Developing Human Brain Using Contrastive Language Image Pre-Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The functions of different regions of the human brain are closely linked to their distinct cytoarchitecture, which is defined by the spatial arrangement and morphology of the cells. Identifying brain regions by their cytoarchitecture enables various scientific analyses of the brain. However, delineating these areas manually in brain histological sections is time-consuming and requires specialized knowledge. An automated approach is necessary to minimize the effort needed from human experts. To address this, we propose CytoCLIP, a suite of vision-language models derived from pre-trained Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) frameworks to learn joint visual-text representations of brain cytoarchitecture. CytoCLIP comprises two model variants: one is trained using low-resolution whole-region images to understand the overall cytoarchitectural pattern of an area, and the other is trained on high-resolution image tiles for detailed cellular-level representation. The training dataset is created from NISSL-stained histological sections of developing fetal brains of different gestational weeks. It includes 86 distinct regions for low-resolution images and 384 brain regions for high-resolution tiles. We evaluate the model's understanding of the cytoarchitecture and generalization ability using region classification and cross-modal retrieval tasks. Multiple experiments are performed under various data setups, including data from samples of different ages and sectioning planes. Experimental results demonstrate that CytoCLIP outperforms existing methods. It achieves an F1 score of 0.87 for whole-region classification and 0.91 for high-resolution image tile classification.</description>

      <title>SDiT: Semantic Region-Adaptive for Diffusion Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) achieve state-of-the-art performance in text-to-image synthesis but remain computationally expensive due to the iterative nature of denoising and the quadratic cost of global attention. In this work, we observe that denoising dynamics are spatially non-uniform-background regions converge rapidly while edges and textured areas evolve much more actively. Building on this insight, we propose SDiT, a Semantic Region-Adaptive Diffusion Transformer that allocates computation according to regional complexity. SDiT introduces a training-free framework combining (1) semantic-aware clustering via fast Quickshift-based segmentation, (2) complexity-driven regional scheduling to selectively update informative areas, and (3) boundary-aware refinement to maintain spatial coherence. Without any model retraining or architectural modification, SDiT achieves up to 3.0x acceleration while preserving nearly identical perceptual and semantic quality to full-attention inference.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel representation for efficient classical rendering of photorealistic 3D face avatars. Leveraging recent advances in radiance fields anchored to parametric face models, our approach achieves controllable volumetric rendering of complex facial features, including hair, skin, and eyes. At enrollment time, we learn a set of radiance manifolds in 3D space to extract an explicit layered mesh, along with appearance and warp textures. During deployment, this allows us to control and animate the face through simple linear blending and alpha compositing of textures over a static mesh. This explicit representation also enables the generated avatar to be efficiently streamed online and then rendered using classical mesh and shader-based rendering on legacy graphics platforms, eliminating the need for any custom engineering or integration.</description>

      <title>Concepts from Representations: Post-hoc Concept Bottleneck Models via Sparse Decomposition of Visual Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning has achieved remarkable success in image recognition, yet their inherent opacity poses challenges for deployment in critical domains. Concept-based interpretations aim to address this by explaining model reasoning through human-understandable concepts. However, existing post-hoc methods and ante-hoc concept bottleneck models (CBMs), suffer from limitations such as unreliable concept relevance, non-visual or labor-intensive concept definitions, and model or data-agnostic assumptions. This paper introduces Post-hoc Concept Bottleneck Model via Representation Decomposition (PCBM-ReD), a novel pipeline that retrofits interpretability onto pretrained opaque models. PCBM-ReD automatically extracts visual concepts from a pre-trained encoder, employs multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to label and filter concepts based on visual identifiability and task relevance, and selects an independent subset via reconstruction-guided optimization. Leveraging CLIP's visual-text alignment, it decomposes image representations into linear combination of concept embeddings to fit into the CBMs abstraction. Extensive experiments across 11 image classification tasks show PCBM-ReD achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, narrows the performance gap with end-to-end models, and exhibits better interpretability.</description>

      <title>A Two-Stage Globally-Diverse Adversarial Attack for Vision-Language Pre-training Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-language pre-training (VLP) models are vulnerable to adversarial examples, particularly in black-box scenarios. Existing multimodal attacks often suffer from limited perturbation diversity and unstable multi-stage pipelines. To address these challenges, we propose 2S-GDA, a two-stage globally-diverse attack framework. The proposed method first introduces textual perturbations through a globally-diverse strategy by combining candidate text expansion with globally-aware replacement. To enhance visual diversity, image-level perturbations are generated using multi-scale resizing and block-shuffle rotation. Extensive experiments on VLP models demonstrate that 2S-GDA consistently improves attack success rates over state-of-the-art methods, with gains of up to 11.17\% in black-box settings. Our framework is modular and can be easily combined with existing methods to further enhance adversarial transferability.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Multi-Scale Correlation Meta-Network for Few-Shot Remote Sensing Image Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Few-shot learning in remote sensing remains challenging due to three factors: the scarcity of labeled data, substantial domain shifts, and the multi-scale nature of geospatial objects. To address these issues, we introduce Adaptive Multi-Scale Correlation Meta-Network (AMC-MetaNet), a lightweight yet powerful framework with three key innovations: (i) correlation-guided feature pyramids for capturing scale-invariant patterns, (ii) an adaptive channel correlation module (ACCM) for learning dynamic cross-scale relationships, and (iii) correlation-guided meta-learning that leverages correlation patterns instead of conventional prototype averaging. Unlike prior approaches that rely on heavy pre-trained models or transformers, AMC-MetaNet is trained from scratch with only $\sim600K$ parameters, offering $20\times$ fewer parameters than ResNet-18 while maintaining high efficiency ($&lt;50$ms per image inference). AMC-MetaNet achieves up to 86.65\% accuracy in 5-way 5-shot classification on various remote sensing datasets, including EuroSAT, NWPU-RESISC45, UC Merced Land Use, and AID. Our results establish AMC-MetaNet as a computationally efficient, scale-aware framework for real-world few-shot remote sensing.</description>

      <title>CurConMix+: A Unified Spatio-Temporal Framework for Hierarchical Surgical Workflow Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surgical action triplet recognition aims to understand fine-grained surgical behaviors by modeling the interactions among instruments, actions, and anatomical targets. Despite its clinical importance for workflow analysis and skill assessment, progress has been hindered by severe class imbalance, subtle visual variations, and the semantic interdependence among triplet components. Existing approaches often address only a subset of these challenges rather than tackling them jointly, which limits their ability to form a holistic understanding. This study builds upon CurConMix, a spatial representation framework. At its core, a curriculum-guided contrastive learning strategy learns discriminative and progressively correlated features, further enhanced by structured hard-pair sampling and feature-level mixup. Its temporal extension, CurConMix+, integrates a Multi-Resolution Temporal Transformer (MRTT) that achieves robust, context-aware understanding by adaptively fusing multi-scale temporal features and dynamically balancing spatio-temporal cues. Furthermore, we introduce LLS48, a new, hierarchically annotated benchmark for complex laparoscopic left lateral sectionectomy, providing step-, task-, and action-level annotations. Extensive experiments on CholecT45 and LLS48 demonstrate that CurConMix+ not only outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in triplet recognition, but also exhibits strong cross-level generalization, as its fine-grained features effectively transfer to higher-level phase and step recognition tasks. Together, the framework and dataset provide a unified foundation for hierarchy-aware, reproducible, and interpretable surgical workflow understanding. The code and dataset will be publicly released on GitHub to facilitate reproducibility and further research.</description>

      <title>S^2F-Net:A Robust Spatial-Spectral Fusion Framework for Cross-Model AIGC Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid development of generative models has imposed an urgent demand for detection schemes with strong generalization capabilities. However, existing detection methods generally suffer from overfitting to specific source models, leading to significant performance degradation when confronted with unseen generative architectures. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a cross-model detection framework called S 2 F-Net, whose core lies in exploring and leveraging the inherent spectral discrepancies between real and synthetic textures. Considering that upsampling operations leave unique and distinguishable frequency fingerprints in both texture-poor and texture-rich regions, we focus our research on the detection of frequency-domain artifacts, aiming to fundamentally improve the generalization performance of the model. Specifically, we introduce a learnable frequency attention module that adaptively weights and enhances discriminative frequency bands by synergizing spatial texture analysis and spectral dependencies.On the AIGCDetectBenchmark, which includes 17 categories of generative models, S 2 F-Net achieves a detection accuracy of 90.49%, significantly outperforming various existing baseline methods in cross-domain detection scenarios.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a semantics modulated, multi scale Transformer for 3D gaze estimation. Our model conditions CLIP global features with learnable prototype banks (illumination, head pose, background, direction), fuses these prototype-enriched global vectors with CLIP patch tokens and high-resolution CNN tokens in a unified attention space, and replaces several FFN blocks with routed/shared Mixture of Experts to increase conditional capacity. Evaluated on MPIIFaceGaze, EYEDIAP, Gaze360 and ETH-XGaze, our model achieves new state of the art angular errors of 2.49{\deg}, 3.22{\deg}, 10.16{\deg}, and 1.44{\deg}, demonstrating up to a 64% relative improvement over previously reported results. ablations attribute gains to prototype conditioning, cross scale fusion, MoE and hyperparameter.

      <title>Multi-Sensor Matching with HyperNetworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hypernetworks are models that generate or modulate the weights of another network. They provide a flexible mechanism for injecting context and task conditioning and have proven broadly useful across diverse applications without significant increases in model size. We leverage hypernetworks to improve multimodal patch matching by introducing a lightweight descriptor-learning architecture that augments a Siamese CNN with (i) hypernetwork modules that compute adaptive, per-channel scaling and shifting and (ii) conditional instance normalization that provides modality-specific adaptation (e.g., visible vs. infrared, VIS-IR) in shallow layers. This combination preserves the efficiency of descriptor-based methods during inference while increasing robustness to appearance shifts. Trained with a triplet loss and hard-negative mining, our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on VIS-NIR and other VIS-IR benchmarks and matches or surpasses prior methods on additional datasets, despite their higher inference cost. To spur progress on domain shift, we also release GAP-VIR, a cross-platform (ground/aerial) VIS-IR patch dataset with 500K pairs, enabling rigorous evaluation of cross-domain generalization and adaptation.</description>

      <title>EmoKGEdit: Training-free Affective Injection via Visual Cue Transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing image emotion editing methods struggle to disentangle emotional cues from latent content representations, often yielding weak emotional expression and distorted visual structures. To bridge this gap, we propose EmoKGEdit, a novel training-free framework for precise and structure-preserving image emotion editing. Specifically, we construct a Multimodal Sentiment Association Knowledge Graph (MSA-KG) to disentangle the intricate relationships among objects, scenes, attributes, visual clues and emotion. MSA-KG explicitly encode the causal chain among object-attribute-emotion, and as external knowledge to support chain of thought reasoning, guiding the multimodal large model to infer plausible emotion-related visual cues and generate coherent instructions. In addition, based on MSA-KG, we design a disentangled structure-emotion editing module that explicitly separates emotional attributes from layout features within the latent space, which ensures that the target emotion is effectively injected while strictly maintaining visual spatial coherence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EmoKGEdit achieves excellent performance in both emotion fidelity and content preservation, and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>FlowIID: Single-Step Intrinsic Image Decomposition via Latent Flow Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intrinsic Image Decomposition (IID) separates an image into albedo and shading components. It is a core step in many real-world applications, such as relighting and material editing. Existing IID models achieve good results, but often use a large number of parameters. This makes them costly to combine with other models in real-world settings. To address this problem, we propose a flow matching-based solution. For this, we design a novel architecture, FlowIID, based on latent flow matching. FlowIID combines a VAE-guided latent space with a flow matching module, enabling a stable decomposition of albedo and shading. FlowIID is not only parameter-efficient, but also produces results in a single inference step. Despite its compact design, FlowIID delivers competitive and superior results compared to existing models across various benchmarks. This makes it well-suited for deployment in resource-constrained and real-time vision applications.</description>

      <title>Turbo-GoDec: Exploiting the Cluster Sparsity Prior for Hyperspectral Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a key task in hyperspectral image processing, hyperspectral anomaly detection has garnered significant attention and undergone extensive research. Existing methods primarily relt on two prior assumption: low-rank background and sparse anomaly, along with additional spatial assumptions of the background. However, most methods only utilize the sparsity prior assumption for anomalies and rarely expand on this hypothesis. From observations of hyperspectral images, we find that anomalous pixels exhibit certain spatial distribution characteristics: they often manifest as small, clustered groups in space, which we refer to as cluster sparsity of anomalies. Then, we combined the cluster sparsity prior with the classical GoDec algorithm, incorporating the cluster sparsity prior into the S-step of GoDec. This resulted in a new hyperspectral anomaly detection method, which we called Turbo-GoDec. In this approach, we modeled the cluster sparsity prior of anomalies using a Markov random field and computed the marginal probabilities of anomalies through message passing on a factor graph. Locations with high anomalous probabilities were treated as the sparse component in the Turbo-GoDec. Experiments are conducted on three real hyperspectral image (HSI) datasets which demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed Turbo-GoDec method in detecting small-size anomalies comparing with the vanilla GoDec (LSMAD) and state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods. The code is available at https://github.com/jiahuisheng/Turbo-GoDec.</description>

      <title>MMDeepResearch-Bench: A Benchmark for Multimodal Deep Research Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep Research Agents (DRAs) generate citation-rich reports via multi-step search and synthesis, yet existing benchmarks mainly target text-only settings or short-form multimodal QA, missing end-to-end multimodal evidence use. We introduce MMDeepResearch-Bench (MMDR-Bench), a benchmark of 140 expert-crafted tasks across 21 domains, where each task provides an image-text bundle to evaluate multimodal understanding and citation-grounded report generation. Compared to prior setups, MMDR-Bench emphasizes report-style synthesis with explicit evidence use, where models must connect visual artifacts to sourced claims and maintain consistency across narrative, citations, and visual references. We further propose a unified, interpretable evaluation pipeline: Formula-LLM Adaptive Evaluation (FLAE) for report quality, Trustworthy Retrieval-Aligned Citation Evaluation (TRACE) for citation-grounded evidence alignment, and Multimodal Support-Aligned Integrity Check (MOSAIC) for text-visual integrity, each producing fine-grained signals that support error diagnosis beyond a single overall score. Experiments across 25 state-of-the-art models reveal systematic trade-offs between generation quality, citation discipline, and multimodal grounding, highlighting that strong prose alone does not guarantee faithful evidence use and that multimodal integrity remains a key bottleneck for deep research agents.</description>

      <title>SimpleMatch: A Simple and Strong Baseline for Semantic Correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in semantic correspondence have been largely driven by the use of pre-trained large-scale models. However, a limitation of these approaches is their dependence on high-resolution input images to achieve optimal performance, which results in considerable computational overhead. In this work, we address a fundamental limitation in current methods: the irreversible fusion of adjacent keypoint features caused by deep downsampling operations. This issue is triggered when semantically distinct keypoints fall within the same downsampled receptive field (e.g., 16x16 patches). To address this issue, we present SimpleMatch, a simple yet effective framework for semantic correspondence that delivers strong performance even at low resolutions. We propose a lightweight upsample decoder that progressively recovers spatial detail by upsampling deep features to 1/4 resolution, and a multi-scale supervised loss that ensures the upsampled features retain discriminative features across different spatial scales. In addition, we introduce sparse matching and window-based localization to optimize training memory usage and reduce it by 51%. At a resolution of 252x252 (3.3x smaller than current SOTA methods), SimpleMatch achieves superior performance with 84.1% PCK@0.1 on the SPair-71k benchmark. We believe this framework provides a practical and efficient baseline for future research in semantic correspondence. Code is available at: https://github.com/hailong23-jin/SimpleMatch.</description>

      <title>From Prompts to Pavement: LMMs-based Agentic Behavior-Tree Generation Framework for Autonomous Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous vehicles (AVs) require adaptive behavior planners to navigate unpredictable, real-world environments safely. Traditional behavior trees (BTs) offer structured decision logic but are inherently static and demand labor-intensive manual tuning, limiting their applicability at SAE Level 5 autonomy. This paper presents an agentic framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) and multi-modal vision models (LVMs) to generate and adapt BTs on the fly. A specialized Descriptor agent applies chain-of-symbols prompting to assess scene criticality, a Planner agent constructs high-level sub-goals via in-context learning, and a Generator agent synthesizes executable BT sub-trees in XML format. Integrated into a CARLA+Nav2 simulation, our system triggers only upon baseline BT failure, demonstrating successful navigation around unexpected obstacles (e.g., street blockage) with no human intervention. Compared to a static BT baseline, this approach is a proof-of-concept that extends to diverse driving scenarios.</description>

      <title>DepthCropSeg++: Scaling a Crop Segmentation Foundation Model With Depth-Labeled Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: DepthCropSeg++: a foundation model for crop segmentation, capable of segmenting different crop species under open in-field environment. Crop segmentation is a fundamental task for modern agriculture, which closely relates to many downstream tasks such as plant phenotyping, density estimation, and weed control. In the era of foundation models, a number of generic large language and vision models have been developed. These models have demonstrated remarkable real world generalization due to significant model capacity and largescale datasets. However, current crop segmentation models mostly learn from limited data due to expensive pixel-level labelling cost, often performing well only under specific crop types or controlled environment. In this work, we follow the vein of our previous work DepthCropSeg, an almost unsupervised approach to crop segmentation, to scale up a cross-species and crossscene crop segmentation dataset, with 28,406 images across 30+ species and 15 environmental conditions. We also build upon a state-of-the-art semantic segmentation architecture ViT-Adapter architecture, enhance it with dynamic upsampling for improved detail awareness, and train the model with a two-stage selftraining pipeline. To systematically validate model performance, we conduct comprehensive experiments to justify the effectiveness and generalization capabilities across multiple crop datasets. Results demonstrate that DepthCropSeg++ achieves 93.11% mIoU on a comprehensive testing set, outperforming both supervised baselines and general-purpose vision foundation models like Segmentation Anything Model (SAM) by significant margins (+0.36% and +48.57% respectively). The model particularly excels in challenging scenarios including night-time environment (86.90% mIoU), high-density canopies (90.09% mIoU), and unseen crop varieties (90.09% mIoU), indicating a new state of the art for crop segmentation.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the CD-TWINSAFE is introduced, a V2I-based digital twin for Autonomous Vehicles. The proposed architecture is composed of two stacks running simultaneously, an on-board driving stack that includes a stereo camera for scene understanding, and a digital twin stack that runs an Unreal Engine 5 replica of the scene viewed by the camera as well as returning safety alerts to the cockpit. The on-board stack is implemented on the vehicle side including 2 main autonomous modules; localization and perception. The position and orientation of the ego vehicle are obtained using on-board sensors. Furthermore, the perception module is responsible for processing 20-fps images from stereo camera and understands the scene through two complementary pipelines. The pipeline are working on object detection and feature extraction including object velocity, yaw and the safety metrics time-to-collision and time-headway. The collected data form the driving stack are sent to the infrastructure side through the ROS-enabled architecture in the form of custom ROS2 messages and sent over UDP links that ride a 4G modem for V2I communication. The environment is monitored via the digital twin through the shared messages which update the information of the spawned ego vehicle and detected objects based on the real-time localization and perception data. Several tests with different driving scenarios to confirm the validity and real-time response of the proposed architecture.</description>

      <title>Utilizing the Score of Data Distribution for Hyperspectral Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperspectral images (HSIs) are a type of image that contains abundant spectral information. As a type of real-world data, the high-dimensional spectra in hyperspectral images are actually determined by only a few factors, such as chemical composition and illumination. Thus, spectra in hyperspectral images are highly likely to satisfy the manifold hypothesis. Based on the hyperspectral manifold hypothesis, we propose a novel hyperspectral anomaly detection method (named ScoreAD) that leverages the time-dependent gradient field of the data distribution (i.e., the score), as learned by a score-based generative model (SGM). Our method first trains the SGM on the entire set of spectra from the hyperspectral image. At test time, each spectrum is passed through a perturbation kernel, and the resulting perturbed spectrum is fed into the trained SGM to obtain the estimated score. The manifold hypothesis of HSIs posits that background spectra reside on one or more low-dimensional manifolds. Conversely, anomalous spectra, owing to their unique spectral signatures, are considered outliers that do not conform to the background manifold. Based on this fundamental discrepancy in their manifold distributions, we leverage a generative SGM to achieve hyperspectral anomaly detection. Experiments on the four hyperspectral datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The code is available at https://github.com/jiahuisheng/ScoreAD.</description>

      <title>A Hierarchical Benchmark of Foundation Models for Dermatology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foundation models have transformed medical image analysis by providing robust feature representations that reduce the need for large-scale task-specific training. However, current benchmarks in dermatology often reduce the complex diagnostic taxonomy to flat, binary classification tasks, such as distinguishing melanoma from benign nevi. This oversimplification obscures a model's ability to perform fine-grained differential diagnoses, which is critical for clinical workflow integration. This study evaluates the utility of embeddings derived from ten foundation models, spanning general computer vision, general medical imaging, and dermatology-specific domains, for hierarchical skin lesion classification. Using the DERM12345 dataset, which comprises 40 lesion subclasses, we calculated frozen embeddings and trained lightweight adapter models using a five-fold cross-validation. We introduce a hierarchical evaluation framework that assesses performance across four levels of clinical granularity: 40 Subclasses, 15 Main Classes, 2 and 4 Superclasses, and Binary Malignancy. Our results reveal a "granularity gap" in model capabilities: MedImageInsights achieved the strongest overall performance (97.52% weighted F1-Score on Binary Malignancy detection) but declined to 65.50% on fine-grained 40-class subtype classification. Conversely, MedSigLip (69.79%) and dermatology-specific models (Derm Foundation and MONET) excelled at fine-grained 40-class subtype discrimination while achieving lower overall performance than MedImageInsights on broader classification tasks. Our findings suggest that while general medical foundation models are highly effective for high-level screening, specialized modeling strategies are necessary for the granular distinctions required in diagnostic support systems.</description>

Abstract: Most 3D scene generation methods are limited to only generating object bounding box parameters while newer diffusion methods also generate class labels and latent features. Using object size or latent feature, they then retrieve objects from a predefined database. For complex scenes of varied, multi-categorical objects, diffusion-based latents cannot be effectively decoded by current autoencoders into the correct point cloud objects which agree with target classes. We introduce a Class-Partitioned Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (CPVQ-VAE) that is trained to effectively decode object latent features, by employing a pioneering $\textit{class-partitioned codebook}$ where codevectors are labeled by class. To address the problem of $\textit{codebook collapse}$, we propose a $\textit{class-aware}$ running average update which reinitializes dead codevectors within each partition. During inference, object features and class labels, both generated by a Latent-space Flow Matching Model (LFMM) designed specifically for scene generation, are consumed by the CPVQ-VAE. The CPVQ-VAE's class-aware inverse look-up then maps generated latents to codebook entries that are decoded to class-specific point cloud shapes. Thereby, we achieve pure point cloud generation without relying on an external objects database for retrieval. Extensive experiments reveal that our method reliably recovers plausible point cloud scenes, with up to 70.4% and 72.3% reduction in Chamfer and Point2Mesh errors on complex living room scenes.</description>

      <title>Weaknesses of Facial Emotion Recognition Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emotion detection from faces is one of the machine learning problems needed for human-computer interaction. The variety of methods used is enormous, which motivated an in-depth review of articles and scientific studies. Three of the most interesting and best solutions are selected, followed by the selection of three datasets that stood out for the diversity and number of images in them. The selected neural networks are trained, and then a series of experiments are performed to compare their performance, including testing on different datasets than a model was trained on. This reveals weaknesses in existing solutions, including differences between datasets, unequal levels of difficulty in recognizing certain emotions and the challenges in differentiating between closely related emotions.</description>

      <title>HOT-POT: Optimal Transport for Sparse Stereo Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stereo vision between images faces a range of challenges, including occlusions, motion, and camera distortions, across applications in autonomous driving, robotics, and face analysis. Due to parameter sensitivity, further complications arise for stereo matching with sparse features, such as facial landmarks. To overcome this ill-posedness and enable unsupervised sparse matching, we consider line constraints of the camera geometry from an optimal transport (OT) viewpoint. Formulating camera-projected points as (half)lines, we propose the use of the classical epipolar distance as well as a 3D ray distance to quantify matching quality. Employing these distances as a cost function of a (partial) OT problem, we arrive at efficiently solvable assignment problems. Moreover, we extend our approach to unsupervised object matching by formulating it as a hierarchical OT problem. The resulting algorithms allow for efficient feature and object matching, as demonstrated in our numerical experiments. Here, we focus on applications in facial analysis, where we aim to match distinct landmarking conventions.</description>

      <title>SkeFi: Cross-Modal Knowledge Transfer for Wireless Skeleton-Based Action Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Skeleton-based action recognition leverages human pose keypoints to categorize human actions, which shows superior generalization and interoperability compared to regular end-to-end action recognition. Existing solutions use RGB cameras to annotate skeletal keypoints, but their performance declines in dark environments and raises privacy concerns, limiting their use in smart homes and hospitals. This paper explores non-invasive wireless sensors, i.e., LiDAR and mmWave, to mitigate these challenges as a feasible alternative. Two problems are addressed: (1) insufficient data on wireless sensor modality to train an accurate skeleton estimation model, and (2) skeletal keypoints derived from wireless sensors are noisier than RGB, causing great difficulties for subsequent action recognition models. Our work, SkeFi, overcomes these gaps through a novel cross-modal knowledge transfer method acquired from the data-rich RGB modality. We propose the enhanced Temporal Correlation Adaptive Graph Convolution (TC-AGC) with frame interactive enhancement to overcome the noise from missing or inconsecutive frames. Additionally, our research underscores the effectiveness of enhancing multiscale temporal modeling through dual temporal convolution. By integrating TC-AGC with temporal modeling for cross-modal transfer, our framework can extract accurate poses and actions from noisy wireless sensors. Experiments demonstrate that SkeFi realizes state-of-the-art performances on mmWave and LiDAR. The code is available at https://github.com/Huang0035/Skefi.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Defense in Vision-Language Models: An Overview</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The widespread use of Vision Language Models (VLMs, e.g. CLIP) has raised concerns about their vulnerability to sophisticated and imperceptible adversarial attacks. These attacks could compromise model performance and system security in cross-modal tasks. To address this challenge, three main defense paradigms have been proposed: Training-time Defense, Test-time Adaptation Defense, and Training-free Defense. Training-time Defense involves modifying the training process, typically through adversarial fine-tuning to improve the robustness to adversarial examples. While effective, this approach requires substantial computational resources and may not generalize across all adversarial attacks. Test-time Adaptation Defense focuses on adapting the model at inference time by updating its parameters to handle unlabeled adversarial examples, offering flexibility but often at the cost of increased complexity and computational overhead. Training-free Defense avoids modifying the model itself, instead focusing on altering the adversarial inputs or their feature embeddings, which enforces input perturbations to mitigate the impact of attacks without additional training. This survey reviews the latest advancements in adversarial defense strategies for VLMs, highlighting the strengths and limitations of such approaches and discussing ongoing challenges in enhancing the robustness of VLMs.</description>

      <title>Large-scale EM Benchmark for Multi-Organelle Instance Segmentation in the Wild</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate instance-level segmentation of organelles in electron microscopy (EM) is critical for quantitative analysis of subcellular morphology and inter-organelle interactions. However, current benchmarks, based on small, curated datasets, fail to capture the inherent heterogeneity and large spatial context of in-the-wild EM data, imposing fundamental limitations on current patch-based methods. To address these limitations, we developed a large-scale, multi-source benchmark for multi-organelle instance segmentation, comprising over 100,000 2D EM images across variety cell types and five organelle classes that capture real-world variability. Dataset annotations were generated by our designed connectivity-aware Label Propagation Algorithm (3D LPA) with expert refinement. We further benchmarked several state-of-the-art models, including U-Net, SAM variants, and Mask2Former. Our results show several limitations: current models struggle to generalize across heterogeneous EM data and perform poorly on organelles with global, distributed morphologies (e.g., Endoplasmic Reticulum). These findings underscore the fundamental mismatch between local-context models and the challenge of modeling long-range structural continuity in the presence of real-world variability. The benchmark dataset and labeling tool will be publicly released soon.</description>

      <title>DCAC: Dynamic Class-Aware Cache Creates Stronger Out-of-Distribution Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection remains a fundamental challenge for deep neural networks, particularly due to overconfident predictions on unseen OOD samples during testing. We reveal a key insight: OOD samples predicted as the same class, or given high probabilities for it, are visually more similar to each other than to the true in-distribution (ID) samples. Motivated by this class-specific observation, we propose DCAC (Dynamic Class-Aware Cache), a training-free, test-time calibration module that maintains separate caches for each ID class to collect high-entropy samples and calibrate the raw predictions of input samples. DCAC leverages cached visual features and predicted probabilities through a lightweight two-layer module to mitigate overconfident predictions on OOD samples. This module can be seamlessly integrated with various existing OOD detection methods across both unimodal and vision-language models while introducing minimal computational overhead. Extensive experiments on multiple OOD benchmarks demonstrate that DCAC significantly enhances existing methods, achieving substantial improvements, i.e., reducing FPR95 by 6.55% when integrated with ASH-S on ImageNet OOD benchmark.</description>

      <title>NeuralFur: Animal Fur Reconstruction From Multi-View Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconstructing realistic animal fur geometry from images is a challenging task due to the fine-scale details, self-occlusion, and view-dependent appearance of fur. In contrast to human hairstyle reconstruction, there are also no datasets that can be leveraged to learn a fur prior for different animals. In this work, we present a first multi-view-based method for high-fidelity 3D fur modeling of animals using a strand-based representation, leveraging the general knowledge of a vision language model. Given multi-view RGB images, we first reconstruct a coarse surface geometry using traditional multi-view stereo techniques. We then use a vision language model (VLM) system to retrieve information about the realistic length structure of the fur for each part of the body. We use this knowledge to construct the animal's furless geometry and grow strands atop it. The fur reconstruction is supervised with both geometric and photometric losses computed from multi-view images. To mitigate orientation ambiguities stemming from the Gabor filters that are applied to the input images, we additionally utilize the VLM to guide the strands' growth direction and their relation to the gravity vector that we incorporate as a loss. With this new schema of using a VLM to guide 3D reconstruction from multi-view inputs, we show generalization across a variety of animals with different fur types.

      <title>Histopath-C: Towards Realistic Domain Shifts for Histopathology Vision-Language Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medical Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable performances in various medical imaging domains such as histo\-pathology by leveraging pre-trained, contrastive models that exploit visual and textual information. However, histopathology images may exhibit severe domain shifts, such as staining, contamination, blurring, and noise, which may severely degrade the VLM's downstream performance. In this work, we introduce Histopath-C, a new benchmark with realistic synthetic corruptions designed to mimic real-world distribution shifts observed in digital histopathology. Our framework dynamically applies corruptions to any available dataset and evaluates Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) mechanisms on the fly. We then propose LATTE, a transductive, low-rank adaptation strategy that exploits multiple text templates, mitigating the sensitivity of histopathology VLMs to diverse text inputs. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art TTA methods originally designed for natural images across a breadth of histopathology datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed design for robust adaptation in histopathology images.

      <title>Video Individual Counting and Tracking from Moving Drones: A Benchmark and Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Counting and tracking dense crowds in large-scale scenes is highly challenging, yet existing methods mainly rely on datasets captured by fixed cameras, which provide limited spatial coverage and are inadequate for large-scale dense crowd analysis. To address this limitation, we propose a flexible solution using moving drones to capture videos and perform video-level crowd counting and tracking of unique pedestrians across entire scenes. We introduce MovingDroneCrowd++, the largest video-level dataset for dense crowd counting and tracking captured by moving drones, covering diverse and complex conditions with varying flight altitudes, camera angles, and illumination. Existing methods fail to achieve satisfactory performance on this dataset. To this end, we propose GD3A (Global Density Map Decomposition via Descriptor Association), a density map-based video individual counting method that avoids explicit localization. GD3A establishes pixel-level correspondences between pedestrian descriptors across consecutive frames via optimal transport with an adaptive dustbin score, enabling the decomposition of global density maps into shared, inflow, and outflow components. Building on this framework, we further introduce DVTrack, which converts descriptor-level matching into instance-level associations through a descriptor voting mechanism for pedestrian tracking. Experimental results show that our methods significantly outperform existing approaches under dense crowds and complex motion, reducing counting error by 47.4 percent and improving tracking performance by 39.2 percent.</description>

      <title>SDCoNet: Saliency-Driven Multi-Task Collaborative Network for Remote Sensing Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In remote sensing images, complex backgrounds, weak object signals, and small object scales make accurate detection particularly challenging, especially under low-quality imaging conditions. A common strategy is to integrate single-image super-resolution (SR) before detection; however, such serial pipelines often suffer from misaligned optimization objectives, feature redundancy, and a lack of effective interaction between SR and detection. To address these issues, we propose a Saliency-Driven multi-task Collaborative Network (SDCoNet) that couples SR and detection through implicit feature sharing while preserving task specificity. SDCoNet employs the swin transformer-based shared encoder, where hierarchical window-shifted self-attention supports cross-task feature collaboration and adaptively balances the trade-off between texture refinement and semantic representation. In addition, a multi-scale saliency prediction module produces importance scores to select key tokens, enabling focused attention on weak object regions, suppression of background clutter, and suppression of adverse features introduced by multi-task coupling. Furthermore, a gradient routing strategy is introduced to mitigate optimization conflicts. It first stabilizes detection semantics and subsequently routes SR gradients along a detection-oriented direction, enabling the framework to guide the SR branch to generate high-frequency details that are explicitly beneficial for detection. Experiments on public datasets, including NWPU VHR-10-Split, DOTAv1.5-Split, and HRSSD-Split, demonstrate that the proposed method, while maintaining competitive computational efficiency, significantly outperforms existing mainstream algorithms in small object detection on low-quality remote sensing images. Our code is available at https://github.com/qiruo-ya/SDCoNet.</description>

      <title>Fine-Tuning Cycle-GAN for Domain Adaptation of MRI Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans acquired from different scanners or institutions often suffer from domain shifts owing to variations in hardware, protocols, and acquisition parameters. This discrepancy degrades the performance of deep learning models trained on source domain data when applied to target domain images. In this study, we propose a Cycle-GAN-based model for unsupervised medical-image domain adaptation. Leveraging CycleGANs, our model learns bidirectional mappings between the source and target domains without paired training data, preserving the anatomical content of the images. By leveraging Cycle-GAN capabilities with content and disparity loss for adaptation tasks, we ensured image-domain adaptation while maintaining image integrity. Several experiments on MRI datasets demonstrated the efficacy of our model in bidirectional domain adaptation without labelled data. Furthermore, research offers promising avenues for improving the diagnostic accuracy of healthcare. The statistical results confirm that our approach improves model performance and reduces domain-related variability, thus contributing to more precise and consistent medical image analysis.</description>

      <title>Deep Feature Deformation Weights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Handle-based mesh deformation has been a long-standing paradigm in computer graphics, enabling intuitive shape edits from sparse controls. Classic techniques offer precise and rapid deformation control. However, they solve an optimization problem with constraints defined by control handle placement, requiring a user to know apriori the ideal distribution of handles on the shape to accomplish the desired edit. The mapping from handle set to deformation behavior is often unintuitive and, importantly, non-semantic. Modern data-driven methods, on the other hand, leverage a data prior to obtain semantic edits, but are slow and imprecise. We propose a technique that fuses the semantic prior of data with the precise control and speed of traditional frameworks. Our approach is surprisingly simple yet effective: deep feature proximity makes for smooth and semantic deformation weights, with no need for additional regularization. The weights can be computed in real-time for any surface point, whereas prior methods require optimization for new handles. Moreover, the semantic prior from deep features enables co-deformation of semantic parts. We introduce an improved feature distillation pipeline, barycentric feature distillation, which efficiently uses the visual signal from shape renders to minimize distillation cost. This allows our weights to be computed for high resolution meshes in under a minute, in contrast to potentially hours for both classical and neural methods. We preserve and extend properties of classical methods through feature space constraints and locality weighting. Our field representation allows for automatic detection of semantic symmetries, which we use to produce symmetry-preserving deformations. We show a proof-of-concept application which can produce deformations for meshes up to 1 million faces in real-time on a consumer-grade machine.</description>

      <title>XRefine: Attention-Guided Keypoint Match Refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sparse keypoint matching is crucial for 3D vision tasks, yet current keypoint detectors often produce spatially inaccurate matches. Existing refinement methods mitigate this issue through alignment of matched keypoint locations, but they are typically detector-specific, requiring retraining for each keypoint detector. We introduce XRefine, a novel, detector-agnostic approach for sub-pixel keypoint refinement that operates solely on image patches centered at matched keypoints. Our cross-attention-based architecture learns to predict refined keypoint coordinates without relying on internal detector representations, enabling generalization across detectors. Furthermore, XRefine can be extended to handle multi-view feature tracks. Experiments on MegaDepth, KITTI, and ScanNet demonstrate that the approach consistently improves geometric estimation accuracy, achieving superior performance compared to existing refinement methods while maintaining runtime efficiency. Our code and trained models can be found at https://github.com/boschresearch/xrefine.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting faces in overhead images remains a significant challenge due to extreme scale variations and environmental clutter. To address this, we created the BirdsEye-RU dataset, a comprehensive collection of 2,978 images containing over eight thousand annotated faces. This dataset is specifically designed to capture small and distant faces across diverse environments, containing both drone images and smartphone-captured images from high altitude.

      <title>Encoding Emotion Through Self-Supervised Eye Movement Reconstruction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The relationship between emotional expression and eye movement is well-documented, with literature establishing gaze patterns are reliable indicators of emotion. However, most studies utilize specialized, high-resolution eye-tracking equipment, limiting the potential reach of findings. We investigate how eye movement can be used to predict multimodal markers of emotional expression from naturalistic, low-resolution videos. We utilize a collection of video interviews from the USC Shoah Foundation's Visual History Archive with Holocaust survivors as they recount their experiences in the Auschwitz concentration camp. Inspired by pretraining methods on language models, we develop a novel gaze detection model that uses self-supervised eye movement reconstruction that can effectively leverage unlabeled video. We use this model's encoder embeddings to fine-tune models on two downstream tasks related to emotional expression. The first is aligning eye movement with directional emotion estimates from speech. The second task is using eye gaze as a predictor of three momentary manifestations of emotional behaviors: laughing, crying/sobbing, and sighing. We find our new model is predictive of emotion outcomes and observe a positive correlation between pretraining performance and emotion processing performance for both experiments. We conclude self-supervised eye movement reconstruction is an effective method for encoding the affective signal they carry.</description>

      <title>Camera Pose Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimating the position and orientation of a camera with respect to an observed scene is one of the central problems in computer vision, particularly in the context of camera calibration and multi-sensor systems. This paper addresses the planar Perspective--$n$--Point problem, with special emphasis on the initial estimation of the pose of a calibration object. As a solution, we propose the \texttt{PnP-ProCay78} algorithm, which combines the classical quadratic formulation of the reconstruction error with a Cayley parameterization of rotations and least-squares optimization. The key component of the method is a deterministic selection of starting points based on an analysis of the reconstruction error for two canonical vectors, allowing costly solution-space search procedures to be avoided. Experimental validation is performed using data acquired also from high-resolution RGB cameras and very low-resolution thermal cameras in an integrated RGB--IR setup. The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves practically the same projection accuracy as optimal \texttt{SQPnP} and slightly higher than \texttt{IPPE}, both prominent \texttt{PnP-OpenCV} procedures. However, \texttt{PnP-ProCay78} maintains a significantly simpler algorithmic structure. Moreover, the analysis of optimization trajectories in Cayley space provides an intuitive insight into the convergence process, making the method attractive also from a didactic perspective. Unlike existing PnP solvers, the proposed \texttt{PnP-ProCay78} algorithm combines projection error minimization with an analytically eliminated reconstruction-error surrogate for translation, yielding a hybrid cost formulation that is both geometrically transparent and computationally efficient.</description>

      <title>Linear Mechanisms for Spatiotemporal Reasoning in Vision Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatio-temporal reasoning is a remarkable capability of Vision Language Models (VLMs), but the underlying mechanisms of such abilities remain largely opaque. We postulate that visual/geometrical and textual representations of spatial structure must be combined at some point in VLM computations. We search for such confluence, and ask whether the identified representation can causally explain aspects of input-output model behavior through a linear model. We show empirically that VLMs encode object locations by linearly binding \textit{spatial IDs} to textual activations, then perform reasoning via language tokens. Through rigorous causal interventions we demonstrate that these IDs, which are ubiquitous across the model, can systematically mediate model beliefs at intermediate VLM layers. Additionally, we find that spatial IDs serve as a diagnostic tool for identifying limitations in existing VLMs, and as a valuable learning signal. We extend our analysis to video VLMs and identify an analogous linear temporal ID mechanism. By characterizing our proposed spatiotemporal ID mechanism, we elucidate a previously underexplored internal reasoning process in VLMs, toward improved interpretability and the principled design of more aligned and capable models. We release our code for reproducibility: https://github.com/Raphoo/linear-mech-vlms.</description>

      <title>From Bands to Depth: Understanding Bathymetry Decisions on Sentinel-2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deploying Sentinel-2 satellite derived bathymetry (SDB) robustly across sites remains challenging. We analyze a Swin-Transformer based U-Net model (Swin-BathyUNet) to understand how it infers depth and when its predictions are trustworthy. A leave-one-band out study ranks spectral importance to the different bands consistent with shallow water optics. We adapt ablation-based CAM to regression (A-CAM-R) and validate the reliability via a performance retention test: keeping only the top-p% salient pixels while neutralizing the rest causes large, monotonic RMSE increase, indicating explanations localize on evidence the model relies on. Attention ablations show decoder conditioned cross attention on skips is an effective upgrade, improving robustness to glint/foam. Cross-region inference (train on one site, test on another) reveals depth-dependent degradation: MAE rises nearly linearly with depth, and bimodal depth distributions exacerbate mid/deep errors. Practical guidance follows: maintain wide receptive fields, preserve radiometric fidelity in green/blue channels, pre-filter bright high variance near shore, and pair light target site fine tuning with depth aware calibration to transfer across regions.</description>

      <title>Mixed Precision PointPillars for Efficient 3D Object Detection with TensorRT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LIDAR 3D object detection is one of the important tasks for autonomous vehicles. Ensuring that this task operates in real-time is crucial. Toward this, model quantization can be used to accelerate the runtime. However, directly applying model quantization often leads to performance degradation due to LIDAR's wide numerical distributions and extreme outliers. To address the wide numerical distribution, we proposed a mixed precision framework designed for PointPillars. Our framework first searches for sensitive layers with post-training quantization (PTQ) by quantizing one layer at a time to 8-bit integer (INT8) and evaluating each model for average precision (AP). The top-k most sensitive layers are assigned as floating point (FP). Combinations of these layers are greedily searched to produce candidate mixed precision models, which are finalized with either PTQ or quantization-aware training (QAT). Furthermore, to handle outliers, we observe that using a very small number of calibration data reduces the likelihood of encountering outliers, thereby improving PTQ performance. Our methods provides mixed precision models without training in the PTQ pipeline, while our QAT pipeline achieves the performance competitive to FP models. With TensorRT deployment, our models offer less latency and sizes by up to 2.35 and 2.26 times, respectively.</description>

      <title>Generalizable Hyperparameter Optimization for Federated Learning on Non-IID Cancer Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning for cancer histopathology training conflicts with privacy constraints in clinical settings. Federated Learning (FL) mitigates this by keeping data local; however, its performance depends on hyperparameter choices under non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) client datasets. This paper examined whether hyperparameters optimized on one cancer imaging dataset generalized across non-IID federated scenarios. We considered binary histopathology tasks for ovarian and colorectal cancers. We perform centralized Bayesian hyperparameter optimization and transfer dataset-specific optima to the non-IID FL setup. The main contribution of this study is the introduction of a simple cross-dataset aggregation heuristic by combining configurations by averaging the learning rates and considering the modal optimizers and batch sizes. This combined configuration achieves a competitive classification performance.</description>

      <title>Near-Light Color Photometric Stereo for mono-Chromaticity non-lambertian surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Color photometric stereo enables single-shot surface reconstruction, extending conventional photometric stereo that requires multiple images of a static scene under varying illumination to dynamic scenarios. However, most existing approaches assume ideal distant lighting and Lambertian reflectance, leaving more practical near-light conditions and non-Lambertian surfaces underexplored. To overcome this limitation, we propose a framework that leverages neural implicit representations for depth and BRDF modeling under the assumption of mono-chromaticity (uniform chromaticity and homogeneous material), which alleviates the inherent ill-posedness of color photometric stereo and allows for detailed surface recovery from just one image. Furthermore, we design a compact optical tactile sensor to validate our approach. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method achieves accurate and robust surface reconstruction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient brain tumor diagnosis is crucial for early treatment; however, it is challenging because of lesion variability and image complexity. We evaluated convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in a federated learning (FL) setting, comparing models trained on original versus preprocessed MRI images (resizing, grayscale conversion, normalization, filtering, and histogram equalization). Preprocessing alone yielded negligible gains; combined with test-time augmentation (TTA), it delivered consistent, statistically significant improvements in federated MRI classification (p&lt;0.001). In practice, TTA should be the default inference strategy in FL-based medical imaging; when the computational budget permits, pairing TTA with light preprocessing provides additional reliable gains.</description>

      <title>VILTA: A VLM-in-the-Loop Adversary for Enhancing Driving Policy Robustness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The safe deployment of autonomous driving (AD) systems is fundamentally hindered by the long-tail problem, where rare yet critical driving scenarios are severely underrepresented in real-world data. Existing solutions including safety-critical scenario generation and closed-loop learning often rely on rule-based heuristics, resampling methods and generative models learned from offline datasets, limiting their ability to produce diverse and novel challenges. While recent works leverage Vision Language Models (VLMs) to produce scene descriptions that guide a separate, downstream model in generating hazardous trajectories for agents, such two-stage framework constrains the generative potential of VLMs, as the diversity of the final trajectories is ultimately limited by the generalization ceiling of the downstream algorithm. To overcome these limitations, we introduce VILTA (VLM-In-the-Loop Trajectory Adversary), a novel framework that integrates a VLM into the closed-loop training of AD agents. Unlike prior works, VILTA actively participates in the training loop by comprehending the dynamic driving environment and strategically generating challenging scenarios through direct, fine-grained editing of surrounding agents' future trajectories. This direct-editing approach fully leverages the VLM's powerful generalization capabilities to create a diverse curriculum of plausible yet challenging scenarios that extend beyond the scope of traditional methods. We demonstrate that our approach substantially enhances the safety and robustness of the resulting AD policy, particularly in its ability to navigate critical long-tail events.</description>

      <title>Fusion-Restoration Image Processing Algorithm to Improve the High-Temperature Deformation Measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the deformation measurement of high-temperature structures, image degradation caused by thermal radiation and random errors introduced by heat haze restrict the accuracy and effectiveness of deformation measurement. To suppress thermal radiation and heat haze using fusion-restoration image processing methods, thereby improving the accuracy and effectiveness of DIC in the measurement of high-temperature deformation. For image degradation caused by thermal radiation, based on the image layered representation, the image is decomposed into positive and negative channels for parallel processing, and then optimized for quality by multi-exposure image fusion. To counteract the high-frequency, random errors introduced by heat haze, we adopt the FSIM as the objective function to guide the iterative optimization of model parameters, and the grayscale average algorithm is applied to equalize anomalous gray values, thereby reducing measurement error. The proposed multi-exposure image fusion algorithm effectively suppresses image degradation caused by complex illumination conditions, boosting the effective computation area from 26% to 50% for under-exposed images and from 32% to 40% for over-exposed images without degrading measurement accuracy in the experiment. Meanwhile, the image restoration combined with the grayscale average algorithm reduces static thermal deformation measurement errors. The error in {\epsilon}_xx is reduced by 85.3%, while the errors in {\epsilon}_yy and {\gamma}_xy are reduced by 36.0% and 36.4%, respectively. We present image processing methods to suppress the interference of thermal radiation and heat haze in high-temperature deformation measurement using DIC. The experimental results verify that the proposed method can effectively improve image quality, reduce deformation measurement errors, and has potential application value in thermal deformation measurement.</description>

      <title>GaussianTrimmer: Online Trimming Boundaries for 3DGS Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the widespread application of 3D Gaussians in 3D scene representation, 3D scene segmentation methods based on 3D Gaussians have also gradually emerged. However, existing 3D Gaussian segmentation methods basically segment on the basis of Gaussian primitives. Due to the large variation range of the scale of 3D Gaussians, large-sized Gaussians that often span the foreground and background lead to jagged boundaries of segmented objects. To this end, we propose an online boundary trimming method, GaussianTrimmer, which is an efficient and plug-and-play post-processing method capable of trimming coarse boundaries for existing 3D Gaussian segmentation methods. Our method consists of two core steps: 1. Generating uniformly and well-covered virtual cameras; 2. Trimming Gaussian at the primitive level based on 2D segmentation results on virtual cameras. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that our method can improve the segmentation quality of existing 3D Gaussian segmentation methods as a plug-and-play method.</description>

      <title>Fusing in 3D: Free-Viewpoint Fusion Rendering with a 3D Infrared-Visible Scene Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Infrared-visible image fusion aims to integrate infrared and visible information into a single fused image. Existing 2D fusion methods focus on fusing images from fixed camera viewpoints, neglecting a comprehensive understanding of complex scenarios, which results in the loss of critical information about the scene. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Infrared-Visible Gaussian Fusion (IVGF) framework, which reconstructs scene geometry from multimodal 2D inputs and enables direct rendering of fused images. Specifically, we propose a cross-modal adjustment (CMA) module that modulates the opacity of Gaussians to solve the problem of cross-modal conflicts. Moreover, to preserve the distinctive features from both modalities, we introduce a fusion loss that guides the optimization of CMA, thus ensuring that the fused image retains the critical characteristics of each modality. Comprehensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>P2L-CA: An Effective Parameter Tuning Framework for Rehearsal-Free Multi-Label Class-Incremental Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-label Class-Incremental Learning aims to continuously recognize novel categories in complex scenes where multiple objects co-occur. However, existing approaches often incur high computational costs due to full-parameter fine-tuning and substantial storage overhead from memory buffers, or they struggle to address feature confusion and domain discrepancies adequately. To overcome these limitations, we introduce P2L-CA, a parameter-efficient framework that integrates a Prompt-to-Label module with a Continuous Adapter module. The P2L module leverages class-specific prompts to disentangle multi-label representations while incorporating linguistic priors to enforce stable semantic-visual alignment. Meanwhile, the CA module employs lightweight adapters to mitigate domain gaps between pre-trained models and downstream tasks, thereby enhancing model plasticity. Extensive experiments across standard and challenging MLCIL settings on MS-COCO and PASCAL VOC show that P2L-CA not only achieves substantial improvements over state-of-the-art methods but also demonstrates strong generalization in CIL scenarios, all while requiring minimal trainable parameters and eliminating the need for memory buffers.</description>

      <title>RSOD: Reliability-Guided Sonar Image Object Detection with Extremely Limited Labels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Object detection in sonar images is a key technology in underwater detection systems. Compared to natural images, sonar images contain fewer texture details and are more susceptible to noise, making it difficult for non-experts to distinguish subtle differences between classes. This leads to their inability to provide precise annotation data for sonar images. Therefore, designing effective object detection methods for sonar images with extremely limited labels is particularly important. To address this, we propose a teacher-student framework called RSOD, which aims to fully learn the characteristics of sonar images and develop a pseudo-label strategy suitable for these images to mitigate the impact of limited labels. First, RSOD calculates a reliability score by assessing the consistency of the teacher's predictions across different views. To leverage this score, we introduce an object mixed pseudo-label method to tackle the shortage of labeled data in sonar images. Finally, we optimize the performance of the student by implementing a reliability-guided adaptive constraint. By taking full advantage of unlabeled data, the student can perform well even in situations with extremely limited labels. Notably, on the UATD dataset, our method, using only 5% of labeled data, achieves results that can compete against those of our baseline algorithm trained on 100% labeled data. We also collected a new dataset to provide more valuable data for research in the field of sonar.</description>

      <title>S2DiT: Sandwich Diffusion Transformer for Mobile Streaming Video Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have recently improved video generation quality. However, their heavy computational cost makes real-time or on-device generation infeasible. In this work, we introduce S2DiT, a Streaming Sandwich Diffusion Transformer designed for efficient, high-fidelity, and streaming video generation on mobile hardware. S2DiT generates more tokens but maintains efficiency with novel efficient attentions: a mixture of LinConv Hybrid Attention (LCHA) and Stride Self-Attention (SSA). Based on this, we uncover the sandwich design via a budget-aware dynamic programming search, achieving superior quality and efficiency. We further propose a 2-in-1 distillation framework that transfers the capacity of large teacher models (e.g., Wan 2.2-14B) to the compact few-step sandwich model. Together, S2DiT achieves quality on par with state-of-the-art server video models, while streaming at over 10 FPS on an iPhone.</description>

      <title>DC-VLAQ: Query-Residual Aggregation for Robust Visual Place Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the central challenges in visual place recognition (VPR) is learning a robust global representation that remains discriminative under large viewpoint changes, illumination variations, and severe domain shifts. While visual foundation models (VFMs) provide strong local features, most existing methods rely on a single model, overlooking the complementary cues offered by different VFMs. However, exploiting such complementary information inevitably alters token distributions, which challenges the stability of existing query-based global aggregation schemes. To address these challenges, we propose DC-VLAQ, a representation-centric framework that integrates the fusion of complementary VFMs and robust global aggregation. Specifically, we first introduce a lightweight residual-guided complementary fusion that anchors representations in the DINOv2 feature space while injecting complementary semantics from CLIP through a learned residual correction. In addition, we propose the Vector of Local Aggregated Queries (VLAQ), a query--residual global aggregation scheme that encodes local tokens by their residual responses to learnable queries, resulting in improved stability and the preservation of fine-grained discriminative cues. Extensive experiments on standard VPR benchmarks, including Pitts30k, Tokyo24/7, MSLS, Nordland, SPED, and AmsterTime, demonstrate that DC-VLAQ consistently outperforms strong baselines and achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly under challenging domain shifts and long-term appearance changes.</description>

      <title>KaoLRM: Repurposing Pre-trained Large Reconstruction Models for Parametric 3D Face Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose KaoLRM to re-target the learned prior of the Large Reconstruction Model (LRM) for parametric 3D face reconstruction from single-view images. Parametric 3D Morphable Models (3DMMs) have been widely used for facial reconstruction due to their compact and interpretable parameterization, yet existing 3DMM regressors often exhibit poor consistency across varying viewpoints. To address this, we harness the pre-trained 3D prior of LRM and incorporate FLAME-based 2D Gaussian Splatting into LRM's rendering pipeline. Specifically, KaoLRM projects LRM's pre-trained triplane features into the FLAME parameter space to recover geometry, and models appearance via 2D Gaussian primitives that are tightly coupled to the FLAME mesh. The rich prior enables the FLAME regressor to be aware of the 3D structure, leading to accurate and robust reconstructions under self-occlusions and diverse viewpoints. Experiments on both controlled and in-the-wild benchmarks demonstrate that KaoLRM achieves superior reconstruction accuracy and cross-view consistency, while existing methods remain sensitive to viewpoint variations. The code is released at https://github.com/CyberAgentAILab/KaoLRM.</description>

      <title>SSPFormer: Self-Supervised Pretrained Transformer for MRI Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pre-trained transformer demonstrates remarkable generalization ability in natural image processing. However, directly transferring it to magnetic resonance images faces two key challenges: the inability to adapt to the specificity of medical anatomical structures and the limitations brought about by the privacy and scarcity of medical data. To address these issues, this paper proposes a Self-Supervised Pretrained Transformer (SSPFormer) for MRI images, which effectively learns domain-specific feature representations of medical images by leveraging unlabeled raw imaging data. To tackle the domain gap and data scarcity, we introduce inverse frequency projection masking, which prioritizes the reconstruction of high-frequency anatomical regions to enforce structure-aware representation learning. Simultaneously, to enhance robustness against real-world MRI artifacts, we employ frequency-weighted FFT noise enhancement that injects physiologically realistic noise into the Fourier domain. Together, these strategies enable the model to learn domain-invariant and artifact-robust features directly from raw scans. Through extensive experiments on segmentation, super-resolution, and denoising tasks, the proposed SSPFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance, fully verifying its ability to capture fine-grained MRI image fidelity and adapt to clinical application requirements.</description>

      <title>Moaw: Unleashing Motion Awareness for Video Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video diffusion models, trained on large-scale datasets, naturally capture correspondences of shared features across frames. Recent works have exploited this property for tasks such as optical flow prediction and tracking in a zero-shot setting. Motivated by these findings, we investigate whether supervised training can more fully harness the tracking capability of video diffusion models. To this end, we propose Moaw, a framework that unleashes motion awareness for video diffusion models and leverages it to facilitate motion transfer. Specifically, we train a diffusion model for motion perception, shifting its modality from image-to-video generation to video-to-dense-tracking. We then construct a motion-labeled dataset to identify features that encode the strongest motion information, and inject them into a structurally identical video generation model. Owing to the homogeneity between the two networks, these features can be naturally adapted in a zero-shot manner, enabling motion transfer without additional adapters. Our work provides a new paradigm for bridging generative modeling and motion understanding, paving the way for more unified and controllable video learning frameworks.</description>

      <title>Towards Unbiased Source-Free Object Detection via Vision Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Source-Free Object Detection (SFOD) has garnered much attention in recent years by eliminating the need of source-domain data in cross-domain tasks, but existing SFOD methods suffer from the Source Bias problem, i.e. the adapted model remains skewed towards the source domain, leading to poor generalization and error accumulation during self-training. To overcome this challenge, we propose Debiased Source-free Object Detection (DSOD), a novel VFM-assisted SFOD framework that can effectively mitigate source bias with the help of powerful VFMs. Specifically, we propose Unified Feature Injection (UFI) module that integrates VFM features into the CNN backbone through Simple-Scale Extension (SSE) and Domain-aware Adaptive Weighting (DAAW). Then, we propose Semantic-aware Feature Regularization (SAFR) that constrains feature learning to prevent overfitting to source domain characteristics. Furthermore, we propose a VFM-free variant, termed DSOD-distill for computation-restricted scenarios through a novel Dual-Teacher distillation scheme. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that DSOD outperforms state-of-the-art SFOD methods, achieving 48.1% AP on Normal-to-Foggy weather adaptation, 39.3% AP on Cross-scene adaptation, and 61.4% AP on Synthetic-to-Real adaptation.</description>

      <title>Spatial-VLN: Zero-Shot Vision-and-Language Navigation With Explicit Spatial Perception and Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zero-shot Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) agents leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in generalization but suffer from insufficient spatial perception. Focusing on complex continuous environments, we categorize key perceptual bottlenecks into three spatial challenges: door interaction,multi-room navigation, and ambiguous instruction execution, where existing methods consistently suffer high failure rates. We present Spatial-VLN, a perception-guided exploration framework designed to overcome these challenges. The framework consists of two main modules. The Spatial Perception Enhancement (SPE) module integrates panoramic filtering with specialized door and region experts to produce spatially coherent, cross-view consistent perceptual representations. Building on this foundation, our Explored Multi-expert Reasoning (EMR) module uses parallel LLM experts to address waypoint-level semantics and region-level spatial transitions. When discrepancies arise between expert predictions, a query-and-explore mechanism is activated, prompting the agent to actively probe critical areas and resolve perceptual ambiguities. Experiments on VLN-CE demonstrate that Spatial VLN achieves state-of-the-art performance using only low-cost LLMs. Furthermore, to validate real-world applicability, we introduce a value-based waypoint sampling strategy that effectively bridges the Sim2Real gap. Extensive real-world evaluations confirm that our framework delivers superior generalization and robustness in complex environments.

      <title>Delving Deeper: Hierarchical Visual Perception for Robust Video-Text Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video-text retrieval (VTR) aims to locate relevant videos using natural language queries. Current methods, often based on pre-trained models like CLIP, are hindered by video's inherent redundancy and their reliance on coarse, final-layer features, limiting matching accuracy. To address this, we introduce the HVP-Net (Hierarchical Visual Perception Network), a framework that mines richer video semantics by extracting and refining features from multiple intermediate layers of a vision encoder. Our approach progressively distills salient visual concepts from raw patch-tokens at different semantic levels, mitigating redundancy while preserving crucial details for alignment. This results in a more robust video representation, leading to new state-of-the-art performance on challenging benchmarks including MSRVTT, DiDeMo, and ActivityNet. Our work validates the effectiveness of exploiting hierarchical features for advancing video-text retrieval. Our codes are available at https://github.com/boyun-zhang/HVP-Net.</description>

      <title>Generalizable and Animatable 3D Full-Head Gaussian Avatar from a Single Image</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building 3D animatable head avatars from a single image is an important yet challenging problem. Existing methods generally collapse under large camera pose variations, compromising the realism of 3D avatars. In this work, we propose a new framework to tackle the novel setting of one-shot 3D full-head animatable avatar reconstruction in a single feed-forward pass, enabling real-time animation and simultaneous 360$^\circ$ rendering views. To facilitate efficient animation control, we model 3D head avatars with Gaussian primitives embedded on the surface of a parametric face model within the UV space. To obtain knowledge of full-head geometry and textures, we leverage rich 3D full-head priors within a pretrained 3D generative adversarial network (GAN) for global full-head feature extraction and multi-view supervision. To increase the fidelity of the 3D reconstruction of the input image, we take advantage of the symmetric nature of the UV space and human faces to fuse local fine-grained input image features with the global full-head textures. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving high-quality 3D full-head modeling as well as real-time animation, thereby improving the realism of 3D talking avatars.</description>

      <title>Open Vocabulary Panoptic Segmentation With Retrieval Augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given an input image and set of class names, panoptic segmentation aims to label each pixel in an image with class labels and instance labels. In comparison, Open Vocabulary Panoptic Segmentation aims to facilitate the segmentation of arbitrary classes according to user input. The challenge is that a panoptic segmentation system trained on a particular dataset typically does not generalize well to unseen classes beyond the training data. In this work, we propose RetCLIP, a retrieval-augmented panoptic segmentation method that improves the performance of unseen classes. In particular, we construct a masked segment feature database using paired image-text data. At inference time, we use masked segment features from the input image as query keys to retrieve similar features and associated class labels from the database. Classification scores for the masked segment are assigned based on the similarity between query features and retrieved features. The retrieval-based classification scores are combined with CLIP-based scores to produce the final output. We incorporate our solution with a previous SOTA method (FC-CLIP). When trained on COCO, the proposed method demonstrates 30.9 PQ, 19.3 mAP, 44.0 mIoU on the ADE20k dataset, achieving +4.5 PQ, +2.5 mAP, +10.0 mIoU absolute improvement over the baseline.</description>

      <title>SKANet: A Cognitive Dual-Stream Framework with Adaptive Modality Fusion for Robust Compound GNSS Interference Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the electromagnetic environment becomes increasingly complex, Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) face growing threats from sophisticated jamming interference. Although Deep Learning (DL) effectively identifies basic interference, classifying compound interference remains difficult due to the superposition of diverse jamming sources. Existing single-domain approaches often suffer from performance degradation because transient burst signals and continuous global signals require conflicting feature extraction scales. We propose the Selective Kernel and Asymmetric convolution Network(SKANet), a cognitive deep learning framework built upon a dual-stream architecture that integrates Time-Frequency Images (TFIs) and Power Spectral Density (PSD). Distinct from conventional fusion methods that rely on static receptive fields, the proposed architecture incorporates a Multi-Branch Selective Kernel (SK) module combined with Asymmetric Convolution Blocks (ACBs). This mechanism enables the network to dynamically adjust its receptive fields, acting as an adaptive filter that simultaneously captures micro-scale transient features and macro-scale spectral trends within entangled compound signals. To complement this spatial-temporal adaptation, a Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) mechanism is integrated at the fusion stage to adaptively recalibrate the contribution of heterogeneous features from each modality. Evaluations on a dataset of 405,000 samples demonstrate that SKANet achieves an overall accuracy of 96.99\%, exhibiting superior robustness for compound jamming classification, particularly under low Jamming-to-Noise Ratio (JNR) regimes.</description>

      <title>Combating Noisy Labels through Fostering Self- and Neighbor-Consistency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Label noise is pervasive in various real-world scenarios, posing challenges in supervised deep learning. Deep networks are vulnerable to such label-corrupted samples due to the memorization effect. One major stream of previous methods concentrates on identifying clean data for training. However, these methods often neglect imbalances in label noise across different mini-batches and devote insufficient attention to out-of-distribution noisy data. To this end, we propose a noise-robust method named Jo-SNC (\textbf{Jo}int sample selection and model regularization based on \textbf{S}elf- and \textbf{N}eighbor-\textbf{C}onsistency). Specifically, we propose to employ the Jensen-Shannon divergence to measure the ``likelihood'' of a sample being clean or out-of-distribution. This process factors in the nearest neighbors of each sample to reinforce the reliability of clean sample identification. We design a self-adaptive, data-driven thresholding scheme to adjust per-class selection thresholds. While clean samples undergo conventional training, detected in-distribution and out-of-distribution noisy samples are trained following partial label learning and negative learning, respectively. Finally, we advance the model performance further by proposing a triplet consistency regularization that promotes self-prediction consistency, neighbor-prediction consistency, and feature consistency. Extensive experiments on various benchmark datasets and comprehensive ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our approach over existing state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>PhyG-MoE: A Physics-Guided Mixture-of-Experts Framework for Energy-Efficient GNSS Interference Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex electromagnetic interference increasingly compromises Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), threatening the reliability of Space-Air-Ground Integrated Networks (SAGIN). Although deep learning has advanced interference recognition, current static models suffer from a \textbf{fundamental limitation}: they impose a fixed computational topology regardless of the input's physical entropy. This rigidity leads to severe resource mismatch, where simple primitives consume the same processing cost as chaotic, saturated mixtures. To resolve this, this paper introduces PhyG-MoE (Physics-Guided Mixture-of-Experts), a framework designed to \textbf{dynamically align model capacity with signal complexity}. Unlike static architectures, the proposed system employs a spectrum-based gating mechanism that routes signals based on their spectral feature entanglement. A high-capacity TransNeXt expert is activated on-demand to disentangle complex features in saturated scenarios, while lightweight experts handle fundamental signals to minimize latency. Evaluations on 21 jamming categories demonstrate that PhyG-MoE achieves an overall accuracy of 97.58\%. By resolving the intrinsic conflict between static computing and dynamic electromagnetic environments, the proposed framework significantly reduces computational overhead without performance degradation, offering a viable solution for resource-constrained cognitive receivers.</description>

      <title>Left-Right Symmetry Breaking in CLIP-style Vision-Language Models Trained on Synthetic Spatial-Relation Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatial understanding remains a key challenge in vision-language models. Yet it is still unclear whether such understanding is truly acquired, and if so, through what mechanisms. We present a controllable 1D image-text testbed to probe how left-right relational understanding emerges in Transformer-based vision and text encoders trained with a CLIP-style contrastive objective. We train lightweight Transformer-based vision and text encoders end-to-end on paired descriptions of one- and two-object scenes and evaluate generalization to unseen object pairs while systematically varying label and layout diversity. We find that contrastive training learns left-right relations and that label diversity, more than layout diversity, is the primary driver of generalization in this setting. To gain the mechanistic understanding, we perform an attention decomposition and show that interactions between positional and token embeddings induce a horizontal attention gradient that breaks left-right symmetry in the encoders; ablating this contribution substantially reduces left-right discrimination. Our results provide a mechanistic insight of when and how CLIP-style models acquire relational competence.</description>

      <title>CSGaussian: Progressive Rate-Distortion Compression and Segmentation for 3D Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first unified framework for rate-distortion-optimized compression and segmentation of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). While 3DGS has proven effective for both real-time rendering and semantic scene understanding, prior works have largely treated these tasks independently, leaving their joint consideration unexplored. Inspired by recent advances in rate-distortion-optimized 3DGS compression, this work integrates semantic learning into the compression pipeline to support decoder-side applications--such as scene editing and manipulation--that extend beyond traditional scene reconstruction and view synthesis. Our scheme features a lightweight implicit neural representation-based hyperprior, enabling efficient entropy coding of both color and semantic attributes while avoiding costly grid-based hyperprior as seen in many prior works. To facilitate compression and segmentation, we further develop compression-guided segmentation learning, consisting of quantization-aware training to enhance feature separability and a quality-aware weighting mechanism to suppress unreliable Gaussian primitives. Extensive experiments on the LERF and 3D-OVS datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces transmission cost while preserving high rendering quality and strong segmentation performance.</description>

      <title>A Generalist Foundation Model for Total-body PET/CT Enables Diagnostic Reporting and System-wide Metabolic Profiling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Total-body PET/CT enables system-wide molecular imaging, but heterogeneous anatomical and metabolic signals, approximately 2 m axial coverage, and structured radiology semantics challenge existing medical AI models that assume single-modality inputs, localized fields of view, and coarse image-text alignment. We introduce SDF-HOLO (Systemic Dual-stream Fusion Holo Model), a multimodal foundation model for holistic total-body PET/CT, pre-trained on more than 10,000 patients. SDF-HOLO decouples CT and PET representation learning with dual-stream encoders and couples them through a cross-modal interaction module, allowing anatomical context to refine PET aggregation while metabolic saliency guides subtle morphological reasoning. To model long-range dependencies across the body, hierarchical context modeling combines efficient local windows with global attention. To bridge voxels and clinical language, we use anatomical segmentation masks as explicit semantic anchors and perform voxel-mask-text alignment during pre-training. Across tumor segmentation, low-dose lesion detection, and multilingual diagnostic report generation, SDF-HOLO outperforms strong task-specific and clinical-reference baselines while reducing localization errors and hallucinated findings. Beyond focal interpretation, the model enables system-wide metabolic profiling and reveals tumor-associated fingerprints of inter-organ metabolic network interactions, providing a scalable computational foundation for total-body PET/CT diagnostics and system-level precision oncology.</description>

      <title>TreeDGS: Aerial Gaussian Splatting for Distant DBH Measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aerial remote sensing enables efficient large-area surveying, but accurate direct object-level measurement remains difficult in complex natural scenes. Recent advancements in 3D vision, particularly learned radiance-field representations such as NeRF and 3D Gaussian Splatting, have begun to raise the ceiling on reconstruction fidelity and densifiable geometry from posed imagery. Nevertheless, direct aerial measurement of important natural attributes such as tree diameter at breast height (DBH) remains challenging. Trunks in aerial forest scans are distant and sparsely observed in image views: at typical operating altitudes, stems may span only a few pixels. With these constraints, conventional reconstruction methods leave breast-height trunk geometry weakly constrained. We present TreeDGS, an aerial image reconstruction method that leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting as a continuous, densifiable scene representation for trunk measurement. After SfM-MVS initialization and Gaussian optimization, we extract a dense point set from the Gaussian field using RaDe-GS's depth-aware cumulative-opacity integration and associate each sample with a multi-view opacity reliability score. We then estimate DBH from trunk-isolated points using opacity-weighted solid-circle fitting. Evaluated on 10 plots with field-measured DBH, TreeDGS reaches 4.79,cm RMSE (about 2.6 pixels at this GSD) and outperforms a state-of-the-art LiDAR baseline (7.91,cm RMSE), demonstrating that densified splat-based geometry can enable accurate, low-cost aerial DBH measurement.</description>

      <title>Seeing Isn't Always Believing: Analysis of Grad-CAM Faithfulness and Localization Reliability in Lung Cancer CT Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques, such as Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM), have become indispensable for visualizing the reasoning process of deep neural networks in medical image analysis. Despite their popularity, the faithfulness and reliability of these heatmap-based explanations remain under scrutiny. This study critically investigates whether Grad-CAM truly represents the internal decision-making of deep models trained for lung cancer image classification. Using the publicly available IQ-OTH/NCCD dataset, we evaluate five representative architectures: ResNet-50, ResNet-101, DenseNet-161, EfficientNet-B0, and ViT-Base-Patch16-224, to explore model-dependent variations in Grad-CAM interpretability. We introduce a quantitative evaluation framework that combines localization accuracy, perturbation-based faithfulness, and explanation consistency to assess Grad-CAM reliability across architectures. Experimental findings reveal that while Grad-CAM effectively highlights salient tumor regions in most convolutional networks, its interpretive fidelity significantly degrades for Vision Transformer models due to non-local attention behavior. Furthermore, cross-model comparisons indicate substantial variability in saliency localization, implying that Grad-CAM explanations may not always correspond to the true diagnostic evidence used by the networks. This work exposes critical limitations of current saliency-based XAI approaches in medical imaging and emphasizes the need for model-aware interpretability methods that are both computationally sound and clinically meaningful. Our findings aim to inspire a more cautious and rigorous adoption of visual explanation tools in medical AI, urging the community to rethink what it truly means to "trust" a model's explanation.</description>

      <title>FGTBT: Frequency-Guided Task-Balancing Transformer for Unified Facial Landmark Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, deep learning based facial landmark detection (FLD) methods have achieved considerable success. However, in challenging scenarios such as large pose variations, illumination changes, and facial expression variations, they still struggle to accurately capture the geometric structure of the face, resulting in performance degradation. Moreover, the limited size and diversity of existing FLD datasets hinder robust model training, leading to reduced detection accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose a Frequency-Guided Task-Balancing Transformer (FGTBT), which enhances facial structure perception through frequency-domain modeling and multi-dataset unified training. Specifically, we propose a novel Fine-Grained Multi-Task Balancing loss (FMB-loss), which moves beyond coarse task-level balancing by assigning weights to individual landmarks based on their occurrence across datasets. This enables more effective unified training and mitigates the issue of inconsistent gradient magnitudes. Additionally, a Frequency-Guided Structure-Aware (FGSA) model is designed to utilize frequency-guided structure injection and regularization to help learn facial structure constraints. Extensive experimental results on popular benchmark datasets demonstrate that the integration of the proposed FMB-loss and FGSA model into our FGTBT framework achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods.

      <title>Proxy Robustness in Vision Language Models is Effortlessly Transferable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a pivotal technique for improving the defense of deep models, adversarial robustness transfer via distillation has demonstrated remarkable success in conventional image classification tasks. However, this paradigm encounters critical challenges when applied to vision-language models (VLM) (e.g., CLIP): constructing adversarially robust teacher for large-scale multi-modal models demands prohibitively high computational resources. We bridge this gap by revealing an interesting phenomenon: vanilla CLIP (without adversarial training) exhibits intrinsic defensive capabilities against adversarial examples generated by another CLIP with different architectures. We formally define this as proxy adversarial robustness, and naturally propose a Heterogeneous Proxy Transfer (HPT) framework that establishes cross-architectural robustness distillation channels between CLIP variants, effortlessly enabling the VLM robustness transfer from proxy to target models. Yet, such proxy transfer paradigm easily induces severe overfitting, leading to a sharp degradation in zero-shot natural generalization. To resolve that, we design Generalization-Pivot Decoupling (GPD) by leveraging the difference in learning rate scheduling. This decouples the proxy transfer process into a generalization-anchored warm-up that maintains generalization and a generalization-pulled HPT that promotes adversarial robustness, to achieve an equilibrium between natural generalization and adversarial robustness. Extensive experiments on 15 zero-shot datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our HPT-GPD method. The code is available at the website of github.com/fxw13/HPT-GPD.</description>

      <title>Exploring Talking Head Models With Adjacent Frame Prior for Speech-Preserving Facial Expression Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speech-Preserving Facial Expression Manipulation (SPFEM) is an innovative technique aimed at altering facial expressions in images and videos while retaining the original mouth movements. Despite advancements, SPFEM still struggles with accurate lip synchronization due to the complex interplay between facial expressions and mouth shapes. Capitalizing on the advanced capabilities of audio-driven talking head generation (AD-THG) models in synthesizing precise lip movements, our research introduces a novel integration of these models with SPFEM. We present a new framework, Talking Head Facial Expression Manipulation (THFEM), which utilizes AD-THG models to generate frames with accurately synchronized lip movements from audio inputs and SPFEM-altered images. However, increasing the number of frames generated by AD-THG models tends to compromise the realism and expression fidelity of the images. To counter this, we develop an adjacent frame learning strategy that finetunes AD-THG models to predict sequences of consecutive frames. This strategy enables the models to incorporate information from neighboring frames, significantly improving image quality during testing. Our extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that this framework effectively preserves mouth shapes during expression manipulations, highlighting the substantial benefits of integrating AD-THG with SPFEM.</description>

      <title>YOLO26: An Analysis of NMS-Free End to End Framework for Real-Time Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The "You Only Look Once" (YOLO) framework has long served as the benchmark for real-time object detection, yet traditional iterations (YOLOv1 through YOLO11) remain constrained by the latency and hyperparameter sensitivity of Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) post-processing. This paper analyzes a comprehensive analysis of YOLO26, an architecture that fundamentally redefines this paradigm by eliminating NMS in favor of a native end-to-end learning strategy. This study examines the critical innovations that enable this transition, specifically the introduction of the MuSGD optimizer for stabilizing lightweight backbones, STAL for small-target-aware assignment, and ProgLoss for dynamic supervision. Through a systematic review of official performance benchmarks, the results demonstrate that YOLO26 establishes a new Pareto front, outperforming a comprehensive suite of predecessors and state-of-the-art competitors (including RTMDet and DAMO-YOLO) in both inference speed and detection accuracy. The analysis confirms that by decoupling representation learning from heuristic post-processing, YOLOv26 successfully resolves the historical trade-off between latency and precision, signaling the next evolutionary step in edge-based computer vision.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Detection of LSD and FMD in Cattle Using Ensemble Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lumpy Skin Disease (LSD) and Foot-and-Mouth Disease (FMD) are highly contagious viral diseases affecting cattle, causing significant economic losses and welfare challenges. Their visual diagnosis is complicated by significant symptom overlap with each other and with benign conditions like insect bites or chemical burns, hindering timely control measures. Leveraging a comprehensive dataset of 10,516 expert-annotated images from 18 farms across India, Brazil, and the USA, this study presents a novel Ensemble Deep Learning framework integrating VGG16, ResNet50, and InceptionV3 with optimized weighted averaging for simultaneous LSD and FMD detection. The model achieves a state-of-the-art accuracy of 98.2\%, with macro-averaged precision of 98.2\%, recall of 98.1\%, F1-score of 98.1\%, and an AUC-ROC of 99.5\%. This approach uniquely addresses the critical challenge of symptom overlap in multi-disease detection, enabling early, precise, and automated diagnosis. This tool has the potential to enhance disease management, support global agricultural sustainability, and is designed for future deployment in resource-limited settings.</description>

      <title>TwoHead-SwinFPN: A Unified DL Architecture for Synthetic Manipulation, Detection and Localization in Identity Documents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proliferation of sophisticated generative AI models has significantly escalated the threat of synthetic manipulations in identity documents, particularly through face swapping and text inpainting attacks. This paper presents TwoHead-SwinFPN, a unified deep learning architecture that simultaneously performs binary classification and precise localization of manipulated regions in ID documents. Our approach integrates a Swin Transformer backbone with Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) and UNet-style decoder, enhanced with Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) for improved feature representation. The model employs a dual-head architecture for joint optimization of detection and segmentation tasks, utilizing uncertainty-weighted multi-task learning. Extensive experiments on the FantasyIDiap dataset demonstrate superior performance with 84.31\% accuracy, 90.78\% AUC for classification, and 57.24\% mean Dice score for localization. The proposed method achieves an F1-score of 88.61\% for binary classification while maintaining computational efficiency suitable for real-world deployment through FastAPI implementation. Our comprehensive evaluation includes ablation studies, cross-device generalization analysis, and detailed performance assessment across 10 languages and 3 acquisition devices.</description>

      <title>Supervision-by-Hallucination-and-Transfer: A Weakly-Supervised Approach for Robust and Precise Facial Landmark Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-precision facial landmark detection (FLD) relies on high-resolution deep feature representations. However, low-resolution face images or the compression (via pooling or strided convolution) of originally high-resolution images hinder the learning of such features, thereby reducing FLD accuracy. Moreover, insufficient training data and imprecise annotations further degrade performance. To address these challenges, we propose a weakly-supervised framework called Supervision-by-Hallucination-and-Transfer (SHT) for more robust and precise FLD. SHT contains two novel mutually enhanced modules: Dual Hallucination Learning Network (DHLN) and Facial Pose Transfer Network (FPTN). By incorporating FLD and face hallucination tasks, DHLN is able to learn high-resolution representations with low-resolution inputs for recovering both facial structures and local details and generating more effective landmark heatmaps. Then, by transforming faces from one pose to another, FPTN can further improve landmark heatmaps and faces hallucinated by DHLN for detecting more accurate landmarks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to explore weakly-supervised FLD by integrating face hallucination and facial pose transfer tasks. Experimental results of both face hallucination and FLD demonstrate that our method surpasses state-of-the-art techniques.</description>

      <title>Dual-Stream Collaborative Transformer for Image Captioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current region feature-based image captioning methods have progressed rapidly and achieved remarkable performance. However, they are still prone to generating irrelevant descriptions due to the lack of contextual information and the over-reliance on generated partial descriptions for predicting the remaining words. In this paper, we propose a Dual-Stream Collaborative Transformer (DSCT) to address this issue by introducing the segmentation feature. The proposed DSCT consolidates and then fuses the region and segmentation features to guide the generation of caption sentences. It contains multiple Pattern-Specific Mutual Attention Encoders (PSMAEs) and Dynamic Nomination Decoders (DNDs). The PSMAE effectively highlights and consolidates the private information of two representations by querying each other. The DND dynamically searches for the most relevant learning blocks to the input textual representations and exploits the homogeneous features between the consolidated region and segmentation features to generate more accurate and descriptive caption sentences. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to explore how to fuse different pattern-specific features in a dynamic way to bypass their semantic inconsistencies and spatial misalignment issues for image captioning. The experimental results from popular benchmark datasets demonstrate that our DSCT outperforms the state-of-the-art image captioning models in the literature.</description>

      <title>Membership Inference Test: Auditing Training Data in Object Classification Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this research, we analyze the performance of Membership Inference Tests (MINT), focusing on determining whether given data were utilized during the training phase, specifically in the domain of object recognition. Within the area of object recognition, we propose and develop architectures tailored for MINT models. These architectures aim to optimize performance and efficiency in data utilization, offering a tailored solution to tackle the complexities inherent in the object recognition domain. We conducted experiments involving an object detection model, an embedding extractor, and a MINT module. These experiments were performed in three public databases, totaling over 174K images. The proposed architecture leverages convolutional layers to capture and model the activation patterns present in the data during the training process. Through our analysis, we are able to identify given data used for testing and training, achieving precision rates ranging between 70% and 80%, contingent upon the depth of the detection module layer chosen for input to the MINT module. Additionally, our studies entail an analysis of the factors influencing the MINT Module, delving into the contributing elements behind more transparent training processes.</description>

      <title>QASA: Quality-Guided K-Adaptive Slot Attention for Unsupervised Object-Centric Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Slot Attention, an approach that binds different objects in a scene to a set of "slots", has become a leading method in unsupervised object-centric learning. Most methods assume a fixed slot count K, and to better accommodate the dynamic nature of object cardinality, a few works have explored K-adaptive variants. However, existing K-adaptive methods still suffer from two limitations. First, they do not explicitly constrain slot-binding quality, so low-quality slots lead to ambiguous feature attribution. Second, adding a slot-count penalty to the reconstruction objective creates conflicting optimization goals between reducing the number of active slots and maintaining reconstruction fidelity. As a result, they still lag significantly behind strong K-fixed baselines. To address these challenges, we propose Quality-Guided K-Adaptive Slot Attention (QASA). First, we decouple slot selection from reconstruction, eliminating the mutual constraints between the two objectives. Then, we propose an unsupervised Slot-Quality metric to assess per-slot quality, providing a principled signal for fine-grained slot--object binding. Based on this metric, we design a Quality-Guided Slot Selection scheme that dynamically selects a subset of high-quality slots and feeds them into our newly designed gated decoder for reconstruction during training. At inference, token-wise competition on slot attention yields a K-adaptive outcome. Experiments show that QASA substantially outperforms existing K-adaptive methods on both real and synthetic datasets. Moreover, on real-world datasets QASA surpasses K-fixed methods.</description>

      <title>GazeD: Context-Aware Diffusion for Accurate 3D Gaze Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce GazeD, a new 3D gaze estimation method that jointly provides 3D gaze and human pose from a single RGB image. Leveraging the ability of diffusion models to deal with uncertainty, it generates multiple plausible 3D gaze and pose hypotheses based on the 2D context information extracted from the input image. Specifically, we condition the denoising process on the 2D pose, the surroundings of the subject, and the context of the scene. With GazeD we also introduce a novel way of representing the 3D gaze by positioning it as an additional body joint at a fixed distance from the eyes. The rationale is that the gaze is usually closely related to the pose, and thus it can benefit from being jointly denoised during the diffusion process. Evaluations across three benchmark datasets demonstrate that GazeD achieves state-of-the-art performance in 3D gaze estimation, even surpassing methods that rely on temporal information. Project details will be available at https://aimagelab.ing.unimore.it/go/gazed.</description>

      <title>StyMam: A Mamba-Based Generator for Artistic Style Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image style transfer aims to integrate the visual patterns of a specific artistic style into a content image while preserving its content structure. Existing methods mainly rely on the generative adversarial network (GAN) or stable diffusion (SD). GAN-based approaches using CNNs or Transformers struggle to jointly capture local and global dependencies, leading to artifacts and disharmonious patterns. SD-based methods reduce such issues but often fail to preserve content structures and suffer from slow inference. To address these issues, we revisit GAN and propose a mamba-based generator, termed as StyMam, to produce high-quality stylized images without introducing artifacts and disharmonious patterns. Specifically, we introduce a mamba-based generator with a residual dual-path strip scanning mechanism and a channel-reweighted spatial attention module. The former efficiently captures local texture features, while the latter models global dependencies. Finally, extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in both quality and speed.</description>

      <title>Cross-Scale Pretraining: Enhancing Self-Supervised Learning for Low-Resolution Satellite Imagery for Semantic Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-supervised pretraining in remote sensing is mostly done using mid-spatial resolution (MR) image datasets due to their high availability. Given the release of high-resolution (HR) datasets, we ask how HR datasets can be included in self-supervised pretraining to enhance MR image representation learning and downstream segmentation performance on MR tasks. We design a spatial affinity component that can be added to existing self-supervised learning frameworks and that uses HR imagery to learn better representations of MR imagery. We test the spatial affinity component on two self-supervised learning frameworks and show that it outperforms models pretrained on HR or MR images alone.</description>

      <title>Early Prediction of Type 2 Diabetes Using Multimodal data and Tabular Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces a novel approach for early Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) risk prediction using a tabular transformer (TabTrans) architecture to analyze longitudinal patient data. By processing patients` longitudinal health records and bone-related tabular data, our model captures complex, long-range dependencies in disease progression that conventional methods often overlook. We validated our TabTrans model on a retrospective Qatar BioBank (QBB) cohort of 1,382 subjects, comprising 725 men (146 diabetic, 579 healthy) and 657 women (133 diabetic, 524 healthy). The study integrated electronic health records (EHR) with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) data. To address class imbalance, we employed SMOTE and SMOTE-ENN resampling techniques. The proposed model`s performance is evaluated against conventional machine learning (ML) and generative AI models, including Claude 3.5 Sonnet (Anthropic`s constitutional AI), GPT-4 (OpenAI`s generative pre-trained transformer), and Gemini Pro (Google`s multimodal language model). Our TabTrans model demonstrated superior predictive performance, achieving ROC AUC $\geq$ 79.7 % for T2DM prediction compared to both generative AI models and conventional ML approaches. Feature interpretation analysis identified key risk indicators, with visceral adipose tissue (VAT) mass and volume, ward bone mineral density (BMD) and bone mineral content (BMC), T and Z-scores, and L1-L4 scores emerging as the most important predictors associated with diabetes development in Qatari adults. These findings demonstrate the significant potential of TabTrans for analyzing complex tabular healthcare data, providing a powerful tool for proactive T2DM management and personalized clinical interventions in the Qatari population.

      <title>AsyncBEV: Cross-modal Flow Alignment in Asynchronous 3D Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In autonomous driving, multi-modal perception tasks like 3D object detection typically rely on well-synchronized sensors, both at training and inference. However, despite the use of hardware- or software-based synchronization algorithms, perfect synchrony is rarely guaranteed: Sensors may operate at different frequencies, and real-world factors such as network latency, hardware failures, or processing bottlenecks often introduce time offsets between sensors. Such asynchrony degrades perception performance, especially for dynamic objects. To address this challenge, we propose AsyncBEV, a trainable lightweight and generic module to improve the robustness of 3D Birds' Eye View (BEV) object detection models against sensor asynchrony. Inspired by scene flow estimation, AsyncBEV first estimates the 2D flow from the BEV features of two different sensor modalities, taking into account the known time offset between these sensor measurements. The predicted feature flow is then used to warp and spatially align the feature maps, which we show can easily be integrated into different current BEV detector architectures (e.g., BEV grid-based and token-based). Extensive experiments demonstrate AsyncBEV improves robustness against both small and large asynchrony between LiDAR or camera sensors in both the token-based CMT and grid-based UniBEV, especially for dynamic objects. We significantly outperform the ego motion compensated CMT and UniBEV baselines, notably by $16.6$ % and $11.9$ % NDS on dynamic objects in the worst-case scenario of a $0.5 s$ time offset. Code will be released upon acceptance.</description>

      <title>Think3D: Thinking with Space for Spatial Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding and reasoning about the physical world requires spatial intelligence: the ability to interpret geometry, perspective, and spatial relations beyond 2D perception. While recent vision large models (VLMs) excel at visual understanding, they remain fundamentally 2D perceivers and struggle with genuine 3D reasoning. We introduce Think3D, a framework that enables VLM agents to think with 3D space. By leveraging 3D reconstruction models that recover point clouds and camera poses from images or videos, Think3D allows the agent to actively manipulate space through camera-based operations and ego/global-view switching, transforming spatial reasoning into an interactive 3D chain-of-thought process. Without additional training, Think3D significantly improves the spatial reasoning performance of advanced models such as GPT-4.1 and Gemini 2.5 Pro, yielding average gains of +7.8% on BLINK Multi-view and MindCube, and +4.7% on VSI-Bench. We further show that smaller models, which struggle with spatial exploration, benefit significantly from a reinforcement learning policy that enables the model to select informative viewpoints and operations. With RL, the benefit from tool usage increases from +0.7% to +6.8%. Our findings demonstrate that training-free, tool-augmented spatial exploration is a viable path toward more flexible and human-like 3D reasoning in multimodal agents, establishing a new dimension of multimodal intelligence.

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents GridNet-HD, a multi-modal dataset for 3D semantic segmentation of overhead electrical infrastructures, pairing high-density LiDAR with high-resolution oblique imagery. The dataset comprises 7,694 images and 2.5 billion points annotated into 11 classes, with predefined splits and mIoU metrics. Unimodal (LiDAR-only, image-only) and multi-modal fusion baselines are provided. On GridNet-HD, fusion models outperform the best unimodal baseline by +5.55 mIoU, highlighting the complementarity of geometry and appearance. As reviewed in Sec. 2, no public dataset jointly provides high-density LiDAR and high-resolution oblique imagery with 3D semantic labels for power-line assets.

      <title>Prototype Learning-Based Few-Shot Segmentation for Low-Light Crack on Concrete Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Crack detection is critical for concrete infrastructure safety, but real-world cracks often appear in low-light environments like tunnels and bridge undersides, degrading computer vision segmentation accuracy. Pixel-level annotation of low-light crack images is extremely time-consuming, yet most deep learning methods require large, well-illuminated datasets. We propose a dual-branch prototype learning network integrating Retinex theory with few-shot learning for low-light crack segmentation. Retinex-based reflectance components guide illumination-invariant global representation learning, while metric learning reduces dependence on large annotated datasets. We introduce a cross-similarity prior mask generation module that computes high-dimensional similarities between query and support features to capture crack location and structure, and a multi-scale feature enhancement module that fuses multi-scale features with the prior mask to alleviate spatial inconsistency. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate consistent state-of-the-art performance under low-light conditions. Code: https://github.com/YulunGuo/CrackFSS.</description>

      <title>Patient-Conditioned Adaptive Offsets for Reliable Diagnosis across Subgroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI models for medical diagnosis often exhibit uneven performance across patient populations due to heterogeneity in disease prevalence, imaging appearance, and clinical risk profiles. Existing algorithmic fairness approaches typically seek to reduce such disparities by suppressing sensitive attributes. However, in medical settings these attributes often carry essential diagnostic information, and removing them can degrade accuracy and reliability, particularly in high-stakes applications. In contrast, clinical decision making explicitly incorporates patient context when interpreting diagnostic evidence, suggesting a different design direction for subgroup-aware models. In this paper, we introduce HyperAdapt, a patient-conditioned adaptation framework that improves subgroup reliability while maintaining a shared diagnostic model. Clinically relevant attributes such as age and sex are encoded into a compact embedding and used to condition a hypernetwork-style module, which generates small residual modulation parameters for selected layers of a shared backbone. This design preserves the general medical knowledge learned by the backbone while enabling targeted adjustments that reflect patient-specific variability. To ensure efficiency and robustness, adaptations are constrained through low-rank and bottlenecked parameterizations, limiting both model complexity and computational overhead. Experiments across multiple public medical imaging benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed approach consistently improves subgroup-level performance without sacrificing overall accuracy. On the PAD-UFES-20 dataset, our method outperforms the strongest competing baseline by 4.1% in recall and 4.4% in F1 score, with larger gains observed for underrepresented patient populations.</description>

      <title>A Streamlined Attention-Based Network for Descriptor Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce SANDesc, a Streamlined Attention-Based Network for Descriptor extraction that aims to improve on existing architectures for keypoint description.
  Our descriptor network learns to compute descriptors that improve matching without modifying the underlying keypoint detector. We employ a revised U-Net-like architecture enhanced with Convolutional Block Attention Modules and residual paths, enabling effective local representation while maintaining computational efficiency. We refer to the building blocks of our model as Residual U-Net Blocks with Attention. The model is trained using a modified triplet loss in combination with a curriculum learning-inspired hard negative mining strategy, which improves training stability.
  Extensive experiments on HPatches, MegaDepth-1500, and the Image Matching Challenge 2021 show that training SANDesc on top of existing keypoint detectors leads to improved results on multiple matching tasks compared to the original keypoint descriptors. At the same time, SANDesc has a model complexity of just 2.4 million parameters.
  As a further contribution, we introduce a new urban dataset featuring 4K images and pre-calibrated intrinsics, designed to evaluate feature extractors. On this benchmark, SANDesc achieves substantial performance gains over the existing descriptors while operating with limited computational resources.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proliferation of hyper-realistic images from Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) demands robust watermarking, yet existing post-hoc methods are prohibitively slow due to iterative optimization or inversion processes. We introduce PhaseMark, a single-shot, optimization-free framework that directly modulates the phase in the VAE latent frequency domain. This approach makes PhaseMark thousands of times faster than optimization-based techniques while achieving state-of-the-art resilience against severe attacks, including regeneration, without degrading image quality. We analyze four modulation variants, revealing a clear performance-quality trade-off. PhaseMark demonstrates a new paradigm where efficient, resilient watermarking is achieved by exploiting intrinsic latent properties.</description>

      <title>GaussExplorer: 3D Gaussian Splatting for Embodied Exploration and Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present GaussExplorer, a framework for embodied exploration and reasoning built on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). While prior approaches to language-embedded 3DGS have made meaningful progress in aligning simple text queries with Gaussian embeddings, they are generally optimized for relatively simple queries and struggle to interpret more complex, compositional language queries. Alternative studies based on object-centric RGB-D structured memories provide spatial grounding but are constrained by pre-fixed viewpoints. To address these issues, GaussExplorer introduces Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on top of 3DGS to enable question-driven exploration and reasoning within 3D scenes. We first identify pre-captured images that are most correlated with the query question, and subsequently adjust them into novel viewpoints to more accurately capture visual information for better reasoning by VLMs. Experiments show that ours outperforms existing methods on several benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of integrating VLM-based reasoning with 3DGS for embodied tasks.</description>

      <title>CLIP-Guided Adaptable Self-Supervised Learning for Human-Centric Visual Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human-centric visual analysis plays a pivotal role in diverse applications, including surveillance, healthcare, and human-computer interaction. With the emergence of large-scale unlabeled human image datasets, there is an increasing need for a general unsupervised pre-training model capable of supporting diverse human-centric downstream tasks. To achieve this goal, we propose CLASP (CLIP-guided Adaptable Self-suPervised learning), a novel framework designed for unsupervised pre-training in human-centric visual tasks. CLASP leverages the powerful vision-language model CLIP to generate both low-level (e.g., body parts) and high-level (e.g., attributes) semantic pseudo-labels. These multi-level semantic cues are then integrated into the learned visual representations, enriching their expressiveness and generalizability. Recognizing that different downstream tasks demand varying levels of semantic granularity, CLASP incorporates a Prompt-Controlled Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) module. MoE dynamically adapts feature extraction based on task-specific prompts, mitigating potential feature conflicts and enhancing transferability. Furthermore, CLASP employs a multi-task pre-training strategy, where part- and attribute-level pseudo-labels derived from CLIP guide the representation learning process. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that CLASP consistently outperforms existing unsupervised pre-training methods, advancing the field of human-centric visual analysis.</description>

      <title>TVWorld: Foundations for Remote-Control TV Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated strong potential for device control. However, existing research has primarily focused on point-and-click (PnC) interaction, while remote-control (RC) interaction commonly encountered in everyday TV usage remains largely underexplored. To fill this gap, we introduce \textbf{TVWorld}, an offline graph-based abstraction of real-world TV navigation that enables reproducible and deployment-free evaluation. On this basis, we derive two complementary benchmarks that comprehensively assess TV-use capabilities: \textbf{TVWorld-N} for topology-aware navigation and \textbf{TVWorld-G} for focus-aware grounding. These benchmarks expose a key limitation of existing agents: insufficient topology awareness for focus-based, long-horizon TV navigation. Motivated by this finding, we propose a \emph{Topology-Aware Training} framework that injects topology awareness into LVLMs. Using this framework, we develop \textbf{TVTheseus}, a foundation model specialized for TV navigation. TVTheseus achieves a success rate of $68.3\%$ on TVWorld-N, surpassing strong closed-source baselines such as Gemini 3 Flash and establishing state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. Additional analyses further provide valuable insights into the development of effective TV-use agents.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents Interactive Conversational 3D Virtual Human (ICo3D), a method for generating an interactive, conversational, and photorealistic 3D human avatar. Based on multi-view captures of a subject, we create an animatable 3D face model and a dynamic 3D body model, both rendered by splatting Gaussian primitives. Once merged together, they represent a lifelike virtual human avatar suitable for real-time user interactions. We equip our avatar with an LLM for conversational ability. During conversation, the audio speech of the avatar is used as a driving signal to animate the face model, enabling precise synchronization. We describe improvements to our dynamic Gaussian models that enhance photorealism: SWinGS++ for body reconstruction and HeadGaS++ for face reconstruction, and provide as well a solution to merge the separate face and body models without artifacts. We also present a demo of the complete system, showcasing several use cases of real-time conversation with the 3D avatar. Our approach offers a fully integrated virtual avatar experience, supporting both oral and written form interactions in immersive environments. ICo3D is applicable to a wide range of fields, including gaming, virtual assistance, and personalized education, among others. Project page: https://ico3d.github.io/</description>

      <title>From 100,000+ images to winning the first brain MRI foundation model challenges: Sharing lessons and models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developing Foundation Models for medical image analysis is essential to overcome the unique challenges of radiological tasks. The first challenges of this kind for 3D brain MRI, SSL3D and FOMO25, were held at MICCAI 2025. Our solution ranked first in tracks of both contests. It relies on a U-Net CNN architecture combined with strategies leveraging anatomical priors and neuroimaging domain knowledge. Notably, our models trained 1-2 orders of magnitude faster and were 10 times smaller than competing transformer-based approaches. Models are available here: https://github.com/jbanusco/BrainFM4Challenges.</description>

      <title>GTPred: Benchmarking MLLMs for Interpretable Geo-localization and Time-of-capture Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geo-localization aims to infer the geographic location where an image was captured using observable visual evidence. Traditional methods achieve impressive results through large-scale training on massive image corpora. With the emergence of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs), recent studies have explored their applications in geo-localization, benefiting from improved accuracy and interpretability. However, existing benchmarks largely ignore the temporal information inherent in images, which can further constrain the location. To bridge this gap, we introduce GTPred, a novel benchmark for geo-temporal prediction. GTPred comprises 370 globally distributed images spanning over 120 years. We evaluate MLLM predictions by jointly considering year and hierarchical location sequence matching, and further assess intermediate reasoning chains using meticulously annotated ground-truth reasoning processes. Experiments on 8 proprietary and 7 open-source MLLMs show that, despite strong visual perception, current models remain limited in world knowledge and geo-temporal reasoning. Results also demonstrate that incorporating temporal information significantly enhances location inference performance.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Skip Connections: Additive U-Net for Robust and Interpretable Denoising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Skip connections are central to U-Net architectures for image denoising, but standard concatenation doubles channel dimensionality and obscures information flow, allowing uncontrolled noise transfer. We propose the Additive U-Net, which replaces concatenative skips with gated additive connections. Each skip pathway is scaled by a learnable non-negative scalar, offering explicit and interpretable control over encoder contributions while avoiding channel inflation. Evaluations on the Kodak-17 denoising benchmark show that Additive U-Net achieves competitive PSNR/SSIM at noise levels {\sigma} = 15, 25, 50, with robustness across kernel schedules and depths. Notably, effective denoising is achieved even without explicit down/up-sampling or forced hierarchies, as the model naturally learns a progression from high-frequency to band-pass to low-frequency features. These results position additive skips as a lightweight and interpretable alternative to concatenation, enabling both efficient design and a clearer understanding of multi-scale information transfer in reconstruction networks.</description>

      <title>ObjectVisA-120: Object-based Visual Attention Prediction in Interactive Street-crossing Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The object-based nature of human visual attention is well-known in cognitive science, but has only played a minor role in computational visual attention models so far. This is mainly due to a lack of suitable datasets and evaluation metrics for object-based attention. To address these limitations, we present \dataset~ -- a novel 120-participant dataset of spatial street-crossing navigation in virtual reality specifically geared to object-based attention evaluations. The uniqueness of the presented dataset lies in the ethical and safety affiliated challenges that make collecting comparable data in real-world environments highly difficult. \dataset~ not only features accurate gaze data and a complete state-space representation of objects in the virtual environment, but it also offers variable scenario complexities and rich annotations, including panoptic segmentation, depth information, and vehicle keypoints. We further propose object-based similarity (oSIM) as a novel metric to evaluate the performance of object-based visual attention models, a previously unexplored performance characteristic. Our evaluations show that explicitly optimising for object-based attention not only improves oSIM performance but also leads to an improved model performance on common metrics. In addition, we present SUMGraph, a Mamba U-Net-based model, which explicitly encodes critical scene objects (vehicles) in a graph representation, leading to further performance improvements over several state-of-the-art visual attention prediction methods. The dataset, code and models will be publicly released.</description>

      <title>Not all Blends are Equal: The BLEMORE Dataset of Blended Emotion Expressions with Relative Salience Annotations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Humans often experience not just a single basic emotion at a time, but rather a blend of several emotions with varying salience. Despite the importance of such blended emotions, most video-based emotion recognition approaches are designed to recognize single emotions only. The few approaches that have attempted to recognize blended emotions typically cannot assess the relative salience of the emotions within a blend. This limitation largely stems from the lack of datasets containing a substantial number of blended emotion samples annotated with relative salience. To address this shortcoming, we introduce BLEMORE, a novel dataset for multimodal (video, audio) blended emotion recognition that includes information on the relative salience of each emotion within a blend. BLEMORE comprises over 3,000 clips from 58 actors, performing 6 basic emotions and 10 distinct blends, where each blend has 3 different salience configurations (50/50, 70/30, and 30/70). Using this dataset, we conduct extensive evaluations of state-of-the-art video classification approaches on two blended emotion prediction tasks: (1) predicting the presence of emotions in a given sample, and (2) predicting the relative salience of emotions in a blend. Our results show that unimodal classifiers achieve up to 29% presence accuracy and 13% salience accuracy on the validation set, while multimodal methods yield clear improvements, with ImageBind + WavLM reaching 35% presence accuracy and HiCMAE 18% salience accuracy. On the held-out test set, the best models achieve 33% presence accuracy (VideoMAEv2 + HuBERT) and 18% salience accuracy (HiCMAE). In sum, the BLEMORE dataset provides a valuable resource to advancing research on emotion recognition systems that account for the complexity and significance of blended emotion expressions.</description>

      <title>ConvMambaNet: A Hybrid CNN-Mamba State Space Architecture for Accurate and Real-Time EEG Seizure Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Epilepsy is a chronic neurological disorder marked by recurrent seizures that can severely impact quality of life. Electroencephalography (EEG) remains the primary tool for monitoring neural activity and detecting seizures, yet automated analysis remains challenging due to the temporal complexity of EEG signals. This study introduces ConvMambaNet, a hybrid deep learning model that integrates Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with the Mamba Structured State Space Model (SSM) to enhance temporal feature extraction. By embedding the Mamba-SSM block within a CNN framework, the model effectively captures both spatial and long-range temporal dynamics. Evaluated on the CHB-MIT Scalp EEG dataset, ConvMambaNet achieved a 99% accuracy and demonstrated robust performance under severe class imbalance. These results underscore the model's potential for precise and efficient seizure detection, offering a viable path toward real-time, automated epilepsy monitoring in clinical environments.</description>

      <title>A Semantic Decoupling-Based Two-Stage Rainy-Day Attack for Revealing Weather Robustness Deficiencies in Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are trained on image-text pairs collected under canonical visual conditions and achieve strong performance on multimodal tasks. However, their robustness to real-world weather conditions, and the stability of cross-modal semantic alignment under such structured perturbations, remain insufficiently studied. In this paper, we focus on rainy scenarios and introduce the first adversarial framework that exploits realistic weather to attack VLMs, using a two-stage, parameterized perturbation model based on semantic decoupling to analyze rain-induced shifts in decision-making. In Stage 1, we model the global effects of rainfall by applying a low-dimensional global modulation to condition the embedding space and gradually weaken the original semantic decision boundaries. In Stage 2, we introduce structured rain variations by explicitly modeling multi-scale raindrop appearance and rainfall-induced illumination changes, and optimize the resulting non-differentiable weather space to induce stable semantic shifts. Operating in a non-pixel parameter space, our framework generates perturbations that are both physically grounded and interpretable. Experiments across multiple tasks show that even physically plausible, highly constrained weather perturbations can induce substantial semantic misalignment in mainstream VLMs, posing potential safety and reliability risks in real-world deployment. Ablations further confirm that illumination modeling and multi-scale raindrop structures are key drivers of these semantic shifts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developing cost-efficient and reliable perception systems remains a central challenge for automated vehicles. LiDAR and camera-based systems dominate, yet they present trade-offs in cost, robustness and performance under adverse conditions. This work introduces a novel framework for learning-based 3D semantic segmentation using Calyo Pulse, a modular, solid-state 3D ultrasound sensor system for use in harsh and cluttered environments. A 3D U-Net architecture is introduced and trained on the spatial ultrasound data for volumetric segmentation. Results demonstrate robust segmentation performance from Calyo Pulse sensors, with potential for further improvement through larger datasets, refined ground truth, and weighted loss functions. Importantly, this study highlights 3D ultrasound sensing as a promising complementary modality for reliable autonomy.</description>

Abstract: We propose Enginuity - the first open, large-scale, multi-domain engineering diagram dataset with comprehensive structural annotations designed for automated diagram parsing. By capturing hierarchical component relationships, connections, and semantic elements across diverse engineering domains, our proposed dataset would enable multimodal large language models to address critical downstream tasks including structured diagram parsing, cross-modal information retrieval, and AI-assisted engineering simulation. Enginuity would be transformative for AI for Scientific Discovery by enabling artificial intelligence systems to comprehend and manipulate the visual-structural knowledge embedded in engineering diagrams, breaking down a fundamental barrier that currently prevents AI from fully participating in scientific workflows where diagram interpretation, technical drawing analysis, and visual reasoning are essential for hypothesis generation, experimental design, and discovery.</description>

      <title>CausalSpatial: A Benchmark for Object-Centric Causal Spatial Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Humans can look at a static scene and instantly predict what happens next -- will moving this object cause a collision? We call this ability Causal Spatial Reasoning. However, current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) cannot do this, as they remain largely restricted to static spatial perception, struggling to answer "what-if" questions in a 3D scene. We introduce CausalSpatial, a diagnostic benchmark evaluating whether models can anticipate consequences of object motions across four tasks: Collision, Compatibility, Occlusion, and Trajectory. Results expose a severe gap: humans score 84% while GPT-5 achieves only 54%. Why do MLLMs fail? Our analysis uncovers a fundamental deficiency: models over-rely on textual chain-of-thought reasoning that drifts from visual evidence, producing fluent but spatially ungrounded hallucinations. To address this, we propose the Causal Object World model (COW), a framework that externalizes the simulation process by generating videos of hypothetical dynamics. With explicit visual cues of causality, COW enables models to ground their reasoning in physical reality rather than linguistic priors. We make the dataset and code publicly available here: https://github.com/CausalSpatial/CausalSpatial</description>

      <title>MultiST: A Cross-Attention-Based Multimodal Model for Spatial Transcriptomic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics (ST) enables transcriptome-wide profiling while preserving the spatial context of tissues, offering unprecedented opportunities to study tissue organization and cell-cell interactions in situ. Despite recent advances, existing methods often lack effective integration of histological morphology with molecular profiles, relying on shallow fusion strategies or omitting tissue images altogether, which limits their ability to resolve ambiguous spatial domain boundaries. To address this challenge, we propose MultiST, a unified multimodal framework that jointly models spatial topology, gene expression, and tissue morphology through cross-attention-based fusion. MultiST employs graph-based gene encoders with adversarial alignment to learn robust spatial representations, while integrating color-normalized histological features to capture molecular-morphological dependencies and refine domain boundaries. We evaluated the proposed method on 13 diverse ST datasets spanning two organs, including human brain cortex and breast cancer tissue. MultiST yields spatial domains with clearer and more coherent boundaries than existing methods, leading to more stable pseudotime trajectories and more biologically interpretable cell-cell interaction patterns. The MultiST framework and source code are available at https://github.com/LabJunBMI/MultiST.git.</description>

      <title>Real-Time 4D Radar Perception for Robust Human Detection in Harsh Enclosed Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel methodology for generating controlled, multi-level dust concentrations in a highly cluttered environment representative of harsh, enclosed environments, such as underground mines, road tunnels, or collapsed buildings, enabling repeatable mm-wave propagation studies under severe electromagnetic constraints. We also present a new 4D mmWave radar dataset, augmented by camera and LiDAR, illustrating how dust particles and reflective surfaces jointly impact the sensing functionality. To address these challenges, we develop a threshold-based noise filtering framework leveraging key radar parameters (RCS, velocity, azimuth, elevation) to suppress ghost targets and mitigate strong multipath reflections at the raw data level. Building on the filtered point clouds, a cluster-level, rule-based classification pipeline exploits radar semantics-velocity, RCS, and volumetric spread-to achieve reliable, real-time pedestrian detection without extensive domainspecific training. Experimental results confirm that this integrated approach significantly enhances clutter mitigation, detection robustness, and overall system resilience in dust-laden mining environments.</description>

      <title>Spherical Geometry Diffusion: Generating High-quality 3D Face Geometry via Sphere-anchored Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fundamental challenge in text-to-3D face generation is achieving high-quality geometry. The core difficulty lies in the arbitrary and intricate distribution of vertices in 3D space, making it challenging for existing models to establish clean connectivity and resulting in suboptimal geometry. To address this, our core insight is to simplify the underlying geometric structure by constraining the distribution onto a simple and regular manifold, a topological sphere. Building on this, we first propose the Spherical Geometry Representation, a novel face representation that anchors geometric signals to uniform spherical coordinates. This guarantees a regular point distribution, from which the mesh connectivity can be robustly reconstructed. Critically, this canonical sphere can be seamlessly unwrapped into a 2D map, creating a perfect synergy with powerful 2D generative models. We then introduce Spherical Geometry Diffusion, a conditional diffusion framework built upon this 2D map. It enables diverse and controllable generation by jointly modeling geometry and texture, where the geometry explicitly conditions the texture synthesis process. Our method's effectiveness is demonstrated through its success in a wide range of tasks: text-to-3D generation, face reconstruction, and text-based 3D editing. Extensive experiments show that our approach substantially outperforms existing methods in geometric quality, textual fidelity, and inference efficiency.</description>

      <title>A Lightweight Model-Driven 4D Radar Framework for Pervasive Human Detection in Harsh Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pervasive sensing in industrial and underground environments is severely constrained by airborne dust, smoke, confined geometry, and metallic structures, which rapidly degrade optical and LiDAR based perception. Elevation resolved 4D mmWave radar offers strong resilience to such conditions, yet there remains a limited understanding of how to process its sparse and anisotropic point clouds for reliable human detection in enclosed, visibility degraded spaces. This paper presents a fully model-driven 4D radar perception framework designed for real-time execution on embedded edge hardware. The system uses radar as its sole perception modality and integrates domain aware multi threshold filtering, ego motion compensated temporal accumulation, KD tree Euclidean clustering with Doppler aware refinement, and a rule based 3D classifier. The framework is evaluated in a dust filled enclosed trailer and in real underground mining tunnels, and in the tested scenarios the radar based detector maintains stable pedestrian identification as camera and LiDAR modalities fail under severe visibility degradation. These results suggest that the proposed model-driven approach provides robust, interpretable, and computationally efficient perception for safety-critical applications in harsh industrial and subterranean environments.</description>

      <title>Practical Insights into Semi-Supervised Object Detection Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning in data-scarce settings has recently gained significant attention in the research community. Semi-supervised object detection(SSOD) aims to improve detection performance by leveraging a large number of unlabeled images alongside a limited number of labeled images(a.k.a.,few-shot learning). In this paper, we present a comprehensive comparison of three state-of-the-art SSOD approaches, including MixPL, Semi-DETR and Consistent-Teacher, with the goal of understanding how performance varies with the number of labeled images. We conduct experiments using the MS-COCO and Pascal VOC datasets, two popular object detection benchmarks which allow for standardized evaluation. In addition, we evaluate the SSOD approaches on a custom Beetle dataset which enables us to gain insights into their performance on specialized datasets with a smaller number of object categories. Our findings highlight the trade-offs between accuracy, model size, and latency, providing insights into which methods are best suited for low-data regimes.</description>

      <title>Organ-Aware Attention Improves CT Triage and Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is an urgent need for triage and classification of high-volume medical imaging modalities such as computed tomography (CT), which can improve patient care and mitigate radiologist burnout. Study-level CT triage requires calibrated predictions with localized evidence; however, off-the-shelf Vision Language Models (VLM) struggle with 3D anatomy, protocol shifts, and noisy report supervision. This study used the two largest publicly available chest CT datasets: CT-RATE and RADCHEST-CT (held-out external test set). Our carefully tuned supervised baseline (instantiated as a simple Global Average Pooling head) establishes a new supervised state of the art, surpassing all reported linear-probe VLMs. Building on this baseline, we present ORACLE-CT, an encoder-agnostic, organ-aware head that pairs Organ-Masked Attention (mask-restricted, per-organ pooling that yields spatial evidence) with Organ-Scalar Fusion (lightweight fusion of normalized volume and mean-HU cues). In the chest setting, ORACLE-CT masked attention model achieves AUROC 0.86 on CT-RATE; in the abdomen setting, on MERLIN (30 findings), our supervised baseline exceeds a reproduced zero-shot VLM baseline obtained by running publicly released weights through our pipeline, and adding masked attention plus scalar fusion further improves performance to AUROC 0.85. Together, these results deliver state-of-the-art supervised classification performance across both chest and abdomen CT under a unified evaluation protocol.

      <title>Leveraging Transformer Decoder for Automotive Radar Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a Transformer-based architecture for 3D radar object detection that uses a novel Transformer Decoder as the prediction head to directly regress 3D bounding boxes and class scores from radar feature representations. To bridge multi-scale radar features and the decoder, we propose Pyramid Token Fusion (PTF), a lightweight module that converts a feature pyramid into a unified, scale-aware token sequence. By formulating detection as a set prediction problem with learnable object queries and positional encodings, our design models long-range spatial-temporal correlations and cross-feature interactions. This approach eliminates dense proposal generation and heuristic post-processing such as extensive non-maximum suppression (NMS) tuning. We evaluate the proposed framework on the RADDet, where it achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art radar-only baselines.</description>

      <title>Deep Image Prior with L0 Gradient Regularizer for Image Smoothing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image smoothing is a fundamental image processing operation that preserves the underlying structure, such as strong edges and contours, and removes minor details and textures in an image. Many image smoothing algorithms rely on computing local window statistics or solving an optimization problem. Recent state-of-the-art methods leverage deep learning, but they require a carefully curated training dataset. Because constructing a proper training dataset for image smoothing is challenging, we propose DIP-$\ell_0$, a deep image prior framework that incorporates the $\ell_0$ gradient regularizer. This framework can perform high-quality image smoothing without any training data. To properly minimize the associated loss function that has the nonconvex, nonsmooth $\ell_0$ ``norm", we develop an alternating direction method of multipliers algorithm that utilizes an off-the-shelf $\ell_0$ gradient minimization solver. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed DIP-$\ell_0$ outperforms many image smoothing algorithms in edge-preserving image smoothing and JPEG artifact removal.</description>

      <title>Reasoning with Pixel-level Precision: QVLM Architecture and SQuID Dataset for Quantitative Geospatial Analytics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current Vision-Language Models (VLMs) fail at quantitative spatial reasoning because their architectures destroy pixel-level information required for counting and measurements. Vision encoders compress images through patch embeddings, reducing spatial indexing and losing the precise pixel-level tracking required for accurate counting. We present two contributions to address this fundamental limitation. First, we introduce SQuID (Satellite Quantitative Intelligence Dataset), a benchmark of 2,000 satellite image Question-Answer pairs with both numerical range and categorical answers, designed to evaluate quantitative spatial reasoning. The dataset spans three difficulty tiers with annotations automatically generated from human labels and their learned variability. Second, we propose QVLM (Quantitative Vision-Language Model), a code-generation architecture that maintains pixel precision by decoupling language understanding from visual analysis. Instead of encoding images into embeddings, QVLM generates executable code that first calls a segmentation model to obtain pixel-level masks, then operates directly on these masks, preserving spatial indexing throughout the reasoning process. Our experiments show that QVLM using GPT-5 as coder achieves 42.0% accuracy on SQuID compared to 28.1% for a VLM prompted with image-question pairs. Our work reveals that, for quantitative spatial reasoning, architectural decoupling enables better accuracy on quantitative tasks.</description>

      <title>Local-to-Global Logical Explanations for Deep Vision Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While deep neural networks are extremely effective at classifying images, they remain opaque and hard to interpret. We introduce local and global explanation methods for black-box models that generate explanations in terms of human-recognizable primitive concepts. Both the local explanations for a single image and the global explanations for a set of images are cast as logical formulas in monotone disjunctive-normal-form (MDNF), whose satisfaction guarantees that the model yields a high score on a given class. We also present an algorithm for explaining the classification of examples into multiple classes in the form of a monotone explanation list over primitive concepts. Despite their simplicity and interpretability we show that the explanations maintain high fidelity and coverage with respect to the blackbox models they seek to explain in challenging vision datasets.</description>

      <title>Using deep learning for predicting cleansing quality of colon capsule endoscopy images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we explore the application of deep learning techniques for predicting cleansing quality in colon capsule endoscopy (CCE) images. Using a dataset of 500 images labeled by 14 clinicians on the Leighton-Rex scale (Poor, Fair, Good, and Excellent), a ResNet-18 model was trained for classification, leveraging stratified K-fold cross-validation to ensure robust performance. To optimize the model, structured pruning techniques were applied iteratively, achieving significant sparsity while maintaining high accuracy. Explainability of the pruned model was evaluated using Grad-CAM, Grad-CAM++, Eigen-CAM, Ablation-CAM, and Random-CAM, with the ROAD method employed for consistent evaluation. Our results indicate that for a pruned model, we can achieve a cross-validation accuracy of 88% with 79% sparsity, demonstrating the effectiveness of pruning in improving efficiency from 84% without compromising performance. We also highlight the challenges of evaluating cleansing quality of CCE images, emphasize the importance of explainability in clinical applications, and discuss the challenges associated with using the ROAD method for our task. Finally, we employ a variant of adaptive temperature scaling to calibrate the pruned models for an external dataset.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Representations for Fine-Grained Image Classification: A Marine Plankton Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as state-of-the-art generative methods for image synthesis, yet their potential as general-purpose feature encoders remains underexplored. Trained for denoising and generation without labels, they can be interpreted as self-supervised learners that capture both low- and high-level structure. We show that a frozen diffusion backbone enables strong fine-grained recognition by probing intermediate denoising features across layers and timesteps and training a linear classifier for each pair. We evaluate this in a real-world plankton-monitoring setting with practical impact, using controlled and comparable training setups against established supervised and self-supervised baselines. Frozen diffusion features are competitive with supervised baselines and outperform other self-supervised methods in both balanced and naturally long-tailed settings. Out-of-distribution evaluations on temporally and geographically shifted plankton datasets further show that frozen diffusion features maintain strong accuracy and Macro F1 under substantial distribution shift.</description>

      <title>SGW-GAN: Sliced Gromov-Wasserstein Guided GANs for Retinal Fundus Image Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retinal fundus photography is indispensable for ophthalmic screening and diagnosis, yet image quality is often degraded by noise, artifacts, and uneven illumination. Recent GAN- and diffusion-based enhancement methods improve perceptual quality by aligning degraded images with high-quality distributions, but our analysis shows that this focus can distort intra-class geometry: clinically related samples become dispersed, disease-class boundaries blur, and downstream tasks such as grading or lesion detection are harmed. The Gromov Wasserstein (GW) discrepancy offers a principled solution by aligning distributions through internal pairwise distances, naturally preserving intra-class structure, but its high computational cost restricts practical use. To overcome this, we propose SGW-GAN, the first framework to incorporate Sliced GW (SGW) into retinal image enhancement. SGW approximates GW via random projections, retaining relational fidelity while greatly reducing cost. Experiments on public datasets show that SGW-GAN produces visually compelling enhancements, achieves superior diabetic retinopathy grading, and reports the lowest GW discrepancy across disease labels, demonstrating both efficiency and clinical fidelity for unpaired medical image enhancement.</description>

      <title>Analyzing VLM-Based Approaches for Anomaly Classification and Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs), particularly CLIP, have revolutionized anomaly detection by enabling zero-shot and few-shot defect identification without extensive labeled datasets. By learning aligned representations of images and text, VLMs facilitate anomaly classification and segmentation through natural language descriptions of normal and abnormal states, eliminating traditional requirements for task-specific training or defect examples. This project presents a comprehensive analysis of VLM-based approaches for anomaly classification (AC) and anomaly segmentation (AS). We systematically investigate key architectural paradigms including sliding window-based dense feature extraction (WinCLIP), multi-stage feature alignment with learnable projections (AprilLab framework), and compositional prompt ensemble strategies. Our analysis evaluates these methods across critical dimensions: feature extraction mechanisms, text-visual alignment strategies, prompt engineering techniques, zero-shot versus few-shot trade-offs, computational efficiency, and cross-domain generalization. Through rigorous experimentation on benchmarks such as MVTec AD and VisA, we compare classification accuracy, segmentation precision, and inference efficiency. The primary contribution is a foundational understanding of how and why VLMs succeed in anomaly detection, synthesizing practical insights for method selection and identifying current limitations. This work aims to facilitate informed adoption of VLM-based methods in industrial quality control and guide future research directions.</description>

      <title>Optical Linear Systems Framework for Event Sensing and Computational Neuromorphic Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Event vision sensors (neuromorphic cameras) output sparse, asynchronous ON/OFF events triggered by log-intensity threshold crossings, enabling microsecond-scale sensing with high dynamic range and low data bandwidth. As a nonlinear system, this event representation does not readily integrate with the linear forward models that underpin most computational imaging and optical system design. We present a physics-grounded processing pipeline that maps event streams to estimates of per-pixel log-intensity and intensity derivatives, and embeds these measurements in a dynamic linear systems model with a time-varying point spread function. This enables inverse filtering directly from event data, using frequency-domain Wiener deconvolution with a known (or parameterised) dynamic transfer function. We validate the approach in simulation for single and overlapping point sources under modulated defocus, and on real event data from a tunable-focus telescope imaging a star field, demonstrating source localisation and separability. The proposed framework provides a practical bridge between event sensing and model-based computational imaging for dynamic optical systems.</description>

      <title>DIS2: Disentanglement Meets Distillation with Classwise Attention for Robust Remote Sensing Segmentation under Missing Modalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The efficacy of multimodal learning in remote sensing (RS) is severely undermined by missing modalities. The challenge is exacerbated by the RS highly heterogeneous data and huge scale variation. Consequently, paradigms proven effective in other domains often fail when confronted with these unique data characteristics. Conventional disentanglement learning, which relies on significant feature overlap between modalities (modality-invariant), is insufficient for this heterogeneity. Similarly, knowledge distillation becomes an ill-posed mimicry task where a student fails to focus on the necessary compensatory knowledge, leaving the semantic gap unaddressed. Our work is therefore built upon three pillars uniquely designed for RS: (1) principled missing information compensation, (2) class-specific modality contribution, and (3) multi-resolution feature importance. We propose a novel method DIS2, a new paradigm shifting from modality-shared feature dependence and untargeted imitation to active, guided missing features compensation. Its core novelty lies in a reformulated synergy between disentanglement learning and knowledge distillation, termed DLKD. Compensatory features are explicitly captured which, when fused with the features of the available modality, approximate the ideal fused representation of the full-modality case. To address the class-specific challenge, our Classwise Feature Learning Module (CFLM) adaptively learn discriminative evidence for each target depending on signal availability. Both DLKD and CFLM are supported by a hierarchical hybrid fusion (HF) structure using features across resolutions to strengthen prediction. Extensive experiments validate that our proposed approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods across benchmarks.</description>

      <title>GO-MLVTON: Garment Occlusion-Aware Multi-Layer Virtual Try-On with Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing Image-based virtual try-on (VTON) methods primarily focus on single-layer or multi-garment VTON, neglecting multi-layer VTON (ML-VTON), which involves dressing multiple layers of garments onto the human body with realistic deformation and layering to generate visually plausible outcomes. The main challenge lies in accurately modeling occlusion relationships between inner and outer garments to reduce interference from redundant inner garment features. To address this, we propose GO-MLVTON, the first multi-layer VTON method, introducing the Garment Occlusion Learning module to learn occlusion relationships and the StableDiffusion-based Garment Morphing &amp; Fitting module to deform and fit garments onto the human body, producing high-quality multi-layer try-on results. Additionally, we present the MLG dataset for this task and propose a new metric named Layered Appearance Coherence Difference (LACD) for evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of GO-MLVTON. Project page: https://upyuyang.github.io/go-mlvton/.</description>

      <title>DiffFace-Edit: A Diffusion-Based Facial Dataset for Forgery-Semantic Driven Deepfake Detection Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative models now produce imperceptible, fine-grained manipulated faces, posing significant privacy risks. However, existing AI-generated face datasets generally lack focus on samples with fine-grained regional manipulations. Furthermore, no researchers have yet studied the real impact of splice attacks, which occur between real and manipulated samples, on detectors. We refer to these as detector-evasive samples. Based on this, we introduce the DiffFace-Edit dataset, which has the following advantages: 1) It contains over two million AI-generated fake images. 2) It features edits across eight facial regions (e.g., eyes, nose) and includes a richer variety of editing combinations, such as single-region and multi-region edits. Additionally, we specifically analyze the impact of detector-evasive samples on detection models. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of the dataset and propose a cross-domain evaluation that combines IMDL methods. Dataset will be available at https://github.com/ywh1093/DiffFace-Edit.</description>

      <title>Learning Fine-Grained Correspondence with Cross-Perspective Perception for Open-Vocabulary 6D Object Pose Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open-vocabulary 6D object pose estimation empowers robots to manipulate arbitrary unseen objects guided solely by natural language. However, a critical limitation of existing approaches is their reliance on unconstrained global matching strategies. In open-world scenarios, trying to match anchor features against the entire query image space introduces excessive ambiguity, as target features are easily confused with background distractors. To resolve this, we propose Fine-grained Correspondence Pose Estimation (FiCoP), a framework that transitions from noise-prone global matching to spatially-constrained patch-level correspondence. Our core innovation lies in leveraging a patch-to-patch correlation matrix as a structural prior to narrowing the matching scope, effectively filtering out irrelevant clutter to prevent it from degrading pose estimation. Firstly, we introduce an object-centric disentanglement preprocessing to isolate the semantic target from environmental noise. Secondly, a Cross-Perspective Global Perception (CPGP) module is proposed to fuse dual-view features, establishing structural consensus through explicit context reasoning. Finally, we design a Patch Correlation Predictor (PCP) that generates a precise block-wise association map, acting as a spatial filter to enforce fine-grained, noise-resilient matching. Experiments on the REAL275 and Toyota-Light datasets demonstrate that FiCoP improves Average Recall by 8.0% and 6.1%, respectively, compared to the state-of-the-art method, highlighting its capability to deliver robust and generalized perception for robotic agents operating in complex, unconstrained open-world environments.

      <title>ChartVerse: Scaling Chart Reasoning via Reliable Programmatic Synthesis from Scratch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chart reasoning is a critical capability for Vision Language Models (VLMs). However, the development of open-source models is severely hindered by the lack of high-quality training data. Existing datasets suffer from a dual challenge: synthetic charts are often simplistic and repetitive, while the associated QA pairs are prone to hallucinations and lack the reasoning depth required for complex tasks. To bridge this gap, we propose ChartVerse, a scalable framework designed to synthesize complex charts and reliable reasoning data from scratch. (1) To address the bottleneck of simple patterns, we first introduce Rollout Posterior Entropy (RPE), a novel metric that quantifies chart complexity. Guided by RPE, we develop complexity-aware chart coder to autonomously synthesize diverse, high-complexity charts via executable programs. (2) To guarantee reasoning rigor, we develop truth-anchored inverse QA synthesis. Diverging from standard generation, we adopt an answer-first paradigm: we extract deterministic answers directly from the source code, generate questions conditional on these anchors, and enforce strict consistency verification. To further elevate difficulty and reasoning depth, we filter samples based on model fail-rate and distill high-quality Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. We curate ChartVerse-SFT-600K and ChartVerse-RL-40K using Qwen3-VL-30B-A3B-Thinking as the teacher. Experimental results demonstrate that ChartVerse-8B achieves state-of-the-art performance, notably surpassing its teacher and rivaling the stronger Qwen3-VL-32B-Thinking.</description>

      <title>CARPE: Context-Aware Image Representation Prioritization via Ensemble for Large Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have pushed them closer to becoming general-purpose assistants. Despite their strong performance, LVLMs still struggle with vision-centric tasks such as image classification, underperforming compared to their base vision encoders, which are often CLIP-based models. To address this limitation, we propose Context-Aware Image Representation Prioritization via Ensemble (CARPE), a novel, model-agnostic framework which introduces vision-integration layers and a context-aware ensemble strategy to identify when to prioritize image representations or rely on the reasoning capabilities of the language model. This design enhances the model's ability to adaptively weight visual and textual modalities and enables the model to capture various aspects of image representations, leading to consistent improvements in generalization across classification and vision-language benchmarks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CARPE not only improves performance on image classification benchmarks but also enhances results across various vision-language benchmarks. Finally, CARPE is designed to be effectively integrated with most open-source LVLMs that consist of a vision encoder and a language model, ensuring its adaptability across diverse architectures.</description>

      <title>Scaling Test-time Inference for Visual Grounding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visual grounding is an essential capability of Visual Language Models (VLMs) to understand the real physical world. Previous state-of-the-art grounding visual language models usually have large model sizes, making them heavy for deployment and slow for inference. However, we notice that the sizes of visual encoders are nearly the same for small and large VLMs and the major difference is the sizes of the language models. Small VLMs fall behind larger VLMs in grounding because of the difference in language understanding capability rather than visual information handling. To mitigate the gap, we introduce 'Efficient visual Grounding language Models' (EGM): a method to scale the test-time computation (#generated tokens). Scaling the test-time computation of a small model is deployment-friendly, and yields better end-to-end latency as the cost of each token is much cheaper compared to directly running a large model. On the RefCOCO benchmark, our EGM-Qwen3-VL-8B demonstrates 91.4 IoU with an average of 737ms (5.9x faster) latency while Qwen3-VL-235B demands 4,320ms to achieve 90.5 IoU. To validate our approach's generality, we further set up a new amodal grounding setting that requires the model to predict both the visible and occluded parts of the objects. Experiments show our method can consistently and significantly improve the vanilla grounding and amodal grounding capabilities of small models to be on par with or outperform the larger models, thereby improving the efficiency for visual grounding.</description>

      <title>Face-Voice Association with Inductive Bias for Maximum Class Separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Face-voice association is widely studied in multimodal learning and is approached representing faces and voices with embeddings that are close for a same person and well separated from those of others. Previous work achieved this with loss functions. Recent advancements in classification have shown that the discriminative ability of embeddings can be strengthened by imposing maximum class separation as inductive bias. This technique has never been used in the domain of face-voice association, and this work aims at filling this gap. More specifically, we develop a method for face-voice association that imposes maximum class separation among multimodal representations of different speakers as an inductive bias. Through quantitative experiments we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, showing that it achieves SOTA performance on two task formulation of face-voice association. Furthermore, we carry out an ablation study to show that imposing inductive bias is most effective when combined with losses for inter-class orthogonality. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first that applies and demonstrates the effectiveness of maximum class separation as an inductive bias in multimodal learning; it hence paves the way to establish a new paradigm.</description>

      <title>VIAFormer: Voxel-Image Alignment Transformer for High-Fidelity Voxel Refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose VIAFormer, a Voxel-Image Alignment Transformer model designed for Multi-view Conditioned Voxel Refinement--the task of repairing incomplete noisy voxels using calibrated multi-view images as guidance. Its effectiveness stems from a synergistic design: an Image Index that provides explicit 3D spatial grounding for 2D image tokens, a Correctional Flow objective that learns a direct voxel-refinement trajectory, and a Hybrid Stream Transformer that enables robust cross-modal fusion. Experiments show that VIAFormer establishes a new state of the art in correcting both severe synthetic corruptions and realistic artifacts on the voxel shape obtained from powerful Vision Foundation Models. Beyond benchmarking, we demonstrate VIAFormer as a practical and reliable bridge in real-world 3D creation pipelines, paving the way for voxel-based methods to thrive in large-model, big-data wave.</description>

      <title>Transformer based Multi-task Fusion Network for Food Spoilage Detection and Shelf life Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Food wastage is one of the critical challenges in the agricultural supply chain, and accurate and effective spoilage detection can help to reduce it. Further, it is highly important to forecast the spoilage information. This aids the longevity of the supply chain management in the agriculture field. This motivated us to propose fusion based architectures by combining CNN with LSTM and DeiT transformer for the following multi-tasks simultaneously: (i) vegetable classification, (ii) food spoilage detection, and (iii) shelf life forecasting. We developed a dataset by capturing images of vegetables from their fresh state until they were completely spoiled. From the experimental analysis it is concluded that the proposed fusion architectures CNN+CNN-LSTM and CNN+DeiT Transformer outperformed several deep learning models such as CNN, VGG16, ResNet50, Capsule Networks, and DeiT Transformers. Overall, CNN + DeiT Transformer yielded F1-score of 0.98 and 0.61 in vegetable classification and spoilage detection respectively and mean squared error (MSE) and symmetric mean absolute percentage error (SMAPE) of 3.58, and 41.66% respectively in spoilage forecasting. Further, the reliability of the fusion models was validated on noisy images and integrated with LIME to visualize the model decisions.</description>

      <title>Finally Outshining the Random Baseline: A Simple and Effective Solution for Active Learning in 3D Biomedical Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active learning (AL) has the potential to drastically reduce annotation costs in 3D biomedical image segmentation, where expert labeling of volumetric data is both time-consuming and expensive. Yet, existing AL methods are unable to consistently outperform improved random sampling baselines adapted to 3D data, leaving the field without a reliable solution. We introduce Class-stratified Scheduled Power Predictive Entropy (ClaSP PE), a simple and effective query strategy that addresses two key limitations of standard uncertainty-based AL methods: class imbalance and redundancy in early selections. ClaSP PE combines class-stratified querying to ensure coverage of underrepresented structures and log-scale power noising with a decaying schedule to enforce query diversity in early-stage AL and encourage exploitation later. In our evaluation on 24 experimental settings using four 3D biomedical datasets within the comprehensive nnActive benchmark, ClaSP PE is the only method that generally outperforms improved random baselines in terms of both segmentation quality with statistically significant gains, whilst remaining annotation efficient. Furthermore, we explicitly simulate the real-world application by testing our method on four previously unseen datasets without manual adaptation, where all experiment parameters are set according to predefined guidelines. The results confirm that ClaSP PE robustly generalizes to novel tasks without requiring dataset-specific tuning. Within the nnActive framework, we present compelling evidence that an AL method can consistently outperform random baselines adapted to 3D segmentation, in terms of both performance and annotation efficiency in a realistic, close-to-production scenario. Our open-source implementation and clear deployment guidelines make it readily applicable in practice. Code is at https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/nnActive.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Differential Linear Attention: Enhancing Linear Diffusion Transformer for High-Quality Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion transformers (DiTs) have emerged as a powerful architecture for high-fidelity image generation, yet the quadratic cost of self-attention poses a major scalability bottleneck. To address this, linear attention mechanisms have been adopted to reduce computational cost; unfortunately, the resulting linear diffusion transformers (LiTs) models often come at the expense of generative performance, frequently producing over-smoothed attention weights that limit expressiveness. In this work, we introduce Dynamic Differential Linear Attention (DyDiLA), a novel linear attention formulation that enhances the effectiveness of LiTs by mitigating the oversmoothing issue and improving generation quality. Specifically, the novelty of DyDiLA lies in three key designs: (i) dynamic projection module, which facilitates the decoupling of token representations by learning with dynamically assigned knowledge; (ii) dynamic measure kernel, which provides a better similarity measurement to capture fine-grained semantic distinctions between tokens by dynamically assigning kernel functions for token processing; and (iii) token differential operator, which enables more robust query-to-key retrieval by calculating the differences between the tokens and their corresponding information redundancy produced by dynamic measure kernel. To capitalize on DyDiLA, we introduce a refined LiT, termed DyDi-LiT, that systematically incorporates our advancements. Extensive experiments show that DyDi-LiT consistently outperforms current state-of-the-art (SOTA) models across multiple metrics, underscoring its strong practical potential.</description>

      <title>Reasoning or Pattern Matching? Probing Large Vision-Language Models with Visual Puzzles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Puzzles have long served as compact and revealing probes of human cognition, isolating abstraction, rule discovery, and systematic reasoning with minimal reliance on prior knowledge. Leveraging these properties, visual puzzles have recently emerged as a powerful diagnostic tool for evaluating the reasoning abilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), offering controlled, verifiable alternatives to open-ended multimodal benchmarks. This survey provides a unified perspective of visual puzzle reasoning in LVLMs. We frame visual puzzles through a common abstraction and organize existing benchmarks by the reasoning mechanisms they target (inductive, analogical, algorithmic, deductive, and geometric/spatial), thereby linking puzzle design to the cognitive operations required for solving. Synthesizing empirical evidence across these categories, we identify consistent limitations in current models, including brittle generalization, tight entanglement between perception and reasoning, and a persistent gap between fluent explanations and faithful execution. By framing visual puzzles as diagnostic instruments rather than task formats, this survey elaborates on the state of LVLM reasoning and outlines key directions for future benchmarks and reasoning-aware multimodal systems.</description>

      <title>ParkingTwin: Training-Free Streaming 3D Reconstruction for Parking-Lot Digital Twins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-fidelity parking-lot digital twins provide essential priors for path planning, collision checking, and perception validation in Automated Valet Parking (AVP). Yet robot-oriented reconstruction faces a trilemma: sparse forward-facing views cause weak parallax and ill-posed geometry; dynamic occlusions and extreme lighting hinder stable texture fusion; and neural rendering typically needs expensive offline optimization, violating edge-side streaming constraints. We propose ParkingTwin, a training-free, lightweight system for online streaming 3D reconstruction. First, OSM-prior-driven geometric construction uses OpenStreetMap semantic topology to directly generate a metric-consistent TSDF, replacing blind geometric search with deterministic mapping and avoiding costly optimization. Second, geometry-aware dynamic filtering employs a quad-modal constraint field (normal/height/depth consistency) to reject moving vehicles and transient occlusions in real time. Third, illumination-robust fusion in CIELAB decouples luminance and chromaticity via adaptive L-channel weighting and depth-gradient suppression, reducing seams under abrupt lighting changes. ParkingTwin runs at 30+ FPS on an entry-level GTX 1660. On a 68,000 m^2 real-world dataset, it achieves SSIM 0.87 (+16.0%), delivers about 15x end-to-end speedup, and reduces GPU memory by 83.3% compared with state-of-the-art 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) that typically requires high-end GPUs (RTX 4090D). The system outputs explicit triangle meshes compatible with Unity/Unreal digital-twin pipelines. Project page: https://mihoutao-liu.github.io/ParkingTwin/</description>

      <title>Attention-space Contrastive Guidance for Efficient Hallucination Mitigation in LVLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hallucinations in large vision-language models (LVLMs) often arise when language priors dominate over visual evidence, causing object misidentification and visually inconsistent descriptions. We address this issue by framing hallucination mitigation as contrastive guidance, steering generation toward visually grounded and semantically faithful text. This approach regulates the model's internal behavior by reducing over-dependence on language priors and contrasting visually grounded with language-only representations. We propose Attention-space Contrastive Guidance (ACG), a single-pass mechanism that operates within self-attention layers to construct both vision-language and language-only attention paths in a single forward computation. This integration enables computationally efficient guidance directly embedded in the model's representation contextualization. To correct approximation bias introduced by the single-pass formulation, we further apply an orthogonalized correction that removes components aligned with the language-only path, selectively amplifying visual contributions. Experiments on the CHAIR and POPE benchmarks show that ACG achieves state-of-the-art faithfulness and caption quality while significantly reducing computational cost. Our method establishes a principled and efficient alternative, reducing latency by up to 2x compared to prior contrastive decoding methods that require multiple forward passes.</description>

      <title>MVGD-Net: A Novel Motion-aware Video Glass Surface Detection Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Glass surface ubiquitous in both daily life and professional environments presents a potential threat to vision-based systems, such as robot and drone navigation. To solve this challenge, most recent studies have shown significant interest in Video Glass Surface Detection (VGSD). We observe that objects in the reflection (or transmission) layer appear farther from the glass surfaces. Consequently, in video motion scenarios, the notable reflected (or transmitted) objects on the glass surface move slower than objects in non-glass regions within the same spatial plane, and this motion inconsistency can effectively reveal the presence of glass surfaces. Based on this observation, we propose a novel network, named MVGD-Net, for detecting glass surfaces in videos by leveraging motion inconsistency cues. Our MVGD-Net features three novel modules: the Cross-scale Multimodal Fusion Module (CMFM) that integrates extracted spatial features and estimated optical flow maps, the History Guided Attention Module (HGAM) and Temporal Cross Attention Module (TCAM), both of which further enhances temporal features. A Temporal-Spatial Decoder (TSD) is also introduced to fuse the spatial and temporal features for generating the glass region mask. Furthermore, for learning our network, we also propose a large-scale dataset, which comprises 312 diverse glass scenarios with a total of 19,268 frames. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our MVGD-Net outperforms relevant state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Long Video Understanding with Audiovisual Entity Cohesion and Agentic Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long video understanding presents significant challenges for vision-language models due to extremely long context windows. Existing solutions relying on naive chunking strategies with retrieval-augmented generation, typically suffer from information fragmentation and a loss of global coherence. We present HAVEN, a unified framework for long-video understanding that enables coherent and comprehensive reasoning by integrating audiovisual entity cohesion and hierarchical video indexing with agentic search. First, we preserve semantic consistency by integrating entity-level representations across visual and auditory streams, while organizing content into a structured hierarchy spanning global summary, scene, segment, and entity levels. Then we employ an agentic search mechanism to enable dynamic retrieval and reasoning across these layers, facilitating coherent narrative reconstruction and fine-grained entity tracking. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves good temporal coherence, entity consistency, and retrieval efficiency, establishing a new state-of-the-art with an overall accuracy of 84.1% on LVBench. Notably, it achieves outstanding performance in the challenging reasoning category, reaching 80.1%. These results highlight the effectiveness of structured, multimodal reasoning for comprehensive and context-consistent understanding of long-form videos.</description>

      <title>Facial Spatiotemporal Graphs: Leveraging the 3D Facial Surface for Remote Physiological Measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Facial remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) methods estimate physiological signals by modeling subtle color changes on the 3D facial surface over time. However, existing methods fail to explicitly align their receptive fields with the 3D facial surface-the spatial support of the rPPG signal. To address this, we propose the Facial Spatiotemporal Graph (STGraph), a novel representation that encodes facial color and structure using 3D facial mesh sequences-enabling surface-aligned spatiotemporal processing. We introduce MeshPhys, a lightweight spatiotemporal graph convolutional network that operates on the STGraph to estimate physiological signals. Across four benchmark datasets, MeshPhys achieves state-of-the-art or competitive performance in both intra- and cross-dataset settings. Ablation studies show that constraining the model's receptive field to the facial surface acts as a strong structural prior, and that surface-aligned, 3D-aware node features are critical for robustly encoding facial surface color. Together, the STGraph and MeshPhys constitute a novel, principled modeling paradigm for facial rPPG, enabling robust, interpretable, and generalizable estimation.

      <title>HiT: History-Injection Transformers for Onboard Continuous Flood Change Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Natural disaster monitoring through continuous satellite observation requires processing multi-temporal data under strict operational constraints. This paper addresses flood detection, a critical application for hazard management, by developing an onboard change detection system that operates within the memory and computational limits of small satellites. We propose History Injection mechanism for Transformer models (HiT), that maintains historical context from previous observations while reducing data storage by over 99\% of original image size. Moreover, testing on the STTORM-CD flood dataset confirms that the HiT mechanism within the Prithvi-tiny foundation model maintains detection accuracy compared to the bitemporal baseline. The proposed HiT-Prithvi model achieved 43 FPS on Jetson Orin Nano, a representative onboard hardware used in nanosats. This work establishes a practical framework for satellite-based continuous monitoring of natural disasters, supporting real-time hazard assessment without dependency on ground-based processing infrastructure. Architecture as well as model checkpoints is available at https://github.com/zaitra/HiT-change-detection</description>

      <title>PREGEN: Uncovering Latent Thoughts in Composed Video Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Composed Video Retrieval (CoVR) aims to retrieve a video based on a query video and a modifying text. Current CoVR methods fail to fully exploit modern Vision-Language Models (VLMs), either using outdated architectures or requiring computationally expensive fine-tuning and slow caption generation. We introduce PREGEN (PRE GENeration extraction), an efficient and powerful CoVR framework that overcomes these limitations. Our approach uniquely pairs a frozen, pre-trained VLM with a lightweight encoding model, eliminating the need for any VLM fine-tuning. We feed the query video and modifying text into the VLM and extract the hidden state of the final token from each layer. A simple encoder is then trained on these pooled representations, creating a semantically rich and compact embedding for retrieval. PREGEN significantly advances the state of the art, surpassing all prior methods on standard CoVR benchmarks with substantial gains in Recall@1 of +27.23 and +69.59. Our method demonstrates robustness across different VLM backbones and exhibits strong zero-shot generalization to more complex textual modifications, highlighting its effectiveness and semantic capabilities.</description>

      <title>Insight: Interpretable Semantic Hierarchies in Vision-Language Encoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Language-aligned vision foundation models perform strongly across diverse downstream tasks. Yet, their learned representations remain opaque, making interpreting their decision-making hard. Recent works decompose these representations into human-interpretable concepts, but provide poor spatial grounding and are limited to image classification tasks. In this work, we propose Insight, a language-aligned concept foundation model that provides fine-grained concepts, which are human-interpretable and spatially grounded in the input image. We leverage a hierarchical sparse autoencoder and a foundation model with strong semantic representations to automatically extract concepts at various granularities. Examining local co-occurrence dependencies of concepts allows us to define concept relationships. Through these relations we further improve concept naming and obtain richer explanations. On benchmark data, we show that Insight provides performance on classification and segmentation that is competitive with opaque foundation models while providing fine-grained, high quality concept-based explanations.

      <title>Discriminant Learning-based Colorspace for Blade Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Suboptimal color representation often hinders accurate image segmentation, yet many modern algorithms neglect this critical preprocessing step. This work presents a novel multidimensional nonlinear discriminant analysis algorithm, Colorspace Discriminant Analysis (CSDA), for improved segmentation. Extending Linear Discriminant Analysis into a deep learning context, CSDA customizes color representation by maximizing multidimensional signed inter-class separability while minimizing intra-class variability through a generalized discriminative loss. To ensure stable training, we introduce three alternative losses that enable end-to-end optimization of both the discriminative colorspace and segmentation process. Experiments on wind turbine blade data demonstrate significant accuracy gains, emphasizing the importance of tailored preprocessing in domain-specific segmentation.</description>

      <title>FastGHA: Generalized Few-Shot 3D Gaussian Head Avatars with Real-Time Animation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite recent progress in 3D Gaussian-based head avatar modeling, efficiently generating high fidelity avatars remains a challenge. Current methods typically rely on extensive multi-view capture setups or monocular videos with per-identity optimization during inference, limiting their scalability and ease of use on unseen subjects. To overcome these efficiency drawbacks, we propose \OURS, a feed-forward method to generate high-quality Gaussian head avatars from only a few input images while supporting real-time animation. Our approach directly learns a per-pixel Gaussian representation from the input images, and aggregates multi-view information using a transformer-based encoder that fuses image features from both DINOv3 and Stable Diffusion VAE. For real-time animation, we extend the explicit Gaussian representations with per-Gaussian features and introduce a lightweight MLP-based dynamic network to predict 3D Gaussian deformations from expression codes. Furthermore, to enhance geometric smoothness of the 3D head, we employ point maps from a pre-trained large reconstruction model as geometry supervision. Experiments show that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods in both rendering quality and inference efficiency, while supporting real-time dynamic avatar animation.</description>

      <title>DisasterVQA: A Visual Question Answering Benchmark Dataset for Disaster Scenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social media imagery provides a low-latency source of situational information during natural and human-induced disasters, enabling rapid damage assessment and response. While Visual Question Answering (VQA) has shown strong performance in general-purpose domains, its suitability for the complex and safety-critical reasoning required in disaster response remains unclear. We introduce DisasterVQA, a benchmark dataset designed for perception and reasoning in crisis contexts. DisasterVQA consists of 1,395 real-world images and 4,405 expert-curated question-answer pairs spanning diverse events such as floods, wildfires, and earthquakes. Grounded in humanitarian frameworks including FEMA ESF and OCHA MIRA, the dataset includes binary, multiple-choice, and open-ended questions covering situational awareness and operational decision-making tasks. We benchmark seven state-of-the-art vision-language models and find performance variability across question types, disaster categories, regions, and humanitarian tasks. Although models achieve high accuracy on binary questions, they struggle with fine-grained quantitative reasoning, object counting, and context-sensitive interpretation, particularly for underrepresented disaster scenarios. DisasterVQA provides a challenging and practical benchmark to guide the development of more robust and operationally meaningful vision-language models for disaster response. The dataset is publicly available at https://zenodo.org/records/18267770.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Deep Discriminant Analysis for Wind Blade Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linear discriminant analysis improves class separability but struggles with non-linearly separable data. To overcome this, we introduce Deep Discriminant Analysis (DDA), which directly optimizes the Fisher criterion utilizing deep networks. To ensure stable training and avoid computational instabilities, we incorporate signed between-class variance, bound outputs with a sigmoid function, and convert multiplicative relationships into additive ones. We present two stable DDA loss functions and augment them with a probability loss, resulting in Probabilistic DDA (PDDA). PDDA effectively minimizes class overlap in output distributions, producing highly confident predictions with reduced within-class variance. When applied to wind blade segmentation, PDDA showcases notable advances in performance and consistency, critical for wind energy maintenance. To our knowledge, this is the first application of DDA to image segmentation.</description>

      <title>OCCAM: Class-Agnostic, Training-Free, Prior-Free and Multi-Class Object Counting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Class-Agnostic object Counting (CAC) involves counting instances of objects from arbitrary classes within an image. Due to its practical importance, CAC has received increasing attention in recent years. Most existing methods assume a single object class per image, rely on extensive training of large deep learning models and address the problem by incorporating additional information, such as visual exemplars or text prompts. In this paper, we present OCCAM, the first training-free approach to CAC that operates without the need of any supplementary information. Moreover, our approach addresses the multi-class variant of the problem, as it is capable of counting the object instances in each and every class among arbitrary object classes within an image. We leverage Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2), a foundation model, and a custom threshold-based variant of the First Integer Neighbor Clustering Hierarchy (FINCH) algorithm to achieve competitive performance on widely used benchmark datasets, FSC-147 and CARPK. We propose a synthetic multi-class dataset and F1 score as a more suitable evaluation metric. The code for our method and the proposed synthetic dataset will be made publicly available at https://mikespanak.github.io/OCCAM_counter.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Multi-Task Visual Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current visual representation learning remains bifurcated: vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) excel at global semantic alignment but lack spatial precision, while self-supervised methods (e.g., MAE, DINO) capture intricate local structures yet struggle with high-level semantic context. We argue that these paradigms are fundamentally complementary and can be integrated into a principled multi-task framework, further enhanced by dense spatial supervision. We introduce MTV, a multi-task visual pretraining framework that jointly optimizes a shared backbone across vision-language contrastive, self-supervised, and dense spatial objectives. To mitigate the need for manual annotations, we leverage high-capacity "expert" models -- such as Depth Anything V2 and OWLv2 -- to synthesize dense, structured pseudo-labels at scale. Beyond the framework, we provide a systematic investigation into the mechanics of multi-task visual learning, analyzing: (i) the marginal gain of each objective, (ii) task synergies versus interference, and (iii) scaling behavior across varying data and model scales. Our results demonstrate that MTV achieves "best-of-both-worlds" performance, significantly enhancing fine-grained spatial reasoning without compromising global semantic understanding. Our findings suggest that multi-task learning, fueled by high-quality pseudo-supervision, is a scalable path toward more general visual encoders.</description>

      <title>OmniOVCD: Streamlining Open-Vocabulary Change Detection with SAM 3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Change Detection (CD) is a fundamental task in remote sensing. It monitors the evolution of land cover over time. Based on this, Open-Vocabulary Change Detection (OVCD) introduces a new requirement. It aims to reduce the reliance on predefined categories. Existing training-free OVCD methods mostly use CLIP to identify categories. These methods also need extra models like DINO to extract features. However, combining different models often causes problems in matching features and makes the system unstable. Recently, the Segment Anything Model 3 (SAM 3) is introduced. It integrates segmentation and identification capabilities within one promptable model, which offers new possibilities for the OVCD task. In this paper, we propose OmniOVCD, a standalone framework designed for OVCD. By leveraging the decoupled output heads of SAM 3, we propose a Synergistic Fusion to Instance Decoupling (SFID) strategy. SFID first fuses the semantic, instance, and presence outputs of SAM 3 to construct land-cover masks, and then decomposes them into individual instance masks for change comparison. This design preserves high accuracy in category recognition and maintains instance-level consistency across images. As a result, the model can generate accurate change masks. Experiments on four public benchmarks (LEVIR-CD, WHU-CD, S2Looking, and SECOND) demonstrate SOTA performance, achieving IoU scores of 67.2, 66.5, 24.5, and 27.1 (class-average), respectively, surpassing all previous methods.</description>

      <title>Towards Visually Explaining Statistical Tests with Applications in Biomedical Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep neural two-sample tests have recently shown strong power for detecting distributional differences between groups, yet their black-box nature limits interpretability and practical adoption in biomedical analysis. Moreover, most existing post-hoc explainability methods rely on class labels, making them unsuitable for label-free statistical testing settings. We propose an explainable deep statistical testing framework that augments deep two-sample tests with sample-level and feature-level explanations, revealing which individual samples and which input features drive statistically significant group differences. Our method highlights which image regions and which individual samples contribute most to the detected group difference, providing spatial and instance-wise insight into the test's decision. Applied to biomedical imaging data, the proposed framework identifies influential samples and highlights anatomically meaningful regions associated with disease-related variation. This work bridges statistical inference and explainable AI, enabling interpretable, label-free population analysis in medical imaging.</description>

      <title>On the Role of Rotation Equivariance in Monocular 3D Human Pose Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimating 3D from 2D is one of the central tasks in computer vision. In this work, we consider the monocular setting, i.e. single-view input, for 3D human pose estimation (HPE). Here, the task is to predict a 3D point set of human skeletal joints from a single 2D input image. While by definition this is an ill-posed problem, recent work has presented methods that solve it with up to several-centimetre error. Typically, these methods employ a two-step approach, where the first step is to detect the 2D skeletal joints in the input image, followed by the step of 2D-to-3D lifting. We find that common lifting models fail when encountering a rotated input. We argue that learning a single human pose along with its in-plane rotations is considerably easier and more geometrically grounded than directly learning a point-to-point mapping. Furthermore, our intuition is that endowing the model with the notion of rotation equivariance without explicitly constraining its parameter space should lead to a more straightforward learning process than one with equivariance by design. Utilising the common HPE benchmarks, we confirm that the 2D rotation equivariance per se improves the model performance on human poses akin to rotations in the image plane, and can be efficiently and straightforwardly learned by augmentation, outperforming state-of-the-art equivariant-by-design methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: White Matter Tract Segmentation is imperative for studying brain structural connectivity, neurological disorders and neurosurgery. This task remains complex, as tracts differ among themselves, across subjects and conditions, yet have similar 3D structure across hemispheres and subjects. To address these challenges, we propose TrackletGPT, a language-like GPT framework which reintroduces sequential information in tokens using tracklets. TrackletGPT generalises seamlessly across datasets, is fully automatic, and encodes granular sub-streamline segments, Tracklets, scaling and refining GPT models in Tractography Segmentation. Based on our experiments, TrackletGPT outperforms state-of-the-art methods on average DICE, Overlap and Overreach scores on TractoInferno and HCP datasets, even on inter-dataset experiments.</description>

      <title>Glance-or-Gaze: Incentivizing LMMs to Adaptively Focus Search via Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have achieved remarkable success in visual understanding, yet they struggle with knowledge-intensive queries involving long-tail entities or evolving information due to static parametric knowledge. Recent search-augmented approaches attempt to address this limitation, but existing methods rely on indiscriminate whole-image retrieval that introduces substantial visual redundancy and noise, and lack deep iterative reflection, limiting their effectiveness on complex visual queries. To overcome these challenges, we propose Glance-or-Gaze (GoG), a fully autonomous framework that shifts from passive perception to active visual planning. GoG introduces a Selective Gaze mechanism that dynamically chooses whether to glance at global context or gaze into high-value regions, filtering irrelevant information before retrieval. We design a dual-stage training strategy: Reflective GoG Behavior Alignment via supervised fine-tuning instills the fundamental GoG paradigm, while Complexity-Adaptive Reinforcement Learning further enhances the model's capability to handle complex queries through iterative reasoning. Experiments across six benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. Ablation studies confirm that both Selective Gaze and complexity-adaptive RL are essential for effective visual search.

      <title>VTONGuard: Automatic Detection and Authentication of AI-Generated Virtual Try-On Content</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of generative AI, virtual try-on (VTON) systems are becoming increasingly common in e-commerce and digital entertainment. However, the growing realism of AI-generated try-on content raises pressing concerns about authenticity and responsible use. To address this, we present VTONGuard, a large-scale benchmark dataset containing over 775,000 real and synthetic try-on images. The dataset covers diverse real-world conditions, including variations in pose, background, and garment styles, and provides both authentic and manipulated examples. Based on this benchmark, we conduct a systematic evaluation of multiple detection paradigms under unified training and testing protocols. Our results reveal each method's strengths and weaknesses and highlight the persistent challenge of cross-paradigm generalization. To further advance detection, we design a multi-task framework that integrates auxiliary segmentation to enhance boundary-aware feature learning, achieving the best overall performance on VTONGuard. We expect this benchmark to enable fair comparisons, facilitate the development of more robust detection models, and promote the safe and responsible deployment of VTON technologies in practice.</description>

      <title>DExTeR: Weakly Semi-Supervised Object Detection with Class and Instance Experts for Medical Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting anatomical landmarks in medical imaging is essential for diagnosis and intervention guidance. However, object detection models rely on costly bounding box annotations, limiting scalability. Weakly Semi-Supervised Object Detection (WSSOD) with point annotations proposes annotating each instance with a single point, minimizing annotation time while preserving localization signals. A Point-to-Box teacher model, trained on a small box-labeled subset, converts these point annotations into pseudo-box labels to train a student detector. Yet, medical imagery presents unique challenges, including overlapping anatomy, variable object sizes, and elusive structures, which hinder accurate bounding box inference. To overcome these challenges, we introduce DExTeR (DETR with Experts), a transformer-based Point-to-Box regressor tailored for medical imaging. Built upon Point-DETR, DExTeR encodes single-point annotations as object queries, refining feature extraction with the proposed class-guided deformable attention, which guides attention sampling using point coordinates and class labels to capture class-specific characteristics. To improve discrimination in complex structures, it introduces CLICK-MoE (CLass, Instance, and Common Knowledge Mixture of Experts), decoupling class and instance representations to reduce confusion among adjacent or overlapping instances. Finally, we implement a multi-point training strategy which promotes prediction consistency across different point placements, improving robustness to annotation variability. DExTeR achieves state-of-the-art performance across three datasets spanning different medical domains (endoscopy, chest X-rays, and endoscopic ultrasound) highlighting its potential to reduce annotation costs while maintaining high detection accuracy.</description>

      <title>STEC: A Reference-Free Spatio-Temporal Entropy Coverage Metric for Evaluating Sampled Video Frames</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Frame sampling is a fundamental component in video understanding and video--language model pipelines, yet evaluating the quality of sampled frames remains challenging. Existing evaluation metrics primarily focus on perceptual quality or reconstruction fidelity, and are not designed to assess whether a set of sampled frames adequately captures informative and representative video content.
  We propose Spatio-Temporal Entropy Coverage (STEC), a simple and non-reference metric for evaluating the effectiveness of video frame sampling. STEC builds upon Spatio-Temporal Frame Entropy (STFE), which measures per-frame spatial information via entropy-based structural complexity, and evaluates sampled frames based on their temporal coverage and redundancy. By jointly modeling spatial information strength, temporal dispersion, and non-redundancy, STEC provides a principled and lightweight measure of sampling quality.
  Experiments on the MSR-VTT test-1k benchmark demonstrate that STEC clearly differentiates common sampling strategies, including random, uniform, and content-aware methods. We further show that STEC reveals robustness patterns across individual videos that are not captured by average performance alone, highlighting its practical value as a general-purpose evaluation tool for efficient video understanding.
  We emphasize that STEC is not designed to predict downstream task accuracy, but to provide a task-agnostic diagnostic signal for analyzing frame sampling behavior under constrained budgets.</description>

      <title>Harmonizing the Deep: A Unified Information Pipeline for Robust Marine Biodiversity Assessment Across Heterogeneous Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Marine biodiversity monitoring requires scalability and reliability across complex underwater environments to support conservation and invasive-species management. Yet existing detection solutions often exhibit a pronounced deployment gap, with performance degrading sharply when transferred to new sites. This work establishes the foundational detection layer for a multi-year invasive species monitoring initiative targeting Arctic and Atlantic marine ecosystems. We address this challenge by developing a Unified Information Pipeline that standardises heterogeneous datasets into a comparable information flow and evaluates a fixed, deployment-relevant detector under controlled cross-domain protocols. Across multiple domains, we find that structural factors, such as scene composition, object density, and contextual redundancy, explain cross-domain performance loss more strongly than visual degradation such as turbidity, with sparse scenes inducing a characteristic "Context Collapse" failure mode. We further validate operational feasibility by benchmarking inference on low-cost edge hardware, showing that runtime optimisation enables practical sampling rates for remote monitoring. The results shift emphasis from image enhancement toward structure-aware reliability, providing a democratised tool for consistent marine ecosystem assessment.</description>

      <title>FantasyVLN: Unified Multimodal Chain-of-Thought Reasoning for Vision-Language Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving human-level performance in Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) requires an embodied agent to jointly understand multimodal instructions and visual-spatial context while reasoning over long action sequences. Recent works, such as NavCoT and NavGPT-2, demonstrate the potential of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning for improving interpretability and long-horizon planning. Moreover, multimodal extensions like OctoNav-R1 and CoT-VLA further validate CoT as a promising pathway toward human-like navigation reasoning. However, existing approaches face critical drawbacks: purely textual CoTs lack spatial grounding and easily overfit to sparse annotated reasoning steps, while multimodal CoTs incur severe token inflation by generating imagined visual observations, making real-time navigation impractical. In this work, we propose FantasyVLN, a unified implicit reasoning framework that preserves the benefits of CoT reasoning without explicit token overhead. Specifically, imagined visual tokens are encoded into a compact latent space using a pretrained Visual AutoRegressor (VAR) during CoT reasoning training, and the model jointly learns from textual, visual, and multimodal CoT modes under a unified multi-CoT strategy. At inference, our model performs direct instruction-to-action mapping while still enjoying reasoning-aware representations. Extensive experiments on LH-VLN show that our approach achieves reasoning-aware yet real-time navigation, improving success rates and efficiency while reducing inference latency by an order of magnitude compared to explicit CoT methods.</description>

      <title>Equivariant Learning for Unsupervised Image Dehazing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image Dehazing (ID) aims to produce a clear image from an observation contaminated by haze. Current ID methods typically rely on carefully crafted priors or extensive haze-free ground truth, both of which are expensive or impractical to acquire, particularly in the context of scientific imaging. We propose a new unsupervised learning framework called Equivariant Image Dehazing (EID) that exploits the symmetry of image signals to restore clarity to hazy observations. By enforcing haze consistency and systematic equivariance, EID can recover clear patterns directly from raw, hazy images. Additionally, we propose an adversarial learning strategy to model unknown haze physics and facilitate EID learning. Experiments on two scientific image dehazing benchmarks (including cell microscopy and medical endoscopy) and on natural image dehazing have demonstrated that EID significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. By unifying equivariant learning with modelling haze physics, we hope that EID will enable more versatile and effective haze removal in scientific imaging. Code and datasets will be published.</description>

      <title>Likelihood-Separable Diffusion Inference for Multi-Image MRI Super-Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models are the current state-of-the-art for solving inverse problems in imaging. Their impressive generative capability allows them to approximate sampling from a prior distribution, which alongside a known likelihood function permits posterior sampling without retraining the model. While recent methods have made strides in advancing the accuracy of posterior sampling, the majority focuses on single-image inverse problems. However, for modalities such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), it is common to acquire multiple complementary measurements, each low-resolution along a different axis. In this work, we generalize common diffusion-based inverse single-image problem solvers for multi-image super-resolution (MISR) MRI. We show that the DPS likelihood correction allows an exactly-separable gradient decomposition across independently acquired measurements, enabling MISR without constructing a joint operator, modifying the diffusion model, or increasing network function evaluations. We derive MISR versions of DPS, DMAP, DPPS, and diffusion-based PnP/ADMM, and demonstrate substantial gains over SISR across $4\times/8\times/16\times$ anisotropic degradations. Our results achieve state-of-the-art super-resolution of anisotropic MRI volumes and, critically, enable reconstruction of near-isotropic anatomy from routine 2D multi-slice acquisitions, which are otherwise highly degraded in orthogonal views.</description>

      <title>Human detectors are surprisingly powerful reward models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video generation models have recently achieved impressive visual fidelity and temporal coherence. Yet, they continue to struggle with complex, non-rigid motions, especially when synthesizing humans performing dynamic actions such as sports, dance, etc. Generated videos often exhibit missing or extra limbs, distorted poses, or physically implausible actions. In this work, we propose a remarkably simple reward model, HuDA, to quantify and improve the human motion in generated videos. HuDA integrates human detection confidence for appearance quality, and a temporal prompt alignment score to capture motion realism. We show this simple reward function that leverages off-the-shelf models without any additional training, outperforms specialized models finetuned with manually annotated data. Using HuDA for Group Reward Policy Optimization (GRPO) post-training of video models, we significantly enhance video generation, especially when generating complex human motions, outperforming state-of-the-art models like Wan 2.1, with win-rate of 73%. Finally, we demonstrate that HuDA improves generation quality beyond just humans, for instance, significantly improving generation of animal videos and human-object interactions.</description>

      <title>Correcting and Quantifying Systematic Errors in 3D Box Annotations for Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate ground truth annotations are critical to supervised learning and evaluating the performance of autonomous vehicle systems. These vehicles are typically equipped with active sensors, such as LiDAR, which scan the environment in predefined patterns. 3D box annotation based on data from such sensors is challenging in dynamic scenarios, where objects are observed at different timestamps, hence different positions. Without proper handling of this phenomenon, systematic errors are prone to being introduced in the box annotations. Our work is the first to discover such annotation errors in widely used, publicly available datasets. Through our novel offline estimation method, we correct the annotations so that they follow physically feasible trajectories and achieve spatial and temporal consistency with the sensor data. For the first time, we define metrics for this problem; and we evaluate our method on the Argoverse 2, MAN TruckScenes, and our proprietary datasets. Our approach increases the quality of box annotations by more than 17% in these datasets. Furthermore, we quantify the annotation errors in them and find that the original annotations are misplaced by up to 2.5 m, with highly dynamic objects being the most affected. Finally, we test the impact of the errors in benchmarking and find that the impact is larger than the improvements that state-of-the-art methods typically achieve with respect to the previous state-of-the-art methods; showing that accurate annotations are essential for correct interpretation of performance. Our code is available at https://github.com/alexandre-justo-miro/annotation-correction-3D-boxes.</description>

      <title>Generalizing Abstention for Noise-Robust Learning in Medical Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Label noise is a critical problem in medical image segmentation, often arising from the inherent difficulty of manual annotation. Models trained on noisy data are prone to overfitting, which degrades their generalization performance. While a number of methods and strategies have been proposed to mitigate noisy labels in the segmentation domain, this area remains largely under-explored. The abstention mechanism has proven effective in classification tasks by enhancing the capabilities of Cross Entropy, yet its potential in segmentation remains unverified. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing a universal and modular abstention framework capable of enhancing the noise-robustness of a diverse range of loss functions. Our framework improves upon prior work with two key components: an informed regularization term to guide abstention behaviour, and a more flexible power-law-based auto-tuning algorithm for the abstention penalty. We demonstrate the framework's versatility by systematically integrating it with three distinct loss functions to create three novel, noise-robust variants: GAC, SAC, and ADS. Experiments on the CaDIS and DSAD medical datasets show our methods consistently and significantly outperform their non-abstaining baselines, especially under high noise levels. This work establishes that enabling models to selectively ignore corrupted samples is a powerful and generalizable strategy for building more reliable segmentation models. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/wemous/abstention-for-segmentation.</description>

      <title>Federated Balanced Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated learning is a paradigm of joint learning in which clients collaborate by sharing model parameters instead of data. However, in the non-iid setting, the global model experiences client drift, which can seriously affect the final performance of the model. Previous methods tend to correct the global model that has already deviated based on the loss function or gradient, overlooking the impact of the client samples. In this paper, we rethink the role of the client side and propose Federated Balanced Learning, i.e., FBL, to prevent this issue from the beginning through sample balance on the client side. Technically, FBL allows unbalanced data on the client side to achieve sample balance through knowledge filling and knowledge sampling using edge-side generation models, under the limitation of a fixed number of data samples on clients. Furthermore, we design a Knowledge Alignment Strategy to bridge the gap between synthetic and real data, and a Knowledge Drop Strategy to regularize our method. Meanwhile, we scale our method to real and complex scenarios, allowing different clients to adopt various methods, and extend our framework to further improve performance. Numerous experiments show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. The code is released upon acceptance.</description>

      <title>Weather-R1: Logically Consistent Reinforcement Fine-Tuning for Multimodal Reasoning in Meteorology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While Vision Language Models (VLMs) show advancing reasoning capabilities, their application in meteorology is constrained by a domain gap and a reasoning faithfulness gap. Specifically, mainstream Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) can induce Self-Contradictory Reasoning (Self-Contra), where the model's reasoning contradicts its final answer, which is unacceptable in such a high-stakes domain. To address these challenges, we construct WeatherQA, a novel multimodal reasoning benchmark in meteorology. We also propose Logically Consistent Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (LoCo-RFT), which resolves Self-Contra by introducing a logical consistency reward. Furthermore, we introduce Weather-R1, the first reasoning VLM with logical faithfulness in meteorology, to the best of our knowledge. Experiments demonstrate that Weather-R1 improves performance on WeatherQA by 9.8 percentage points over the baseline, outperforming Supervised Fine-Tuning and RFT, and even surpassing the original Qwen2.5-VL-32B. These results highlight the effectiveness of our LoCo-RFT and the superiority of Weather-R1. Our benchmark and code are available at https://github.com/Marcowky/Weather-R1.</description>

      <title>Vision Also You Need: Navigating Out-of-Distribution Detection with Multimodal Large Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection is a critical task that has garnered significant attention. The emergence of CLIP has spurred extensive research into zero-shot OOD detection, often employing a training-free approach. Current methods leverage expert knowledge from large language models (LLMs) to identify potential outliers. However, these approaches tend to over-rely on knowledge in the text space, neglecting the inherent challenges involved in detecting out-of-distribution samples in the image space. In this paper, we propose a novel pipeline, MM-OOD, which leverages the multimodal reasoning capabilities of MLLMs and their ability to conduct multi-round conversations for enhanced outlier detection. Our method is designed to improve performance in both near OOD and far OOD tasks. Specifically, (1) for near OOD tasks, we directly feed ID images and corresponding text prompts into MLLMs to identify potential outliers; and (2) for far OOD tasks, we introduce the sketch-generate-elaborate framework: first, we sketch outlier exposure using text prompts, then generate corresponding visual OOD samples, and finally elaborate by using multimodal prompts. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves significant improvements on widely used multimodal datasets such as Food-101, while also validating its scalability on ImageNet-1K.</description>

      <title>Decoder-Free Supervoxel GNN for Accurate Brain-Tumor Localization in Multi-Modal MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern vision backbones for 3D medical imaging typically process dense voxel grids through parameter-heavy encoder-decoder structures, a design that allocates a significant portion of its parameters to spatial reconstruction rather than feature learning. Our approach introduces SVGFormer, a decoder-free pipeline built upon a content-aware grouping stage that partitions the volume into a semantic graph of supervoxels. Its hierarchical encoder learns rich node representations by combining a patch-level Transformer with a supervoxel-level Graph Attention Network, jointly modeling fine-grained intra-region features and broader inter-regional dependencies. This design concentrates all learnable capacity on feature encoding and provides inherent, dual-scale explainability from the patch to the region level. To validate the framework's flexibility, we trained two specialized models on the BraTS dataset: one for node-level classification and one for tumor proportion regression. Both models achieved strong performance, with the classification model achieving a F1-score of 0.875 and the regression model a MAE of 0.028, confirming the encoder's ability to learn discriminative and localized features. Our results establish that a graph-based, encoder-only paradigm offers an accurate and inherently interpretable alternative for 3D medical image representation.</description>

      <title>POCI-Diff: Position Objects Consistently and Interactively with 3D-Layout Guided Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a diffusion-based approach for Text-to-Image (T2I) generation with consistent and interactive 3D layout control and editing. While prior methods improve spatial adherence using 2D cues or iterative copy-warp-paste strategies, they often distort object geometry and fail to preserve consistency across edits. To address these limitations, we introduce a framework for Positioning Objects Consistently and Interactively (POCI-Diff), a novel formulation for jointly enforcing 3D geometric constraints and instance-level semantic binding within a unified diffusion process. Our method enables explicit per-object semantic control by binding individual text descriptions to specific 3D bounding boxes through Blended Latent Diffusion, allowing one-shot synthesis of complex multi-object scenes. We further propose a warping-free generative editing pipeline that supports object insertion, removal, and transformation via regeneration rather than pixel deformation. To preserve object identity and consistency across edits, we condition the diffusion process on reference images using IP-Adapter, enabling coherent object appearance throughout interactive 3D editing while maintaining global scene coherence. Experimental results demonstrate that POCI-Diff produces high-quality images consistent with the specified 3D layouts and edits, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in both visual fidelity and layout adherence while eliminating warping-induced geometric artifacts.</description>

      <title>Fine-Grained Zero-Shot Composed Image Retrieval with Complementary Visual-Semantic Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zero-shot composed image retrieval (ZS-CIR) is a rapidly growing area with significant practical applications, allowing users to retrieve a target image by providing a reference image and a relative caption describing the desired modifications. Existing ZS-CIR methods often struggle to capture fine-grained changes and integrate visual and semantic information effectively. They primarily rely on either transforming the multimodal query into a single text using image-to-text models or employing large language models for target image description generation, approaches that often fail to capture complementary visual information and complete semantic context. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Fine-Grained Zero-Shot Composed Image Retrieval method with Complementary Visual-Semantic Integration (CVSI). Specifically, CVSI leverages three key components: (1) Visual Information Extraction, which not only extracts global image features but also uses a pre-trained mapping network to convert the image into a pseudo token, combining it with the modification text and the objects most likely to be added. (2) Semantic Information Extraction, which involves using a pre-trained captioning model to generate multiple captions for the reference image, followed by leveraging an LLM to generate the modified captions and the objects most likely to be added. (3) Complementary Information Retrieval, which integrates information extracted from both the query and database images to retrieve the target image, enabling the system to efficiently handle retrieval queries in a variety of situations. Extensive experiments on three public datasets (e.g., CIRR, CIRCO, and FashionIQ) demonstrate that CVSI significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

      <title>VERIDAH: Solving Enumeration Anomaly Aware Vertebra Labeling across Imaging Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The human spine commonly consists of seven cervical, twelve thoracic, and five lumbar vertebrae. However, enumeration anomalies may result in individuals having eleven or thirteen thoracic vertebrae and four or six lumbar vertebrae. Although the identification of enumeration anomalies has potential clinical implications for chronic back pain and operation planning, the thoracolumbar junction is often poorly assessed and rarely described in clinical reports. Additionally, even though multiple deep-learning-based vertebra labeling algorithms exist, there is a lack of methods to automatically label enumeration anomalies. Our work closes that gap by introducing "Vertebra Identification with Anomaly Handling" (VERIDAH), a novel vertebra labeling algorithm based on multiple classification heads combined with a weighted vertebra sequence prediction algorithm. We show that our approach surpasses existing models on T2w TSE sagittal (98.30% vs. 94.24% of subjects with all vertebrae correctly labeled, p &lt; 0.001) and CT imaging (99.18% vs. 77.26% of subjects with all vertebrae correctly labeled, p &lt; 0.001) and works in arbitrary field-of-view images. VERIDAH correctly labeled the presence 2 M\"oller et al. of thoracic enumeration anomalies in 87.80% and 96.30% of T2w and CT images, respectively, and lumbar enumeration anomalies in 94.48% and 97.22% for T2w and CT, respectively.

      <title>Unsupervised Video Class-Incremental Learning via Deep Embedded Clustering Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unsupervised video class incremental learning (uVCIL) represents an important learning paradigm for learning video information without forgetting, and without considering any data labels. Prior approaches have focused on supervised class-incremental learning, relying on using the knowledge of labels and task boundaries, which is costly, requires human annotation, or is simply not a realistic option. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective approach to address the uVCIL. We first consider a deep feature extractor network, providing a set of representative video features during each task without assuming any class or task information. We then progressively build a series of deep clusters from the extracted features. During the successive task learning, the model updated from the previous task is used as an initial state in order to transfer knowledge to the current learning task. We perform in-depth evaluations on three standard video action recognition datasets, including UCF101, HMDB51, and Something-to-Something V2, by ignoring the labels from the supervised setting. Our approach significantly outperforms other baselines on all datasets.</description>

      <title>VENI: Variational Encoder for Natural Illumination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inverse rendering is an ill-posed problem, but priors like illumination priors, can simplify it. Existing work either disregards the spherical and rotation-equivariant nature of illumination environments or does not provide a well-behaved latent space. We propose a rotation-equivariant variational autoencoder that models natural illumination on the sphere without relying on 2D projections. To preserve the SO(2)-equivariance of environment maps, we use a novel Vector Neuron Vision Transformer (VN-ViT) as encoder and a rotation-equivariant conditional neural field as decoder. In the encoder, we reduce the equivariance from SO(3) to SO(2) using a novel SO(2)-equivariant fully connected layer, an extension of Vector Neurons. We show that our SO(2)-equivariant fully connected layer outperforms standard Vector Neurons when used in our SO(2)-equivariant model. Compared to previous methods, our variational autoencoder enables smoother interpolation in latent space and offers a more well-behaved latent space.</description>

      <title>DermaBench: A Clinician-Annotated Benchmark Dataset for Dermatology Visual Question Answering and Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) are increasingly important in medical applications; however, their evaluation in dermatology remains limited by datasets that focus primarily on image-level classification tasks such as lesion recognition. While valuable for recognition, such datasets cannot assess the full visual understanding, language grounding, and clinical reasoning capabilities of multimodal models. Visual question answering (VQA) benchmarks are required to evaluate how models interpret dermatological images, reason over fine-grained morphology, and generate clinically meaningful descriptions. We introduce DermaBench, a clinician-annotated dermatology VQA benchmark built on the Diverse Dermatology Images (DDI) dataset. DermaBench comprises 656 clinical images from 570 unique patients spanning Fitzpatrick skin types I-VI. Using a hierarchical annotation schema with 22 main questions (single-choice, multi-choice, and open-ended), expert dermatologists annotated each image for diagnosis, anatomic site, lesion morphology, distribution, surface features, color, and image quality, together with open-ended narrative descriptions and summaries, yielding approximately 14.474 VQA-style annotations. DermaBench is released as a metadata-only dataset to respect upstream licensing and is publicly available at Harvard Dataverse.</description>

Abstract: Motion representation plays an important role in video understanding and has many applications including action recognition, robot and autonomous guidance or others. Lately, transformer networks, through their self-attention mechanism capabilities, have proved their efficiency in many applications. In this study, we introduce a new two-stream transformer video classifier, which extracts spatio-temporal information from content and optical flow representing movement information. The proposed model identifies self-attention features across the joint optical flow and temporal frame domain and represents their relationships within the transformer encoder mechanism. The experimental results show that our proposed methodology provides excellent classification results on three well-known video datasets of human activities.</description>

      <title>Curriculum-Based Strategies for Efficient Cross-Domain Action Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite significant progress in human action recognition, generalizing to diverse viewpoints remains a challenge. Most existing datasets are captured from ground-level perspectives, and models trained on them often struggle to transfer to drastically different domains such as aerial views. This paper examines how curriculum-based training strategies can improve generalization to unseen real aerial-view data without using any real aerial data during training.
  We explore curriculum learning for cross-view action recognition using two out-of-domain sources: synthetic aerial-view data and real ground-view data. Our results on the evaluation on order of training (fine-tuning on synthetic aerial data vs. real ground data) shows that fine-tuning on real ground data but differ in how they transition from synthetic to real. The first uses a two-stage curriculum with direct fine-tuning, while the second applies a progressive curriculum that expands the dataset in multiple stages before fine-tuning. We evaluate both methods on the REMAG dataset using SlowFast (CNN-based) and MViTv2 (Transformer-based) architectures.
  Results show that combining the two out-of-domain datasets clearly outperforms training on a single domain, whether real ground-view or synthetic aerial-view. Both curriculum strategies match the top-1 accuracy of simple dataset combination while offering efficiency gains. With the two-step fine-tuning method, SlowFast achieves up to a 37% reduction in iterations and MViTv2 up to a 30% reduction compared to simple combination. The multi-step progressive approach further reduces iterations, by up to 9% for SlowFast and 30% for MViTv2, relative to the two-step method. These findings demonstrate that curriculum-based training can maintain comparable performance (top-1 accuracy within 3% range) while improving training efficiency in cross-view action recognition.</description>

      <title>Interp3D: Correspondence-aware Interpolation for Generative Textured 3D Morphing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Textured 3D morphing seeks to generate smooth and plausible transitions between two 3D assets, preserving both structural coherence and fine-grained appearance. This ability is crucial not only for advancing 3D generation research but also for practical applications in animation, editing, and digital content creation. Existing approaches either operate directly on geometry, limiting them to shape-only morphing while neglecting textures, or extend 2D interpolation strategies into 3D, which often causes semantic ambiguity, structural misalignment, and texture blurring. These challenges underscore the necessity to jointly preserve geometric consistency, texture alignment, and robustness throughout the transition process. To address this, we propose Interp3D, a novel training-free framework for textured 3D morphing. It harnesses generative priors and adopts a progressive alignment principle to ensure both geometric fidelity and texture coherence. Starting from semantically aligned interpolation in condition space, Interp3D enforces structural consistency via SLAT (Structured Latent)-guided structure interpolation, and finally transfers appearance details through fine-grained texture fusion. For comprehensive evaluations, we construct a dedicated dataset, Interp3DData, with graded difficulty levels and assess generation results from fidelity, transition smoothness, and plausibility. Both quantitative metrics and human studies demonstrate the significant advantages of our proposed approach over previous methods.

      <title>PMCE: Probabilistic Multi-Granularity Semantics with Caption-Guided Enhancement for Few-Shot Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Few-shot learning aims to identify novel categories from only a handful of labeled samples, where prototypes estimated from scarce data are often biased and generalize poorly. Semantic-based methods alleviate this by introducing coarse class-level information, but they are mostly applied on the support side, leaving query representations unchanged. In this paper, we present PMCE, a Probabilistic few-shot framework that leverages Multi-granularity semantics with Caption-guided Enhancement. PMCE constructs a nonparametric knowledge bank that stores visual statistics for each category as well as CLIP-encoded class name embeddings of the base classes. At meta-test time, the most relevant base classes are retrieved based on the similarities of class name embeddings for each novel category. These statistics are then aggregated into category-specific prior information and fused with the support set prototypes via a simple MAP update. Simultaneously, a frozen BLIP captioner provides label-free instance-level image descriptions, and a lightweight enhancer trained on base classes optimizes both support prototypes and query features under an inductive protocol with a consistency regularization to stabilize noisy captions. Experiments on four benchmarks show that PMCE consistently improves over strong baselines, achieving up to 7.71% absolute gain over the strongest semantic competitor on MiniImageNet in the 1-shot setting.

      <title>The Side Effects of Being Smart: Safety Risks in MLLMs' Multi-Image Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) acquire stronger reasoning capabilities to handle complex, multi-image instructions, this advancement may pose new safety risks. We study this problem by introducing MIR-SafetyBench, the first benchmark focused on multi-image reasoning safety, which consists of 2,676 instances across a taxonomy of 9 multi-image relations. Our extensive evaluations on 19 MLLMs reveal a troubling trend: models with more advanced multi-image reasoning can be more vulnerable on MIR-SafetyBench. Beyond attack success rates, we find that many responses labeled as safe are superficial, often driven by misunderstanding or evasive, non-committal replies. We further observe that unsafe generations exhibit lower attention entropy than safe ones on average. This internal signature suggests a possible risk that models may over-focus on task solving while neglecting safety constraints. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/thu-coai/MIR-SafetyBench.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.14130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural image codecs achieve higher compression ratios than traditional hand-crafted methods such as PNG or JPEG-XL, but often incur substantial computational overhead, limiting their deployment on energy-constrained devices such as smartphones, cameras, and drones. We propose Grayscale Image Compression with Differentiable Logic Circuits (GIC-DLC), a hardware-aware codec where we train lookup tables to combine the flexibility of neural networks with the efficiency of Boolean operations. Experiments on grayscale benchmark datasets show that GIC-DLC outperforms traditional codecs in compression efficiency while allowing substantial reductions in energy consumption and latency. These results demonstrate that learned compression can be hardware-friendly, offering a promising direction for low-power image compression on edge devices.</description>

      <title>LLM Augmented Intervenable Multimodal Adaptor for Post-operative Complication Prediction in Lung Cancer Surgery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Postoperative complications remain a critical concern in clinical practice, adversely affecting patient outcomes and contributing to rising healthcare costs. We present MIRACLE, a deep learning architecture for prediction of risk of postoperative complications in lung cancer surgery by integrating preoperative clinical and radiological data. MIRACLE employs a hyperspherical embedding space fusion of heterogeneous inputs, enabling the extraction of robust, discriminative features from both structured clinical records and high-dimensional radiological images. To enhance transparency of prediction and clinical utility, we incorporate an interventional deep learning module in MIRACLE, that not only refines predictions but also provides interpretable and actionable insights, allowing domain experts to interactively adjust recommendations based on clinical expertise. We validate our approach on POC-L, a real-world dataset comprising 3,094 lung cancer patients who underwent surgery at Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center. Our results demonstrate that MIRACLE outperforms various traditional machine learning models and contemporary large language models (LLM) variants alone, for personalized and explainable postoperative risk management.</description>

      <title>One-Shot Refiner: Boosting Feed-forward Novel View Synthesis via One-Step Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel framework for high-fidelity novel view synthesis (NVS) from sparse images, addressing key limitations in recent feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) methods built on Vision Transformer (ViT) backbones. While ViT-based pipelines offer strong geometric priors, they are often constrained by low-resolution inputs due to computational costs. Moreover, existing generative enhancement methods tend to be 3D-agnostic, resulting in inconsistent structures across views, especially in unseen regions. To overcome these challenges, we design a Dual-Domain Detail Perception Module, which enables handling high-resolution images without being limited by the ViT backbone, and endows Gaussians with additional features to store high-frequency details. We develop a feature-guided diffusion network, which can preserve high-frequency details during the restoration process. We introduce a unified training strategy that enables joint optimization of the ViT-based geometric backbone and the diffusion-based refinement module. Experiments demonstrate that our method can maintain superior generation quality across multiple datasets.</description>

      <title>ASBA: A-line State Space Model and B-line Attention for Sparse Optical Doppler Tomography Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical Doppler Tomography (ODT) is an emerging blood flow analysis technique. A 2D ODT image (B-scan) is generated by sequentially acquiring 1D depth-resolved raw A-scans (A-line) along the lateral axis (B-line), followed by Doppler phase-subtraction analysis. To ensure high-fidelity B-scan images, current practices rely on dense sampling, which prolongs scanning time, increases storage demands, and limits the capture of rapid blood flow dynamics. Recent studies have explored sparse sampling of raw A-scans to alleviate these limitations, but their effectiveness is hindered by the conservative sampling rates and the uniform modeling of flow and background signals. In this study, we introduce a novel blood flow-aware network, named ASBA (A-line ROI State space model and B-line phase Attention), to reconstruct ODT images from highly sparsely sampled raw A-scans. Specifically, we propose an A-line ROI state space model to extract sparsely distributed flow features along the A-line, and a B-line phase attention to capture long-range flow signals along each B-line based on phase difference. Moreover, we introduce a flow-aware weighted loss function that encourages the network to prioritize the accurate reconstruction of flow signals. Extensive experiments on real animal data demonstrate that the proposed approach clearly outperforms existing state-of-the-art reconstruction methods.</description>

      <title>Progressive self-supervised blind-spot denoising method for LDCT denoising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-supervised learning is increasingly investigated for low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) image denoising, as it alleviates the dependence on paired normal-dose CT (NDCT) data, which are often difficult to acquire in clinical practice. In this paper, we propose a novel self-supervised training strategy that relies exclusively on LDCT images. We introduce a step-wise blind-spot denoising mechanism that enforces conditional independence in a progressive manner, enabling more fine-grained denoising learning. In addition, we add Gaussian noise to LDCT images, which acts as a regularization and mitigates overfitting. Extensive experiments on the Mayo LDCT dataset demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms existing self-supervised approaches and achieves performance comparable to, or better than, several representative supervised denoising methods.</description>

      <title>IIR-VLM: In-Context Instance-level Recognition for Large Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Instance-level recognition (ILR) concerns distinguishing individual instances from one another, with person re-identification as a prominent example. Despite the impressive visual perception capabilities of modern VLMs, we find their performance on ILR unsatisfactory, often dramatically underperforming domain-specific ILR models. This limitation hinders many practical application of VLMs, e.g. where recognizing familiar people and objects is crucial for effective visual understanding. Existing solutions typically learn to recognize instances one at a time using instance-specific datasets, which not only incur substantial data collection and training costs but also struggle with fine-grained discrimination. In this work, we propose IIR-VLM, a VLM enhanced for In-context Instance-level Recognition. We integrate pre-trained ILR expert models as auxiliary visual encoders to provide specialized features for learning diverse instances, which enables VLMs to learn new instances in-context in a one-shot manner. Further, IIR-VLM leverages this knowledge for instance-aware visual understanding. We validate IIR-VLM's efficacy on existing instance personalization benchmarks. Finally, we demonstrate its superior ILR performance on a challenging new benchmark, which assesses ILR capabilities across varying difficulty and diverse categories, with person, face, pet and general objects as the instances at task.</description>

      <title>Rig-Aware 3D Reconstruction of Vehicle Undercarriages using Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspecting the undercarriage of used vehicles is a labor-intensive task that requires inspectors to crouch or crawl underneath each vehicle to thoroughly examine it. Additionally, online buyers rarely see undercarriage photos. We present an end-to-end pipeline that utilizes a three-camera rig to capture videos of the undercarriage as the vehicle drives over it, and produces an interactive 3D model of the undercarriage. The 3D model enables inspectors and customers to rotate, zoom, and slice through the undercarriage, allowing them to detect rust, leaks, or impact damage in seconds, thereby improving both workplace safety and buyer confidence. Our primary contribution is a rig-aware Structure-from-Motion (SfM) pipeline specifically designed to overcome the challenges of wide-angle lens distortion and low-parallax scenes. Our method overcomes the challenges of wide-angle lens distortion and low-parallax scenes by integrating precise camera calibration, synchronized video streams, and strong geometric priors from the camera rig. We use a constrained matching strategy with learned components, the DISK feature extractor, and the attention-based LightGlue matcher to generate high-quality sparse point clouds that are often unattainable with standard SfM pipelines. These point clouds seed the Gaussian splatting process to generate photorealistic undercarriage models that render in real-time. Our experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that our design choices are essential to achieve state-of-the-art quality.</description>

      <title>Soft Tail-dropping for Adaptive Visual Tokenization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Soft Tail-dropping Adaptive Tokenizer (STAT), a 1D discrete visual tokenizer that adaptively chooses the number of output tokens per image according to its structural complexity and level of detail. STAT encodes an image into a sequence of discrete codes together with per-token keep probabilities. Beyond standard autoencoder objectives, we regularize these keep probabilities to be monotonically decreasing along the sequence and explicitly align their distribution with an image-level complexity measure. As a result, STAT produces length-adaptive 1D visual tokens that are naturally compatible with causal 1D autoregressive (AR) visual generative models. On ImageNet-1k, equipping vanilla causal AR models with STAT yields competitive or superior visual generation quality compared to other probabilistic model families, while also exhibiting favorable scaling behavior that has been elusive in prior vanilla AR visual generation attempts.</description>

      <title>OmniTransfer: All-in-one Framework for Spatio-temporal Video Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Videos convey richer information than images or text, capturing both spatial and temporal dynamics. However, most existing video customization methods rely on reference images or task-specific temporal priors, failing to fully exploit the rich spatio-temporal information inherent in videos, thereby limiting flexibility and generalization in video generation. To address these limitations, we propose OmniTransfer, a unified framework for spatio-temporal video transfer. It leverages multi-view information across frames to enhance appearance consistency and exploits temporal cues to enable fine-grained temporal control. To unify various video transfer tasks, OmniTransfer incorporates three key designs: Task-aware Positional Bias that adaptively leverages reference video information to improve temporal alignment or appearance consistency; Reference-decoupled Causal Learning separating reference and target branches to enable precise reference transfer while improving efficiency; and Task-adaptive Multimodal Alignment using multimodal semantic guidance to dynamically distinguish and tackle different tasks. Extensive experiments show that OmniTransfer outperforms existing methods in appearance (ID and style) and temporal transfer (camera movement and video effects), while matching pose-guided methods in motion transfer without using pose, establishing a new paradigm for flexible, high-fidelity video generation.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present \textbf{LightOnOCR-2-1B}, a 1B-parameter end-to-end multilingual vision--language model that converts document images (e.g., PDFs) into clean, naturally ordered text without brittle OCR pipelines. Trained on a large-scale, high-quality distillation mix with strong coverage of scans, French documents, and scientific PDFs, LightOnOCR-2 achieves state-of-the-art results on OlmOCR-Bench while being 9$\times$ smaller and substantially faster than prior best-performing models. We further extend the output format to predict normalized bounding boxes for embedded images, introducing localization during pretraining via a resume strategy and refining it with RLVR using IoU-based rewards. Finally, we improve robustness with checkpoint averaging and task-arithmetic merging. We release model checkpoints under Apache 2.0, and publicly release the dataset and \textbf{LightOnOCR-bbox-bench} evaluation under their respective licenses.</description>

      <title>Motion 3-to-4: 3D Motion Reconstruction for 4D Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Motion 3-to-4, a feed-forward framework for synthesising high-quality 4D dynamic objects from a single monocular video and an optional 3D reference mesh. While recent advances have significantly improved 2D, video, and 3D content generation, 4D synthesis remains difficult due to limited training data and the inherent ambiguity of recovering geometry and motion from a monocular viewpoint. Motion 3-to-4 addresses these challenges by decomposing 4D synthesis into static 3D shape generation and motion reconstruction. Using a canonical reference mesh, our model learns a compact motion latent representation and predicts per-frame vertex trajectories to recover complete, temporally coherent geometry. A scalable frame-wise transformer further enables robustness to varying sequence lengths. Evaluations on both standard benchmarks and a new dataset with accurate ground-truth geometry show that Motion 3-to-4 delivers superior fidelity and spatial consistency compared to prior work.

      <title>VideoMaMa: Mask-Guided Video Matting via Generative Prior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalizing video matting models to real-world videos remains a significant challenge due to the scarcity of labeled data. To address this, we present Video Mask-to-Matte Model (VideoMaMa) that converts coarse segmentation masks into pixel accurate alpha mattes, by leveraging pretrained video diffusion models. VideoMaMa demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization to real-world footage, even though it is trained solely on synthetic data. Building on this capability, we develop a scalable pseudo-labeling pipeline for large-scale video matting and construct the Matting Anything in Video (MA-V) dataset, which offers high-quality matting annotations for more than 50K real-world videos spanning diverse scenes and motions. To validate the effectiveness of this dataset, we fine-tune the SAM2 model on MA-V to obtain SAM2-Matte, which outperforms the same model trained on existing matting datasets in terms of robustness on in-the-wild videos. These findings emphasize the importance of large-scale pseudo-labeled video matting and showcase how generative priors and accessible segmentation cues can drive scalable progress in video matting research.</description>

      <title>Implicit Neural Representation Facilitates Unified Universal Vision Encoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Models for image representation learning are typically designed for either recognition or generation. Various forms of contrastive learning help models learn to convert images to embeddings that are useful for classification, detection, and segmentation. On the other hand, models can be trained to reconstruct images with pixel-wise, perceptual, and adversarial losses in order to learn a latent space that is useful for image generation. We seek to unify these two directions with a first-of-its-kind model that learns representations which are simultaneously useful for recognition and generation. We train our model as a hyper-network for implicit neural representation, which learns to map images to model weights for fast, accurate reconstruction. We further integrate our INR hyper-network with knowledge distillation to improve its generalization and performance. Beyond the novel training design, the model also learns an unprecedented compressed embedding space with outstanding performance for various visual tasks. The complete model competes with state-of-the-art results for image representation learning, while also enabling generative capabilities with its high-quality tiny embeddings.

Abstract: This project explores how we engage with AI-generated content through the lens of the jutter: Dutch coastal foragers who comb the shoreline after storms, gathering and repurposing what the sea leaves behind. Reflecting how our lives are increasingly shaped by AI-generated media, we create a beach-like installation that blends real shoreline debris with AI-transformed images and videos. Visitors are invited to explore this space as contemporary jutters, deciding what to keep and what to discard. In doing so, the project reimagines AI-imagery as material for reflection, encouraging a more discerning engagement with the content that drifts through our feeds.

      <description>arXiv:2601.11656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modeling wireless channels accurately remains a challenge due to environmental variations and signal uncertainties. Recent neural networks can learn radio frequency~(RF) signal propagation patterns, but they process each voxel on the ray independently, without considering global context or environmental factors. Our paper presents a new approach that learns comprehensive representations of complete rays rather than individual points, capturing more detailed environmental features. We integrate a Kolmogorov-Arnold network (KAN) architecture with transformer modules to achieve better performance across realistic and synthetic scenes while maintaining computational efficiency. Our experimental results show that this approach outperforms existing methods in various scenarios. Ablation studies confirm that each component of our model contributes to its effectiveness. Additional experiments provide clear explanations for our model's performance.</description>

      <title>IPEC: Test-Time Incremental Prototype Enhancement Classifier for Few-Shot Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metric-based few-shot approaches have gained significant popularity due to their relatively straightforward implementation, high interpret ability, and computational efficiency. However, stemming from the batch-independence assumption during testing, which prevents the model from leveraging valuable knowledge accumulated from previous batches. To address these challenges, we propose a novel test-time method called Incremental Prototype Enhancement Classifier (IPEC), a test-time method that optimizes prototype estimation by leveraging information from previous query samples. IPEC maintains a dynamic auxiliary set by selectively incorporating query samples that are classified with high confidence. To ensure sample quality, we design a robust dual-filtering mechanism that assesses each query sample based on both global prediction confidence and local discriminative ability. By aggregating this auxiliary set with the support set in subsequent tasks, IPEC builds progressively more stable and representative prototypes, effectively reducing its reliance on the initial support set. We ground this approach in a Bayesian interpretation, conceptualizing the support set as a prior and the auxiliary set as a data-driven posterior, which in turn motivates the design of a practical "warm-up and test" two-stage inference protocol. Extensive empirical results validate the superior performance of our proposed method across multiple few-shot classification tasks.</description>

      <title>Pigment Network Detection and Classification in Dermoscopic Images Using Directional Imaging Algorithms and Convolutional Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Early diagnosis of melanoma, which can save thousands of lives, relies heavily on the analysis of dermoscopic images. One crucial diagnostic criterion is the identification of unusual pigment network (PN). However, distinguishing between regular (typical) and irregular (atypical) PN is challenging. This study aims to automate the PN detection process using a directional imaging algorithm and classify PN types using machine learning classifiers. The directional imaging algorithm incorporates Principal Component Analysis (PCA), contrast enhancement, filtering, and noise reduction. Applied to the PH2 dataset, this algorithm achieved a 96% success rate, which increased to 100% after pixel intensity adjustments. We created a new dataset containing only PN images from these results. We then employed two classifiers, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Bag of Features (BoF), to categorize PN into atypical and typical classes. Given the limited dataset of 200 images, a simple and effective CNN was designed, featuring two convolutional layers and two batch normalization layers. The proposed CNN achieved 90% accuracy, 90% sensitivity, and 89% specificity. When compared to state-of-the-art methods, our CNN demonstrated superior performance. Our study highlights the potential of the proposed CNN model for effective PN classification, suggesting future research should focus on expanding datasets and incorporating additional dermatological features to further enhance melanoma diagnosis.</description>

Abstract: Low-count positron emission tomography (PET) reconstruction is a challenging inverse problem due to severe degradations arising from Poisson noise, photon scarcity, and attenuation correction errors. Existing deep learning methods typically address these in the spatial domain with an undifferentiated optimization objective, making it difficult to disentangle overlapping artifacts and limiting correction effectiveness. In this work, we perform a Fourier-domain analysis and reveal that these degradations are spectrally separable: Poisson noise and photon scarcity cause high-frequency phase perturbations, while attenuation errors suppress low-frequency amplitude components. Leveraging this insight, we propose FourierPET, a Fourier-based unrolled reconstruction framework grounded in the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers. It consists of three tailored modules: a spectral consistency module that enforces global frequency alignment to maintain data fidelity, an amplitude-phase correction module that decouples and compensates for high-frequency phase distortions and low-frequency amplitude suppression, and a dual adjustment module that accelerates convergence during iterative reconstruction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FourierPET achieves state-of-the-art performance with significantly fewer parameters, while offering enhanced interpretability through frequency-aware correction.</description>

      <title>Mobile-friendly Image de-noising: Hardware Conscious Optimization for Edge Application</title>

Abstract: Image enhancement is a critical task in computer vision and photography that is often entangled with noise. This renders the traditional Image Signal Processing (ISP) ineffective compared to the advances in deep learning. However, the success of such methods is increasingly associated with the ease of their deployment on edge devices, such as smartphones. This work presents a novel mobile-friendly network for image de-noising obtained with Entropy-Regularized differentiable Neural Architecture Search (NAS) on a hardware-aware search space for a U-Net architecture, which is first-of-its-kind. The designed model has 12% less parameters, with ~2-fold improvement in ondevice latency and 1.5-fold improvement in the memory footprint for a 0.7% drop in PSNR, when deployed and profiled on Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra. Compared to the SOTA Swin-Transformer for Image Restoration, the proposed network had competitive accuracy with ~18-fold reduction in GMACs. Further, the network was tested successfully for Gaussian de-noising with 3 intensities on 4 benchmarks and real-world de-noising on 1 benchmark demonstrating its generalization ability.</description>

      <title>Towards Efficient Image Deblurring for Edge Deployment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Image deblurring is a critical stage in mobile image signal processing pipelines, where the ability to restore fine structures and textures must be balanced with real-time constraints on edge devices. While recent deep networks such as transformers and activation-free architectures achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) accuracy, their efficiency is typically measured in FLOPs or parameters, which do not correlate with latency on embedded hardware. We propose a hardware-aware adaptation framework that restructures existing models through sensitivity-guided block substitution, surrogate distillation, and training-free multi-objective search driven by device profiling. Applied to the 36-block NAFNet baseline, the optimized variants achieve up to 55% reduction in GMACs compared to the recent transformer-based SOTA while maintaining competitive accuracy. Most importantly, on-device deployment yields a 1.25X latency improvement over the baseline. Experiments on motion deblurring (GoPro), defocus deblurring (DPDD), and auxiliary benchmarks (RealBlur-J/R, HIDE) demonstrate the generality of the approach, while comparisons with prior efficient baselines confirm its accuracy-efficiency trade-off. These results establish feedback-driven adaptation as a principled strategy for bridging the gap between algorithmic design and deployment-ready deblurring models.</description>

      <title>Bridging Modalities: Joint Synthesis and Registration Framework for Aligning Diffusion MRI with T1-Weighted Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal image registration between diffusion MRI (dMRI) and T1-weighted (T1w) MRI images is a critical step for aligning diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) data with structural anatomical space. Traditional registration methods often struggle to ensure accuracy due to the large intensity differences between diffusion data and high-resolution anatomical structures. This paper proposes an unsupervised registration framework based on a generative registration network, which transforms the original multimodal registration problem between b0 and T1w images into a unimodal registration task between a generated image and the real T1w image. This effectively reduces the complexity of cross-modal registration. The framework first employs an image synthesis model to generate images with T1w-like contrast, and then learns a deformation field from the generated image to the fixed T1w image. The registration network jointly optimizes local structural similarity and cross-modal statistical dependency to improve deformation estimation accuracy. Experiments conducted on two independent datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms several state-of-the-art approaches in multimodal registration tasks.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic Tensor Deconvolution of Hyperspectral Images</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.11694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) deconvolution is a challenging ill-posed inverse problem, made difficult by the data's high dimensionality.We propose a parameter-parsimonious framework based on a low-rank Canonical Polyadic Decomposition (CPD) of the entire latent HSI $\mathbf{\mathcal{X}} \in \mathbb{R}^{P\times Q \times N}$.This approach recasts the problem from recovering a large-scale image with $PQN$ variables to estimating the CPD factors with $(P+Q+N)R$ variables.This model also enables a structure-aware, anisotropic Total Variation (TV) regularization applied only to the spatial factors, preserving the smooth spectral signatures.An efficient algorithm based on the Proximal Alternating Linearized Minimization (PALM) framework is developed to solve the resulting non-convex optimization problem.Experiments confirm the model's efficiency, showing a numerous parameter reduction of over two orders of magnitude and a compelling trade-off between model compactness and reconstruction accuracy.</description>

      <title>Risk-Aware Human-in-the-Loop Framework with Adaptive Intrusion Response for Autonomous Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous vehicles must remain safe and effective when encountering rare long-tailed scenarios or cyber-physical intrusions during driving. We present RAIL, a risk-aware human-in-the-loop framework that turns heterogeneous runtime signals into calibrated control adaptations and focused learning. RAIL fuses three cues (curvature actuation integrity, time-to-collision proximity, and observation-shift consistency) into an Intrusion Risk Score (IRS) via a weighted Noisy-OR. When IRS exceeds a threshold, actions are blended with a cue-specific shield using a learned authority, while human override remains available; when risk is low, the nominal policy executes. A contextual bandit arbitrates among shields based on the cue vector, improving mitigation choices online. RAIL couples Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) with risk-prioritized replay and dual rewards so that takeovers and near misses steer learning while nominal behavior remains covered. On MetaDrive, RAIL achieves a Test Return (TR) of 360.65, a Test Success Rate (TSR) of 0.85, a Test Safety Violation (TSV) of 0.75, and a Disturbance Rate (DR) of 0.0027, while logging only 29.07 training safety violations, outperforming RL, safe RL, offline/imitation learning, and prior HITL baselines. Under Controller Area Network (CAN) injection and LiDAR spoofing attacks, it improves Success Rate (SR) to 0.68 and 0.80, lowers the Disengagement Rate under Attack (DRA) to 0.37 and 0.03, and reduces the Attack Success Rate (ASR) to 0.34 and 0.11. In CARLA, RAIL attains a TR of 1609.70 and TSR of 0.41 with only 8000 steps.</description>

      <title>Physics-Constrained Denoising Autoencoders for Data-Scarce Wildfire UAV Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wildfire monitoring requires high-resolution atmospheric measurements, yet low-cost sensors on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) exhibit baseline drift, cross-sensitivity, and response lag that corrupt concentration estimates. Traditional deep learning denoising approaches demand large datasets impractical to obtain from limited UAV flight campaigns. We present PC$^2$DAE, a physics-informed denoising autoencoder that addresses data scarcity by embedding physical constraints directly into the network architecture. Non-negative concentration estimates are enforced via softplus activations and physically plausible temporal smoothing, ensuring outputs are physically admissible by construction rather than relying on loss function penalties. The architecture employs hierarchical decoder heads for Black Carbon, Gas, and CO$_2$ sensor families, with two variants: PC$^2$DAE-Lean (21k parameters) for edge deployment and PC$^2$DAE-Wide (204k parameters) for offline processing. We evaluate on 7,894 synchronized 1 Hz samples collected from UAV flights during prescribed burns in Saskatchewan, Canada (approximately 2.2 hours of flight data), two orders of magnitude below typical deep learning requirements. PC$^2$DAE-Lean achieves 67.3\% smoothness improvement and 90.7\% high-frequency noise reduction with zero physics violations. Five baselines (LSTM-AE, U-Net, Transformer, CBDAE, DeSpaWN) produce 15--23\% negative outputs. The lean variant outperforms wide (+5.6\% smoothness), suggesting reduced capacity with strong inductive bias prevents overfitting in data-scarce regimes. Training completes in under 65 seconds on consumer hardware.</description>

      <title>MixFlow: Mixture-Conditioned Flow Matching for Out-of-Distribution Generalization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.11827v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Achieving robust generalization under distribution shift remains a central challenge in conditional generative modeling, as existing conditional flow-based methods often struggle to extrapolate beyond the training conditions. We introduce MixFlow, a conditional flow-matching framework for descriptor-controlled generation that directly targets this limitation by jointly learning a descriptor-conditioned base distribution and a descriptor-conditioned flow field via shortest-path flow matching. By modeling the base distribution as a learnable, descriptor-dependent mixture, MixFlow enables smooth interpolation and extrapolation to unseen conditions, leading to substantially improved out-of-distribution generalization. We provide analytical insights into the behavior of the proposed framework and empirically demonstrate its effectiveness across multiple domains, including prediction of responses to unseen perturbations in single-cell transcriptomic data and high-content microscopy-based drug screening tasks. Across these diverse settings, MixFlow consistently outperforms standard conditional flow-matching baselines. Overall, MixFlow offers a simple yet powerful approach for achieving robust, generalizable, and controllable generative modeling across heterogeneous domains.</description>

      <title>Karhunen-Lo\`eve Expansion-Based Residual Anomaly Map for Resource-Efficient Glioma MRI Segmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.11833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate segmentation of brain tumors is essential for clinical diagnosis and treatment planning. Deep learning is currently the state-of-the-art for brain tumor segmentation, yet it requires either large datasets or extensive computational resources that are inaccessible in most areas. This makes the problem increasingly difficult: state-of-the-art models use thousands of training cases and vast computational power, where performance drops sharply when either is limited. The top performer in the Brats GLI 2023 competition relied on supercomputers trained on over 92,000 augmented MRI scans using an AMD EPYC 7402 CPU, six NVIDIA RTX 6000 GPUs (48GB VRAM each), and 1024GB of RAM over multiple weeks. To address this, the Karhunen--Lo\`eve Expansion (KLE) was implemented as a feature extraction step on downsampled, z-score normalized MRI volumes. Each 240$\times$240$\times$155 multi-modal scan is reduced to four $48^3$ channels and compressed into 32 KL coefficients. The resulting approximate reconstruction enables a residual-based anomaly map, which is upsampled and added as a fifth channel to a compact 3D U-Net. All experiments were run on a consumer workstation (AMD Ryzen 5 7600X CPU, RTX 4060Ti (8GB VRAM), and 64GB RAM while using far fewer training cases. This model achieves post-processed Dice scores of 0.929 (WT), 0.856 (TC), and 0.821 (ET), with HD95 distances of 2.93, 6.78, and 10.35 voxels. These results are significantly better than the winning BraTS 2023 methodology for HD95 distances and WT dice scores. This demonstrates that a KLE-based residual anomaly map can dramatically reduce computational cost and data requirements while retaining state-of-the-art performance.</description>

      <title>AI for Green Spaces: Leveraging Autonomous Navigation and Computer Vision for Park Litter Removal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.11876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There are 50 billion pieces of litter in the U.S. alone. Grass fields contribute to this problem because picnickers tend to leave trash on the field. We propose building a robot that can autonomously navigate, identify, and pick up trash in parks. To autonomously navigate the park, we used a Spanning Tree Coverage (STC) algorithm to generate a coverage path the robot could follow. To navigate this path, we successfully used Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) GPS, which provides a centimeter-level reading every second. For computer vision, we utilized the ResNet50 Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which detects trash with 94.52% accuracy. For trash pickup, we tested multiple design concepts. We select a new pickup mechanism that specifically targets the trash we encounter on the field. Our solution achieved an overall success rate of 80%, demonstrating that autonomous trash pickup robots on grass fields are a viable solution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.11878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To develop a deep-learning method for achieving fast high-resolution MR elastography from highly undersampled data without the need of high-quality training dataset. We first framed the deep neural network representation as a nonlinear extension of the linear subspace model, then used it to represent and reconstruct MRE image repetitions from undersampled k-space data. The network weights were learned using a multi-level k-space consistent loss in a self-supervised manner. To further enhance reconstruction quality, phase-contrast specific magnitude and phase priors were incorporated, including the similarity of anatomical structures and smoothness of wave-induced harmonic displacement. Experiments were conducted using both 3D gradient-echo spiral and multi-slice spin-echo spiral MRE datasets. Compared to the conventional linear subspace-based approaches, the nonlinear network representation method was able to produce superior image reconstruction with suppressed noise and artifacts from a single in-plane spiral arm per MRE repetition (e.g., total R=10), yielding comparable stiffness estimation to the fully sampled data. This work demonstrated the feasibility of using deep network representations to model and reconstruct MRE images from highly-undersampled data, a nonlinear extension of the subspace-based approaches.</description>

      <title>A Constraint Programming Model for the Super-Agile Earth Observation Satellite Imaging Scheduling Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the dependence on satellite imaging continues to grow, modern satellites have become increasingly agile, with the new generation, namely super-agile Earth observation satellites (SAEOS), providing unprecedented imaging flexibility. The highly dynamic capabilities of these satellites introduce additional challenges to the scheduling of observation tasks, as existing approaches for conventional agile satellites do not account for variable observation durations and multiple imaging directions. Although some efforts have been made in this regard, the SAEOS imaging scheduling problem (SAEOS-ISP) remains largely unexplored, and no exact approaches have yet been proposed. In this context, this study presents the first exact Constraint Programming formulation for the SAEOS-ISP, considering flexible observation windows, multiple pointing directions and sequence-dependent transition times across multiple satellites. Computational experiments on a newly generated benchmark set demonstrate that the model can be solved efficiently and within very short computational times. Moreover, the results also show that the proposed approach has the potential to achieve higher computational performance compared to the non-exact approaches that are currently considered state-of-the-art.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Feedback for Handheld Tool Guidance: Combining Wrist-Based Haptics with Augmented Reality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate how vibrotactile wrist feedback can enhance spatial guidance for handheld tool movement in optical see-through augmented reality (AR). While AR overlays are widely used to support surgical tasks, visual occlusion, lighting conditions, and interface ambiguity can compromise precision and confidence. To address these challenges, we designed a multimodal system combining AR visuals with a custom wrist-worn haptic device delivering directional and state-based cues. A formative study with experienced surgeons and residents identified key tool maneuvers and preferences for reference mappings, guiding our cue design. In a cue identification experiment (N=21), participants accurately recognized five vibration patterns under visual load, with higher recognition for full-actuator states than spatial direction cues. In a guidance task (N=27), participants using both AR and haptics achieved significantly higher spatial precision (5.8 mm) and usability (SUS = 88.1) than those using either modality alone, despite having modest increases in task time. Participants reported that haptic cues provided reassuring confirmation and reduced cognitive effort during alignment. Our results highlight the promise of integrating wrist-based haptics into AR systems for high-precision, visually complex tasks such as surgical guidance. We discuss design implications for multimodal interfaces supporting confident, efficient tool manipulation.</description>

However, MoE models are plagued by two fundamental challenges: 1) a load imbalance problem known as the``rich get richer" phenomenon, where a few experts are over-utilized, and 2) an expert homogeneity problem, where experts learn redundant representations, negating their purpose. Current solutions typically employ an auxiliary load-balancing loss that, while mitigating imbalance, often exacerbates homogeneity by enforcing uniform routing at the expense of specialization. To resolve this, we introduce the Eigen-Mixture-of-Experts (EMoE), a novel architecture that leverages a routing mechanism based on a learned orthonormal eigenbasis. EMoE projects input tokens onto this shared eigenbasis and routes them based on their alignment with the principal components of the feature space. This principled, geometric partitioning of data intrinsically promotes both balanced expert utilization and the development of diverse, specialized experts, all without the need for a conflicting auxiliary loss function.

      <title>Proc3D: Procedural 3D Generation and Parametric Editing of 3D Shapes with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12234</link>

Abstract: Generating 3D models has traditionally been a complex task requiring specialized expertise. While recent advances in generative AI have sought to automate this process, existing methods produce non-editable representation, such as meshes or point clouds, limiting their adaptability for iterative design. In this paper, we introduce Proc3D, a system designed to generate editable 3D models while enabling real-time modifications. At its core, Proc3D introduces procedural compact graph (PCG), a graph representation of 3D models, that encodes the algorithmic rules and structures necessary for generating the model. This representation exposes key parameters, allowing intuitive manual adjustments via sliders and checkboxes, as well as real-time, automated modifications through natural language prompts using Large Language Models (LLMs). We demonstrate Proc3D's capabilities using two generative approaches: GPT-4o with in-context learning (ICL) and a fine-tuned LLAMA-3 model. Experimental results show that Proc3D outperforms existing methods in editing efficiency, achieving more than 400x speedup over conventional approaches that require full regeneration for each modification. Additionally, Proc3D improves ULIP scores by 28%, a metric that evaluates the alignment between generated 3D models and text prompts. By enabling text-aligned 3D model generation along with precise, real-time parametric edits, Proc3D facilitates highly accurate text-based image editing applications.</description>

      <title>Breaking Coordinate Overfitting: Geometry-Aware WiFi Sensing for Cross-Layout 3D Pose Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: WiFi-based 3D human pose estimation offers a low-cost and privacy-preserving alternative to vision-based systems for smart interaction. However, existing approaches rely on visual 3D poses as supervision and directly regress CSI to a camera-based coordinate system. We find that this practice leads to coordinate overfitting: models memorize deployment-specific WiFi transceiver layouts rather than only learning activity-relevant representations, resulting in severe generalization failures. To address this challenge, we present PerceptAlign, the first geometry-conditioned framework for WiFi-based cross-layout pose estimation. PerceptAlign introduces a lightweight coordinate unification procedure that aligns WiFi and vision measurements in a shared 3D space using only two checkerboards and a few photos. Within this unified space, it encodes calibrated transceiver positions into high-dimensional embeddings and fuses them with CSI features, making the model explicitly aware of device geometry as a conditional variable. This design forces the network to disentangle human motion from deployment layouts, enabling robust and, for the first time, layout-invariant WiFi pose estimation. To support systematic evaluation, we construct the largest cross-domain 3D WiFi pose estimation dataset to date, comprising 21 subjects, 5 scenes, 18 actions, and 7 device layouts. Experiments show that PerceptAlign reduces in-domain error by 12.3% and cross-domain error by more than 60% compared to state-of-the-art baselines. These results establish geometry-conditioned learning as a viable path toward scalable and practical WiFi sensing.</description>

      <title>DeepRAHT: Learning Predictive RAHT for Point Cloud Attribute Compression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Regional Adaptive Hierarchical Transform (RAHT) is an effective point cloud attribute compression (PCAC) method. However, its application in deep learning lacks research. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end RAHT framework for lossy PCAC based on the sparse tensor, called DeepRAHT. The RAHT transform is performed within the learning reconstruction process, without requiring manual RAHT for preprocessing. We also introduce the predictive RAHT to reduce bitrates and design a learning-based prediction model to enhance performance. Moreover, we devise a bitrate proxy that applies run-length coding to entropy model, achieving seamless variable-rate coding and improving robustness. DeepRAHT is a reversible and distortion-controllable framework, ensuring its lower bound performance and offering significant application potential. The experiments demonstrate that DeepRAHT is a high-performance, faster, and more robust solution than the baseline methods. Project Page: https://github.com/zb12138/DeepRAHT.</description>

      <title>DALD-PCAC: Density-Adaptive Learning Descriptor for Point Cloud Lossless Attribute Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, deep learning has significantly advanced the performance of point cloud geometry compression. However, the learning-based lossless attribute compression of point clouds with varying densities is under-explored. In this paper, we develop a learning-based framework, namely DALD-PCAC that leverages Levels of Detail (LoD) to tailor for point cloud lossless attribute compression. We develop a point-wise attention model using a permutation-invariant Transformer to tackle the challenges of sparsity and irregularity of point clouds during context modeling. We also propose a Density-Adaptive Learning Descriptor (DALD) capable of capturing structure and correlations among points across a large range of neighbors. In addition, we develop a prior-guided block partitioning to reduce the attribute variance within blocks and enhance the performance. Experiments on LiDAR and object point clouds show that DALD-PCAC achieves the state-of-the-art performance on most data. Our method boosts the compression performance and is robust to the varying densities of point clouds. Moreover, it guarantees a good trade-off between performance and complexity, exhibiting great potential in real-world applications.

      <title>OpenNavMap: Structure-Free Topometric Mapping via Large-Scale Collaborative Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scalable and maintainable map representations are fundamental to enabling large-scale visual navigation and facilitating the deployment of robots in real-world environments. While collaborative localization across multi-session mapping enhances efficiency, traditional structure-based methods struggle with high maintenance costs and fail in feature-less environments or under significant viewpoint changes typical of crowd-sourced data. To address this, we propose OPENNAVMAP, a lightweight, structure-free topometric system leveraging 3D geometric foundation models for on-demand reconstruction. Our method unifies dynamic programming-based sequence matching, geometric verification, and confidence-calibrated optimization to robust, coarse-to-fine submap alignment without requiring pre-built 3D models. Evaluations on the Map-Free benchmark demonstrate superior accuracy over structure-from-motion and regression baselines, achieving an average translation error of 0.62m. Furthermore, the system maintains global consistency across 15km of multi-session data with an absolute trajectory error below 3m for map merging. Finally, we validate practical utility through 12 successful autonomous image-goal navigation tasks on simulated and physical robots. Code and datasets will be publicly available in https://rpl-cs-ucl.github.io/OpenNavMap_page.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, video-based world models that learn to simulate the dynamics have gained increasing attention in robot learning. However, current approaches primarily emphasize visual generative quality while overlooking physical fidelity, dynamic consistency, and task logic, especially for contact-rich manipulation tasks, which limits their applicability to downstream tasks. To this end, we introduce ReWorld, a framework aimed to employ reinforcement learning to align the video-based embodied world models with physical realism, task completion capability, embodiment plausibility and visual quality. Specifically, we first construct a large-scale (~235K) video preference dataset and employ it to train a hierarchical reward model designed to capture multi-dimensional reward consistent with human preferences. We further propose a practical alignment algorithm that post-trains flow-based world models using this reward through a computationally efficient PPO-style algorithm. Comprehensive experiments and theoretical analysis demonstrate that ReWorld significantly improves the physical fidelity, logical coherence, embodiment and visual quality of generated rollouts, outperforming previous methods.</description>

      <title>Constraint-Aware Neurosymbolic Uncertainty Quantification with Bayesian Deep Learning for Scientific Discovery</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scientific Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications require models that deliver trustworthy uncertainty estimates while respecting domain constraints. Existing uncertainty quantification methods lack mechanisms to incorporate symbolic scientific knowledge, while neurosymbolic approaches operate deterministically without principled uncertainty modeling. We introduce the Constraint-Aware Neurosymbolic Uncertainty Framework (CANUF), unifying Bayesian deep learning with differentiable symbolic reasoning. The architecture comprises three components: automated constraint extraction from scientific literature, probabilistic neural backbone with variational inference, and differentiable constraint satisfaction layer ensuring physical consistency. Experiments on Materials Project (140,000+ materials), QM9 molecular properties, and climate benchmarks show CANUF reduces Expected Calibration Error by 34.7% versus Bayesian neural networks while maintaining 99.2% constraint satisfaction. Ablations reveal constraint-guided recalibration contributes 18.3% performance gain, with constraint extraction achieving 91.4% precision. CANUF provides the first end-to-end differentiable pipeline simultaneously addressing uncertainty quantification, constraint satisfaction, and interpretable explanations for scientific predictions.</description>

      <title>Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning with Verifiable Fairness Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated learning enables collaborative model training across distributed institutions without centralizing sensitive data; however, ensuring algorithmic fairness across heterogeneous data distributions while preserving privacy remains fundamentally unresolved. This paper introduces CryptoFair-FL, a novel cryptographic framework providing the first verifiable fairness guarantees for federated learning systems under formal security definitions. The proposed approach combines additively homomorphic encryption with secure multi-party computation to enable privacy-preserving verification of demographic parity and equalized odds metrics without revealing protected attribute distributions or individual predictions. A novel batched verification protocol reduces computational complexity from BigO(n^2) to BigO(n \log n) while maintaining (\dparam, \deltap)-differential privacy with dparam = 0.5 and deltap = 10^{-6}. Theoretical analysis establishes information-theoretic lower bounds on the privacy cost of fairness verification, demonstrating that the proposed protocol achieves near-optimal privacy-fairness tradeoffs. Comprehensive experiments across four benchmark datasets (MIMIC-IV healthcare records, Adult Income, CelebA, and a novel FedFair-100 benchmark) demonstrate that CryptoFair-FL reduces fairness violations from 0.231 to 0.031 demographic parity difference while incurring only 2.3 times computational overhead compared to standard federated averaging. The framework successfully defends against attribute inference attacks, maintaining adversarial success probability below 0.05 across all tested configurations. These results establish a practical pathway for deploying fairness-aware federated learning in regulated industries requiring both privacy protection and algorithmic accountability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Future direct-imaging flagship missions, such as NASA's Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO), face critical decisions in prioritizing observations due to extremely stringent time and resource constraints. In this paper, we introduce two advanced machine-learning architectures tailored for predicting biosignature species fluxes from exoplanetary reflected-light spectra: a Bayesian Convolutional Neural Network (BCNN) and our novel model architecture, the Spectral Query Adaptive Transformer (SQuAT). The BCNN robustly quantifies both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties, offering reliable predictions under diverse observational conditions, whereas SQuAT employs query-driven attention mechanisms to enhance interpretability by explicitly associating spectral features with specific biosignature species. We demonstrate that both models achieve comparably high predictive accuracy on an augmented dataset spanning a wide range of exoplanetary conditions, while highlighting their distinct advantages in uncertainty quantification and spectral interpretability. These capabilities position our methods as promising tools for accelerating target triage, optimizing observation schedules, and maximizing scientific return for upcoming flagship missions such as HWO.</description>

      <title>Towards Robust Universal Perturbation Attacks: A Float-Coded, Penalty-Driven Evolutionary Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Universal adversarial perturbations (UAPs) have garnered significant attention due to their ability to undermine deep neural networks across multiple inputs using a single noise pattern. Evolutionary algorithms offer a promising approach to generating such perturbations due to their ability to navigate non-convex, gradient-free landscapes. In this work, we introduce a float-coded, penalty-driven single-objective evolutionary framework for UAP generation that achieves lower visibility perturbations while enhancing attack success rates. Our approach leverages continuous gene representations aligned with contemporary deep learning scales, incorporates dynamic evolutionary operators with adaptive scheduling, and utilizes a modular PyTorch implementation for seamless integration with modern architectures. Additionally, we ensure the universality of the generated perturbations by testing across diverse models and by periodically switching batches to prevent overfitting. Experimental results on the ImageNet dataset demonstrate that our framework consistently produces perturbations with smaller norms, higher misclassification effectiveness, and faster convergence compared to existing evolutionary-based methods. These findings highlight the robustness and scalability of our approach for universal adversarial attacks across various deep learning architectures.</description>

      <title>VIRO: Robust and Efficient Neuro-Symbolic Reasoning with Verification for Referring Expression Comprehension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) aims to localize the image region corresponding to a natural-language query. Recent neuro-symbolic REC approaches leverage large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) to perform compositional reasoning, decomposing queries 4 structured programs and executing them step-by-step. While such approaches achieve interpretable reasoning and strong zero-shot generalization, they assume that intermediate reasoning steps are accurate. However, this assumption causes cascading errors: false detections and invalid relations propagate through the reasoning chain, yielding high-confidence false positives even when no target is present in the image. To address this limitation, we introduce Verification-Integrated Reasoning Operators (VIRO), a neuro-symbolic framework that embeds lightweight operator-level verifiers within reasoning steps. Each operator executes and validates its output, such as object existence or spatial relationship, thereby allowing the system to robustly handle no-target cases when verification conditions are not met. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance, reaching 61.1% balanced accuracy across target-present and no-target settings, and demonstrates generalization to real-world egocentric data. Furthermore, VIRO shows superior computational efficiency in terms of throughput, high reliability with a program failure rate of less than 0.3%, and scalability through decoupled program generation from execution.</description>

      <title>FRoM-W1: Towards General Humanoid Whole-Body Control with Language Instructions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Humanoid robots are capable of performing various actions such as greeting, dancing and even backflipping. However, these motions are often hard-coded or specifically trained, which limits their versatility. In this work, we present FRoM-W1, an open-source framework designed to achieve general humanoid whole-body motion control using natural language. To universally understand natural language and generate corresponding motions, as well as enable various humanoid robots to stably execute these motions in the physical world under gravity, FRoM-W1 operates in two stages: (a) H-GPT: utilizing massive human data, a large-scale language-driven human whole-body motion generation model is trained to generate diverse natural behaviors. We further leverage the Chain-of-Thought technique to improve the model's generalization in instruction understanding. (b) H-ACT: After retargeting generated human whole-body motions into robot-specific actions, a motion controller that is pretrained and further fine-tuned through reinforcement learning in physical simulation enables humanoid robots to accurately and stably perform corresponding actions. It is then deployed on real robots via a modular simulation-to-reality module. We extensively evaluate FRoM-W1 on Unitree H1 and G1 robots. Results demonstrate superior performance on the HumanML3D-X benchmark for human whole-body motion generation, and our introduced reinforcement learning fine-tuning consistently improves both motion tracking accuracy and task success rates of these humanoid robots. We open-source the entire FRoM-W1 framework and hope it will advance the development of humanoid intelligence.</description>

      <title>Joint Source-Channel-Generation Coding: From Distortion-oriented Reconstruction to Semantic-consistent Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conventional communication systems, including both separation-based coding and AI-driven joint source-channel coding (JSCC), are largely guided by Shannon's rate-distortion theory. However, relying on generic distortion metrics fails to capture complex human visual perception, often resulting in blurred or unrealistic reconstructions. In this paper, we propose Joint Source-Channel-Generation Coding (JSCGC), a novel paradigm that shifts the focus from deterministic reconstruction to probabilistic generation. JSCGC leverages a generative model at the receiver as a generator rather than a conventional decoder to parameterize the data distribution, enabling direct maximization of mutual information under channel constraints while controlling stochastic sampling to produce outputs residing on the authentic data manifold with high fidelity. We further derive a theoretical lower bound on the maximum semantic inconsistency with given transmitted mutual information, elucidating the fundamental limits of communication in controlling the generative process. Extensive experiments on image transmission demonstrate that JSCGC substantially improves perceptual quality and semantic fidelity, significantly outperforming conventional distortion-oriented JSCC methods.</description>

      <title>Data-Consistent Learning of Inverse Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inverse problems are inherently ill-posed, suffering from non-uniqueness and instability. Classical regularization methods provide mathematically well-founded solutions, ensuring stability and convergence, but often at the cost of reduced flexibility or visual quality. Learned reconstruction methods, such as convolutional neural networks, can produce visually compelling results, yet they typically lack rigorous theoretical guarantees. DC (DC) networks address this gap by enforcing the measurement model within the network architecture. In particular, null-space networks combined with a classical regularization method as an initial reconstruction define a convergent regularization method. This approach preserves the theoretical reliability of classical schemes while leveraging the expressive power of data-driven learning, yielding reconstructions that are both accurate and visually appealing.</description>

      <title>Accurate Simulation Pipeline for Passive Single-Photon Imaging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single-Photon Avalanche Diodes (SPADs) are new and promising imaging sensors. These sensors are sensitive enough to detect individual photons hitting each pixel, with extreme temporal resolution and without readout noise. Thus, SPADs stand out as an optimal choice for low-light imaging. Due to the high price and limited availability of SPAD sensors, the demand for an accurate data simulation pipeline is substantial. Indeed, the scarcity of SPAD datasets hinders the development of SPAD-specific processing algorithms and impedes the training of learning-based solutions.
  In this paper, we present a comprehensive SPAD simulation pipeline and validate it with multiple experiments using two recent commercial SPAD sensors. Our simulator is used to generate the SPAD-MNIST, a single-photon version of the seminal MNIST dataset, to investigate the effectiveness of convolutional neural network (CNN) classifiers on reconstructed fluxes, even at extremely low light conditions, e.g., 5 mlux. We also assess the performance of classifiers exclusively trained on simulated data on real images acquired from SPAD sensors at different light conditions. The synthetic dataset encompasses different SPAD imaging modalities and is made available for download. Project page: https://boracchi.faculty.polimi.it/Projects/SPAD-MNIST.html.</description>

      <title>Sparse ActionGen: Accelerating Diffusion Policy with Real-time Pruning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion Policy has dominated action generation due to its strong capabilities for modeling multi-modal action distributions, but its multi-step denoising processes make it impractical for real-time visuomotor control. Existing caching-based acceleration methods typically rely on $\textit{static}$ schedules that fail to adapt to the $\textit{dynamics}$ of robot-environment interactions, thereby leading to suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose $\underline{\textbf{S}}$parse $\underline{\textbf{A}}$ction$\underline{\textbf{G}}$en ($\textbf{SAG}$) for extremely sparse action generation. To accommodate the iterative interactions, SAG customizes a rollout-adaptive prune-then-reuse mechanism that first identifies prunable computations globally and then reuses cached activations to substitute them during action diffusion. To capture the rollout dynamics, SAG parameterizes an observation-conditioned diffusion pruner for environment-aware adaptation and instantiates it with a highly parameter- and inference-efficient design for real-time prediction. Furthermore, SAG introduces a one-for-all reusing strategy that reuses activations across both timesteps and blocks in a zig-zag manner, minimizing the global redundancy. Extensive experiments on multiple robotic benchmarks demonstrate that SAG achieves up to 4$\times$ generation speedup without sacrificing performance.

      <title>AI-generated data contamination erodes pathological variability and diagnostic reliability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly populating medical records with synthetic content, creating a feedback loop where future models are increasingly at risk of training on uncurated AI-generated data. However, the clinical consequences of this AI-generated data contamination remain unexplored. Here, we show that in the absence of mandatory human verification, this self-referential cycle drives a rapid erosion of pathological variability and diagnostic reliability. By analysing more than 800,000 synthetic data points across clinical text generation, vision-language reporting, and medical image synthesis, we find that models progressively converge toward generic phenotypes regardless of the model architecture. Specifically, rare but critical findings, including pneumothorax and effusions, vanish from the synthetic content generated by AI models, while demographic representations skew heavily toward middle-aged male phenotypes. Crucially, this degradation is masked by false diagnostic confidence; models continue to issue reassuring reports while failing to detect life-threatening pathology, with false reassurance rates tripling to 40%. Blinded physician evaluation confirms that this decoupling of confidence and accuracy renders AI-generated documentation clinically useless after just two generations. We systematically evaluate three mitigation strategies, finding that while synthetic volume scaling fails to prevent collapse, mixing real data with quality-aware filtering effectively preserves diversity. Ultimately, our results suggest that without policy-mandated human oversight, the deployment of generative AI threatens to degrade the very healthcare data ecosystems it relies upon.</description>

      <title>LLM-VLM Fusion Framework for Autonomous Maritime Port Inspection using a Heterogeneous UAV-USV System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Maritime port inspection plays a critical role in ensuring safety, regulatory compliance, and operational efficiency in complex maritime environments. However, existing inspection methods often rely on manual operations and conventional computer vision techniques that lack scalability and contextual understanding. This study introduces a novel integrated engineering framework that utilizes the synergy between Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs) to enable autonomous maritime port inspection using cooperative aerial and surface robotic platforms. The proposed framework replaces traditional state-machine mission planners with LLM-driven symbolic planning and improved perception pipelines through VLM-based semantic inspection, enabling context-aware and adaptive monitoring. The LLM module translates natural language mission instructions into executable symbolic plans with dependency graphs that encode operational constraints and ensure safe UAV-USV coordination. Meanwhile, the VLM module performs real-time semantic inspection and compliance assessment, generating structured reports with contextual reasoning. The framework was validated using the extended MBZIRC Maritime Simulator with realistic port infrastructure and further assessed through real-world robotic inspection trials. The lightweight on-board design ensures suitability for resource-constrained maritime platforms, advancing the development of intelligent, autonomous inspection systems.

      <title>Earth Embeddings as Products: Taxonomy, Ecosystem, and Standardized Access</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Geospatial Foundation Models (GFMs) provide powerful representations, but high compute costs hinder their widespread use. Pre-computed embedding data products offer a practical "frozen" alternative, yet they currently exist in a fragmented ecosystem of incompatible formats and resolutions. This lack of standardization creates an engineering bottleneck that prevents meaningful model comparison and reproducibility. We formalize this landscape through a three-layer taxonomy: Data, Tools, and Value. We survey existing products to identify interoperability barriers. To bridge this gap, we extend TorchGeo with a unified API that standardizes the loading and querying of diverse embedding products. By treating embeddings as first-class geospatial datasets, we decouple downstream analysis from model-specific engineering, providing a roadmap for more transparent and accessible Earth observation workflows.</description>

      <title>Aligning Agentic World Models via Knowledgeable Experience Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit a critical modal disconnect: they possess vast semantic knowledge but lack the procedural grounding to respect the immutable laws of the physical world. Consequently, while these agents implicitly function as world models, their simulations often suffer from physical hallucinations-generating plans that are logically sound but physically unexecutable. Existing alignment strategies predominantly rely on resource-intensive training or fine-tuning, which attempt to compress dynamic environmental rules into static model parameters. However, such parametric encapsulation is inherently rigid, struggling to adapt to the open-ended variability of physical dynamics without continuous, costly retraining. To bridge this gap, we introduce WorldMind, a framework that autonomously constructs a symbolic World Knowledge Repository by synthesizing environmental feedback. Specifically, it unifies Process Experience to enforce physical feasibility via prediction errors and Goal Experience to guide task optimality through successful trajectories. Experiments on EB-ALFRED and EB-Habitat demonstrate that WorldMind achieves superior performance compared to baselines with remarkable cross-model and cross-environment transferability.</description>

      <title>Event-based Heterogeneous Information Processing for Online Vision-based Obstacle Detection and Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel framework for robotic vision-based navigation that integrates Hybrid Neural Networks (HNNs) with Spiking Neural Network (SNN)-based filtering to enhance situational awareness for unmodeled obstacle detection and localization. By leveraging the complementary strengths of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and SNNs, the system achieves both accurate environmental understanding and fast, energy-efficient processing. The proposed architecture employs a dual-pathway approach: an ANN component processes static spatial features at low frequency, while an SNN component handles dynamic, event-based sensor data in real time. Unlike conventional hybrid architectures that rely on domain conversion mechanisms, our system incorporates a pre-developed SNN-based filter that directly utilizes spike-encoded inputs for localization and state estimation. Detected anomalies are validated using contextual information from the ANN pathway and continuously tracked to support anticipatory navigation strategies. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method offers acceptable detection accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency close to SNN-only implementations, which operate at a fraction of the resource cost. This framework represents a significant advancement in neuromorphic navigation systems for robots operating in unpredictable and dynamic environments.</description>

      <title>Reasoning is a Modality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) provides a compact laboratory for studying abstract reasoning, an ability central to human intelligence. Modern AI systems, including LLMs and ViTs, largely operate as sequence-of-behavior prediction machines: they match observable behaviors by modeling token statistics without a persistent, readable mental state. This creates a gap with human-like behavior: humans can explain an action by decoding internal state, while AI systems can produce fluent post-hoc rationalizations that are not grounded in such a state. We hypothesize that reasoning is a modality: reasoning should exist as a distinct channel separate from the low-level workspace on which rules are applied. To test this hypothesis, on solving ARC tasks as a visual reasoning problem, we designed a novel role-separated transformer block that splits global controller tokens from grid workspace tokens, enabling iterative rule execution. Trained and evaluated within the VARC vision-centric protocol, our method achieved 62.6% accuracy on ARC-1, surpassing average human performance (60.2%) and outperforming prior methods significantly. Qualitatively, our models exhibit more coherent rule-application structure than the dense ViT baseline, consistent with a shift away from plausible probability blobs toward controller-driven reasoning.</description>

      <title>FG-OrIU: Towards Better Forgetting via Feature-Gradient Orthogonality for Incremental Unlearning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Incremental unlearning (IU) is critical for pre-trained models to comply with sequential data deletion requests, yet existing methods primarily suppress parameters or confuse knowledge without explicit constraints on both feature and gradient level, resulting in \textit{superficial forgetting} where residual information remains recoverable. This incomplete forgetting risks security breaches and disrupts retention balance, especially in IU scenarios. We propose FG-OrIU (\textbf{F}eature-\textbf{G}radient \textbf{Or}thogonality for \textbf{I}ncremental \textbf{U}nlearning), the first framework unifying orthogonal constraints on both features and gradients level to achieve deep forgetting, where the forgetting effect is irreversible. FG-OrIU decomposes feature spaces via Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), separating forgetting and remaining class features into distinct subspaces. It then enforces dual constraints: feature orthogonal projection on both forgetting and remaining classes, while gradient orthogonal projection prevents the reintroduction of forgotten knowledge and disruption to remaining classes during updates. Additionally, dynamic subspace adaptation merges newly forgetting subspaces and contracts remaining subspaces, ensuring a stable balance between removal and retention across sequential unlearning tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.</description>

Abstract: Fast adversarial training (FAT) aims to enhance the robustness of models against adversarial attacks with reduced training time, however, FAT often suffers from compromised robustness due to insufficient exploration of adversarial space. In this paper, we develop a loss function to mitigate the problem of degraded robustness under FAT. Specifically, we derive a quadratic upper bound (QUB) on the adversarial training (AT) loss function and propose to utilize the bound with existing FAT methods. Our experimental results show that applying QUB loss to the existing methods yields significant improvement of robustness. Furthermore, using various metrics, we demonstrate that this improvement is likely to result from the smoothened loss landscape of the resulting model.</description>

      <title>FutureOmni: Evaluating Future Forecasting from Omni-Modal Context for Multimodal LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate strong omni-modal perception, their ability to forecast future events from audio-visual cues remains largely unexplored, as existing benchmarks focus mainly on retrospective understanding. To bridge this gap, we introduce FutureOmni, the first benchmark designed to evaluate omni-modal future forecasting from audio-visual environments. The evaluated models are required to perform cross-modal causal and temporal reasoning, as well as effectively leverage internal knowledge to predict future events. FutureOmni is constructed via a scalable LLM-assisted, human-in-the-loop pipeline and contains 919 videos and 1,034 multiple-choice QA pairs across 8 primary domains. Evaluations on 13 omni-modal and 7 video-only models show that current systems struggle with audio-visual future prediction, particularly in speech-heavy scenarios, with the best accuracy of 64.8% achieved by Gemini 3 Flash. To mitigate this limitation, we curate a 7K-sample instruction-tuning dataset and propose an Omni-Modal Future Forecasting (OFF) training strategy. Evaluations on FutureOmni and popular audio-visual and video-only benchmarks demonstrate that OFF enhances future forecasting and generalization. We publicly release all code (https://github.com/OpenMOSS/FutureOmni) and datasets (https://huggingface.co/datasets/OpenMOSS-Team/FutureOmni).</description>

      <title>Chain-of-Thought Compression Should Not Be Blind: V-Skip for Efficient Multimodal Reasoning via Dual-Path Anchoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning significantly enhances the performance of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), its autoregressive nature incurs prohibitive latency constraints. Current efforts to mitigate this via token compression often fail by blindly applying text-centric metrics to multimodal contexts. We identify a critical failure mode termed Visual Amnesia, where linguistically redundant tokens are erroneously pruned, leading to hallucinations. To address this, we introduce V-Skip that reformulates token pruning as a Visual-Anchored Information Bottleneck (VA-IB) optimization problem. V-Skip employs a dual-path gating mechanism that weighs token importance through both linguistic surprisal and cross-modal attention flow, effectively rescuing visually salient anchors. Extensive experiments on Qwen2-VL and Llama-3.2 families demonstrate that V-Skip achieves a $2.9\times$ speedup with negligible accuracy loss. Specifically, it preserves fine-grained visual details, outperforming other baselines over 30\% on the DocVQA.</description>

      <title>HyperWalker: Dynamic Hypergraph-Based Deep Diagnosis for Multi-Hop Clinical Modeling across EHR and X-Ray in Medical VLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automated clinical diagnosis remains a core challenge in medical AI, which usually requires models to integrate multi-modal data and reason across complex, case-specific contexts. Although recent methods have advanced medical report generation (MRG) and visual question answering (VQA) with medical vision-language models (VLMs), these methods, however, predominantly operate under a sample-isolated inference paradigm, as such processing cases independently without access to longitudinal electronic health records (EHRs) or structurally related patient examples. This paradigm limits reasoning to image-derived information alone, which ignores external complementary medical evidence for potentially more accurate diagnosis. To overcome this limitation, we propose \textbf{HyperWalker}, a \textit{Deep Diagnosis} framework that reformulates clinical reasoning via dynamic hypergraphs and test-time training. First, we construct a dynamic hypergraph, termed \textbf{iBrochure}, to model the structural heterogeneity of EHR data and implicit high-order associations among multimodal clinical information. Within this hypergraph, a reinforcement learning agent, \textbf{Walker}, navigates to and identifies optimal diagnostic paths. To ensure comprehensive coverage of diverse clinical characteristics in test samples, we incorporate a \textit{linger mechanism}, a multi-hop orthogonal retrieval strategy that iteratively selects clinically complementary neighborhood cases reflecting distinct clinical attributes. Experiments on MRG with MIMIC and medical VQA on EHRXQA demonstrate that HyperWalker achieves state-of-the-art performance.

      <title>SHARE: A Fully Unsupervised Framework for Single Hyperspectral Image Restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) restoration is a fundamental challenge in computational imaging and computer vision. It involves ill-posed inverse problems, such as inpainting and super-resolution. Although deep learning methods have transformed the field through data-driven learning, their effectiveness hinges on access to meticulously curated ground-truth datasets. This fundamentally restricts their applicability in real-world scenarios where such data is unavailable. This paper presents SHARE (Single Hyperspectral Image Restoration with Equivariance), a fully unsupervised framework that unifies geometric equivariance principles with low-rank spectral modelling to eliminate the need for ground truth. SHARE's core concept is to exploit the intrinsic invariance of hyperspectral structures under differentiable geometric transformations (e.g. rotations and scaling) to derive self-supervision signals through equivariance consistency constraints. Our novel Dynamic Adaptive Spectral Attention (DASA) module further enhances this paradigm shift by explicitly encoding the global low-rank property of HSI and adaptively refining local spectral-spatial correlations through learnable attention mechanisms. Extensive experiments on HSI inpainting and super-resolution tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of SHARE. Our method outperforms many state-of-the-art unsupervised approaches and achieves performance comparable to that of supervised methods. We hope that our approach will shed new light on HSI restoration and broader scientific imaging scenarios. The code will be released at https://github.com/xuwayyy/SHARE.</description>

      <title>LLMOrbit: A Circular Taxonomy of Large Language Models -From Scaling Walls to Agentic AI Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The field of artificial intelligence has undergone a revolution from foundational Transformer architectures to reasoning-capable systems approaching human-level performance. We present LLMOrbit, a comprehensive circular taxonomy navigating the landscape of large language models spanning 2019-2025. This survey examines over 50 models across 15 organizations through eight interconnected orbital dimensions, documenting architectural innovations, training methodologies, and efficiency patterns defining modern LLMs, generative AI, and agentic systems. We identify three critical crises: (1) data scarcity (9-27T tokens depleted by 2026-2028), (2) exponential cost growth ($3M to $300M+ in 5 years), and (3) unsustainable energy consumption (22x increase), establishing the scaling wall limiting brute-force approaches. Our analysis reveals six paradigms breaking this wall: (1) test-time compute (o1, DeepSeek-R1 achieve GPT-4 performance with 10x inference compute), (2) quantization (4-8x compression), (3) distributed edge computing (10x cost reduction), (4) model merging, (5) efficient training (ORPO reduces memory 50%), and (6) small specialized models (Phi-4 14B matches larger models). Three paradigm shifts emerge: (1) post-training gains (RLHF, GRPO, pure RL contribute substantially, DeepSeek-R1 achieving 79.8% MATH), (2) efficiency revolution (MoE routing 18x efficiency, Multi-head Latent Attention 8x KV cache compression enables GPT-4-level performance at &lt;$0.30/M tokens), and (3) democratization (open-source Llama 3 88.6% MMLU surpasses GPT-4 86.4%). We provide insights into techniques (RLHF, PPO, DPO, GRPO, ORPO), trace evolution from passive generation to tool-using agents (ReAct, RAG, multi-agent systems), and analyze post-training innovations.</description>

      <title>MooneyMaker: A Python package to create ambiguous two-tone images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mooney images are high-contrast, two-tone visual stimuli, created by thresholding photographic images. They allow researchers to separate image content from image understanding, making them valuable for studying visual perception. An ideal Mooney image for this purpose achieves a specific balance: it initially appears unrecognizable but becomes fully interpretable to the observer after seeing the original template. Researchers traditionally created these stimuli manually using subjective criteria, which is labor-intensive and can introduce inconsistencies across studies. Automated generation techniques now offer an alternative to this manual approach. Here, we present MooneyMaker, an open-source Python package that automates the generation of ambiguous Mooney images using several complementary approaches. Users can choose between various generation techniques that range from approaches based on image statistics to deep learning models. These models strategically alter edge information to increase initial ambiguity. The package lets users create two-tone images with multiple methods and directly compare the results visually. In an experiment, we validate MooneyMaker by generating Mooney images using different techniques and assess their recognizability for human observers before and after disambiguating them by presenting the template images. Our results reveal that techniques with lower initial recognizability are associated with higher post-template recognition (i.e. a larger disambiguation effect). To help vision scientists build effective databases of Mooney stimuli, we provide practical guidelines for technique selection. By standardizing the generation process, MooneyMaker supports more consistent and reproducible visual perception research.</description>

      <title>Diffusion-Guided Backdoor Attacks in Real-World Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Backdoor attacks embed hidden malicious behaviors in reinforcement learning (RL) policies and activate them using triggers at test time. Most existing attacks are validated only in simulation, while their effectiveness in real-world robotic systems remains unclear. In physical deployment, safety-constrained control pipelines such as velocity limiting, action smoothing, and collision avoidance suppress abnormal actions, causing strong attenuation of conventional backdoor attacks. We study this previously overlooked problem and propose a diffusion-guided backdoor attack framework (DGBA) for real-world RL. We design small printable visual patch triggers placed on the floor and generate them using a conditional diffusion model that produces diverse patch appearances under real-world visual variations. We treat the robot control stack as a black-box system. We further introduce an advantage-based poisoning strategy that injects triggers only at decision-critical training states. We evaluate our method on a TurtleBot3 mobile robot and demonstrate reliable activation of targeted attacks while preserving normal task performance. Demo videos and code are available in the supplementary material.</description>

      <title>TwinBrainVLA: Unleashing the Potential of Generalist VLMs for Embodied Tasks via Asymmetric Mixture-of-Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Standard Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models typically fine-tune a monolithic Vision-Language Model (VLM) backbone explicitly for robotic control. However, this approach creates a critical tension between maintaining high-level general semantic understanding and learning low-level, fine-grained sensorimotor skills, often leading to "catastrophic forgetting" of the model's open-world capabilities. To resolve this conflict, we introduce TwinBrainVLA, a novel architecture that coordinates a generalist VLM retaining universal semantic understanding and a specialist VLM dedicated to embodied proprioception for joint robotic control. TwinBrainVLA synergizes a frozen "Left Brain", which retains robust general visual reasoning, with a trainable "Right Brain", specialized for embodied perception, via a novel Asymmetric Mixture-of-Transformers (AsyMoT) mechanism. This design allows the Right Brain to dynamically query semantic knowledge from the frozen Left Brain and fuse it with proprioceptive states, providing rich conditioning for a Flow-Matching Action Expert to generate precise continuous controls. Extensive experiments on SimplerEnv and RoboCasa benchmarks demonstrate that TwinBrainVLA achieves superior manipulation performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines while explicitly preserving the comprehensive visual understanding capabilities of the pre-trained VLM, offering a promising direction for building general-purpose robots that simultaneously achieve high-level semantic understanding and low-level physical dexterity.</description>

      <title>Copy-Trasform-Paste: Zero-Shot Object-Object Alignment Guided by Vision-Language and Geometric Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study zero-shot 3D alignment of two given meshes, using a text prompt describing their spatial relation -- an essential capability for content creation and scene assembly. Earlier approaches primarily rely on geometric alignment procedures, while recent work leverages pretrained 2D diffusion models to model language-conditioned object-object spatial relationships. In contrast, we directly optimize the relative pose at test time, updating translation, rotation, and isotropic scale with CLIP-driven gradients via a differentiable renderer, without training a new model. Our framework augments language supervision with geometry-aware objectives: a variant of soft-Iterative Closest Point (ICP) term to encourage surface attachment and a penetration loss to discourage interpenetration. A phased schedule strengthens contact constraints over time, and camera control concentrates the optimization on the interaction region. To enable evaluation, we curate a benchmark containing diverse categories and relations, and compare against baselines. Our method outperforms all alternatives, yielding semantically faithful and physically plausible alignments.</description>

      <title>KAGE-Bench: Fast Known-Axis Visual Generalization Evaluation for Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pixel-based reinforcement learning agents often fail under purely visual distribution shift even when latent dynamics and rewards are unchanged, but existing benchmarks entangle multiple sources of shift and hinder systematic analysis. We introduce KAGE-Env, a JAX-native 2D platformer that factorizes the observation process into independently controllable visual axes while keeping the underlying control problem fixed. By construction, varying a visual axis affects performance only through the induced state-conditional action distribution of a pixel policy, providing a clean abstraction for visual generalization. Building on this environment, we define KAGE-Bench, a benchmark of six known-axis suites comprising 34 train-evaluation configuration pairs that isolate individual visual shifts. Using a standard PPO-CNN baseline, we observe strong axis-dependent failures, with background and photometric shifts often collapsing success, while agent-appearance shifts are comparatively benign. Several shifts preserve forward motion while breaking task completion, showing that return alone can obscure generalization failures. Finally, the fully vectorized JAX implementation enables up to 33M environment steps per second on a single GPU, enabling fast and reproducible sweeps over visual factors.

      <title>Shape Completion with Prediction of Uncertain Regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.00377v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Shape completion, i.e., predicting the complete geometry of an object from a partial observation, is highly relevant for several downstream tasks, most notably robotic manipulation. When basing planning or prediction of real grasps on object shape reconstruction, an indication of severe geometric uncertainty is indispensable. In particular, there can be an irreducible uncertainty in extended regions about the presence of entire object parts when given ambiguous object views. To treat this important case, we propose two novel methods for predicting such uncertain regions as straightforward extensions of any method for predicting local spatial occupancy, one through postprocessing occupancy scores, the other through direct prediction of an uncertainty indicator. We compare these methods together with two known approaches to probabilistic shape completion. Moreover, we generate a dataset, derived from ShapeNet, of realistically rendered depth images of object views with ground-truth annotations for the uncertain regions. We train on this dataset and test each method in shape completion and prediction of uncertain regions for known and novel object instances and on synthetic and real data. While direct uncertainty prediction is by far the most accurate in the segmentation of uncertain regions, both novel methods outperform the two baselines in shape completion and uncertain region prediction, and avoiding the predicted uncertain regions increases the quality of grasps for all tested methods.</description>

      <title>Compositional Feature Augmentation for Unbiased Scene Graph Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.06712v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scene Graph Generation (SGG) aims to detect all the visual relation triplets $&lt;$\texttt{sub}, \texttt{pred}, \texttt{obj}$&gt;$ in a given image. With the emergence of various advanced techniques for better utilizing both the intrinsic and extrinsic information in each relation triplet, SGG has achieved great progress over the recent years. However, due to the ubiquitous long-tailed predicate distributions, today's SGG models are still easily biased to the head predicates. Currently, the most prevalent debiasing solutions for SGG are re-balancing methods, \eg, changing the distributions of original training samples. In this paper, we argue that all existing re-balancing strategies fail to increase the diversity of the relation triplet features of each predicate, which is critical for robust SGG. To this end, we propose a novel Compositional Feature Augmentation (\textbf{CFA}) strategy, which is the first unbiased SGG work to mitigate the bias issue from the perspective of increasing the diversity of triplet features. Specifically, we first decompose each relation triplet feature into two components: intrinsic feature and extrinsic feature, which correspond to the intrinsic characteristics and extrinsic contexts of a relation triplet, respectively. Then, we design two different feature augmentation modules to enrich the feature diversity of original relation triplets by replacing or mixing up either their intrinsic or extrinsic features from other samples. Due to its model-agnostic nature, CFA can be seamlessly incorporated into various SGG frameworks. Extensive ablations have shown that CFA achieves a new state-of-the-art performance on the trade-off between different metrics.</description>

      <title>Shadow loss: Memory-linear deep metric learning for efficient training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14012v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep metric learning objectives (e.g., triplet loss) require storing and comparing high-dimensional embeddings, making the per-batch loss buffer scale as $O(S\cdot D)$, where $S$ is the number of samples in a batch and $D$ is the feature dimension, thus limiting training on memory-constrained hardware. We propose Shadow Loss, a proxy-free, parameter-free objective that measures similarity via scalar projections onto the anchor direction, reducing the loss-specific buffer from $O(S\cdot D)$ to $O(S)$ while preserving the triplet structure. We analyze gradients, provide a Lipschitz continuity bound, and show that Shadow Loss penalizes trivial collapse for stable optimization. Across fine-grained retrieval (CUB-200, CARS196), large-scale product retrieval (Stanford Online Products, In-Shop Clothes), and standard/medical benchmarks (CIFAR-10/100, Tiny-ImageNet, HAM-10K, ODIR-5K), Shadow Loss consistently outperforms recent objectives (Triplet, Soft-Margin Triplet, Angular Triplet, SoftTriple, Multi-Similarity). It also converges in $\approx 1.5\text{-}2\times$ fewer epochs under identical backbones and mining. Furthermore, it improves representation separability as measured by higher silhouette scores. The design is architecture-agnostic and vectorized for efficient implementation. By decoupling discriminative power from embedding dimensionality and reusing batch dot-products, Shadow Loss enables memory-linear training and faster convergence, making deep metric learning practical on both edge and large-scale systems.</description>

      <title>DiffusionAgent: Navigating Expert Models for Agentic Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10061v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the accelerating era of human-instructed visual content creation, diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable generative potential. Yet their deployment is constrained by a dual bottleneck: semantic ambiguity in diverse prompts and the narrow specialization of individual models. A single diffusion architecture struggles to maintain optimal performance across heterogeneous prompts, while conventional "parse-then-call" pipelines artificially separate semantic understanding from generative execution. To bridge this gap, we introduce DiffusionAgent, a unified, language-model-driven agent that casts the entire "prompt comprehension-expert routing-image synthesis" loop into a agentic framework. Our contributions are three-fold: (1) a tree-of-thought-powered expert navigator that performs fine-grained semantic parsing and zero-shot matching to the most suitable diffusion model via an extensible prior-knowledge tree; (2) an advantage database updated with human-in-the-loop feedback, continually aligning model-selection policy with human aesthetic and semantic preferences; and (3) a fully decoupled agent architecture that activates the optimal generative path for open-domain prompts without retraining or fine-tuning any expert. Extensive experiments show that DiffusionAgent retains high generation quality while significantly broadening prompt coverage, establishing a new performance and generality benchmark for multi-domain image synthesis.

      <title>Unified Source-Free Domain Adaptation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07601v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the pursuit of transferring a source model to a target domain without access to the source training data, Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA) has been extensively explored across various scenarios, including Closed-set, Open-set, Partial-set, and Generalized settings. Existing methods, focusing on specific scenarios, not only address a limited subset of challenges but also necessitate prior knowledge of the target domain, significantly limiting their practical utility and deployability. In light of these considerations, we introduce a more practical yet challenging problem, termed unified SFDA, which comprehensively incorporates all specific scenarios in a unified manner. In this paper, we propose a novel approach latent Causal factors discovery for unified SFDA (CausalDA). In contrast to previous alternatives that emphasize learning the statistical description of reality, we formulate CausalDA from a causality perspective. The objective is to uncover potential causality between latent variables and model decisions, enhancing the reliability and robustness of the learned model against domain shifts. To integrate extensive world knowledge, we leverage a pre-trained vision-language model such as CLIP. This aids in the formation and discovery of latent causal factors in the absence of supervision in the variation of distribution and semantics, coupled with a newly designed information bottleneck with theoretical guarantees. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CausalDA can achieve new state-of-the-art results in distinct SFDA settings, as well as source-free out-of-distribution generalization. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/tntek/CausalDA.</description>

      <title>Hi5: Synthetic Data for Inclusive, Robust, Hand Pose Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03599v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hand pose estimation plays a vital role in capturing subtle nonverbal cues essential for understanding human affect. However, collecting diverse, expressive real-world data remains challenging due to labor-intensive manual annotation that often underrepresents demographic diversity and natural expressions. To address this issue, we introduce a cost-effective approach to generating synthetic data using high-fidelity 3D hand models and a wide range of affective hand poses. Our method includes varied skin tones, genders, dynamic environments, realistic lighting conditions, and diverse naturally occurring gesture animations. The resulting dataset, Hi5, contains 583,000 pose-annotated images, carefully balanced to reflect natural diversity and emotional expressiveness. Models trained exclusively on Hi5 achieve performance comparable to human-annotated datasets, exhibiting superior robustness to occlusions and consistent accuracy across diverse skin tones -- which is crucial for reliably recognizing expressive gestures in affective computing applications. Our results demonstrate that synthetic data effectively addresses critical limitations of existing datasets, enabling more inclusive, expressive, and reliable gesture recognition systems while achieving competitive performance in pose estimation benchmarks. The Hi5 dataset, data synthesis pipeline, source code, and game engine project are publicly released to support further research in synthetic hand-gesture applications.</description>

      <title>Unleashing the Potential of Tracklets for Unsupervised Video Person Re-Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14261v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With rich temporal-spatial information, video-based person re-identification methods have shown broad prospects. Although tracklets can be easily obtained with ready-made tracking models, annotating identities is still expensive and impractical. Therefore, some video-based methods propose using only a few identity annotations or camera labels to facilitate feature learning. They also simply average the frame features of each tracklet, overlooking unexpected variations and inherent identity consistency within tracklets. In this paper, we propose the Self-Supervised Refined Clustering (SSR-C) framework without relying on any annotation or auxiliary information to promote unsupervised video person re-identification. Specifically, we first propose the Noise-Filtered Tracklet Partition (NFTP) module to reduce the feature bias of tracklets caused by noisy tracking results, and sequentially partition the noise-filtered tracklets into "sub-tracklets". Then, we cluster and further merge sub-tracklets using the self-supervised signal from the tracklet partition, which is enhanced through a progressive strategy to generate reliable pseudo labels, facilitating intra-class cross-tracklet aggregation. Moreover, we propose the Class Smoothing Classification (CSC) loss to efficiently promote model learning. Extensive experiments on the MARS and DukeMTMC-VideoReID datasets demonstrate that our proposed SSR-C for unsupervised video person re-identification achieves state-of-the-art results and is comparable to advanced supervised methods.

      <title>Rethinking and Red-Teaming Protective Perturbation in Personalized Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18944v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Personalized diffusion models (PDMs) have become prominent for adapting pre-trained text-to-image models to generate images of specific subjects using minimal training data. However, PDMs are susceptible to minor adversarial perturbations, leading to significant degradation when fine-tuned on corrupted datasets. These vulnerabilities are exploited to create protective perturbations that prevent unauthorized image generation. Existing purification methods attempt to red-team the protective perturbation to break the protection but often over-purify images, resulting in information loss. In this work, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the fine-tuning process of PDMs through the lens of shortcut learning. We hypothesize and empirically demonstrate that adversarial perturbations induce a latent-space misalignment between images and their text prompts in the CLIP embedding space. This misalignment causes the model to erroneously associate noisy patterns with unique identifiers during fine-tuning, resulting in poor generalization. Based on these insights, we propose a systematic red-teaming framework that includes data purification and contrastive decoupling learning. We first employ off-the-shelf image restoration techniques to realign images with their original semantic content in latent space. Then, we introduce contrastive decoupling learning with noise tokens to decouple the learning of personalized concepts from spurious noise patterns. Our study not only uncovers shortcut learning vulnerabilities in PDMs but also provides a thorough evaluation framework for developing stronger protection. Our extensive evaluation demonstrates its advantages over existing purification methods and its robustness against adaptive perturbations.</description>

      <title>VRP-UDF: Towards Unbiased Learning of Unsigned Distance Functions from Multi-view Images with Volume Rendering Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16396v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unsigned distance functions (UDFs) have been a vital representation for open surfaces. With different differentiable renderers, current methods are able to train neural networks to infer a UDF by minimizing the rendering errors with the UDF to the multi-view ground truth. However, these differentiable renderers are mainly handcrafted, which makes them either biased on ray-surface intersections, or sensitive to unsigned distance outliers, or not scalable to large scenes. To resolve these issues, we present a novel differentiable renderer to infer UDFs more accurately. Instead of using handcrafted equations, our differentiable renderer is a neural network which is pre-trained in a data-driven manner. It learns how to render unsigned distances into depth images, leading to a prior knowledge, dubbed volume rendering priors. To infer a UDF for an unseen scene from multiple RGB images, we generalize the learned volume rendering priors to map inferred unsigned distances in alpha blending for RGB image rendering. To reduce the bias of sampling in UDF inference, we utilize an auxiliary point sampling prior as an indicator of ray-surface intersection, and propose novel schemes towards more accurate and uniform sampling near the zero-level sets. We also propose a new strategy that leverages our pretrained volume rendering prior to serve as a general surface refiner, which can be integrated with various Gaussian reconstruction methods to optimize the Gaussian distributions and refine geometric details. Our results show that the learned volume rendering prior is unbiased, robust, scalable, 3D aware, and more importantly, easy to learn. Further experiments show that the volume rendering prior is also a general strategy to enhance other neural implicit representations such as signed distance function and occupancy.</description>

      <title>A new baseline for edge detection: Make Encoder-Decoder great again</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14976v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The performance of deep learning based edge detector has far exceeded that of humans, but the huge computational cost and complex training strategy hinder its further development and application. In this paper, we eliminate these complexities with a vanilla encoder-decoder based detector. Firstly, we design a bilateral encoder to decouple the extraction process of location features and semantic features. Since the location branch no longer provides cues for the semantic branch, the richness of features can be further compressed, which is the key to make our model more compact. We propose a cascaded feature fusion decoder, where the location features are progressively refined by semantic features. The refined location features are the only basis for generating the edge map. The coarse original location features and semantic features are avoided from direct contact with the final result. So the noise in the location features and the location error in the semantic features can be suppressed in the generated edge map. The proposed New Baseline for Edge Detection (NBED) achieves superior performance consistently across multiple edge detection benchmarks, even compared with those methods with huge computational cost and complex training strategy. The ODS of NBED on BSDS500 is 0.838, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Our study shows that what really matters in the current edge detection is high-quality features, and we can make the encoder-decoder based detector great again even without complex training strategies and huge computational cost.

      <title>RemoteDet-Mamba: A Hybrid Mamba-CNN Network for Multi-modal Object Detection in Remote Sensing Images</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13532v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) remote sensing, with its advantages of rapid information acquisition and low cost, has been widely applied in scenarios such as emergency response. However, due to the long imaging distance and complex imaging mechanisms, targets in remote sensing images often face challenges such as small object size, dense distribution, and low inter-class discriminability. To address these issues, this paper proposes a multi-modal remote sensing object detection network called RemoteDet-Mamba, which is based on a patch-level four-direction selective scanning fusion strategy. This method simultaneously learns unimodal local features and fuses cross-modal patch-level global semantic information, thereby enhancing the distinguishability of small objects and improving inter-class discrimination. Furthermore, the designed lightweight fusion mechanism effectively decouples densely packed targets while reducing computational complexity. Experimental results on the DroneVehicle dataset demonstrate that RemoteDet-Mamba achieves superior detection performance compared to current mainstream methods, while maintaining low parameter count and computational overhead, showing promising potential for practical applications.</description>

      <title>LLM2CLIP: Powerful Language Model Unlocks Richer Visual Representation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04997v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: CLIP is a foundational multimodal model that aligns image and text features into a shared representation space via contrastive learning on large-scale image-text pairs. Its effectiveness primarily stems from the use of natural language as rich supervision. Motivated by the remarkable advancements in large language models (LLMs), this work explores how LLMs' superior text understanding and extensive open-world knowledge can enhance CLIP's capability, especially for processing longer and more complex image captions. We propose an efficient post-training strategy that integrates LLMs into pretrained CLIP. To address the challenge posed by the autoregressive nature of LLMs, we introduce a caption-to-caption contrastive fine-tuning framework, significantly enhancing the discriminative quality of LLM outputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms LoRA-based methods, achieving nearly fourfold faster training with superior performance. Furthermore, we validate substantial improvements over state-of-the-art models such as CLIP, EVA02, and SigLip2 across various zero-shot multimodal retrieval tasks, cross-lingual retrieval tasks, and multimodal language model pretraining.</description>

      <title>GalaxyEdit: Large-Scale Image Editing Dataset with Enhanced Diffusion Adapter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13794v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Training of large-scale text-to-image and image-to-image models requires a huge amount of annotated data. While text-to-image datasets are abundant, data available for instruction-based image-to-image tasks like object addition and removal is limited. This is because of the several challenges associated with the data generation process, such as, significant human effort, limited automation, suboptimal end-to-end models, data diversity constraints and high expenses. We propose an automated data generation pipeline aimed at alleviating such limitations, and introduce GalaxyEdit - a large-scale image editing dataset for add and remove operations. We fine-tune the SD v1.5 model on our dataset and find that our model can successfully handle a broader range of objects and complex editing instructions, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in FID scores by 11.2\% and 26.1\% for add and remove tasks respectively. Furthermore, in light of on-device usage scenarios, we expand our research to include task-specific lightweight adapters leveraging the ControlNet-xs architecture. While ControlNet-xs excels in canny and depth guided generation, we propose to improve the communication between the control network and U-Net for more intricate add and remove tasks. We achieve this by enhancing ControlNet-xs with non-linear interaction layers based on Volterra filters. Our approach outperforms ControlNet-xs in both add/remove and canny-guided image generation tasks, highlighting the effectiveness of the proposed enhancement.</description>

      <title>Deblur4DGS: 4D Gaussian Splatting from Blurry Monocular Video</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06424v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent 4D reconstruction methods have yielded impressive results but rely on sharp videos as supervision. However, motion blur often occurs in videos due to camera shake and object movement, while existing methods render blurry results when using such videos for reconstructing 4D models. Although a few approaches attempted to address the problem, they struggled to produce high-quality results, due to the inaccuracy in estimating continuous dynamic representations within the exposure time. Encouraged by recent works in 3D motion trajectory modeling using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), we take 3DGS as the scene representation manner, and propose Deblur4DGS to reconstruct a high-quality 4D model from blurry monocular video. Specifically, we transform continuous dynamic representations estimation within an exposure time into the exposure time estimation. Moreover, we introduce the exposure regularization term, multi-frame, and multi-resolution consistency regularization term to avoid trivial solutions. Furthermore, to better represent objects with large motion, we suggest blur-aware variable canonical Gaussians. Beyond novel-view synthesis, Deblur4DGS can be applied to improve blurry video from multiple perspectives, including deblurring, frame interpolation, and video stabilization. Extensive experiments in both synthetic and real-world data on the above four tasks show that Deblur4DGS outperforms state-of-the-art 4D reconstruction methods.

      <title>Beyond Knowledge Silos: Task Fingerprinting for Democratization of Medical Imaging AI</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08763v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The field of medical imaging AI is currently undergoing rapid transformations, with methodical research increasingly translated into clinical practice. Despite these successes, research suffers from knowledge silos, hindering collaboration and progress: Existing knowledge is scattered across publications and many details remain unpublished, while privacy regulations restrict data sharing. In the spirit of democratizing of AI, we propose a framework for secure knowledge transfer in the field of medical image analysis. The key to our approach is dataset "fingerprints", structured representations of feature distributions, that enable quantification of task similarity. We tested our approach across 71 distinct tasks and 12 medical imaging modalities by transferring neural architectures, pretraining, augmentation policies, and multi-task learning. According to comprehensive analyses, our method outperforms traditional methods for identifying relevant knowledge and facilitates collaborative model training. Our framework fosters the democratization of AI in medical imaging and could become a valuable tool for promoting faster scientific advancement.</description>

      <title>SuperGSeg: Open-Vocabulary 3D Segmentation with Structured Super-Gaussians</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10231v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting has recently gained traction for its efficient training and real-time rendering. While its vanilla representation is mainly designed for view synthesis, recent works extended it to scene understanding with language features. However, storing additional high-dimensional features per Gaussian for semantic information is memory-intensive, which limits their ability to segment and interpret challenging scenes. To this end, we introduce SuperGSeg, a novel approach that fosters cohesive, context-aware hierarchical scene representation by disentangling segmentation and language field distillation. SuperGSeg first employs neural 3D Gaussians to learn geometry, instance and hierarchical segmentation features from multi-view images with the aid of off-the-shelf 2D masks. These features are then leveraged to create a sparse set of \acrlong{superg}s. \acrlong{superg}s facilitate the lifting and distillation of 2D language features into 3D space. They enable hierarchical scene understanding with high-dimensional language feature rendering at moderate GPU memory costs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SuperGSeg achieves remarkable performance on both open-vocabulary object selection and semantic segmentation tasks.</description>

      <title>FaceXBench: Evaluating Multimodal LLMs on Face Understanding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10360v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate impressive problem-solving abilities across a wide range of tasks and domains. However, their capacity for face understanding has not been systematically studied. To address this gap, we introduce FaceXBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs on complex face understanding tasks. FaceXBench includes 5,000 multimodal multiple-choice questions derived from 25 public datasets and a newly created dataset, FaceXAPI. These questions cover 14 tasks across 6 broad categories, assessing MLLMs' face understanding abilities in bias and fairness, face authentication, recognition, analysis, localization and tool retrieval. Using FaceXBench, we conduct an extensive evaluation of 26 open-source MLLMs alongside 2 proprietary models, revealing the unique challenges in complex face understanding tasks. We analyze the models across three evaluation settings: zero-shot, in-context task description, and chain-of-thought prompting. Our detailed analysis reveals that current MLLMs, including advanced models like GPT-4o, and GeminiPro 1.5, show significant room for improvement. We believe FaceXBench will be a crucial resource for developing MLLMs equipped to perform sophisticated face understanding. Code: https://github.com/Kartik-3004/facexbench</description>

      <title>vSTMD: Visual Motion Detection for Extremely Tiny Target at Various Velocities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13054v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Visual motion detection for extremely tiny (ET-) targets is challenging, due to their category-independent nature and the scarcity of visual cues, which often incapacitate mainstream feature-based models. Natural architectures with rich interpretability offer a promising alternative, where STMD architectures derived from insect visual STMD (Small Target Motion Detector) pathways have demonstrated their effectiveness. However, previous STMD models are constrained to a narrow velocity range, hindering their efficacy in real-world scenarios where targets exhibit diverse and unstable dynamics. To address this limitation, we present vSTMD, a learning-free model for motion detection of ET-targets at various velocities. Our key innovations include: (1) a cross-Inhibition Dynamic Potential (cIDP) that serves as a self-adaptive mechanism efficiently capturing motion cues across a wide velocity spectrum, and (2) the first Collaborative Directional Gradient Calculation (CDGC) strategy, which enhances orienting accuracy and robustness while reducing computational overhead to one-eighth of previously isolated strategies. Evaluated on the real-world dataset RIST, the proposed vSTMD and its feedback-facilitated variant vSTMD-F achieve relative $F_{1}$ gains of $30\%$ and $58\%$ over state-of-the-art (SOTA) STMD approaches, respectively. Furthermore, both models demonstrate competitive orientation estimation performance compared to SOTA deep learning-driven methods. Experiments also reveal the superiority of the natural architecture for ET-object motion detection - vSTMD is $60\times$ faster than contemporary data-driven methods, making it highly suitable for real-time applications in dynamic scenarios and complex backgrounds.

      <description>arXiv:2501.15394v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 3D object detection and occupancy prediction are critical tasks in autonomous driving, attracting significant attention. Despite the potential of recent vision-based methods, they encounter challenges under adverse conditions. Thus, integrating cameras with next-generation 4D imaging radar to achieve unified multi-task perception is highly significant, though research in this domain remains limited. In this paper, we propose Doracamom, the first framework that fuses multi-view cameras and 4D radar for joint 3D object detection and semantic occupancy prediction, enabling comprehensive environmental perception. Specifically, we introduce a novel Coarse Voxel Queries Generator that integrates geometric priors from 4D radar with semantic features from images to initialize voxel queries, establishing a robust foundation for subsequent Transformer-based refinement. To leverage temporal information, we design a Dual-Branch Temporal Encoder that processes multi-modal temporal features in parallel across BEV and voxel spaces, enabling comprehensive spatio-temporal representation learning. Furthermore, we propose a Cross-Modal BEV-Voxel Fusion module that adaptively fuses complementary features through attention mechanisms while employing auxiliary tasks to enhance feature quality. Extensive experiments on the OmniHD-Scenes, View-of-Delft (VoD), and TJ4DRadSet datasets demonstrate that Doracamom achieves state-of-the-art performance in both tasks, establishing new benchmarks for multi-modal 3D perception. Code and models will be publicly available.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09680v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Leveraging vast amounts of unlabeled internet video data for embodied AI is currently bottlenecked by the lack of action labels and the presence of action-correlated visual distractors. Although recent latent action policy optimization (LAPO) has shown promise in inferring proxy action labels from visual observations, its performance degrades significantly when distractors are present. To address this limitation, we propose a novel object-centric latent action learning framework that centers on objects rather than pixels. We leverage self-supervised object-centric pretraining to disentangle the movement of the agent and distracting background dynamics. This allows LAPO to focus on task-relevant interactions, resulting in more robust proxy-action labels, enabling better imitation learning and efficient adaptation of the agent with just a few action-labeled trajectories. We evaluated our method in eight visually complex tasks across the Distracting Control Suite (DCS) and Distracting MetaWorld (DMW). Our results show that object-centric pretraining mitigates the negative effects of distractors by 50%, as measured by downstream task performance: average return (DCS) and success rate (DMW).</description>

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated exceptional performance in various vision tasks. However, they tend to underperform on smaller datasets due to their inherent lack of inductive biases. Current approaches address this limitation implicitly-often by pairing ViTs with pretext tasks or by distilling knowledge from convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to strengthen the prior. In contrast, Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs), a widely adopted self-supervised framework, are inherently structured to preserve topology and spatial organization, making them a promising candidate to directly address the limitations of ViTs in limited or small training datasets. Despite this potential, equipping SOMs with modern deep learning architectures remains largely unexplored. In this study, we conduct a novel exploration on how Vision Transformers (ViTs) and Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) can empower each other, aiming to bridge this critical research gap. Our findings demonstrate that these architectures can synergistically enhance each other, leading to significantly improved performance in both unsupervised and supervised tasks. Code is publicly available on GitHub.</description>

      <title>REF-VLM: Triplet-Based Referring Paradigm for Unified Visual Decoding</title>

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate robust zero-shot capabilities across diverse vision-language tasks after training on mega-scale datasets. However, dense prediction tasks, such as semantic segmentation and keypoint detection, pose significant challenges for MLLMs when represented solely as text outputs. Simultaneously, current MLLMs utilizing latent embeddings for visual task decoding generally demonstrate limited adaptability to both multi-task learning and multi-granularity scenarios. In this work, we present \textbf{REF-VLM}, an end-to-end framework for unified training of various visual decoding tasks. To address complex visual decoding scenarios, we introduce the \textbf{Triplet-Based Referring Paradigm (TRP)}, which explicitly decouples three critical dimensions in visual decoding tasks through a triplet structure: concepts, decoding types, and targets. TRP employs symbolic delimiters to enforce structured representation learning, enhancing the parsability and interpretability of model outputs. Additionally, we construct \textbf{Visual-Task Instruction Following Dataset (VT-Instruct)}, a large-scale multi-task dataset containing over 100 million multimodal dialogue samples across 25 task types. Beyond text inputs and outputs, VT-Instruct incorporates various visual prompts such as point, box, scribble, and mask, and generates outputs composed of text and visual units like box, keypoint, depth and mask. The combination of different visual prompts and visual units generates a wide variety of task types, expanding the applicability of REF-VLM significantly. Both qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our REF-VLM outperforms other MLLMs across a variety of standard benchmarks. The code, dataset, and demo will be publicly available.</description>

      <title>UVE: Are MLLMs Unified Evaluators for AI-Generated Videos?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09949v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the rapid growth of video generative models (VGMs), it is essential to develop reliable and comprehensive automatic metrics for AI-generated videos (AIGVs). Existing methods either use off-the-shelf models optimized for other tasks or rely on human assessment data to train specialized evaluators. These approaches are constrained to specific evaluation aspects and are difficult to scale with the increasing demands for finer-grained and more comprehensive evaluations. To address this issue, this work investigates the feasibility of using multimodal large language models (MLLMs) as a unified evaluator for AIGVs, leveraging their strong visual perception and language understanding capabilities. To evaluate the performance of automatic metrics in unified AIGV evaluation, we introduce a benchmark called UVE-Bench. UVE-Bench collects videos generated by state-of-the-art VGMs and provides pairwise human preference annotations across 15 evaluation aspects. Using UVE-Bench, we extensively evaluate 18 MLLMs. Our empirical results suggest that while advanced MLLMs (e.g., Qwen2VL-72B and InternVL2.5-78B) still lag behind human evaluators, they demonstrate promising ability in unified AIGV evaluation, significantly surpassing existing specialized evaluation methods. Additionally, we conduct an in-depth analysis of key design choices that impact the performance of MLLM-driven evaluators, offering valuable insights for future research on AIGV evaluation.</description>

      <title>A Text-to-3D Framework for Joint Generation of CG-Ready Humans and Compatible Garments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12052v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Creating detailed 3D human avatars with fitted garments traditionally requires specialized expertise and labor-intensive workflows. While recent advances in generative AI have enabled text-to-3D human and clothing synthesis, existing methods fall short in offering accessible, integrated pipelines for generating CG-ready 3D avatars with physically compatible outfits; here we use the term CG-ready for models following a technical aesthetic common in computer graphics (CG) and adopt standard CG polygonal meshes and strands representations (rather than neural representations like NeRF and 3DGS) that can be directly integrated into conventional CG pipelines and support downstream tasks such as physical simulation. To bridge this gap, we introduce Tailor, an integrated text-to-3D framework that generates high-fidelity, customizable 3D avatars dressed in simulation-ready garments. Tailor consists of three stages. (1) Seman tic Parsing: we employ a large language model to interpret textual descriptions and translate them into parameterized human avatars and semantically matched garment templates. (2) Geometry-Aware Garment Generation: we propose topology-preserving deformation with novel geometric losses to generate body-aligned garments under text control. (3) Consistent Texture Synthesis: we propose a novel multi-view diffusion process optimized for garment texturing, which enforces view consistency, preserves photorealistic details, and optionally supports symmetric texture generation common in garments. Through comprehensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations, we demonstrate that Tailor outperforms state-of-the-art methods in fidelity, usability, and diversity. Our code will be released for academic use. Project page: https://human-tailor.github.io</description>

      <title>YOLO-LLTS: Real-Time Low-Light Traffic Sign Detection via Prior-Guided Enhancement and Multibranch Feature Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13883v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traffic sign detection is essential for autonomous driving and Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS). However, existing methods struggle to address the challenges of poor image quality and insufficient information under low-light conditions, leading to a decline in detection accuracy and affecting driving safety. To address this issue, we propose YOLO-LLTS, an end-to-end real-time traffic sign detection algorithm specifically designed for low-light environments. YOLO-LLTS introduces three main contributions: the HRFM-SOD module retains more information about distant or tiny traffic signs compared to traditional methods; the MFIA module interacts features with different receptive fields to improve information utilization; the PGFE module enhances detection accuracy by improving brightness, edges, contrast, and supplementing detail information. Additionally, we construct a new dataset, the Chinese Nighttime Traffic Sign Sample Set (CNTSSS), covering diverse nighttime scenarios. Experiments show that YOLO-LLTS achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming previous best methods by 2.7% mAP50 and 1.6% mAP50:95 on TT100K-night, 1.3% mAP50 and 1.9% mAP50:95 on CNTSSS, 7.5% mAP50 and 9.8% mAP50:95 on GTSDB-night, and superior results on CCTSDB2021. Deployment on edge devices confirms its real-time applicability and effectiveness. The code and the dataset are available at https://github.com/linzy88/YOLO-LLTS.</description>

      <title>Light4GS: Lightweight Compact 4D Gaussian Splatting Generation via Context Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13948v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as an efficient and high-fidelity paradigm for novel view synthesis. To adapt 3DGS for dynamic content, deformable 3DGS incorporates temporally deformable primitives with learnable latent embeddings to capture complex motions. Despite its impressive performance, the high-dimensional embeddings and vast number of primitives lead to substantial storage requirements. In this paper, we introduce a \textbf{Light}weight \textbf{4}D\textbf{GS} framework, called Light4GS, that employs significance pruning with a deep context model to provide a lightweight storage-efficient dynamic 3DGS representation. The proposed Light4GS is based on 4DGS that is a typical representation of deformable 3DGS. Specifically, our framework is built upon two core components: (1) a spatio-temporal significance pruning strategy that eliminates over 64\% of the deformable primitives, followed by an entropy-constrained spherical harmonics compression applied to the remainder; and (2) a deep context model that integrates intra- and inter-prediction with hyperprior into a coarse-to-fine context structure to enable efficient multiscale latent embedding compression. Our approach achieves over 120x compression and increases rendering FPS up to 20\% compared to the baseline 4DGS, and also superior to frame-wise state-of-the-art 3DGS compression methods, revealing the effectiveness of our Light4GS in terms of both intra- and inter-prediction methods without sacrificing rendering quality.</description>

      <title>PraNet-V2: Dual-Supervised Reverse Attention for Medical Image Segmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10986v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate medical image segmentation is essential for effective diagnosis and treatment. Previously, PraNet-V1 was proposed to enhance polyp segmentation by introducing a reverse attention (RA) module that utilizes background information. However, PraNet-V1 struggles with multi-class segmentation tasks. To address this limitation, we propose PraNet-V2, which, compared to PraNet-V1, effectively performs a broader range of tasks including multi-class segmentation. At the core of PraNet-V2 is the Dual-Supervised Reverse Attention (DSRA) module, which incorporates explicit background supervision, independent background modeling, and semantically enriched attention fusion. Our PraNet-V2 framework demonstrates strong performance on four polyp segmentation datasets. Additionally, by integrating DSRA to iteratively enhance foreground segmentation results in three state-of-the-art semantic segmentation models, we achieve up to a 1.36% improvement in mean Dice score. Code is available at: https://github.com/ai4colonoscopy/PraNet-V2/tree/main/binary_seg/jittor.</description>

      <title>ESPLoRA: Enhanced Spatial Precision with Low-Rank Adaption in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models for High-Definition Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13745v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion models have revolutionized text-to-image (T2I) synthesis, producing high-quality, photorealistic images. However, they still struggle to properly render the spatial relationships described in text prompts. To address the lack of spatial information in T2I generations, existing methods typically use external network conditioning and predefined layouts, resulting in higher computational costs and reduced flexibility. Our approach builds upon a curated dataset of spatially explicit prompts, meticulously extracted and synthesized from LAION-400M to ensure precise alignment between textual descriptions and spatial layouts. Alongside this dataset, we present ESPLoRA, a flexible fine-tuning framework based on Low-Rank Adaptation, specifically designed to enhance spatial consistency in generative models without increasing generation time or compromising the quality of the outputs. In addition to ESPLoRA, we propose refined evaluation metrics grounded in geometric constraints, capturing 3D spatial relations such as "in front of" or "behind". These metrics also expose spatial biases in T2I models which, even when not fully mitigated, can be strategically exploited by our TORE algorithm to further improve the spatial consistency of generated images. Our method outperforms CoMPaSS, the current baseline framework, on spatial consistency benchmarks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14736v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Plant developmental plasticity, particularly in root system architecture, is fundamental to understanding adaptability and agricultural sustainability. ChronoRoot 2.0 builds upon established low-cost hardware while significantly enhancing software capabilities and usability. The system employs nnUNet architecture for multi-class segmentation, demonstrating significant accuracy improvements while simultaneously tracking six distinct plant structures encompassing root, shoot, and seed components: main root, lateral roots, seed, hypocotyl, leaves, and petiole. This architecture enables easy retraining and incorporation of additional training data without requiring machine learning expertise. The platform introduces dual specialized graphical interfaces: a Standard Interface for detailed architectural analysis with novel gravitropic response parameters, and a Screening Interface enabling high-throughput analysis of multiple plants through automated tracking. Functional Principal Component Analysis integration enables discovery of novel phenotypic parameters through temporal pattern comparison. We demonstrate multi-species analysis, with Arabidopsis thaliana and Solanum lycopersicum, both morphologically distinct plant species. Three use cases in Arabidopsis thaliana and validation with tomato seedlings demonstrate enhanced capabilities: circadian growth pattern characterization, gravitropic response analysis in transgenic plants, and high-throughput etiolation screening across multiple genotypes.ChronoRoot 2.0 maintains the low-cost, modular hardware advantages of its predecessor while dramatically improving accessibility through intuitive graphical interfaces and expanded analytical capabilities. The open-source platform makes sophisticated temporal plant phenotyping more accessible to researchers without computational expertise.</description>

Abstract: Gas leaks pose significant risks to human health and the environment. Despite long-standing concerns, there are limited methods that can efficiently and accurately detect and segment leaks due to their concealed appearance and random shapes. In this paper, we propose a Fine-grained Spatial-Temporal Perception (FGSTP) algorithm for gas leak segmentation. FGSTP captures critical motion clues across frames and integrates them with refined object features in an end-to-end network. Specifically, we first construct a correlation volume to capture motion information between consecutive frames. Then, the fine-grained perception progressively refines the object-level features using previous outputs. Finally, a decoder is employed to optimize boundary segmentation. Because there is no highly precise labeled dataset for gas leak segmentation, we manually label a gas leak video dataset, GasVid. Experimental results on GasVid demonstrate that our model excels in segmenting non-rigid objects such as gas leaks, generating the most accurate mask compared to other state-of-the-art (SOTA) models.</description>

      <title>A Large-scale Benchmark on Geological Fault Delineation Models: Domain Shift, Training Dynamics, Generalizability, Evaluation and Inferential Behavior</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08585v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning has taken a critical role in seismic interpretation workflows, especially in fault delineation tasks. However, despite the recent proliferation of pretrained models and synthetic datasets, the field still lacks a systematic understanding of the generalizability limits of these models across seismic data representing diverse geologic, acquisition and processing settings. Distributional shifts between data sources, limitations in fine-tuning strategies and labeled data accessibility, and inconsistent evaluation protocols all remain major roadblocks to deploying reliable models in real-world exploration. In this paper, we present the first large-scale benchmarking study explicitly designed to provide guidelines for domain shift strategies in seismic interpretation. Our benchmark spans over 200 combinations of model architectures, datasets and training strategies, across three datasets (synthetic and real) including FaultSeg3D, CRACKS, and Thebe. We systematically assess pretraining, fine-tuning, and joint training under varying domain shifts. Our analysis shows that common fine-tuning practices can lead to catastrophic forgetting, especially when source and target datasets are disjoint, and that larger models such as Segformer are more robust than smaller architectures. We also find that domain adaptation methods outperform fine-tuning when shifts are large, yet underperform when domains are similar. Finally, we complement segmentation metrics with a novel analysis based on fault characteristic descriptors, revealing how models absorb structural biases from training datasets. Overall, we establish a robust experimental baseline that provides insights into tradeoffs in current fault delineation workflows and highlights directions for building more generalizable and interpretable models.</description>

      <title>SM3D: Mitigating Spectral Bias and Semantic Dilution in Point Cloud State Space Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11099v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Point clouds are a fundamental 3D data representation that underpins various computer vision tasks. Recently, Mamba has demonstrated strong potential for 3D point cloud understanding. However, existing approaches primarily focus on point serialization, overlooking a more fundamental limitation: State Space Models (SSMs) inherently exhibit a spectral low-pass bias arising from their recursive formulation. In serialized point clouds, this bias is particularly detrimental, as it suppresses high-frequency geometric structures and progressively dilutes semantic discriminability across deep layers. To address these limitations, we propose SM3D, a spectral-aware framework designed to jointly preserve geometric fidelity and semantic consistency. First, a Geometric Spectral Compensator (GSC) is introduced to counteract the low-pass bias by explicitly injecting graph-guided high-frequency components through local Laplacian analysis, thereby restoring structural sensitivity. Second, we design a Semantic Coherence Refiner (SCR) to rectify semantic drift through frequency-aware channel recalibration. To balance theoretical precision and computational efficiency, SCR is instantiated via two pathways: an exact Laplacian eigendecomposition (SCR-L) and a linear-complexity Chebyshev polynomial approximation (SCR-C). Extensive experiments demonstrate that SM3D achieves state-of-the-art performance, including 96.0% accuracy on ModelNet40 and 86.5% mIoU on ShapeNetPart, validating its effectiveness in mitigating spectral low-pass bias and semantic dilution (Code: https://github.com/L1277471578/SM3D).</description>

Recent USS methods extract pixel-level features using frozen visual foundation models and refine them through self-supervised objectives that encourage semantic grouping. These features are then grouped to semantic clusters to produce segmentation masks. Extending these ideas to federated settings requires feature representation and cluster centroid alignment across distributed clients, an inherently difficult task under heterogeneous data distributions in the absence of supervision. To address this, we propose FUSS (Federated Unsupervised image Semantic Segmentation) which is, to our knowledge, the first framework to enable fully decentralized, label-free semantic segmentation training. FUSS introduces novel federation strategies that promote global consistency in feature and prototype space, jointly optimizing local segmentation heads and shared semantic centroids. Experiments on both benchmark and real-world datasets, including binary and multi-class segmentation tasks, show that FUSS consistently outperforms local-only client trainings as well as extensions of classical FL algorithms under varying client data distributions.

      <description>arXiv:2505.24866v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of talking-head deepfake generation fueled by advanced generative models has elevated the realism of synthetic videos to a level that poses substantial risks in domains such as media, politics, and finance. However, current benchmarks for deepfake talking-head detection fail to reflect this progress, relying on outdated generators and offering limited insight into model robustness and generalization. We introduce TalkingHeadBench, a comprehensive multi-model multi-generator benchmark and curated dataset designed to evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art detectors on the most advanced generators. Our dataset includes deepfakes synthesized by leading academic and commercial models and features carefully constructed protocols to assess generalization under distribution shifts in identity and generator characteristics. We benchmark a diverse set of existing detection methods, including CNNs, vision transformers, and temporal models, and analyze their robustness and generalization capabilities. In addition, we provide error analysis using Grad-CAM visualizations to expose common failure modes and detector biases. TalkingHeadBench is hosted on https://huggingface.co/datasets/luchaoqi/TalkingHeadBench with open access to all data splits and protocols. Our benchmark aims to accelerate research towards more robust and generalizable detection models in the face of rapidly evolving generative techniques.</description>

      <title>SiLVR: A Simple Language-based Video Reasoning Framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.24869v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in test-time optimization have led to remarkable reasoning capabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs), enabling them to solve highly complex problems in math and coding. However, the reasoning capabilities of multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) still significantly lag, especially for complex video-language tasks. To address this issue, we present SILVR, a Simple Language-based Video Reasoning framework that decomposes complex video understanding into two stages. In the first stage, SILVR transforms raw video into language-based representations using multisensory inputs, such as short clip captions and audio/speech subtitles. In the second stage, language descriptions are fed into a powerful reasoning LLM to solve complex video-language understanding tasks. To handle long-context multisensory inputs, we use an Adaptive Context Reduction scheme, which dynamically determines the temporal granularity with which to sample the tokens. Our simple, modular, and training-free video reasoning framework achieves the best-reported results on Video-MME (long), Video-MMMU (comprehension), Video-MMLU, CGBench, and EgoLife. Furthermore, our empirical study focused on video reasoning capabilities shows that, despite not being explicitly trained on video, strong reasoning LLMs can effectively aggregate multisensory input information from video, speech, and audio for complex temporal, causal, long-context, and knowledge acquisition reasoning tasks in video.

      <title>CulturalFrames: Assessing Cultural Expectation Alignment in Text-to-Image Models and Evaluation Metrics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08835v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The increasing ubiquity of text-to-image (T2I) models as tools for visual content generation raises concerns about their ability to accurately represent diverse cultural contexts -- where missed cues can stereotype communities and undermine usability. In this work, we present the first study to systematically quantify the alignment of T2I models and evaluation metrics with respect to both explicit (stated) as well as implicit (unstated, implied by the prompt's cultural context) cultural expectations. To this end, we introduce CulturalFrames, a novel benchmark designed for rigorous human evaluation of cultural representation in visual generations. Spanning 10 countries and 5 socio-cultural domains, CulturalFrames comprises 983 prompts, 3637 corresponding images generated by 4 state-of-the-art T2I models, and over 10k detailed human annotations. We find that across models and countries, cultural expectations are missed an average of 44% of the time. Among these failures, explicit expectations are missed at a surprisingly high average rate of 68%, while implicit expectation failures are also significant, averaging 49%. Furthermore, we show that existing T2I evaluation metrics correlate poorly with human judgments of cultural alignment, irrespective of their internal reasoning. Collectively, our findings expose critical gaps, provide a concrete testbed, and outline actionable directions for developing culturally informed T2I models and metrics that improve global usability.</description>

      <title>Synthetic Geology: Structural Geology Meets Deep Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.11164v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reconstructing the structural geology and mineral composition of the first few kilometers of the Earth's subsurface from sparse or indirect surface observations remains a long-standing challenge with critical applications in mineral exploration, geohazard assessment, and geotechnical engineering. This inherently ill-posed problem is often addressed by classical geophysical inversion methods, which typically yield a single maximum-likelihood model that fails to capture the full range of plausible geology. The adoption of modern deep learning methods has been limited by the lack of large 3D training datasets. We address this gap with \textit{StructuralGeo}, a geological simulation engine that mimics eons of tectonic, magmatic, and sedimentary processes to generate a virtually limitless supply of realistic synthetic 3D lithological models. Using this dataset, we train both unconditional and conditional generative flow-matching models with a 3D attention U-Net architecture. The resulting foundation model can reconstruct multiple plausible 3D scenarios from surface topography and sparse borehole data, depicting structures such as layers, faults, folds, and dikes. By sampling many reconstructions from the same observations, we introduce a probabilistic framework for estimating the size and extent of subsurface features. While the realism of the output is bounded by the fidelity of the training data to true geology, this combination of simulation and generative AI functions offers a flexible prior for probabilistic modeling, regional fine-tuning, and use as an AI-based regularizer in traditional geophysical inversion workflows.</description>

      <title>Scaling Laws for Geospatial Foundation Models: A case study on PhilEO Bench</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14765v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Foundation Models (FMs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance across domains by leveraging large-scale pretraining. In Earth Observation (EO), the availability of petabyte-scale satellite archives has recently enabled the development of GeoSpatial Foundation Models (GFMs). Yet, fundamental questions remain regarding how dataset size, model architecture, and size interact to determine downstream performance. In this work, we systematically explore this design space by pretraining and fine-tuning models on three dataset scales: PhilEO Globe (0.5TB), FastTOM (2TB, introduced here), and MajorTOM (23TB). We evaluate three architectural families: Geo-Aware U-Net (CNN), ViT-UPerNet (Transformer), and Mamba (State-Space Model); across model sizes ranging from 44M to 300M parameters. All models are benchmarked on the PhilEO Bench, covering: road density and building density regression, and land cover segmentation, and are compared against existing GFMs such as TerraMind and Prithvi-EO-2.0. Our results show that CNN-based models remain highly competitive in low-shot settings, with a 200M-parameter Geo-Aware U-Net outperforming larger architectures on regression tasks. However, when scaling to multi-terabyte datasets, ViT-UPerNet achieves the best performance, particularly for semantic segmentation on MajorTOM (23TB). Finally, we provide the first extensive evaluation of Mamba models in EO, highlighting their potential efficiency advantages, though further large-scale pretraining is required to fully match CNNs and ViTs. All code, pretrained models, and the FastTOM dataset are released publicly, enabling reproducibility and further exploration of scaling laws for GFMs.</description>

      <title>SoK: On the Survivability of Backdoor Attacks on Unconstrained Face Recognition Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01607v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The widespread deployment of Deep Learning-based Face Recognition Systems raises many security concerns. While prior research has identified backdoor vulnerabilities on isolated components, Backdoor Attacks on real-world, unconstrained pipelines remain underexplored. This SoK paper presents the first comprehensive system-level analysis and measurement of the impact of Backdoor Attacks on fully-fledged Face Recognition Systems. We combine the existing Supervised Learning backdoor literature targeting face detectors, face antispoofing, and face feature extractors to demonstrate a system-level vulnerability. By analyzing 20 pipeline configurations and 15 attack scenarios in a holistic manner, we reveal that an attacker only needs a single backdoored model to compromise an entire Face Recognition System. Finally, we discuss the impact of such attacks and propose best practices and countermeasures for stakeholders.</description>

      <title>Visual Hand Gesture Recognition with Deep Learning: A Comprehensive Review of Methods, Datasets, Challenges and Future Research Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04465v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid evolution of deep learning (DL) models and the ever-increasing size of available datasets have raised the interest of the research community in the always important field of visual hand gesture recognition (VHGR), and delivered a wide range of applications, such as sign language understanding and human-computer interaction using cameras. Despite the large volume of research works in the field, a structured and complete survey on VHGR is still missing, leaving researchers to navigate through hundreds of papers in order to find the right combination of data, model, and approach for each task. The current survey aims to fill this gap by presenting a comprehensive overview of this computer vision field. With a systematic research methodology that identifies the state-of-the-art works and a structured presentation of the various methods, datasets, and evaluation metrics, this review aims to constitute a useful guideline for researchers, helping them to choose the right strategy for handling a VHGR task. Starting with the methodology used to locate the related literature, the survey identifies and organizes the key VHGR approaches in a taxonomy-based format, and presents the various dimensions that affect the final method choice, such as input modality, task type, and application domain. The state-of-the-art techniques are grouped across three primary VHGR tasks: static gesture recognition, isolated dynamic gestures, and continuous gesture recognition. For each task, the architectural trends and learning strategies are listed. To support the experimental evaluation of future methods in the field, the study reviews commonly used datasets and presents the standard performance metrics. Our survey concludes by identifying the major challenges in VHGR, including both general computer vision issues and domain-specific obstacles, and outlines promising directions for future research.</description>

      <title>SGPMIL: Sparse Gaussian Process Multiple Instance Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08711v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) offers a natural solution for settings where only coarse, bag-level labels are available, without having access to instance-level annotations. This is usually the case in digital pathology, which consists of gigapixel-sized images. While deterministic attention-based MIL approaches achieve strong bag-level performance, they often overlook the uncertainty inherent in instance relevance. In this paper, we address the lack of uncertainty quantification in instance-level attention scores by introducing SGPMIL, a new probabilistic attention-based MIL framework grounded in Sparse Gaussian Processes (SGP). By learning a posterior distribution over attention scores, SGPMIL enables principled uncertainty estimation, resulting in more reliable and calibrated instance relevance maps. Our approach not only preserves competitive bag-level performance but also significantly improves the quality and interpretability of instance-level predictions under uncertainty. SGPMIL extends prior work by introducing feature scaling in the SGP predictive mean function, leading to faster training, improved efficiency, and enhanced instance-level performance. Extensive experiments on multiple well-established digital pathology datasets highlight the effectiveness of our approach across both bag- and instance-level evaluations. Our code is available at https://github.com/mandlos/SGPMIL.</description>

      <title>Paired Image Generation with Diffusion-Guided Diffusion Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14833v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The segmentation of mass lesions in digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) images is very significant for the early screening of breast cancer. However, the high-density breast tissue often leads to high concealment of the mass lesions, which makes manual annotation difficult and time-consuming. As a result, there is a lack of annotated data for model training. Diffusion models are commonly used for data augmentation, but the existing methods face two challenges. First, due to the high concealment of lesions, it is difficult for the model to learn the features of the lesion area. This leads to the low generation quality of the lesion areas, thus limiting the quality of the generated images. Second, existing methods can only generate images and cannot generate corresponding annotations, which restricts the usability of the generated images in supervised training. In this work, we propose a paired image generation method. The method does not require external conditions and can achieve the generation of paired images by training an extra diffusion guider for the conditional diffusion model. During the experimental phase, we generated paired DBT slices and mass lesion masks. Then, we incorporated them into the supervised training process of the mass lesion segmentation task. The experimental results show that our method can improve the generation quality without external conditions. Moreover, it contributes to alleviating the shortage of annotated data, thus enhancing the performance of downstream tasks.

      <title>Comparative validation of surgical phase recognition, instrument keypoint estimation, and instrument instance segmentation in endoscopy: Results of the PhaKIR 2024 challenge</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16559v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reliable recognition and localization of surgical instruments in endoscopic video recordings are foundational for a wide range of applications in computer- and robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery (RAMIS), including surgical training, skill assessment, and autonomous assistance. However, robust performance under real-world conditions remains a significant challenge. Incorporating surgical context - such as the current procedural phase - has emerged as a promising strategy to improve robustness and interpretability.
  To address these challenges, we organized the Surgical Procedure Phase, Keypoint, and Instrument Recognition (PhaKIR) sub-challenge as part of the Endoscopic Vision (EndoVis) challenge at MICCAI 2024. We introduced a novel, multi-center dataset comprising thirteen full-length laparoscopic cholecystectomy videos collected from three distinct medical institutions, with unified annotations for three interrelated tasks: surgical phase recognition, instrument keypoint estimation, and instrument instance segmentation. Unlike existing datasets, ours enables joint investigation of instrument localization and procedural context within the same data while supporting the integration of temporal information across entire procedures.
  We report results and findings in accordance with the BIAS guidelines for biomedical image analysis challenges. The PhaKIR sub-challenge advances the field by providing a unique benchmark for developing temporally aware, context-driven methods in RAMIS and offers a high-quality resource to support future research in surgical scene understanding.</description>

      <title>Wukong Framework for Not Safe For Work Detection in Text-to-Image systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00591v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) generation is a popular AI-generated content (AIGC) technology enabling diverse and creative image synthesis. However, some outputs may contain Not Safe For Work (NSFW) content (e.g., violence), violating community guidelines. Detecting NSFW content efficiently and accurately, known as external safeguarding, is essential. Existing external safeguards fall into two types: text filters, which analyze user prompts but overlook T2I model-specific variations and are prone to adversarial attacks; and image filters, which analyze final generated images but are computationally costly and introduce latency. Diffusion models, the foundation of modern T2I systems like Stable Diffusion, generate images through iterative denoising using a U-Net architecture with ResNet and Transformer blocks. We observe that: (1) early denoising steps define the semantic layout of the image, and (2) cross-attention layers in U-Net are crucial for aligning text and image regions. Based on these insights, we propose Wukong, a transformer-based NSFW detection framework that leverages intermediate outputs from early denoising steps and reuses U-Net's pre-trained cross-attention parameters. Wukong operates within the diffusion process, enabling early detection without waiting for full image generation. We also introduce a new dataset containing prompts, seeds, and image-specific NSFW labels, and evaluate Wukong on this and two public benchmarks. Results show that Wukong significantly outperforms text-based safeguards and achieves comparable accuracy of image filters, while offering much greater efficiency.</description>

      <title>HCF: Hierarchical Cascade Framework for Distributed Multi-Stage Image Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02051v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Distributed multi-stage image compression -- where visual content traverses multiple processing nodes under varying quality requirements -- poses challenges. Progressive methods enable bitstream truncation but underutilize available compute resources; successive compression repeats costly pixel-domain operations and suffers cumulative quality loss and inefficiency; fixed-parameter models lack post-encoding flexibility. In this work, we developed the Hierarchical Cascade Framework (HCF) that achieves high rate-distortion performance and better computational efficiency through direct latent-space transformations across network nodes in distributed multi-stage image compression systems. Under HCF, we introduced policy-driven quantization control to optimize rate-distortion trade-offs, and established the edge quantization principle through differential entropy analysis. The configuration based on this principle demonstrates up to 0.6dB PSNR gains over other configurations. When comprehensively evaluated on the Kodak, CLIC, and CLIC2020-mobile datasets, HCF outperforms successive-compression methods by up to 5.56% BD-Rate in PSNR on CLIC, while saving up to 97.8% FLOPs, 96.5% GPU memory, and 90.0% execution time. It also outperforms state-of-the-art progressive compression methods by up to 12.64% BD-Rate on Kodak and enables retraining-free cross-quality adaptation with 7.13-10.87% BD-Rate reductions on CLIC2020-mobile.</description>

      <title>Infrared Object Detection with Ultra Small ConvNets: Is ImageNet Pretraining Still Useful?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02927v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many real-world applications require recognition models that are robust to different operational conditions and modalities, but at the same time run on small embedded devices, with limited hardware. While for normal size models, pre-training is known to be very beneficial in accuracy and robustness, for small models, that can be employed for embedded and edge devices, its effect is not clear. In this work, we investigate the effect of ImageNet pretraining on increasingly small backbone architectures (ultra-small models, with less than 1M parameters) with respect to robustness in downstream object detection tasks in the infrared visual modality. Using scaling laws derived from standard object recognition architectures, we construct two ultra-small backbone families and systematically study their performance. Our experiments on three different datasets reveal that while ImageNet pre-training is still useful, beyond a certain capacity threshold, it offers diminishing returns in terms of out-of-distribution detection robustness. Therefore, we advise practitioners to still use pre-training and, when possible avoid too small models as while they might work well for in-domain problems, they are brittle when working conditions are different.</description>

      <title>HierarchicalPrune: Position-Aware Compression for Large-Scale Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04663v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-image diffusion models (DMs) achieve remarkable quality, yet their massive parameter scale (8-11B) poses significant challenges for inferences on resource-constrained devices. In this paper, we present HierarchicalPrune, a novel compression framework grounded in a key observation: DM blocks exhibit distinct functional hierarchies, where early blocks establish semantic structures while later blocks handle texture refinements. HierarchicalPrune synergistically combines three techniques: (1) Hierarchical Position Pruning, which identifies and removes less essential later blocks based on position hierarchy; (2) Positional Weight Preservation, which systematically protects early model portions that are essential for semantic structural integrity; and (3) Sensitivity-Guided Distillation, which adjusts knowledge-transfer intensity based on our discovery of block-wise sensitivity variations. As a result, our framework brings billion-scale diffusion models into a range more suitable for on-device inference, while preserving the quality of the output images. Specifically, combined with INT4 weight quantisation, HierarchicalPrune achieves 77.5-80.4% memory footprint reduction (e.g., from 15.8 GB to 3.2 GB) and 27.9-38.0% latency reduction, measured on server and consumer grade GPUs, with the minimum drop of 2.6% in GenEval score and 7% in HPSv2 score compared to the original model. Finally, our comprehensive user study with 85 participants demonstrates that HierarchicalPrune maintains perceptual quality comparable to the original model while significantly outperforming prior works.</description>

      <title>Single-Step Reconstruction-Free Anomaly Detection and Segmentation via Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04818v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generative models have demonstrated significant success in anomaly detection and segmentation over the past decade. Recently, diffusion models have emerged as a powerful alternative, outperforming previous approaches such as GANs and VAEs. In typical diffusion-based anomaly detection, a model is trained on normal data, and during inference, anomalous images are perturbed to a predefined intermediate step in the forward diffusion process. The corresponding normal image is then reconstructed through iterative reverse sampling.
  However, reconstruction-based approaches present three major challenges: (1) the reconstruction process is computationally expensive due to multiple sampling steps, making real-time applications impractical; (2) for complex or subtle patterns, the reconstructed image may correspond to a different normal pattern rather than the original input; and (3) Choosing an appropriate intermediate noise level is challenging because it is application-dependent and often assumes prior knowledge of anomalies, an assumption that does not hold in unsupervised settings.
  We introduce Reconstruction-free Anomaly Detection with Attention-based diffusion models in Real-time (RADAR), which overcomes the limitations of reconstruction-based anomaly detection. Unlike current SOTA methods that reconstruct the input image, RADAR directly produces anomaly maps from the diffusion model, improving both detection accuracy and computational efficiency. We evaluate RADAR on real-world 3D-printed material and the MVTec-AD dataset. Our approach surpasses state-of-the-art diffusion-based and statistical machine learning models across all key metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Specifically, RADAR improves F1 score by 7% on MVTec-AD and 13% on the 3D-printed material dataset compared to the next best model.

      <title>CycleDiff: Cycle Diffusion Models for Unpaired Image-to-image Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06625v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a diffusion-based cross-domain image translator in the absence of paired training data. Unlike GAN-based methods, our approach integrates diffusion models to learn the image translation process, allowing for more coverable modeling of the data distribution and performance improvement of the cross-domain translation. However, incorporating the translation process within the diffusion process is still challenging since the two processes are not aligned exactly, i.e., the diffusion process is applied to the noisy signal while the translation process is conducted on the clean signal. As a result, recent diffusion-based studies employ separate training or shallow integration to learn the two processes, yet this may cause the local minimal of the translation optimization, constraining the effectiveness of diffusion models. To address the problem, we propose a novel joint learning framework that aligns the diffusion and the translation process, thereby improving the global optimality. Specifically, we propose to extract the image components with diffusion models to represent the clean signal and employ the translation process with the image components, enabling an end-to-end joint learning manner. On the other hand, we introduce a time-dependent translation network to learn the complex translation mapping, resulting in effective translation learning and significant performance improvement. Benefiting from the design of joint learning, our method enables global optimization of both processes, enhancing the optimality and achieving improved fidelity and structural consistency. We have conducted extensive experiments on RGB$\leftrightarrow$RGB and diverse cross-modality translation tasks including RGB$\leftrightarrow$Edge, RGB$\leftrightarrow$Semantics and RGB$\leftrightarrow$Depth, showcasing better generative performances than the state of the arts.</description>

      <title>Calibration Attention: Learning Reliability-Aware Representations for Vision Transformers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08547v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most calibration methods operate at the logit level, implicitly assuming that miscalibration can be corrected without changing the underlying representation. We challenge this assumption and propose \textbf{Calibration Attention (CalAttn)}, a \emph{representation-aware} calibration module for vision transformers that couples instance-wise temperature scaling to transformer token geometry under a proper scoring objective. CalAttn predicts a sample-specific temperature from the \texttt{[CLS]} token and backpropagates calibration gradients into the backbone, thereby reshaping the uncertainty structure of the representation rather than post-hoc adjusting confidence. This yields \emph{token-conditioned uncertainty modulation} with negligible overhead (\(&lt;0.1\%\) additional parameters). Across multiple datasets with ViT/DeiT/Swin backbones, CalAttn consistently improves calibration while preserving accuracy, achieving relative ECE reductions of \(3.7\%\) to \(77.7\%\) over strong baselines across diverse training objectives. Our results indicate that treating calibration as a representation-level problem is a practical and effective direction for trustworthy uncertainty estimation in transformers.

      <title>Transferable Model-agnostic Vision-Language Model Adaptation for Efficient Weak-to-Strong Generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08604v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been widely used in various visual recognition tasks due to their remarkable generalization capabilities. As these models grow in size and complexity, fine-tuning becomes costly, emphasizing the need to reuse adaptation knowledge from 'weaker' models to efficiently enhance 'stronger' ones. However, existing adaptation transfer methods exhibit limited transferability across models due to their model-specific design and high computational demands. To tackle this, we propose Transferable Model-agnostic adapter (TransMiter), a light-weight adapter that improves vision-language models 'without backpropagation'. TransMiter captures the knowledge gap between pre-trained and fine-tuned VLMs, in an 'unsupervised' manner. Once trained, this knowledge can be seamlessly transferred across different models without the need for backpropagation. Moreover, TransMiter consists of only a few layers, inducing a negligible additional inference cost. Notably, supplementing the process with a few labeled data further yields additional performance gain, often surpassing a fine-tuned stronger model, with a marginal training cost. Experimental results and analyses demonstrate that TransMiter effectively and efficiently transfers adaptation knowledge while preserving generalization abilities across VLMs of different sizes and architectures in visual recognition tasks.</description>

      <title>Integrating Reinforcement Learning with Visual Generative Models: Foundations and Advances</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.10316v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generative models have made significant progress in synthesizing visual content, including images, videos, and 3D/4D structures. However, they are typically trained with surrogate objectives such as likelihood or reconstruction loss, which often misalign with perceptual quality, semantic accuracy, or physical realism. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a principled framework for optimizing non-differentiable, preference-driven, and temporally structured objectives. Recent advances demonstrate its effectiveness in enhancing controllability, consistency, and human alignment across generative tasks. This survey provides a systematic overview of RL-based methods for visual content generation. We review the evolution of RL from classical control to its role as a general-purpose optimization tool, and examine its integration into image, video, and 3D/4D generation. Across these domains, RL serves not only as a fine-tuning mechanism but also as a structural component for aligning generation with complex, high-level goals. We conclude with open challenges and future research directions at the intersection of RL and generative modeling.</description>

      <title>STRIDE-QA: Visual Question Answering Dataset for Spatiotemporal Reasoning in Urban Driving Scenes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.10427v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been applied to autonomous driving to support decision-making in complex real-world scenarios. However, their training on static, web-sourced image-text pairs fundamentally limits the precise spatiotemporal reasoning required to understand and predict dynamic traffic scenes. We address this critical gap with STRIDE-QA, a large-scale visual question answering (VQA) dataset for physically grounded reasoning from an ego-centric perspective. Constructed from 100 hours of multi-sensor driving data in Tokyo, capturing diverse and challenging conditions, STRIDE-QA is the largest VQA dataset for spatiotemporal reasoning in urban driving, offering 16M QA pairs over 270K frames. Grounded by dense, automatically generated annotations including 3D bounding boxes, segmentation masks, and multi-object tracks, the dataset uniquely supports both object-centric and ego-centric reasoning through three novel QA tasks that require spatial localization and temporal prediction. Our benchmarks demonstrate that existing VLMs struggle significantly, with near-zero scores on prediction consistency. In contrast, VLMs fine-tuned on STRIDE-QA exhibit dramatic performance gains, achieving 55% success in spatial localization and 28% consistency in future motion prediction, compared to near-zero scores from general-purpose VLMs. Therefore, STRIDE-QA establishes a comprehensive foundation for developing more reliable VLMs for safety-critical autonomous systems.</description>

Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-image models produce visually impressive results but often struggle with precise alignment to text prompts, leading to missing critical elements or unintended blending of distinct concepts. We propose a novel approach that learns a high-success-rate distribution conditioned on a target prompt, ensuring that generated images faithfully reflect the corresponding prompts. Our method explicitly models the signal component during the denoising process, offering fine-grained control that mitigates over-optimization and out-of-distribution artifacts. Moreover, our framework is training-free and seamlessly integrates with both existing diffusion and flow matching architectures. It also supports additional conditioning modalities -- such as bounding boxes -- for enhanced spatial alignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at https://github.com/grimalPaul/gsn-factory.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Multi-Modality Trackers via Sensitivity-regularized Tuning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17488v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper tackles the critical challenge of optimizing multi-modality trackers by effectively adapting pre-trained models for RGB data. Existing fine-tuning paradigms oscillate between excessive freedom and over-restriction, both leading to a suboptimal plasticity-stability trade-off. To mitigate this dilemma, we propose a novel sensitivity-regularized fine-tuning framework, which delicately refines the learning process by incorporating intrinsic parameter sensitivities. Through a comprehensive investigation of the transition from pre-trained to multi-modal contexts, we identify that parameters sensitive to pivotal foundational patterns and cross-domain shifts are the primary drivers of this issue. Specifically, we first probe the tangent space of pre-trained weights to measure and orient prior sensitivities, dedicated to preserving generalization. Subsequently, we characterize transfer sensitivities during the tuning phase, emphasizing adaptability and stability. By incorporating these sensitivities as unified regularization terms, our method significantly enhances the transferability across modalities. Extensive experiments showcase the superior performance of our method, surpassing current state-of-the-art techniques across various multi-modality tracking benchmarks. The source code and models will be publicly available at https://github.com/zhiwen-xdu/SRTrack.</description>

      <title>Scene-Aware Vectorized Memory Multi-Agent Framework with Cross-Modal Differentiated Quantization VLMs for Visually Impaired Assistance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18177v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Visually impaired individuals face significant challenges in environmental perception. Traditional assistive technologies often lack adaptive intelligence, focusing on individual components rather than integrated systems. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer a promising path to richer, integrated understanding, their deployment is severely limited by substantial computational requirements, demanding dozens of gigabytes of memory. To address these gaps in computational efficiency and integrated design, this study proposes a dual technological innovation framework: a cross-modal differentiated quantization framework for VLMs and a scene-aware vectorized memory multi-agent system. The quantization framework implements differentiated strategies, reducing memory from 38GB to 11.3GB. The multi-agent system uses vectorized memory and perception-memory-reasoning workflows to provide environmental information beyond the current view, achieving 2.83-3.52s latency to initial speech output. Experiments show the quantized 19B-parameter model only experiences a 2.05% performance drop on MMBench and maintains 63.7 accuracy on OCR-VQA (original: 64.9), outperforming smaller models with equivalent memory. This research advances computational efficiency and assistive technology, offering comprehensive assistance in scene perception, text recognition, and navigation.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Safety Tax: Mitigating Unsafe Text-to-Image Generation via External Safety Rectification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21099v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) generative models have achieved remarkable visual fidelity, yet remain vulnerable to generating unsafe content. Existing safety defenses typically intervene internally within the generative model, but suffer from severe concept entanglement, leading to degradation of benign generation quality, a trade-off we term the Safety Tax. To overcome this limitation, we advocate a paradigm shift from destructive internal editing to external safety rectification. Following this principle, we propose SafePatch, a structurally isolated safety module that performs external, interpretable rectification without modifying the base model. The core backbone of SafePatch is architecturally instantiated as a trainable clone of the base model's encoder, allowing it to inherit rich semantic priors and maintain representation consistency. To enable interpretable safety rectification, we construct a strictly aligned counterfactual safety dataset (ACS) for differential supervision training. Across nudity and multi-category benchmarks and recent adversarial prompt attacks, SafePatch achieves robust unsafe suppression (7% unsafe on I2P) while preserving image quality and semantic alignment.</description>

      <title>Does DINOv3 Set a New Medical Vision Standard? Benchmarking 2D and 3D Classification, Segmentation, and Registration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06467v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The advent of large-scale vision foundation models, pre-trained on diverse natural images, has marked a paradigm shift in computer vision. However, how the frontier vision foundation models' efficacies transfer to specialised domains such as medical imaging remains an open question. This report investigates whether DINOv3, a state-of-the-art self-supervised vision transformer (ViT) pre-trained on natural images, can directly serve as a powerful, unified encoder for medical vision tasks without domain-specific fine-tuning. To answer this, we benchmark DINOv3 across common medical vision tasks, including 2D and 3D classification, segmentation, and registration on a wide range of medical imaging modalities. We systematically analyse its scalability by varying model sizes and input image resolutions. Our findings reveal that DINOv3 shows impressive performance and establishes a formidable new baseline. Remarkably, it can even outperform medical-specific foundation models like BiomedCLIP and CT-Net on several tasks, despite being trained solely on natural images. However, we identify clear limitations: The model's features degrade in scenarios requiring deep domain specialisation, such as in whole-slide images (WSIs), electron microscopy (EM), and positron emission tomography (PET). Furthermore, we observe that DINOv3 does not consistently follow the scaling law in the medical domain. Its performance does not reliably increase with larger models or finer feature resolutions, showing diverse scaling behaviours across tasks. Overall, our work establishes DINOv3 as a strong baseline, whose powerful visual features can serve as a robust prior for multiple medical tasks. This opens promising future directions, such as leveraging its features to enforce multiview consistency in 3D reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Generative Diffusion Contrastive Network for Multi-View Clustering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.09527v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, Multi-View Clustering (MVC) has been significantly advanced under the influence of deep learning. By integrating heterogeneous data from multiple views, MVC enhances clustering analysis, making multi-view fusion critical to clustering performance. However, there is a problem of low-quality data in multi-view fusion. This problem primarily arises from two reasons: 1) Certain views are contaminated by noisy data. 2) Some views suffer from missing data. This paper proposes a novel Stochastic Generative Diffusion Fusion (SGDF) method to address this problem. SGDF leverages a multiple generative mechanism for the multi-view feature of each sample. It is robust to low-quality data. Building on SGDF, we further present the Generative Diffusion Contrastive Network (GDCN). Extensive experiments show that GDCN achieves the state-of-the-art results in deep MVC tasks. The source code is publicly available at https://github.com/HackerHyper/GDCN.</description>

      <title>RIS-FUSION: Rethinking Text-Driven Infrared and Visible Image Fusion from the Perspective of Referring Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12710v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Text-driven infrared and visible image fusion has gained attention for enabling natural language to guide the fusion process. However, existing methods lack a goal-aligned task to supervise and evaluate how effectively the input text contributes to the fusion outcome. We observe that referring image segmentation (RIS) and text-driven fusion share a common objective: highlighting the object referred to by the text. Motivated by this, we propose RIS-FUSION, a cascaded framework that unifies fusion and RIS through joint optimization. At its core is the LangGatedFusion module, which injects textual features into the fusion backbone to enhance semantic alignment. To support multimodal referring image segmentation task, we introduce MM-RIS, a large-scale benchmark with 12.5k training and 3.5k testing triplets, each consisting of an infrared-visible image pair, a segmentation mask, and a referring expression. Extensive experiments show that RIS-FUSION achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods by over 11% in mIoU. Code and dataset will be released at https://github.com/SijuMa2003/RIS-FUSION.</description>

      <title>Controllable Localized Face Anonymization Via Diffusion Inpainting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14866v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The growing use of portrait images in computer vision highlights the need to protect personal identities. At the same time, anonymized images must remain useful for downstream computer vision tasks. In this work, we propose a unified framework that leverages the inpainting ability of latent diffusion models to generate realistic anonymized images. Unlike prior approaches, we have complete control over the anonymization process by designing an adaptive attribute-guidance module that applies gradient correction during the reverse denoising process, aligning the facial attributes of the generated image with those of the synthesized target image. Our framework also supports localized anonymization, allowing users to specify which facial regions are left unchanged. Extensive experiments conducted on the public CelebA-HQ and FFHQ datasets show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches while requiring no additional model training. The source code is available on our page.</description>

      <title>TennisTV: Do Multimodal Large Language Models Understand Tennis Rallies?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15602v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) excel at general video understanding but struggle with fast, high-frequency sports like tennis, where rally clips are short yet information-dense. To systematically evaluate MLLMs in this challenging domain, we present TennisTV, the first and most comprehensive benchmark for tennis video understanding. TennisTV models each rally as a temporal-ordered sequence of consecutive stroke events, using automated pipelines for filtering and question generation. It covers 8 tasks from the stroke level to the rally level and includes 2527 human-verified questions. Evaluating 17 representative MLLMs, we provide the first systematic assessment of tennis video understanding. Results yield two key insights: (i) frame-sampling density should be tailored and balanced across tasks, and (ii) improving temporal grounding is essential for stronger reasoning.</description>

      <title>GeLoc3r: Enhancing Relative Camera Pose Regression with Geometric Consistency Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23038v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Prior ReLoc3R achieves breakthrough performance with fast 25ms inference and state-of-the-art regression accuracy, yet our analysis reveals subtle geometric inconsistencies in its internal representations that prevent reaching the precision ceiling of correspondence-based methods like MASt3R (which require 300ms per pair). In this work, we present GeLoc3r, a novel approach to relative camera pose estimation that enhances pose regression methods through Geometric Consistency Regularization (GCR). GeLoc3r overcomes the speed-accuracy dilemma by training regression networks to produce geometrically consistent poses without inference-time geometric computation. During training, GeLoc3r leverages ground-truth depth to generate dense 3D-2D correspondences, weights them using a FusionTransformer that learns correspondence importance, and computes geometrically-consistent poses via weighted RANSAC. This creates a consistency loss that transfers geometric knowledge into the regression network. Unlike FAR method which requires both regression and geometric solving at inference, GeLoc3r only uses the enhanced regression head at test time, maintaining ReLoc3R's fast speed and approaching MASt3R's high accuracy. On challenging benchmarks, GeLoc3r consistently outperforms ReLoc3R, achieving significant improvements including 40.45% vs. 34.85% AUC@5{\deg} on the CO3Dv2 dataset (16% relative improvement), 68.66% vs. 66.70% AUC@5{\deg} on RealEstate10K, and 50.45% vs. 49.60% on MegaDepth1500. By teaching geometric consistency during training rather than enforcing it at inference, GeLoc3r represents a paradigm shift in how neural networks learn camera geometry, achieving both the speed of regression and the geometric understanding of correspondence methods.</description>

      <title>Balanced Diffusion-Guided Fusion for Multimodal Remote Sensing Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23310v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep learning-based techniques for the analysis of multimodal remote sensing data have become popular due to their ability to effectively integrate complementary spatial, spectral, and structural information from different sensors. Recently, denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) have attracted attention in the remote sensing community due to their powerful ability to capture robust and complex spatial-spectral distributions. However, pre-training multimodal DDPMs may result in modality imbalance, and effectively leveraging diffusion features to guide complementary diversity feature extraction remains an open question. To address these issues, this paper proposes a balanced diffusion-guided fusion (BDGF) framework that leverages multimodal diffusion features to guide a multi-branch network for land-cover classification. Specifically, we propose an adaptive modality masking strategy to encourage the DDPMs to obtain a modality-balanced rather than spectral image-dominated data distribution. Subsequently, these diffusion features hierarchically guide feature extraction among CNN, Mamba, and transformer networks by integrating feature fusion, group channel attention, and cross-attention mechanisms. Finally, a mutual learning strategy is developed to enhance inter-branch collaboration by aligning the probability entropy and feature similarity of individual subnetworks. Extensive experiments on four multimodal remote sensing datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior classification performance. The code is available at https://github.com/HaoLiu-XDU/BDGF.</description>

      <title>GenView++: Unifying Adaptive Generative Augmentation and Quality-Driven Supervision for Contrastive Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23770v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The success of contrastive learning depends on the construction and utilization of high-quality positive pairs. However, current methods face critical limitations on two fronts: on the construction side, both handcrafted and generative augmentations often suffer from limited diversity and risk semantic corruption; on the learning side, the absence of a quality assessment mechanism leads to suboptimal supervision where all pairs are treated equally. To tackle these challenges, we propose GenView++, a unified framework that addresses both fronts by introducing two synergistic innovations. To improve pair construction, GenView++ introduces a multi-source adaptive view generation mechanism to synthesize diverse yet semantically coherent views by dynamically modulating generative parameters across image-conditioned, text-conditioned, and image-text-conditioned strategies. Second, a quality-driven contrastive learning mechanism assesses each pair's semantic alignment and diversity to dynamically reweight their training contribution, prioritizing high-quality pairs while suppressing redundant or misaligned pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of GenView++ across both vision and vision-language tasks. For vision representation learning, it improves MoCov2 by +2.5% on ImageNet linear classification. For vision-language learning, it raises the average zero-shot classification accuracy by +12.31% over CLIP and +5.31% over SLIP across ten datasets, and further improves Flickr30k text retrieval R@5 by +3.2%.</description>

      <title>MONKEY: Masking ON KEY-Value Activation Adapter for Personalization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07656v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Personalizing diffusion models allows users to generate new images that incorporate a given subject, allowing more control than a text prompt. These models often suffer somewhat when they end up just recreating the subject image and ignoring the text prompt. We observe that one popular method for personalization, IP-Adapter, automatically generates masks that segment the subject from the background during inference. We propose to use this automatically generated mask on a second pass to mask the image tokens, thus restricting them to the subject, not the background, allowing the text prompt to attend to the rest of the image. For text prompts describing locations and places, this produces images that accurately depict the subject while definitively matching the prompt. We compare our method to a few other test time personalization methods, and find our method displays high prompt and source image alignment. We also perform a user study to validate whether end users would appreciate our method. Code available at https://github.com/jamesBaker361/monkey</description>

      <title>Image-to-Video Transfer Learning based on Image-Language Foundation Models: A Comprehensive Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.10671v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Image-Language Foundation Models (ILFMs) have demonstrated remarkable success in vision-language understanding, providing transferable multimodal representations that generalize across diverse downstream image-based tasks. The advancement of video-text research has spurred growing interest in extending image-based models to the video domain. This paradigm, termed as image-to-video transfer learning, effectively mitigates the substantial data and computational demands compared to training video-language models from scratch while achieves comparable or even stronger model performance. This survey provides the first comprehensive review of this emerging field, which begins by summarizing the widely used ILFMs and their capabilities. We then systematically classify existing image-to-video transfer learning techniques into two broad root categories (frozen features and adapted features), along with numerous fine-grained subcategories, based on the paradigm for transferring image understanding capability to video tasks. Building upon the task-specific nature of image-to-video transfer, this survey methodically elaborates these strategies and details their applications across a spectrum of video-text learning tasks, ranging from fine-grained settings (e.g., spatio-temporal video grounding) to coarse-grained ones (e.g., video question answering). We further present a detailed experimental analysis to investigate the efficacy of different image-to-video transfer learning paradigms on a range of downstream video understanding tasks. Finally, we identify prevailing challenges and highlight promising directions for future research. By offering a comprehensive and structured overview, this survey aims to establish a structured roadmap for advancing video-text learning based on existing ILFM, and to inspire future research directions in this rapidly evolving domain.

      <title>DocReward: A Document Reward Model for Structuring and Stylizing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11391v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in agentic workflows have enabled the automation of tasks such as professional document generation. However, they primarily focus on textual quality, neglecting visual structure and style, which are crucial for readability and engagement. This gap stems mainly from a lack of effective reward models capable of guiding agents toward producing documents with high structural and stylistic professionalism. To address this, we propose DocReward, a document reward model that evaluates documents based on their structure and style. The model is trained under a textual-quality-agnostic framework to assess professionalism without being influenced by textual quality. To achieve this, we construct a multi-domain dataset DocPair of 117K paired documents, covering 32 domains and 267 document types, each comprising a high- and low-professionalism document with identical content but different structure and style. This setup enables the model to evaluate professionalism comprehensively and independently of textual quality. DocReward is trained using the Bradley-Terry loss to score documents, penalizing predictions that contradict the annotated ranking. On a manually annotated benchmark, DocReward outperforms GPT-5 by 14.6 percentage points in accuracy. Extrinsic RL experiments further validate its effectiveness in guiding professional document generation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.13245v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Outdoor 3D semantic scene generation produces realistic and semantically rich environments for applications such as urban simulation and autonomous driving. However, advances in this direction are constrained by the absence of publicly available, well-annotated datasets. We introduce SketchSem3D, the first large-scale benchmark for generating 3D outdoor semantic scenes from abstract freehand sketches and pseudo-labeled annotations of satellite images. SketchSem3D includes two subsets, Sketch-based SemanticKITTI and Sketch-based KITTI-360 (containing LiDAR voxels along with their corresponding sketches and annotated satellite images), to enable standardized, rigorous, and diverse evaluations. We also propose Cylinder Mamba Diffusion (CymbaDiff) that significantly enhances spatial coherence in outdoor 3D scene generation. CymbaDiff imposes structured spatial ordering, explicitly captures cylindrical continuity and vertical hierarchy, and preserves both physical neighborhood relationships and global context within the generated scenes. Extensive experiments on SketchSem3D demonstrate that CymbaDiff achieves superior semantic consistency, spatial realism, and cross-dataset generalization. The code and dataset will be available at https://github.com/Lillian-research-hub/CymbaDiff</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17422v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Keypoint detection is the foundation of many computer vision tasks, including image registration, structure-from-motion, 3D reconstruction, visual odometry, and SLAM. Traditional detectors (SIFT, ORB, BRISK, FAST, etc.) and learning-based methods (SuperPoint, R2D2, QuadNet, LIFT, etc.) have shown strong performance gains yet suffer from key limitations: sensitivity to photometric changes, low keypoint density and repeatability, limited adaptability to challenging scenes, and lack of semantic understanding, often failing to prioritize visually important regions. We present DeepDetect, an intelligent, all-in-one, dense detector that unifies the strengths of classical detectors using deep learning. Firstly, we create ground-truth masks by fusing outputs of 7 keypoint and 2 edge detectors, extracting diverse visual cues from corners and blobs to prominent edges and textures in the images. Afterwards, a lightweight and efficient model: ESPNet, is trained using fused masks as labels, enabling DeepDetect to focus semantically on images while producing highly dense keypoints, that are adaptable to diverse and visually degraded conditions. Evaluations on Oxford, HPatches, and Middlebury datasets demonstrate that DeepDetect surpasses other detectors achieving maximum values of 0.5143 (average keypoint density), 0.9582 (average repeatability), 338,118 (correct matches), and 842,045 (voxels in stereo 3D reconstruction).</description>

      <title>Mapping Hidden Heritage: Self-supervised Pre-training on High-Resolution LiDAR DEM Derivatives for Archaeological Stone Wall Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17644v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Historic dry-stone walls hold significant cultural and environmental importance, serving as historical markers and contributing to ecosystem preservation and wildfire management during dry seasons in Australia. However, many of these stone structures in remote or vegetated landscapes remain undocumented due to limited accessibility and the high cost of manual mapping. Deep learning-based segmentation offers a scalable approach for automated mapping of such features, but challenges remain: 1.the visual occlusion of low-lying dry-stone walls by dense vegetation and 2.the scarcity of labeled training data. This study presents DINO-CV, a self-supervised cross-view pre-training framework based on knowledge distillation, designed for accurate and data-efficient mapping of dry-stone walls using Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) derived from high-resolution airborne LiDAR. By learning invariant geometric and geomorphic features across DEM-derived views, (i.e., Multi-directional Hillshade and Visualization for Archaeological Topography), DINO-CV addresses the occlusion by vegetation and data scarcity challenges. Applied to the Budj Bim Cultural Landscape at Victoria, Australia, a UNESCO World Heritage site, the approach achieves a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 68.6% on test areas and maintains 63.8% mIoU when fine-tuned with only 10% labeled data. These results demonstrate the potential of self-supervised learning on high-resolution DEM derivatives for large-scale, automated mapping of cultural heritage features in complex and vegetated environments. Beyond archaeology, this approach offers a scalable solution for environmental monitoring and heritage preservation across inaccessible or environmentally sensitive regions.</description>

      <title>Dimensionality Reduction for Remote Sensing Data Analysis: A Systematic Review of Methods and Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18935v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Earth observation involves collecting, analyzing, and processing an ever-growing mass of data. This planetary data is crucial for addressing relevant societal, economic, and environmental challenges, ranging from environmental monitoring to urban planning and disaster management. However, its high dimensionality entails significant feature redundancy and computational overhead limiting the effectiveness of machine learning models. Dimensionality reduction (DR) techniques, specifically feature extraction, address these challenges by preserving essential data properties while reducing redundancy and enhancing tasks in Remote Sensing (RS). The landscape of DR for RS is a diverse, disorganized, and rapidly evolving field. We offer a practical guide for this landscape by introducing a framework of DR. Using this framework, we trace the evolution of DR across the data value chain in RS. Finally, we synthesize these trends and offer perspectives for the future of DR in RS by first characterizing this shift from single-task models to unified representations, then identifying two perspectives in the foundation model era: the need for robust and interpretable DR and the potential of bridging classical DR with modern representation learning.</description>

Abstract: The advent of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) has greatly advanced research on video fake news detection (VFND) tasks. Existing benchmarks typically focus on the detection accuracy, while failing to provide fine-grained assessments for the entire detection process. To address these limitations, we introduce {POVFNDB (Process-oriented Video Fake News Detection Benchmark)}, a process-oriented benchmark comprising 10 tasks designed to systematically evaluate MLLMs' perception, understanding, and reasoning capabilities in VFND. This benchmark contains \textit{36,240} human-annotated question-answer (QA) in structured or open-ended formats, spanning 15 distinct evaluation dimensions that characterize different aspects of the video fake news detection process. Using POVFNDB, we conduct comprehensive evaluations on both proprietary and open-source MLLMs. Moreover, we establish a strong benchmark baseline by fine-tuning Qwen2.5VL-7B-Instruct on process-oriented chain-of-thought data constructed with our proposed POVFND-CoT framework, achieving state-of-the-art performance on VFND.</description>

      <title>Comparative Study of UNet-based Architectures for Liver Tumor Segmentation in Multi-Phase Contrast-Enhanced Computed Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25522v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Segmentation of liver structures in multi-phase contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) plays a crucial role in computer-aided diagnosis and treatment planning. In this study, we investigate the performance of UNet-based architectures for liver tumor segmentation, evaluating ResNet, Transformer-based, and State-space (Mamba) backbones initialized with pretrained weights. Our comparative analysis reveals that despite the theoretical advantages of modern architectures in modeling long-range dependencies, ResNet-based models demonstrated superior sample efficiency on this dataset. This suggests that the inherent inductive biases of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) remain advantageous for generalizing on limited medical data compared to data-hungry alternatives. To further improve segmentation quality, we introduce attention mechanisms into the backbone, finding that the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) yields the optimal configuration. The ResNetUNet3+ with CBAM achieved the highest nominal performance with a Dice score of 0.755 and IoU of 0.662, while also delivering the most precise boundary delineation (lowest HD95 of 77.911). Critically, while statistical testing indicated that the improvement in mean Dice score was not significant (p &gt; 0.05) compared to the baseline, the proposed model exhibited greater stability (lower standard deviation) and higher specificity (0.926). These findings demonstrate that classical ResNet architectures, when enhanced with modern attention modules, provide a robust and statistically comparable alternative to emerging methods, offering a stable direction for liver tumor segmentation in clinical practice.</description>

      <title>Assessing the value of Geo-Foundational Models for Flood Inundation Mapping: Benchmarking models for Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and Planetscope for end-users</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01990v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Geo-Foundational Models (GFMs) enable fast and reliable extraction of spatiotemporal information from satellite imagery, improving flood inundation mapping by leveraging location and time embeddings. Despite their potential, it remains unclear whether GFMs outperform traditional models like U-Net. A systematic comparison across sensors and data availability scenarios is still lacking, which is an essential step to guide end-users in model selection. To address this, we evaluate three GFMs, Prithvi 2.0, Clay V1.5, DOFA, and UViT (a Prithvi variant), against TransNorm, U-Net, and Attention U-Net using PlanetScope, Sentinel-1, and Sentinel-2. We observe competitive performance among all GFMs, with only 2-5% variation between the best and worst models across sensors. Clay outperforms others on PlanetScope (0.79 mIoU) and Sentinel-2 (0.70), while Prithvi leads on Sentinel-1 (0.57). In leave-one-region-out cross-validation across five regions, Clay shows slightly better performance across all sensors (mIoU: 0.72(0.04), 0.66(0.07), 0.51(0.08)) compared to Prithvi (0.70(0.05), 0.64(0.09), 0.49(0.13)) and DOFA (0.67(0.07), 0.64(0.04), 0.49(0.09)) for PlanetScope, Sentinel-2, and Sentinel-1, respectively. Across all 19 sites, leave-one-region-out cross-validation reveals a 4% improvement by Clay compared to U-Net. Visual inspection highlights Clay's superior ability to retain fine details. Few-shot experiments show Clay achieves 0.64 mIoU on PlanetScope with just five training images, outperforming Prithvi (0.24) and DOFA (0.35). In terms of computational time, Clay is a better choice due to its smaller model size (26M parameters), making it ~3x faster than Prithvi (650M) and 2x faster than DOFA (410M). Contrary to previous findings, our results suggest GFMs offer small to moderate improvements in flood mapping accuracy at lower computational cost and labeling effort compared to traditional U-Net.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Reasoning via Latent Refocusing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02360v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning enhances logical performance by decomposing complex tasks, yet its multimodal extension faces a trade-off. The existing Thinking with Images paradigm is limited by the modality gap between vision and language, which hinders reliable extraction of reasoning relevant information from high dimensional visual data. Recent latent space reasoning method provides stronger multimodal representations, but it often lacks the ability to refocus on visual inputs and suffers from limited interpretability. To address these issues, we propose \underline{La}tent \underline{Re}focusing (LaRe), a novel multimodal reasoning paradigm that combines visual refocusing with rich latent representations, enabling iterative reasoning within the latent space. We further design a semantic augmentation training strategy that enhances the semantic structure of the latent space through joint alignment and reconstruction objectives. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that LaRe improves average accuracy by 9.4\% compared to existing baselines while reducing the number of tokens required for inference by 16.5\%. When scaled to a 7B-parameter Large Language Model backbone, LaRe achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art models and outperforms larger-scale models on almost all benchmarks. Code and checkpoints will be released later.</description>

      <title>Part-Aware Bottom-Up Group Reasoning for Fine-Grained Social Interaction Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03666v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Social interactions often emerge from subtle, fine-grained cues such as facial expressions, gaze, and gestures. However, existing methods for social interaction detection overlook such nuanced cues and primarily rely on holistic representations of individuals. Moreover, they directly detect social groups without explicitly modeling the underlying interactions between individuals. These drawbacks limit their ability to capture localized social signals and introduce ambiguity when group configurations should be inferred from social interactions grounded in nuanced cues. In this work, we propose a part-aware bottom-up group reasoning framework for fine-grained social interaction detection. The proposed method infers social groups and their interactions using body part features and their interpersonal relations. Our model first detects individuals and enhances their features using part-aware cues, and then infers group configuration by associating individuals via similarity-based reasoning, which considers not only spatial relations but also subtle social cues that signal interactions, leading to more accurate group inference. Experiments on the NVI dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms prior methods, achieving the new state of the art, while additional results on the Caf\'e dataset further validate its generalizability to group activity understanding.</description>

      <title>Semantic-Consistent Bidirectional Contrastive Hashing for Noisy Multi-Label Cross-Modal Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07780v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cross-modal hashing (CMH) facilitates efficient retrieval across different modalities (e.g., image and text) by encoding data into compact binary representations. While recent methods have achieved remarkable performance, they often rely heavily on fully annotated datasets, which are costly and labor-intensive to obtain. In real-world scenarios, particularly in multi-label datasets, label noise is prevalent and severely degrades retrieval performance. Moreover, existing CMH approaches typically overlook the partial semantic overlaps inherent in multi-label data, limiting their robustness and generalization. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel framework named Semantic-Consistent Bidirectional Contrastive Hashing (SCBCH). The framework comprises two complementary modules: (1) Cross-modal Semantic-Consistent Classification (CSCC), which leverages cross-modal semantic consistency to estimate sample reliability and reduce the impact of noisy labels; (2) Bidirectional Soft Contrastive Hashing (BSCH), which dynamically generates soft contrastive sample pairs based on multi-label semantic overlap, enabling adaptive contrastive learning between semantically similar and dissimilar samples across modalities. Extensive experiments on four widely-used cross-modal retrieval benchmarks validate the effectiveness and robustness of our method, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art approaches under noisy multi-label conditions.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Latent Generative Paradigms for High-Fidelity 3D Shape Completion from a Single Depth Image</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11074v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While generative models have seen significant adoption across a wide range of data modalities, including 3D data, a consensus on which model is best suited for which task has yet to be reached. Further, conditional information such as text and images to steer the generation process are frequently employed, whereas others, like partial 3D data, have not been thoroughly evaluated. In this work, we compare two of the most promising generative models--Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models and Autoregressive Causal Transformers--which we adapt for the tasks of generative shape modeling and completion. We conduct a thorough quantitative evaluation and comparison of both tasks, including a baseline discriminative model and an extensive ablation study. Our results show that (1) the diffusion model with continuous latents outperforms both the discriminative model and the autoregressive approach and delivers state-of-the-art performance on multi-modal shape completion from a single, noisy depth image under realistic conditions and (2) when compared on the same discrete latent space, the autoregressive model can match or exceed diffusion performance on these tasks.</description>

      <title>Towards Temporal Fusion Beyond the Field of View for Camera-based Semantic Scene Completion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12498v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent camera-based 3D semantic scene completion (SSC) methods have increasingly explored leveraging temporal cues to enrich the features of the current frame. However, while these approaches primarily focus on enhancing in-frame regions, they often struggle to reconstruct critical out-of-frame areas near the sides of the ego-vehicle, although previous frames commonly contain valuable contextual information about these unseen regions. To address this limitation, we propose the Current-Centric Contextual 3D Fusion (C3DFusion) module, which generates hidden region-aware 3D feature geometry by explicitly aligning 3D-lifted point features from both current and historical frames. C3DFusion performs enhanced temporal fusion through two complementary techniques-historical context blurring and current-centric feature densification-which suppress noise from inaccurately warped historical point features by attenuating their scale, and enhance current point features by increasing their volumetric contribution. Simply integrated into standard SSC architectures, C3DFusion demonstrates strong effectiveness, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods on the SemanticKITTI and SSCBench-KITTI-360 datasets. Furthermore, it exhibits robust generalization, achieving notable performance gains when applied to other baseline models.</description>

      <title>ManipShield: A Unified Framework for Image Manipulation Detection, Localization and Explanation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14259v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of generative models, powerful image editing methods now enable diverse and highly realistic image manipulations that far surpass traditional deepfake techniques, posing new challenges for manipulation detection. Existing image manipulation detection and localization (IMDL) benchmarks suffer from limited content diversity, narrow generative-model coverage, and insufficient interpretability, which hinders the generalization and explanation capabilities of current manipulation detection methods. To address these limitations, we introduce \textbf{ManipBench}, a large-scale benchmark for image manipulation detection and localization focusing on AI-edited images. ManipBench contains over 450K manipulated images produced by 25 state-of-the-art image editing models across 12 manipulation categories, among which 100K images are further annotated with bounding boxes, judgment cues, and textual explanations to support interpretable detection. Building upon ManipBench, we propose \textbf{ManipShield}, an all-in-one model based on a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) that leverages contrastive LoRA fine-tuning and task-specific decoders to achieve unified image manipulation detection, localization, and explanation. Extensive experiments on ManipBench and several public datasets demonstrate that ManipShield achieves state-of-the-art performance and exhibits strong generality to unseen manipulation models. Both ManipBench and ManipShield will be released upon publication.</description>

      <title>Disc3D: Automatic Curation of High-Quality 3D Dialog Data via Discriminative Object Referring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18817v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 3D Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) still lag behind their 2D peers, largely because large-scale, high-quality 3D scene-dialogue datasets remain scarce. Prior efforts hinge on expensive human annotation and leave two key ambiguities unresolved: viewpoint ambiguity, where spatial language presumes unknown camera poses, and object referring ambiguity, where non-exclusive descriptions blur the line between targets and distractors. We therefore present a fully automated pipeline that converts raw 3D scans into unambiguous, high-quality dialogue data at a fraction of the previous cost. By synergizing rule-based constraints with 2D MLLMs and LLMs, the pipeline enables controllable, scalable generation without human intervention. The pipeline comprises four stages: (1) meta-annotation collection harvesting object-, frame-, and scene-level captions, (2) scene graph construction with relation correction to capture proximal object relations, (3) discriminative object referring that generates exclusive and compact descriptions, and (4) multi-task data generation synthesizing diverse dialogues. Our pipeline systematically mitigates inherent flaws in source datasets and produces the final Disc3D dataset, over 2 million samples in 25K hybrid 3D scenes, spanning scene, view, and object captioning, visual grounding, and five object-centric QA tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that training with Disc3D yields consistent, significant improvements on both public benchmarks and our multifaceted Disc3D-QA tasks. Code, data, and models will be publicly available.</description>

      <title>Vidi2.5: Large Multimodal Models for Video Understanding and Creation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19529v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Video has emerged as the primary medium for communication and creativity on the Internet, driving strong demand for scalable, high-quality video production. Vidi models continue to evolve toward next-generation video creation and have achieved state-of-the-art performance in multimodal temporal retrieval (TR). In its second release, Vidi2 advances video understanding with fine-grained spatio-temporal grounding (STG) and extends its capability to video question answering (Video QA), enabling comprehensive multimodal reasoning. Given a text query, Vidi2 can identify not only the corresponding timestamps but also the bounding boxes of target objects within the output time ranges. To enable comprehensive evaluation of STG, we introduce a new benchmark, VUE-STG, which offers critical improvements over existing STG datasets. In addition, we upgrade the previous VUE-TR benchmark to VUE-TR-V2, achieving a more balanced duration and query distribution. Remarkably, the Vidi2 model substantially outperforms leading proprietary systems, such as Gemini 3 Pro Preview and GPT-5, on both VUE-TR-V2 and VUE-STG, while achieving competitive results with popular open-source models with similar scale on video QA benchmarks. The latest Vidi2.5 offers significantly stronger STG capability and slightly better TR and Video QA performance over Vidi2. This update also introduces a Vidi2.5-Think model to handle plot understanding with complex plot reasoning. To comprehensively evaluate the performance of plot understanding, we propose VUE-PLOT benchmark with two tracks, Character and Reasoning. Notably, Vidi2.5-Think outperforms Gemini 3 Pro Preview on fine-grained character understanding with comparable performance on complex plot reasoning. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of Vidi2.5 on a challenging real-world application, video editing planning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.02258v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Biologically plausible and energy-efficient frameworks such as Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have not been sufficiently explored in low-level vision tasks. Taking image deraining as an example, this study addresses the representation of the inherent high-pass characteristics of spiking neurons, specifically in image deraining and innovatively proposes the Visual LIF (VLIF) neuron, overcoming the obstacle of lacking spatial contextual understanding present in traditional spiking neurons. To tackle the limitation of frequency-domain saturation inherent in conventional spiking neurons, we leverage the proposed VLIF to introduce the Spiking Decomposition and Enhancement Module and the lightweight Spiking Multi-scale Unit for hierarchical multi-scale representation learning. Extensive experiments across five benchmark deraining datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art SNN-based deraining methods, achieving this superior performance with only 13\% of their energy consumption. These findings establish a solid foundation for deploying SNNs in high-performance, energy-efficient low-level vision tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07076v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Camouflage is primarily context-dependent yet current metrics for camouflaged scenarios overlook this critical factor. Instead, these metrics are originally designed for evaluating general or salient objects, with an inherent assumption of uncorrelated spatial context. In this paper, we propose a new contextualized evaluation paradigm, Context-measure, built upon a probabilistic pixel-aware correlation framework. By incorporating spatial dependencies and pixel-wise camouflage quantification, our measure better aligns with human perception. Extensive experiments across three challenging camouflaged object segmentation datasets show that Context-measure delivers more reliability than existing context-independent metrics. Our measure can provide a foundational evaluation benchmark for various computer vision applications involving camouflaged patterns, such as agricultural, industrial, and medical scenarios. Code is available at https://github.com/pursuitxi/Context-measure.</description>

      <title>Hierarchy-Aware Multimodal Unlearning for Medical AI</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.09867v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pretrained Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are increasingly used in sensitive domains such as medical AI, where privacy regulations like HIPAA and GDPR require specific removal of individuals' or institutions' data. This motivates machine unlearning, which aims to remove the influence of target data from a trained model. However, existing unlearning benchmarks fail to reflect the hierarchical and multimodal structure of real-world medical data, limiting their ability to properly evaluate unlearning in practice. Therefore, we introduce MedForget, a hierarchy-aware multimodal unlearning benchmark that models hospital data as a nested structure, enabling fine-grained evaluation of multimodal unlearning across retain and forget splits. Experiments with current unlearning methods show that existing approaches struggle to achieve effective hierarchy-aware forgetting without degrading downstream medical utility. To address this limitation, we propose Cross-modal Hierarchy-Informed Projection for unlearning (CHIP), a training-free, hierarchy-aware multimodal unlearning method that deletes information by selectively removing target-specific weight subspaces while preserving sibling-shared information. Experiments show that CHIP achieves the highest forget-retain performance gap across all hierarchy levels while maintaining competitive downstream utility compared to existing methods. Overall, MedForget provides a practical, HIPAA-aligned benchmark for evaluating structured multimodal unlearning for medical data, and CHIP offers an effective and general solution for hierarchy-aware forgetting that balances deletion with utility.</description>

      <title>Simple Yet Effective Selective Imputation for Incomplete Multi-view Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10327v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Incomplete Multi-view Clustering (IMC) has emerged as a significant challenge in multi-view learning. A predominant line for IMC is data imputation; however, indiscriminate imputation can result in unreliable content. Recently, researchers have proposed selective imputation methods that use a post-imputation assessment strategy: (1) impute all or some missing values, and (2) evaluate their quality through clustering tasks. We observe that this strategy incurs substantial computational complexity and is heavily dependent on the performance of the clustering model. To address these challenges, we first introduce the concept of pre-imputation assessment. We propose an Implicit Informativeness-based Selective Imputation (SI$^3$) method for incomplete multi-view clustering, which explicitly addresses the trade-off between imputation utility and imputation risk. SI$^3$ evaluates the imputation-relevant informativeness of each missing position in a training-free manner, and selectively imputes data only when sufficient informative support is available. Under a multi-view generative assumption, SI$^3$ further integrates selective imputation into a variational inference framework, enabling uncertainty-aware imputation at the latent distribution level and robust multi-view fusion. Compared with existing selective imputation strategies, SI$^3$ is lightweight, data-driven, and model-agnostic, and can be seamlessly incorporated into existing incomplete multi-view clustering frameworks as a plug-in strategy. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that SI$^3$ consistently outperforms both imputation-based and imputation-free methods, particularly under challenging unbalanced missing scenarios.</description>

      <title>CARI4D: Category Agnostic 4D Reconstruction of Human-Object Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11988v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate capture of human-object interaction from ubiquitous sensors like RGB cameras is important for applications in human understanding, gaming, and robot learning. However, inferring 4D interactions from a single RGB view is highly challenging due to the unknown object and human information, depth ambiguity, occlusion, and complex motion, which hinder consistent 3D and temporal reconstruction. Previous methods simplify the setup by assuming ground truth object template or constraining to a limited set of object categories. We present CARI4D, the first category-agnostic method that reconstructs spatially and temporarily consistent 4D human-object interaction at metric scale from monocular RGB videos. To this end, we propose a pose hypothesis selection algorithm that robustly integrates the individual predictions from foundation models, jointly refine them through a learned render-and-compare paradigm to ensure spatial, temporal and pixel alignment, and finally reasoning about intricate contacts for further refinement satisfying physical constraints. Experiments show that our method outperforms prior art by 38% on in-distribution dataset and 36% on unseen dataset in terms of reconstruction error. Our model generalizes beyond the training categories and thus can be applied zero-shot to in-the-wild internet videos. Our code and pretrained models will be publicly released.</description>

      <title>ActAvatar: Temporally-Aware Precise Action Control for Talking Avatars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19546v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite significant advances in talking avatar generation, existing methods face critical challenges: insufficient text-following capability for diverse actions, lack of temporal alignment between actions and audio content, and dependency on additional control signals such as pose skeletons. We present ActAvatar, a framework that achieves phase-level precision in action control through textual guidance by capturing both action semantics and temporal context. Our approach introduces three core innovations: (1) Phase-Aware Cross-Attention (PACA), which decomposes prompts into a global base block and temporally-anchored phase blocks, enabling the model to concentrate on phase-relevant tokens for precise temporal-semantic alignment; (2) Progressive Audio-Visual Alignment, which aligns modality influence with the hierarchical feature learning process-early layers prioritize text for establishing action structure while deeper layers emphasize audio for refining lip movements, preventing modality interference; (3) A two-stage training strategy that first establishes robust audio-visual correspondence on diverse data, then injects action control through fine-tuning on structured annotations, maintaining both audio-visual alignment and the model's text-following capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ActAvatar significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both action control and visual quality.</description>

      <title>D^3ETOR: Debate-Enhanced Pseudo Labeling and Frequency-Aware Progressive Debiasing for Weakly-Supervised Camouflaged Object Detection with Scribble Annotations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20260v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Weakly-Supervised Camouflaged Object Detection (WSCOD) aims to locate and segment objects that are visually concealed within their surrounding scenes, relying solely on sparse supervision such as scribble annotations. Despite recent progress, existing WSCOD methods still lag far behind fully supervised ones due to two major limitations: (1) the pseudo masks generated by general-purpose segmentation models (e.g., SAM) and filtered via rules are often unreliable, as these models lack the task-specific semantic understanding required for effective pseudo labeling in COD; and (2) the neglect of inherent annotation bias in scribbles, which hinders the model from capturing the global structure of camouflaged objects. To overcome these challenges, we propose ${D}^{3}$ETOR, a two-stage WSCOD framework consisting of Debate-Enhanced Pseudo Labeling and Frequency-Aware Progressive Debiasing. In the first stage, we introduce an adaptive entropy-driven point sampling method and a multi-agent debate mechanism to enhance the capability of SAM for COD, improving the interpretability and precision of pseudo masks. In the second stage, we design FADeNet, which progressively fuses multi-level frequency-aware features to balance global semantic understanding with local detail modeling, while dynamically reweighting supervision strength across regions to alleviate scribble bias. By jointly exploiting the supervision signals from both the pseudo masks and scribble semantics, ${D}^{3}$ETOR significantly narrows the gap between weakly and fully supervised COD, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks.</description>

      <title>InstructMoLE: Instruction-Guided Mixture of Low-rank Experts for Multi-Conditional Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21788v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning of Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) for diverse, multi-conditional tasks often suffers from task interference when using monolithic adapters like LoRA. The Mixture of Low-rank Experts (MoLE) architecture offers a modular solution, but its potential is usually limited by routing policies that operate at a token level. Such local routing can conflict with the global nature of user instructions, leading to artifacts like spatial fragmentation and semantic drift in complex image generation tasks. To address these limitations, we introduce InstructMoLE, a novel framework that employs an Instruction-Guided Mixture of Low-Rank Experts. Instead of per-token routing, InstructMoLE utilizes a global routing signal, Instruction-Guided Routing (IGR), derived from the user's comprehensive instruction. This ensures that a single, coherently chosen expert council is applied uniformly across all input tokens, preserving the global semantics and structural integrity of the generation process. To complement this, we introduce an output-space orthogonality loss, which promotes expert functional diversity and mitigates representational collapse. Extensive experiments demonstrate that InstructMoLE significantly outperforms existing LoRA adapters and MoLE variants across challenging multi-conditional generation benchmarks. Our work presents a robust and generalizable framework for instruction-driven fine-tuning of generative models, enabling superior compositional control and fidelity to user intent.</description>

      <title>SLIM-Brain: A Data- and Training-Efficient Foundation Model for fMRI Data Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.21881v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Foundation models are emerging as a powerful paradigm for fMRI analysis, but current approaches face a dual bottleneck of data- and training-efficiency. Atlas-based methods aggregate voxel signals into fixed regions of interest, reducing data dimensionality but discarding fine-grained spatial details, and requiring extremely large cohorts to train effectively as general-purpose foundation models. Atlas-free methods, on the other hand, operate directly on voxel-level information - preserving spatial fidelity but are prohibitively memory- and compute-intensive, making large-scale pre-training infeasible. We introduce SLIM-Brain (Sample-efficient, Low-memory fMRI Foundation Model for Human Brain), a new atlas-free foundation model that simultaneously improves both data- and training-efficiency. SLIM-Brain adopts a two-stage adaptive design: (i) a lightweight temporal extractor captures global context across full sequences and ranks data windows by saliency, and (ii) a 4D hierarchical encoder (Hiera-JEPA) learns fine-grained voxel-level representations only from the top-$k$ selected windows, while deleting about 70% masked patches. Extensive experiments across seven public benchmarks show that SLIM-Brain establishes new state-of-the-art performance on diverse tasks, while requiring only 4 thousand pre-training sessions and approximately 30% of GPU memory comparing to traditional voxel-level methods.</description>

      <title>Improved cystic hygroma detection from prenatal imaging using ultrasound-specific self-supervised representation learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.22730v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cystic hygroma is a high-risk prenatal ultrasound finding that portends high rates of chromosomal abnormalities, structural malformations, and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Automated detection can increase reproducibility and support scalable early screening programs, but supervised deep learning methods are limited by small labelled datasets. This study assesses whether ultrasound-specific self-supervised pretraining can facilitate accurate, robust deep learning detection of cystic hygroma in first-trimester ultrasound images. We fine-tuned the Ultrasound Self-Supervised Foundation Model with Masked Autoencoding (USF-MAE), pretrained on over 370,000 unlabelled ultrasound images, for binary classification of normal controls and cystic hygroma cases used in this study. Performance was evaluated on the same curated ultrasound dataset, preprocessing pipeline, and 4-fold cross-validation protocol as for the DenseNet-169 baseline, using accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC). Model interpretability was analyzed qualitatively using Score-CAM visualizations. USF-MAE outperformed the DenseNet-169 baseline on all evaluation metrics. The proposed model yielded a mean accuracy of 0.96, sensitivity of 0.94, specificity of 0.98, and ROC-AUC of 0.98 compared to 0.93, 0.92, 0.94, and 0.94 for the DenseNet-169 baseline, respectively. Qualitative Score-CAM visualizations of model predictions demonstrated clinical relevance by highlighting expected regions in the fetal neck for both positive and negative cases. Paired statistical analysis using a Wilcoxon signed-rank test confirmed that performance improvements achieved by USF-MAE were statistically significant (p = 0.0057).</description>

      <title>RxnBench: A Multimodal Benchmark for Evaluating Large Language Models on Chemical Reaction Understanding from Scientific Literature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23565v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The integration of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) into chemistry promises to revolutionize scientific discovery, yet their ability to comprehend the dense, graphical language of reactions within authentic literature remains underexplored. Here, we introduce RxnBench, a multi-tiered benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate MLLMs on chemical reaction understanding from scientific PDFs. RxnBench comprises two tasks: Single-Figure QA (SF-QA), which tests fine-grained visual perception and mechanistic reasoning using 1,525 questions derived from 305 curated reaction schemes, and Full-Document QA (FD-QA), which challenges models to synthesize information from 108 articles, requiring cross-modal integration of text, schemes, and tables. Our evaluation of MLLMs reveals a critical capability gap: while models excel at extracting explicit text, they struggle with deep chemical logic and precise structural recognition. Notably, models with inference-time reasoning significantly outperform standard architectures, yet none achieve 50\% accuracy on FD-QA. These findings underscore the urgent need for domain-specific visual encoders and stronger reasoning engines to advance autonomous AI chemists.</description>

      <title>SA-ResGS: Self-Augmented Residual 3D Gaussian Splatting for Next Best View Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03024v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose Self-Augmented Residual 3D Gaussian Splatting (SA-ResGS), a novel framework to stabilize uncertainty quantification and enhancing uncertainty-aware supervision in next-best-view (NBV) selection for active scene reconstruction. SA-ResGS improves both the reliability of uncertainty estimates and their effectiveness for supervision by generating Self-Augmented point clouds (SA-Points) via triangulation between a training view and a rasterized extrapolated view, enabling efficient scene coverage estimation. While improving scene coverage through physically guided view selection, SA-ResGS also addresses the challenge of under-supervised Gaussians, exacerbated by sparse and wide-baseline views, by introducing the first residual learning strategy tailored for 3D Gaussian Splatting. This targeted supervision enhances gradient flow in high-uncertainty Gaussians by combining uncertainty-driven filtering with dropout- and hard-negative-mining-inspired sampling. Our contributions are threefold: (1) a physically grounded view selection strategy that promotes efficient and uniform scene coverage; (2) an uncertainty-aware residual supervision scheme that amplifies learning signals for weakly contributing Gaussians, improving training stability and uncertainty estimation across scenes with diverse camera distributions; (3) an implicit unbiasing of uncertainty quantification as a consequence of constrained view selection and residual supervision, which together mitigate conflicting effects of wide-baseline exploration and sparse-view ambiguity in NBV planning. Experiments on active view selection demonstrate that SA-ResGS outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both reconstruction quality and view selection robustness.</description>

      <title>IDESplat: Iterative Depth Probability Estimation for Generalizable 3D Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03824v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generalizable 3D Gaussian Splatting aims to directly predict Gaussian parameters using a feed-forward network for scene reconstruction. Among these parameters, Gaussian means are particularly difficult to predict, so depth is usually estimated first and then unprojected to obtain the Gaussian sphere centers. Existing methods typically rely solely on a single warp to estimate depth probability, which hinders their ability to fully leverage cross-view geometric cues, resulting in unstable and coarse depth maps. To address this limitation, we propose IDESplat, which iteratively applies warp operations to boost depth probability estimation for accurate Gaussian mean prediction. First, to eliminate the inherent instability of a single warp, we introduce a Depth Probability Boosting Unit (DPBU) that integrates epipolar attention maps produced by cascading warp operations in a multiplicative manner. Next, we construct an iterative depth estimation process by stacking multiple DPBUs, progressively identifying potential depth candidates with high likelihood. As IDESplat iteratively boosts depth probability estimates and updates the depth candidates, the depth map is gradually refined, resulting in accurate Gaussian means. We conduct experiments on RealEstate10K, ACID, and DL3DV. IDESplat achieves outstanding reconstruction quality and state-of-the-art performance with real-time efficiency. On RE10K, it outperforms DepthSplat by 0.33 dB in PSNR, using only 10.7% of the parameters and 70% of the memory. Additionally, our IDESplat improves PSNR by 2.95 dB over DepthSplat on the DTU dataset in cross-dataset experiments, demonstrating its strong generalization ability.</description>

      <title>ProFuse: Efficient Cross-View Context Fusion for Open-Vocabulary 3D Gaussian Splatting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.04754v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present ProFuse, an efficient context-aware framework for open-vocabulary 3D scene understanding with 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). The pipeline enhances cross-view consistency and intra-mask cohesion within a direct registration setup, adding minimal overhead and requiring no render-supervised fine-tuning. Instead of relying on a pretrained 3DGS scene, we introduce a dense correspondence-guided pre-registration phase that initializes Gaussians with accurate geometry while jointly constructing 3D Context Proposals via cross-view clustering. Each proposal carries a global feature obtained through weighted aggregation of member embeddings, and this feature is fused onto Gaussians during direct registration to maintain per-primitive language coherence across views. With associations established in advance, semantic fusion requires no additional optimization beyond standard reconstruction, and the model retains geometric refinement without densification. ProFuse achieves strong open-vocabulary 3DGS understanding while completing semantic attachment in about five minutes per scene, which is two times faster than SOTA. Additional details are available at our project page https://chiou1203.github.io/ProFuse/.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.04984v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce OceanSplat, a novel 3D Gaussian Splatting-based approach for high-fidelity underwater scene reconstruction. To overcome multi-view inconsistencies caused by scattering media, we design a trinocular setup for each camera pose by rendering from horizontally and vertically translated virtual viewpoints, enforcing view consistency to facilitate spatial optimization of 3D Gaussians. Furthermore, we derive synthetic epipolar depth priors from the virtual viewpoints, which serve as self-supervised depth regularizers to compensate for the limited geometric cues in degraded underwater scenes. We also propose a depth-aware alpha adjustment that modulates the opacity of 3D Gaussians during early training based on their depth along the viewing direction, deterring the formation of medium-induced primitives. Our approach promotes the disentanglement of 3D Gaussians from the scattering medium through effective geometric constraints, enabling accurate representation of scene structure and significantly reducing floating artifacts. Experiments on real-world underwater and simulated scenes demonstrate that OceanSplat substantially outperforms existing methods for both scene reconstruction and restoration in scattering media.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.05747v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly deployed in close proximity to humans for applications such as parcel delivery, traffic monitoring, disaster response and infrastructure inspections. Ensuring safe and reliable operation in these human-populated environments demands accurate perception of human poses and actions from an aerial viewpoint. This perspective challenges existing methods with low resolution, steep viewing angles and (self-)occlusion, especially if the application demands realtime feasibile models. We train and deploy FlyPose, a lightweight top-down human pose estimation pipeline for aerial imagery. Through multi-dataset training, we achieve an average improvement of 6.8 mAP in person detection across the test-sets of Manipal-UAV, VisDrone, HIT-UAV as well as our custom dataset. For 2D human pose estimation we report an improvement of 16.3 mAP on the challenging UAV-Human dataset. FlyPose runs with an inference latency of ~20 milliseconds including preprocessing on a Jetson Orin AGX Developer Kit and is deployed onboard a quadrotor UAV during flight experiments. We also publish FlyPose-104, a small but challenging aerial human pose estimation dataset, that includes manual annotations from difficult aerial perspectives: https://github.com/farooqhassaan/FlyPose.</description>

Abstract: Accurate surround-view depth estimation provides a competitive alternative to laser-based sensors and is essential for 3D scene understanding in autonomous driving. While empirical studies have proposed various approaches that primarily focus on enforcing cross-view constraints at photometric level, few explicitly exploit the rich geometric structure inherent in both monocular and surround-view setting. In this work, we propose GeoSurDepth, a framework that leverages geometry consistency as the primary cue for surround-view depth estimation. Concretely, we utilize vision foundation models as pseudo geometry priors and feature representation enhancement tool to guide the network to maintain surface normal consistency in spatial 3D space and regularize object- and texture-consistent depth estimation in 2D. In addition, we introduce a novel view synthesis pipeline where 2D-3D lifting is achieved with dense depth reconstructed via spatial warping, encouraging additional photometric supervision across temporal and spatial contexts, and compensating for the limitations of target-view image reconstruction. Finally, a newly-proposed adaptive joint motion learning strategy enables the network to adaptively emphasize informative spatial geometry cues for improved motion reasoning. Extensive experiments on KITTI, DDAD and nuScenes demonstrate that GeoSurDepth achieves SoTA performance, validating the effectiveness of our approach. Our framework highlights the importance of exploiting geometry coherence and consistency for robust self-supervised depth estimation.</description>

      <title>SparseOccVLA: Bridging Occupancy and Vision-Language Models via Sparse Queries for Unified 4D Scene Understanding and Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06474v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In autonomous driving, Vision Language Models (VLMs) excel at high-level reasoning , whereas semantic occupancy provides fine-grained details. Despite significant progress in individual fields, there is still no method that can effectively integrate both paradigms. Conventional VLMs struggle with token explosion and limited spatiotemporal reasoning, while semantic occupancy provides a unified, explicit spatial representation but is too dense to integrate efficiently with VLMs. To address these challenges and bridge the gap between VLMs and occupancy, we propose SparseOccVLA, a novel vision-language-action model that unifies scene understanding, occupancy forecasting, and trajectory planning powered by sparse occupancy queries. Starting with a lightweight Sparse Occupancy Encoder, SparseOccVLA generates compact yet highly informative sparse occupancy queries that serve as the single bridge between vision and language. These queries are aligned into the language space and reasoned by the LLM for unified scene understanding and future occupancy forecasting. Furthermore, we introduce an LLM-guided Anchor-Diffusion Planner featuring decoupled anchor scoring and denoising, as well as cross-model trajectory-condition fusion. SparseOccVLA achieves a 7% relative improvement in CIDEr over the state-of-the-art on OmniDrive-nuScenes, a 0.5 increase in mIoU score on Occ3D-nuScenes, and sets state-of-the-art open-loop planning metric on nuScenes benchmark, demonstrating its strong holistic capability.</description>

      <title>UDPNet: Unleashing Depth-based Priors for Robust Image Dehazing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06909v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Image dehazing has witnessed significant advancements with the development of deep learning models. However, most existing methods focus solely on single-modal RGB features, neglecting the inherent correlation between scene depth and haze distribution. Even those that jointly optimize depth estimation and image dehazing often suffer from suboptimal performance due to inadequate utilization of accurate depth information. In this paper, we present UDPNet, a general framework that leverages depth-based priors from a large-scale pretrained depth estimation model DepthAnything V2 to boost existing image dehazing models. Specifically, our architecture comprises two key components: the Depth-Guided Attention Module (DGAM) adaptively modulates features via lightweight depth-guided channel attention, and the Depth Prior Fusion Module (DPFM) enables hierarchical fusion of multi-scale depth map features by dual sliding-window multi-head cross-attention mechanism. These modules ensure both computational efficiency and effective integration of depth priors. Moreover, the depth priors empower the network to dynamically adapt to varying haze densities, illumination conditions, and domain gaps across synthetic and real-world data. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our UDPNet, outperforming the state-of-the-art methods on popular dehazing datasets, with PSNR improvements of 0.85 dB on SOTS-indoor, 1.19 dB on Haze4K, and 1.79 dB on NHR. Our proposed solution establishes a new benchmark for depth-aware dehazing across various scenarios. Pretrained models and codes are released at our project https://github.com/Harbinzzy/UDPNet.</description>

Abstract: Food image segmentation is a critical task for dietary analysis, enabling accurate estimation of food volume and nutrients. However, current methods suffer from limited multi-view data and poor generalization to new viewpoints. We introduce BenchSeg, a novel multi-view food video segmentation dataset and benchmark. BenchSeg aggregates 55 dish scenes (from Nutrition5k, Vegetables &amp; Fruits, MetaFood3D, and FoodKit) with 25,284 meticulously annotated frames, capturing each dish under free 360{\deg} camera motion. We evaluate a diverse set of 20 state-of-the-art segmentation models (e.g., SAM-based, transformer, CNN, and large multimodal) on the existing FoodSeg103 dataset and evaluate them (alone and combined with video-memory modules) on BenchSeg. Quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate that while standard image segmenters degrade sharply under novel viewpoints, memory-augmented methods maintain temporal consistency across frames. Our best model based on a combination of SeTR-MLA+XMem2 outperforms prior work (e.g., improving over FoodMem by ~2.63% mAP), offering new insights into food segmentation and tracking for dietary analysis. In addition to frame-wise spatial accuracy, we introduce a dedicated temporal evaluation protocol that explicitly quantifies segmentation stability over time through continuity, flicker rate, and IoU drift metrics. This allows us to reveal failure modes that remain invisible under standard per-frame evaluations. We release BenchSeg to foster future research. The project page including the dataset annotations and the food segmentation models can be found at https://amughrabi.github.io/benchseg.</description>

      <title>3AM: 3egment Anything with Geometric Consistency in Videos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08831v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Video object segmentation methods like SAM2 achieve strong performance through memory-based architectures but struggle under large viewpoint changes due to reliance on appearance features. Traditional 3D instance segmentation methods address viewpoint consistency but require camera poses, depth maps, and expensive preprocessing. We introduce 3AM, a training-time enhancement that integrates 3D-aware features from MUSt3R into SAM2. Our lightweight Feature Merger fuses multi-level MUSt3R features that encode implicit geometric correspondence. Combined with SAM2's appearance features, the model achieves geometry-consistent recognition grounded in both spatial position and visual similarity. We propose a field-of-view aware sampling strategy ensuring frames observe spatially consistent object regions for reliable 3D correspondence learning. Critically, our method requires only RGB input at inference, with no camera poses or preprocessing. On challenging datasets with wide-baseline motion (ScanNet++, Replica), 3AM substantially outperforms SAM2 and extensions, achieving 90.6% IoU and 71.7% Positive IoU on ScanNet++'s Selected Subset, improving over state-of-the-art VOS methods by +15.9 and +30.4 points.

      <title>Learning Domain-Invariant Representations for Cross-Domain Image Registration via Scene-Appearance Disentanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08875v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Image registration under domain shift remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision and medical imaging: when source and target images exhibit systematic intensity differences, the brightness constancy assumption underlying conventional registration methods is violated, rendering correspondence
  estimation ill-posed. We propose SAR-Net, a unified framework that addresses this challenge through principled scene-appearance disentanglement. Our key insight is that observed images can be decomposed into domain-invariant scene representations and domain-specific appearance codes, enabling registration
  via re-rendering rather than direct intensity matching. We establish theoretical conditions under which this decomposition enables consistent cross-domain alignment (Proposition 1) and prove that our scene consistency loss provides a sufficient condition for geometric correspondence in the shared latent
  space (Proposition 2). Empirically, we validate SAR-Net on the ANHIR (Automatic Non-rigid Histological Image Registration) challenge benchmark, where multi-stain histopathology images exhibit coupled domain shift from different staining protocols and geometric distortion from tissue preparation. Our method
  achieves a median relative Target Registration Error (rTRE) of 0.25%, outperforming the state-of-the-art MEVIS method (0.27% rTRE) by 7.4%, with robustness of 99.1%. Code is available at https://github.com/D-ST-Sword/SAR-NET</description>

      <title>SSVP: Synergistic Semantic-Visual Prompting for Industrial Zero-Shot Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09147v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Zero-Shot Anomaly Detection (ZSAD) leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to enable supervision-free industrial inspection. However, existing ZSAD paradigms are constrained by single visual backbones, which struggle to balance global semantic generalization with fine-grained structural discriminability. To bridge this gap, we propose Synergistic Semantic-Visual Prompting (SSVP), that efficiently fuses diverse visual encodings to elevate model's fine-grained perception. Specifically, SSVP introduces the Hierarchical Semantic-Visual Synergy (HSVS) mechanism, which deeply integrates DINOv3's multi-scale structural priors into the CLIP semantic space. Subsequently, the Vision-Conditioned Prompt Generator (VCPG) employs cross-modal attention to guide dynamic prompt generation, enabling linguistic queries to precisely anchor to specific anomaly patterns. Furthermore, to address the discrepancy between global scoring and local evidence, the Visual-Text Anomaly Mapper (VTAM) establishes a dual-gated calibration paradigm. Extensive evaluations on seven industrial benchmarks validate the robustness of our method; SSVP achieves state-of-the-art performance with 93.0% Image-AUROC and 92.2% Pixel-AUROC on MVTec-AD, significantly outperforming existing zero-shot approaches.</description>

      <title>UniHash: Unifying Pointwise and Pairwise Hashing Paradigms for Seen and Unseen Category Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09828v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Effective retrieval across both seen and unseen categories is crucial for modern image retrieval systems. Retrieval on seen categories ensures precise recognition of known classes, while retrieval on unseen categories promotes generalization to novel classes with limited supervision. However, most existing deep hashing methods are confined to a single training paradigm, either pointwise or pairwise, where the former excels on seen categories and the latter generalizes better to unseen ones. To overcome this limitation, we propose Unified Hashing (UniHash), a dual-branch framework that unifies the strengths of both paradigms to achieve balanced retrieval performance across seen and unseen categories. UniHash consists of two complementary branches: a center-based branch following the pointwise paradigm and a pairwise branch following the pairwise paradigm. A novel hash code learning method is introduced to enable bidirectional knowledge transfer between branches, improving hash code discriminability and generalization. It employs a mutual learning loss to align hash representations and introduces a Split-Merge Mixture of Hash Experts (SM-MoH) module to enhance cross-branch exchange of hash representations. Theoretical analysis substantiates the effectiveness of UniHash, and extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, MSCOCO, and ImageNet demonstrate that UniHash consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance in both seen and unseen image retrieval scenarios.</description>

      <title>DW-DGAT: Dynamically Weighted Dual Graph Attention Network for Neurodegenerative Disease Diagnosis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.10001v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are the two most prevalent and incurable neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) worldwide, for which early diagnosis is critical to delay their progression. However, the high dimensionality of multi-metric data with diverse structural forms, the heterogeneity of neuroimaging and phenotypic data, and class imbalance collectively pose significant challenges to early ND diagnosis. To address these challenges, we propose a dynamically weighted dual graph attention network (DW-DGAT) that integrates: (1) a general-purpose data fusion strategy to merge three structural forms of multi-metric data; (2) a dual graph attention architecture based on brain regions and inter-sample relationships to extract both micro- and macro-level features; and (3) a class weight generation mechanism combined with two stable and effective loss functions to mitigate class imbalance. Rigorous experiments, based on the Parkinson Progression Marker Initiative (PPMI) and Alzhermer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) studies, demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our approach.</description>

      <title>SRAW-Attack: Space-Reweighted Adversarial Warping Attack for SAR Target Recognition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.10324v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery exhibits intrinsic information sparsity due to its unique electromagnetic scattering mechanism. Despite the widespread adoption of deep neural network (DNN)-based SAR automatic target recognition (SAR-ATR) systems, they remain vulnerable to adversarial examples and tend to over-rely on background regions, leading to degraded adversarial robustness. Existing adversarial attacks for SAR-ATR often require visually perceptible distortions to achieve effective performance, thereby necessitating an attack method that balances effectiveness and stealthiness. In this paper, a novel attack method termed Space-Reweighted Adversarial Warping (SRAW) is proposed, which generates adversarial examples through optimized spatial deformation with reweighted budgets across foreground and background regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SRAW significantly degrades the performance of state-of-the-art SAR-ATR models and consistently outperforms existing methods in terms of imperceptibility and adversarial transferability.

Abstract: Text-guided human pose editing has gained significant traction in AIGC applications. However,it remains plagued by structural anomalies and generative artifacts. Existing evaluation metrics often isolate authenticity detection from quality assessment, failing to provide fine-grained insights into pose-specific inconsistencies. To address these limitations, we introduce HPE-Bench, a specialized benchmark comprising 1,700 standardized samples from 17 state-of-the-art editing models, offering both authenticity labels and multi-dimensional quality scores. Furthermore, we propose a unified framework based on layer-selective multimodal large language models (MLLMs). By employing contrastive LoRA tuning and a novel layer sensitivity analysis (LSA) mechanism, we identify the optimal feature layer for pose evaluation. Our framework achieves superior performance in both authenticity detection and multi-dimensional quality regression, effectively bridging the gap between forensic detection and quality assessment.</description>

      <title>Global Context Compression with Interleaved Vision-Text Transformation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.10378v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent achievements of vision-language models in end-to-end OCR point to a new avenue for low-loss compression of textual information. This motivates earlier works that render the Transformer's input into images for prefilling, which effectively reduces the number of tokens through visual encoding, thereby alleviating the quadratically increased Attention computations. However, this partial compression fails to save computational or memory costs at token-by-token inference. In this paper, we investigate global context compression, which saves tokens at both prefilling and inference stages. Consequently, we propose VIST2, a novel Transformer that interleaves input text chunks alongside their visual encoding, while depending exclusively on visual tokens in the pre-context to predict the next text token distribution. Around this idea, we render text chunks into sketch images and train VIST2 in multiple stages, starting from curriculum-scheduled pretraining for optical language modeling, followed by modal-interleaved instruction tuning. We conduct extensive experiments using VIST2 families scaled from 0.6B to 8B to explore the training recipe and hyperparameters. With a 4$\times$ compression ratio, the resulting models demonstrate significant superiority over baselines on long writing tasks, achieving, on average, a 3$\times$ speedup in first-token generation, 77% reduction in memory usage, and 74% reduction in FLOPS. Our codes and datasets will be public to support further studies.</description>

      <title>SatMap: Revisiting Satellite Maps as Prior for Online HD Map Construction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.10512v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Online high-definition (HD) map construction is an essential part of a safe and robust end-to-end autonomous driving (AD) pipeline. Onboard camera-based approaches suffer from limited depth perception and degraded accuracy due to occlusion. In this work, we propose SatMap, an online vectorized HD map estimation method that integrates satellite maps with multi-view camera observations and directly predicts a vectorized HD map for downstream prediction and planning modules. Our method leverages lane-level semantics and texture from satellite imagery captured from a Bird's Eye View (BEV) perspective as a global prior, effectively mitigating depth ambiguity and occlusion. In our experiments on the nuScenes dataset, SatMap achieves 34.8% mAP performance improvement over the camera-only baseline and 8.5% mAP improvement over the camera-LiDAR fusion baseline. Moreover, we evaluate our model in long-range and adverse weather conditions to demonstrate the advantages of using a satellite prior map.

Abstract: Anticipating the intentions of Vulnerable Road Users (VRUs) is a critical challenge for safe autonomous driving (AD) and mobile robotics. While current research predominantly focuses on pedestrian crossing behaviors from a vehicle's perspective, interactions within dense shared spaces remain underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce FUSE-Bike, the first fully open perception platform of its kind. Equipped with two LiDARs, a camera, and GNSS, it facilitates high-fidelity, close-range data capture directly from a cyclist's viewpoint. Leveraging this platform, we present BikeActions, a novel multi-modal dataset comprising 852 annotated samples across 5 distinct action classes, specifically tailored to improve VRU behavior modeling. We establish a rigorous benchmark by evaluating state-of-the-art graph convolution and transformer-based models on our publicly released data splits, establishing the first performance baselines for this challenging task. We release the full dataset together with data curation tools, the open hardware design, and the benchmark code to foster future research in VRU action understanding under https://iv.ee.hm.edu/bikeactions/.</description>

Abstract: Image segmentation plays a central role in computer vision. However, widely used evaluation metrics, whether pixel-wise, region-based, or boundary-focused, often struggle to capture the structural and topological coherence of a segmentation. In many practical scenarios, such as medical imaging or object delineation, small inaccuracies in boundary, holes, or fragmented predictions can result in high metric scores, despite the fact that the resulting masks fail to preserve the object global shape or connectivity. This highlights a limitation of conventional metrics: they are unable to assess whether a predicted segmentation partitions the image into meaningful interior and exterior regions.
  In this work, we introduce a topology-aware notion of segmentation based on the Jordan Curve Theorem, and adapted for use in digital planes. We define the concept of a \emph{Jordan-segmentatable mask}, which is a binary segmentation whose structure ensures a topological separation of the image domain into two connected components. We analyze segmentation masks through the lens of digital topology and homology theory, extracting a $4$-curve candidate from the mask, verifying its topological validity using Betti numbers. A mask is considered Jordan-segmentatable when this candidate forms a digital 4-curve with $\beta_0 = \beta_1 = 1$, or equivalently when its complement splits into exactly two $8$-connected components.
  This framework provides a mathematically rigorous, unsupervised criterion with which to assess the structural coherence of segmentation masks. By combining digital Jordan theory and homological invariants, our approach provides a valuable alternative to standard evaluation metrics, especially in applications where topological correctness must be preserved.</description>

      <title>MMedExpert-R1: Strengthening Multimodal Medical Reasoning via Domain-Specific Adaptation and Clinical Guideline Reinforcement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.10949v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Medical Vision-Language Models (MedVLMs) excel at perception tasks but struggle with complex clinical reasoning required in real-world scenarios. While reinforcement learning (RL) has been explored to enhance reasoning capabilities, existing approaches face critical mismatches: the scarcity of deep reasoning data, cold-start limits multi-specialty alignment, and standard RL algorithms fail to model clinical reasoning diversity. We propose MMedExpert-R1, a novel reasoning MedVLM that addresses these challenges through domain-specific adaptation and clinical guideline reinforcement. We construct MMedExpert, a high-quality dataset of 10K samples across four specialties with step-by-step reasoning traces. Our Domain-Specific Adaptation (DSA) creates specialty-specific LoRA modules to provide diverse initialization, while Guideline-Based Advantages (GBA) explicitly models different clinical reasoning perspectives to align with real-world diagnostic strategies. Conflict-Aware Capability Integration then merges these specialized experts into a unified agent, ensuring robust multi-specialty alignment. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, with our 7B model achieving 27.50 on MedXpert-MM and 83.03 on OmniMedVQA, establishing a robust foundation for reliable multimodal medical reasoning systems.</description>

      <title>SAMannot: A Memory-Efficient, Local, Open-source Framework for Interactive Video Instance Segmentation based on SAM2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11301v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current research workflows for precise video segmentation are often forced into a compromise between labor-intensive manual curation, costly commercial platforms, and/or privacy-compromising cloud-based services. The demand for high-fidelity video instance segmentation in research is often hindered by the bottleneck of manual annotation and the privacy concerns of cloud-based tools. We present SAMannot, an open-source, local framework that integrates the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) into a human-in-the-loop workflow. To address the high resource requirements of foundation models, we modified the SAM2 dependency and implemented a processing layer that minimizes computational overhead and maximizes throughput, ensuring a highly responsive user interface. Key features include persistent instance identity management, an automated ``lock-and-refine'' workflow with barrier frames, and a mask-skeletonization-based auto-prompting mechanism. SAMannot facilitates the generation of research-ready datasets in YOLO and PNG formats alongside structured interaction logs. Verified through animal behavior tracking use-cases and subsets of the LVOS and DAVIS benchmark datasets, the tool provides a scalable, private, and cost-effective alternative to commercial platforms for complex video annotation tasks.</description>

      <title>Topology-Aware Loss for Aorta and Great Vessel Segmentation in Computed Tomography Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.03137v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Segmentation networks are not explicitly imposed to learn global invariants of an image, such as the shape of an object and the geometry between multiple objects, when they are trained with a standard loss function. On the other hand, incorporating such invariants into network training may help improve performance for various segmentation tasks when they are the intrinsic characteristics of the objects to be segmented. One example is segmentation of aorta and great vessels in computed tomography (CT) images where vessels are found in a particular geometry in the body due to the human anatomy and they mostly seem as round objects on a 2D CT image. This paper addresses this issue by introducing a new topology-aware loss function that penalizes topology dissimilarities between the ground truth and prediction through persistent homology. Different from the previously suggested segmentation network designs, which apply the threshold filtration on a likelihood function of the prediction map and the Betti numbers of the ground truth, this paper proposes to apply the Vietoris-Rips filtration to obtain persistence diagrams of both ground truth and prediction maps and calculate the dissimilarity with the Wasserstein distance between the corresponding persistence diagrams. The use of this filtration has advantage of modeling shape and geometry at the same time, which may not happen when the threshold filtration is applied. Our experiments on 4327 CT images of 24 subjects reveal that the proposed topology-aware loss function leads to better results than its counterparts, indicating the effectiveness of this use.</description>

      <title>Combining Shape Completion and Grasp Prediction for Fast and Versatile Grasping with a Multi-Fingered Hand</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.20350v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Grasping objects with limited or no prior knowledge about them is a highly relevant skill in assistive robotics. Still, in this general setting, it has remained an open problem, especially when it comes to only partial observability and versatile grasping with multi-fingered hands. We present a novel, fast, and high fidelity deep learning pipeline consisting of a shape completion module that is based on a single depth image, and followed by a grasp predictor that is based on the predicted object shape. The shape completion network is based on VQDIF and predicts spatial occupancy values at arbitrary query points. As grasp predictor, we use our two-stage architecture that first generates hand poses using an autoregressive model and then regresses finger joint configurations per pose. Critical factors turn out to be sufficient data realism and augmentation, as well as special attention to difficult cases during training. Experiments on a physical robot platform demonstrate successful grasping of a wide range of household objects based on a depth image from a single viewpoint. The whole pipeline is fast, taking only about 1 s for completing the object's shape (0.7 s) and generating 1000 grasps (0.3 s).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06122v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Feature Visualization (FV) is a widely used technique for interpreting concepts learned by Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), which synthesizes input patterns that maximally activate a given feature. Despite its popularity, the trustworthiness of FV explanations has received limited attention. We introduce Gradient Slingshots, a novel method that enables FV manipulation without modifying model architecture or significantly degrading performance. By shaping new trajectories in off-distribution regions of a feature's activation landscape, we coerce the optimization process to converge to a predefined visualization. We evaluate our approach on several DNN architectures, demonstrating its ability to replace faithful FVs with arbitrary targets. These results expose a critical vulnerability: auditors relying solely on FV may accept entirely fabricated explanations. To mitigate this risk, we propose a straightforward defense and quantitatively demonstrate its effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Emotion Recognition using Audio-Video Transformer Fusion with Cross Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18552v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal emotion recognition (MER) aims to infer human affect by jointly modeling audio and visual cues; however, existing approaches often struggle with temporal misalignment, weakly discriminative feature representations, and suboptimal fusion of heterogeneous modalities. To address these challenges, we propose AVT-CA, an Audio-Video Transformer architecture with cross attention for robust emotion recognition. The proposed model introduces a hierarchical video feature representation that combines channel attention, spatial attention, and local feature extraction to emphasize emotionally salient regions while suppressing irrelevant information. These refined visual features are integrated with audio representations through an intermediate transformer-based fusion mechanism that captures interlinked temporal dependencies across modalities. Furthermore, a cross-attention module selectively reinforces mutually consistent audio-visual cues, enabling effective feature selection and noise-aware fusion. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets, CMU-MOSEI, RAVDESS, and CREMA-D, demonstrate that AVT-CA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving significant improvements in both accuracy and F1-score.

      <title>CausAdv: A Causal-based Framework for Detecting Adversarial Examples</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00839v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep learning has led to tremendous success in computer vision, largely due to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). However, CNNs have been shown to be vulnerable to crafted adversarial perturbations. This vulnerability of adversarial examples has has motivated research into improving model robustness through adversarial detection and defense methods. In this paper, we address the adversarial robustness of CNNs through causal reasoning. We propose CausAdv: a causal framework for detecting adversarial examples based on counterfactual reasoning. CausAdv learns both causal and non-causal features of every input, and quantifies the counterfactual information (CI) of every filter of the last convolutional layer. We then perform a statistical analysis of the filters' CI across clean and adversarial samples, to demonstrate that adversarial examples exhibit different CI distributions compared to clean samples. Our results show that causal reasoning enhances the process of adversarial detection without the need to train a separate detector. Moreover, we illustrate the efficiency of causal explanations as a helpful detection tool by visualizing the extracted causal features.</description>

      <title>Comparison of Generative Learning Methods for Turbulence Surrogates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16417v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Numerical simulations of turbulent flows present significant challenges in fluid dynamics due to their complexity and high computational cost. High resolution techniques such as Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) and Large Eddy Simulation (LES) are generally not computationally affordable, particularly for technologically relevant problems. Recent advances in machine learning, specifically in generative probabilistic models, offer promising alternatives as surrogates for turbulence. This paper investigates the application of three generative models - Variational Autoencoders (VAE), Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGAN), and Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) - in simulating a von K\'arm\'an vortex street around a fixed cylinder projected into 2D, as well as a real-world experimental dataset of the wake flow of a cylinder array. Training data was obtained by means of LES in the simulated case and Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) in the experimental case. We evaluate each model's ability to capture the statistical properties and spatial structures of the turbulent flow. Our results demonstrate that DDPM and DCGAN effectively replicate all flow distributions, highlighting their potential as efficient and accurate tools for turbulence surrogacy. We find a strong argument for DCGAN, as although they are more difficult to train (due to problems such as mode collapse), they show the fastest inference and training time, require less data to train compared to VAE and DDPM, and provide the results most closely aligned with the input stream. In contrast, VAE train quickly (and can generate samples quickly) but do not produce adequate results, and DDPM, whilst effective, are significantly slower at both, inference and training time.</description>

      <title>DiffRatio: Training One-Step Diffusion Models Without Teacher Supervision</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08005v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Score-based distillation methods (e.g., variational score distillation) train one-step diffusion models by first pre-training a teacher score model and then distilling it into a one-step student model. However, the gradient estimator in the distillation stage usually suffers from two sources of bias: (1) biased teacher supervision due to score estimation error incurred during pre-training, and (2) the student model's score estimation error during distillation. These biases can degrade the quality of the resulting one-step diffusion model. To address this, we propose DiffRatio, a new framework for training one-step diffusion models: instead of estimating the teacher and student scores independently and then taking their difference, we directly estimate the score difference as the gradient of a learned log density ratio between the student and data distributions across diffusion time steps. This approach greatly simplifies the training pipeline, significantly reduces gradient estimation bias, and improves one-step generation quality. Additionally, it also reduces auxiliary network size by using a lightweight density-ratio network instead of two full score networks, which improves computational and memory efficiency. DiffRatio achieves competitive one-step generation results on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet (64x64 and 512x512), outperforming most teacher-supervised distillation approaches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07177v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Early brain development is crucial for lifelong neurodevelopmental health. However, current clinical practice offers limited knowledge of normal embryonic brain anatomy on ultrasound, despite the brain undergoing rapid changes within the time-span of days. To provide detailed insights into normal brain development and identify deviations, we created the 4D Human Embryonic Brain Atlas using a deep learning-based approach for groupwise registration and spatiotemporal atlas generation. Our method introduced a time-dependent initial atlas and penalized deviations from it, ensuring age-specific anatomy was maintained throughout rapid development. The atlas was generated and validated using 831 3D ultrasound images from 402 subjects in the Rotterdam Periconceptional Cohort, acquired between gestational weeks 8 and 12. We evaluated the effectiveness of our approach with an ablation study, which demonstrated that incorporating a time-dependent initial atlas and penalization produced anatomically accurate results. In contrast, omitting these adaptations led to anatomically incorrect atlas. Visual comparisons with an existing ex-vivo embryo atlas further confirmed the anatomical accuracy of our atlas. In conclusion, the proposed method successfully captures the rapid anotomical development of the embryonic brain. The resulting 4D Human Embryonic Brain Atlas provides a unique insights into this crucial early life period and holds the potential for improving the detection, prevention, and treatment of prenatal neurodevelopmental disorders.</description>

      <title>Tube-Based Robust Control Strategy for Vision-Guided Autonomous Vehicles</title>

Abstract: A robust control strategy for autonomous vehicles can improve system stability, enhance riding comfort, and prevent driving accidents. This paper presents a novel interpolation-tube-based constrained iterative linear quadratic regulator (itube-CILQR) algorithm for autonomous computer-vision-based vehicle lane-keeping. The goal of the algorithm is to enhance robustness during high-speed cornering on tight turns. Compared with standard tube-based approaches, the proposed itube-CILQR algorithm reduces system conservatism and exhibits higher computational speed. Numerical simulations and vision-based experiments were conducted to examine the feasibility of using the proposed algorithm for controlling autonomous vehicles. The results indicated that the proposed algorithm achieved superior vehicle lane-keeping performance to variational CILQR-based methods and model predictive control (MPC) approaches involving the use of a classical interior-point optimizer. Specifically, itube-CILQR required an average runtime of 3.45 ms to generate a control signal for guiding a self-driving vehicle. By comparison, itube-MPC typically required a 4.32 times longer computation time to complete the same task. Moreover, the influence of conservatism on system behavior was investigated by exploring the variations in the interpolation variables derived using the proposed itube-CILQR algorithm during lane-keeping maneuvers.</description>

      <title>WVSC: Wireless Video Semantic Communication with Multi-frame Compensation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21197v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing wireless video transmission schemes directly conduct video coding in pixel level, while neglecting the inner semantics contained in videos. In this paper, we propose a wireless video semantic communication framework, abbreviated as WVSC, which integrates the idea of semantic communication into wireless video transmission scenarios. WVSC first encodes original video frames as semantic frames and then conducts video coding based on such compact representations, enabling the video coding in semantic level rather than pixel level. Moreover, to further reduce the communication overhead, a reference semantic frame is introduced to substitute motion vectors of each frame in common video coding methods. At the receiver, multi-frame compensation (MFC) is proposed to produce compensated current semantic frame with a multi-frame fusion attention module. With both the reference frame transmission and MFC, the bandwidth efficiency improves with satisfying video transmission performance. Experimental results verify the performance gain of WVSC over other DL-based methods e.g. DVSC about 1 dB and traditional schemes about 2 dB in terms of PSNR.</description>

Abstract: Metaphor and humor share a lot of common ground, and metaphor is one of the most common humorous mechanisms. This study focuses on the humorous capacity of multimodal metaphors, which has not received due attention in the community. We take inspiration from the Incongruity Theory of humor, the Conceptual Metaphor Theory, and the annotation scheme behind the VU Amsterdam Metaphor Corpus, and developed a novel annotation scheme for humorous multimodal metaphor use in image-caption pairs. We create the Hummus Dataset of Humorous Multimodal Metaphor Use, providing expert annotation on 1k image-caption pairs sampled from the New Yorker Caption Contest corpus. Using the dataset, we test state-of-the-art multimodal large language models (MLLMs) on their ability to detect and understand humorous multimodal metaphor use. Our experiments show that current MLLMs still struggle with processing humorous multimodal metaphors, particularly with regard to integrating visual and textual information. We release our dataset and code at github.com/xiaoyuisrain/humorous-multimodal-metaphor-use.</description>

      <title>Knot So Simple: A Minimalistic Environment for Spatial Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18028v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose KnotGym, an interactive environment for complex, spatial reasoning and manipulation. KnotGym includes goal-oriented rope manipulation tasks with varying levels of complexity, all requiring acting from pure image observations. Tasks are defined along a clear and quantifiable axis of complexity based on the number of knot crossings, creating a natural generalization test. KnotGym has a simple observation space, allowing for scalable development, yet it highlights core challenges in integrating acute perception, spatial reasoning, and grounded manipulation. We evaluate methods of different classes, including model-based RL, model-predictive control, and chain-of-thought reasoning, and illustrate the challenges KnotGym presents. KnotGym is available at https://github.com/lil-lab/knotgym.</description>

      <title>Event2Audio: Event-Based Optical Vibration Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03273v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Small vibrations observed in video can unveil information beyond what is visual, such as sound and material properties. It is possible to passively record these vibrations when they are visually perceptible, or actively amplify their visual contribution with a laser beam when they are not perceptible. In this paper, we improve upon the active sensing approach by leveraging event-based cameras, which are designed to efficiently capture fast motion. We demonstrate our method experimentally by recovering audio from vibrations, even for multiple simultaneous sources, and in the presence of environmental distortions. Our approach matches the state-of-the-art reconstruction quality at much faster speeds, approaching real-time processing.</description>

      <title>I2I-PR: Deep Iterative Refinement for Phase Retrieval using Image-to-Image Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09609v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Phase retrieval aims to recover a signal from intensity-only measurements, a fundamental problem in many fields such as imaging, holography, optical computing, crystallography, and microscopy. Although there are several well-known phase retrieval algorithms, including classical alternating projection-based solvers, the reconstruction performance often remains sensitive to initialization and measurement noise. Recently, diffusion models have gained traction in various image reconstruction tasks, yielding significant theoretical insights and practical advances. In this work, we introduce a deep iterative refinement framework that redefines the role of diffusion models in phase retrieval. Instead of generating images from random noise, our method starts with multiple physically consistent initial estimates and iteratively refines them through a learned image-to-image diffusion process. This enables data-driven phase retrieval that is both interpretable and robust, leveraging the strengths of classical solvers while mitigating their weaknesses. Furthermore, we propose an enhanced initialization strategy that integrates classical algorithms with a novel acceleration mechanism to obtain reliable initial estimates. During inference, we adopt a geometric self-ensemble strategy based on input flipping, together with output aggregation to further improve the final reconstruction quality. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves substantial gains in both training efficiency and reconstruction quality, consistently outperforming classical and recent state-of-the-art methods. These results highlight the potential of diffusion-driven refinement as an effective and general framework for robust phase retrieval across diverse applications.

      <title>WaveletInception Networks for on-board Vibration-Based Infrastructure Health Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12969v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a deep learning framework for analyzing on board vibration response signals in infrastructure health monitoring. The proposed WaveletInception-BiGRU network uses a Learnable Wavelet Packet Transform (LWPT) for early spectral feature extraction, followed by one-dimensional Inception-Residual Network (1D Inception-ResNet) modules for multi-scale, high-level feature learning. Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU) modules then integrate temporal dependencies and incorporate operational conditions, such as the measurement speed. This approach enables effective analysis of vibration signals recorded at varying speeds, eliminating the need for explicit signal preprocessing. The sequential estimation head further leverages bidirectional temporal information to produce an accurate, localized assessment of infrastructure health. Ultimately, the framework generates high-resolution health profiles spatially mapped to the physical layout of the infrastructure. Case studies involving track stiffness regression and transition zone classification using real-world measurements demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, underscoring its potential for accurate, localized, and automated on-board infrastructure health monitoring.</description>

      <title>Shared representations in brains and models reveal a two-route cortical organization during scene perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13941v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The brain transforms visual inputs into high-dimensional cortical representations that support diverse cognitive and behavioral goals. Characterizing how this information is organized and routed across the human brain is essential for understanding how we process complex visual scenes. Here, we applied representational similarity analysis to 7T fMRI data collected during natural scene viewing. We quantified representational geometry shared across individuals and compared it to hierarchical features from vision and language neural networks. This analysis revealed two distinct processing routes: a ventromedial pathway specialized for scene layout and environmental context, and a lateral occipitotemporal pathway selective for animate content. Vision models aligned with shared structure in both routes, whereas language models corresponded primarily with the lateral pathway. These findings refine classical visual-stream models by characterizing scene perception as a distributed cortical network with separable representational routes for context and animate content.</description>

      <title>Controllable Video Generation: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16869v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the rapid development of AI-generated content (AIGC), video generation has emerged as one of its most dynamic and impactful subfields. In particular, the advancement of video generation foundation models has led to growing demand for controllable video generation methods that can more accurately reflect user intent. Most existing foundation models are designed for text-to-video generation, where text prompts alone are often insufficient to express complex, multi-modal, and fine-grained user requirements. This limitation makes it challenging for users to generate videos with precise control using current models. To address this issue, recent research has explored the integration of additional non-textual conditions, such as camera motion, depth maps, and human pose, to extend pretrained video generation models and enable more controllable video synthesis. These approaches aim to enhance the flexibility and practical applicability of AIGC-driven video generation systems. In this survey, we provide a systematic review of controllable video generation, covering both theoretical foundations and recent advances in the field. We begin by introducing the key concepts and commonly used open-source video generation models. We then focus on control mechanisms in video diffusion models, analyzing how different types of conditions can be incorporated into the denoising process to guide generation. Finally, we categorize existing methods based on the types of control signals they leverage, including single-condition generation, multi-condition generation, and universal controllable generation.

      <title>WEEP: A Differentiable Nonconvex Sparse Regularizer via Weakly-Convex Envelope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20447v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sparse regularization is fundamental in signal processing and feature extraction but often relies on non-differentiable penalties, conflicting with gradient-based optimizers. We propose WEEP (Weakly-convex Envelope of Piecewise Penalty), a novel differentiable regularizer derived from the weakly-convex envelope framework. WEEP provides tunable, unbiased sparsity and a simple closed-form proximal operator, while maintaining full differentiability and L-smoothness, ensuring compatibility with both gradient-based and proximal algorithms. This resolves the tradeoff between statistical performance and computational tractability. We demonstrate superior performance compared to established convex and non-convex sparse regularizers on challenging compressive sensing and image denoising tasks.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Reconstruction of 3D Bone Models via Very-Low-Dose Protocols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13947v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Patient-specific bone models are essential for designing surgical guides and preoperative planning, as they enable the visualization of intricate anatomical structures. However, traditional CT-based approaches for creating bone models are limited to preoperative use due to the low flexibility and high radiation exposure of CT and time-consuming manual delineation. Here, we introduce Semi-Supervised Reconstruction with Knowledge Distillation (SSR-KD), a fast and accurate AI framework to reconstruct high-quality bone models from biplanar X-rays in 30 seconds, with an average error under 1.0 mm, eliminating the dependence on CT and manual work. Additionally, high tibial osteotomy simulation was performed by experts on reconstructed bone models, demonstrating that bone models reconstructed from biplanar X-rays have comparable clinical applicability to those annotated from CT. Overall, our approach accelerates the process, reduces radiation exposure, enables intraoperative guidance, and significantly improves the practicality of bone models, offering transformative applications in orthopedics.</description>

      <title>UM3: Unsupervised Map to Map Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16874v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Map-to-map matching is a critical task for aligning spatial data across heterogeneous sources, yet it remains challenging due to the lack of ground truth correspondences, sparse node features, and scalability demands. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised graph-based framework that addresses these challenges through three key innovations. First, our method is an unsupervised learning approach that requires no training data, which is crucial for large-scale map data where obtaining labeled training samples is challenging. Second, we introduce pseudo coordinates that capture the relative spatial layout of nodes within each map, which enhances feature discriminability and enables scale-invariant learning. Third, we design an mechanism to adaptively balance feature and geometric similarity, as well as a geometric-consistent loss function, ensuring robustness to noisy or incomplete coordinate data. At the implementation level, to handle large-scale maps, we develop a tile-based post-processing pipeline with overlapping regions and majority voting, which enables parallel processing while preserving boundary coherence. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in matching tasks, surpassing existing methods by a large margin, particularly in high-noise and large-scale scenarios. Our framework provides a scalable and practical solution for map alignment, offering a robust and efficient alternative to traditional approaches.</description>

      <title>Lightning Fast Caching-based Parallel Denoising Prediction for Accelerating Talking Head Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00052v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion-based talking head models generate high-quality, photorealistic videos but suffer from slow inference, limiting practical applications. Existing acceleration methods for general diffusion models fail to exploit the temporal and spatial redundancies unique to talking head generation. In this paper, we propose a task-specific framework addressing these inefficiencies through two key innovations. First, we introduce Lightning-fast Caching-based Parallel denoising prediction (LightningCP), caching static features to bypass most model layers in inference time. We also enable parallel prediction using cached features and estimated noisy latents as inputs, efficiently bypassing sequential sampling. Second, we propose Decoupled Foreground Attention (DFA) to further accelerate attention computations, exploiting the spatial decoupling in talking head videos to restrict attention to dynamic foreground regions. Additionally, we remove reference features in certain layers to bring extra speedup. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework significantly improves inference speed while preserving video quality.</description>

      <title>Sy-FAR: Symmetry-based Fair Adversarial Robustness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12939v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Security-critical machine-learning (ML) systems, such as face-recognition systems, are susceptible to adversarial examples, including real-world physically realizable attacks. Various means to boost ML's adversarial robustness have been proposed; however, they typically induce unfair robustness: It is often easier to attack from certain classes or groups than from others. Several techniques have been developed to improve adversarial robustness while seeking perfect fairness between classes. Yet, prior work has focused on settings where security and fairness are less critical. Our insight is that achieving perfect parity in realistic fairness-critical tasks, such as face recognition, is often infeasible -- some classes may be highly similar, leading to more misclassifications between them. Instead, we suggest that seeking symmetry -- i.e., attacks from class $i$ to $j$ would be as successful as from $j$ to $i$ -- is more tractable. Intuitively, symmetry is a desirable because class resemblance is a symmetric relation in most domains. Additionally, as we prove theoretically, symmetry between individuals induces symmetry between any set of sub-groups, in contrast to other fairness notions where group-fairness is often elusive. We develop Sy-FAR, a technique to encourage symmetry while also optimizing adversarial robustness and extensively evaluate it using five datasets, with three model architectures, including against targeted and untargeted realistic attacks. The results show Sy-FAR significantly improves fair adversarial robustness compared to state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, we find that Sy-FAR is faster and more consistent across runs. Notably, Sy-FAR also ameliorates another type of unfairness we discover in this work -- target classes that adversarial examples are likely to be classified into become significantly less vulnerable after inducing symmetry.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13541v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Purpose: Natural orifice surgeries minimize the need for incisions and reduce the recovery time compared to open surgery; however, they require a higher level of expertise due to visualization and orientation challenges. We propose a perception pipeline for these surgeries that allows semantic scene understanding.
  Methods: We bring learning-based segmentation, depth estimation, and 3D reconstruction modules together to create real-time segmented maps of the surgical scenes. Additionally, we use registration with robot poses to solve the scale ambiguity of mapping from monocular images, and allow the use of semantically informed real-time reconstructions in robotic surgeries.
  Results: We achieve sub-milimeter reconstruction accuracy based on average one-sided Chamfer distances, average pose registration RMSE of 0.9 mm, and an estimated scale within 2% of ground truth.
  Conclusion: We present a modular perception pipeline, integrating semantic segmentation with real-time monocular SLAM for natural orifice surgeries. This pipeline offers a promising solution for scene understanding that can facilitate automation or surgeon guidance.</description>

      <title>SlimDiff: Training-Free, Activation-Guided Hands-free Slimming of Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21498v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs), lauded for their generative performance, are computationally prohibitive due to their billion-scale parameters and iterative denoising dynamics. Existing efficiency techniques, such as quantization, timestep reduction, or pruning, offer savings in compute, memory, or runtime but are strictly bottlenecked by reliance on fine-tuning or retraining to recover performance. In this work, we introduce SlimDiff, an automated activation-informed structural compression framework that reduces both attention and feedforward dimensionalities in DMs, while being entirely gradient-free. SlimDiff reframes DM compression as a spectral approximation task, where activation covariances across denoising timesteps define low-rank subspaces that guide dynamic pruning under a fixed compression budget. This activation-aware formulation mitigates error accumulation across timesteps by applying module-wise decompositions over functional weight groups: query--key interactions, value--output couplings, and feedforward projections, rather than isolated matrix factorizations, while adaptively allocating sparsity across modules to respect the non-uniform geometry of diffusion trajectories. SlimDiff achieves up to 35\% acceleration and $\sim$100M parameter reduction over baselines, with generation quality on par with uncompressed models without any backpropagation. Crucially, our approach requires only about 500 calibration samples, over 70$\times$ fewer than prior methods. To our knowledge, this is the first closed-form, activation-guided structural compression of DMs that is entirely training-free, providing both theoretical clarity and practical efficiency.</description>

Abstract: Generating high-fidelity 3D geometries that satisfy specific parameter constraints has broad applications in design and engineering. However, current methods typically rely on large training datasets and struggle with controllability and generalization beyond the training distributions. To overcome these limitations, we introduce LAMP (Linear Affine Mixing of Parametric shapes), a data-efficient framework for controllable and interpretable 3D generation. LAMP first aligns signed distance function (SDF) decoders by overfitting each exemplar from a shared initialization, then synthesizes new geometries by solving a parameter-constrained mixing problem in the aligned weight space. To ensure robustness, we further propose a safety metric that detects geometry validity via linearity mismatch. We evaluate LAMP on two 3D parametric benchmarks: DrivAerNet++ and BlendedNet. We found that LAMP enables (i) controlled interpolation within bounds with as few as 100 samples, (ii) safe extrapolation by up to 100% parameter difference beyond training ranges, (iii) physics performance-guided optimization under fixed parameters. LAMP significantly outperforms conditional autoencoder and Deep Network Interpolation (DNI) baselines in both extrapolation and data efficiency. Our results demonstrate that LAMP advances controllable, data-efficient, and safe 3D generation for design exploration, dataset generation, and performance-driven optimization.</description>

      <title>Multimodal RewardBench 2: Evaluating Omni Reward Models for Interleaved Text and Image</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16899v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reward models (RMs) are essential for training large language models (LLMs), but remain underexplored for omni models that handle interleaved image and text sequences. We introduce Multimodal RewardBench 2 (MMRB2), the first comprehensive benchmark for reward models on multimodal understanding and (interleaved) generation. MMRB2 spans four tasks: text-to-image, image editing, interleaved generation, and multimodal reasoning ("thinking-with-images"), providing 1,000 expert-annotated preference pairs per task from 23 models and agents across 21 source tasks. MMRB2 is designed with: (1) practical but challenging prompts; (2) responses from state-of-the-art models and agents; and (3) preference pairs with strong human-expert consensus, curated via an ensemble filtering strategy. Using MMRB2, we study existing judges for each subtask, including multimodal LLM-as-a-judge and models trained with human preferences. The latest Gemini 3 Pro attains 75-80% accuracy. GPT-5 and Gemini 2.5 Pro reach 66-75% accuracy, compared to &gt;90% for humans, yet surpass the widely used GPT-4o (59%). The best performing open-source model Qwen3-VL-32B achieves similar accuracies as Gemini 2.5 Flash (64%). We also show that MMRB2 performance strongly correlates with downstream task success using Best-of-N sampling and conduct an in-depth analysis that shows key areas to improve the reward models going forward.</description>

      <title>Crafting Adversarial Inputs for Large Vision-Language Models Using Black-Box Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01747v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have shown groundbreaking capabilities across diverse multimodal tasks. However, these models remain vulnerable to adversarial jailbreak attacks, where adversaries craft subtle perturbations to bypass safety mechanisms and trigger harmful outputs. Existing white-box attacks methods require full model accessibility, suffer from computing costs and exhibit insufficient adversarial transferability, making them impractical for real-world, black-box settings. To address these limitations, we propose a black-box jailbreak attack on LVLMs via Zeroth-Order optimization using Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation (ZO-SPSA). ZO-SPSA provides three key advantages: (i) gradient-free approximation by input-output interactions without requiring model knowledge, (ii) model-agnostic optimization without the surrogate model and (iii) lower resource requirements with reduced GPU memory consumption. We evaluate ZO-SPSA on three LVLMs, including InstructBLIP, LLaVA and MiniGPT-4, achieving the highest jailbreak success rate of 83.0% on InstructBLIP, while maintaining imperceptible perturbations comparable to white-box methods. Moreover, adversarial examples generated from MiniGPT-4 exhibit strong transferability to other LVLMs, with ASR reaching 64.18%. These findings underscore the real-world feasibility of black-box jailbreaks and expose critical weaknesses in the safety mechanisms of current LVLMs</description>

      <title>Normalized Conditional Mutual Information Surrogate Loss for Deep Neural Classifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02543v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel information theoretic surrogate loss; normalized conditional mutual information (NCMI); as a drop in alternative to the de facto cross-entropy (CE) for training deep neural network (DNN) based classifiers. We first observe that the model's NCMI is inversely proportional to its accuracy. Building on this insight, we introduce an alternating algorithm to efficiently minimize the NCMI. Across image recognition and whole-slide imaging (WSI) subtyping benchmarks, NCMI-trained models surpass state of the art losses by substantial margins at a computational cost comparable to that of CE. Notably, on ImageNet, NCMI yields a 2.77% top-1 accuracy improvement with ResNet-50 comparing to the CE; on CAMELYON-17, replacing CE with NCMI improves the macro-F1 by 8.6% over the strongest baseline. Gains are consistent across various architectures and batch sizes, suggesting that NCMI is a practical and competitive alternative to CE.</description>

      <title>Edit2Restore:Few-Shot Image Restoration via Parameter-Efficient Adaptation of Pre-trained Editing Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03391v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Image restoration has traditionally required training specialized models on thousands of paired examples per degradation type. We challenge this paradigm by demonstrating that powerful pre-trained text-conditioned image editing models can be efficiently adapted for multiple restoration tasks through parameter-efficient fine-tuning with remarkably few examples. Our approach fine-tunes LoRA adapters on FLUX.1 Kontext, a state-of-the-art 12B parameter flow matching model for image-to-image translation, using only 16-128 paired images per task, guided by simple text prompts that specify the restoration operation. Unlike existing methods that train specialized restoration networks from scratch with thousands of samples, we leverage the rich visual priors already encoded in large-scale pre-trained editing models, dramatically reducing data requirements while maintaining high perceptual quality. A single unified LoRA adapter, conditioned on task-specific text prompts, effectively handles multiple degradations including denoising, deraining, and dehazing. Through comprehensive ablation studies, we analyze: (i) the impact of training set size on restoration quality, (ii) trade-offs between task-specific versus unified multi-task adapters, (iii) the role of text encoder fine-tuning, and (iv) zero-shot baseline performance. While our method prioritizes perceptual quality over pixel-perfect reconstruction metrics like PSNR/SSIM, our results demonstrate that pre-trained image editing models, when properly adapted, offer a compelling and data-efficient alternative to traditional image restoration approaches, opening new avenues for few-shot, prompt-guided image enhancement.

      <title>Learning Latent Action World Models In The Wild</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05230v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Agents capable of reasoning and planning in the real world require the ability of predicting the consequences of their actions. While world models possess this capability, they most often require action labels, that can be complex to obtain at scale. This motivates the learning of latent action models, that can learn an action space from videos alone. Our work addresses the problem of learning latent actions world models on in-the-wild videos, expanding the scope of existing works that focus on simple robotics simulations, video games, or manipulation data. While this allows us to capture richer actions, it also introduces challenges stemming from the video diversity, such as environmental noise, or the lack of a common embodiment across videos. To address some of the challenges, we discuss properties that actions should follow as well as relevant architectural choices and evaluations. We find that continuous, but constrained, latent actions are able to capture the complexity of actions from in-the-wild videos, something that the common vector quantization does not. We for example find that changes in the environment coming from agents, such as humans entering the room, can be transferred across videos. This highlights the capability of learning actions that are specific to in-the-wild videos. In the absence of a common embodiment across videos, we are mainly able to learn latent actions that become localized in space, relative to the camera. Nonetheless, we are able to train a controller that maps known actions to latent ones, allowing us to use latent actions as a universal interface and solve planning tasks with our world model with similar performance as action-conditioned baselines. Our analyses and experiments provide a step towards scaling latent action models to the real world.</description>

      <title>ChartComplete: A Taxonomy-based Inclusive Chart Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10462v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With advancements in deep learning (DL) and computer vision techniques, the field of chart understanding is evolving rapidly. In particular, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are proving to be efficient and accurate in understanding charts. To accurately measure the performance of MLLMs, the research community has developed multiple datasets to serve as benchmarks. By examining these datasets, we found that they are all limited to a small set of chart types. To bridge this gap, we propose the ChartComplete dataset. The dataset is based on a chart taxonomy borrowed from the visualization community, and it covers thirty different chart types. The dataset is a collection of classified chart images and does not include a learning signal. We present the ChartComplete dataset as is to the community to build upon it.</description>
