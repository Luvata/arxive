      <title>Revisiting Rogers' Paradox in the Context of Human-AI Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Humans learn about the world, and how to act in the world, in many ways: from individually conducting experiments to observing and reproducing others' behavior. Different learning strategies come with different costs and likelihoods of successfully learning more about the world. The choice that any one individual makes of how to learn can have an impact on the collective understanding of a whole population if people learn from each other. Alan Rogers developed simulations of a population of agents to study these network phenomena where agents could individually or socially learn amidst a dynamic, uncertain world and uncovered a confusing result: the availability of cheap social learning yielded no benefit to population fitness over individual learning. This paradox spawned decades of work trying to understand and uncover factors that foster the relative benefit of social learning that centuries of human behavior suggest exists. What happens in such network models now that humans can socially learn from AI systems that are themselves socially learning from us? We revisit Rogers' Paradox in the context of human-AI interaction to probe a simplified network of humans and AI systems learning together about an uncertain world. We propose and examine the impact of several learning strategies on the quality of the equilibrium of a society's 'collective world model'. We consider strategies that can be undertaken by various stakeholders involved in a single human-AI interaction: human, AI model builder, and society or regulators around the interaction. We then consider possible negative feedback loops that may arise from humans learning socially from AI: that learning from the AI may impact our own ability to learn about the world. We close with open directions into studying networks of human and AI systems that can be explored in enriched versions of our simulation framework.</description>

      <title>ColorGrid: A Multi-Agent Non-Stationary Environment for Goal Inference and Assistance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous agents' interactions with humans are increasingly focused on adapting to their changing preferences in order to improve assistance in real-world tasks. Effective agents must learn to accurately infer human goals, which are often hidden, to collaborate well. However, existing Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) environments lack the necessary attributes required to rigorously evaluate these agents' learning capabilities. To this end, we introduce ColorGrid, a novel MARL environment with customizable non-stationarity, asymmetry, and reward structure. We investigate the performance of Independent Proximal Policy Optimization (IPPO), a state-of-the-art (SOTA) MARL algorithm, in ColorGrid and find through extensive ablations that, particularly with simultaneous non-stationary and asymmetric goals between a ``leader'' agent representing a human and a ``follower'' assistant agent, ColorGrid is unsolved by IPPO. To support benchmarking future MARL algorithms, we release our environment code, model checkpoints, and trajectory visualizations at https://github.com/andreyrisukhin/ColorGrid.</description>

      <title>Distributionally Robust Policy Evaluation and Learning for Continuous Treatment with Observational Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using offline observational data for policy evaluation and learning allows decision-makers to evaluate and learn a policy that connects characteristics and interventions. Most existing literature has focused on either discrete treatment spaces or assumed no difference in the distributions between the policy-learning and policy-deployed environments. These restrict applications in many real-world scenarios where distribution shifts are present with continuous treatment. To overcome these challenges, this paper focuses on developing a distributionally robust policy under a continuous treatment setting. The proposed distributionally robust estimators are established using the Inverse Probability Weighting (IPW) method extended from the discrete one for policy evaluation and learning under continuous treatments. Specifically, we introduce a kernel function into the proposed IPW estimator to mitigate the exclusion of observations that can occur in the standard IPW method to continuous treatments. We then provide finite-sample analysis that guarantees the convergence of the proposed distributionally robust policy evaluation and learning estimators. The comprehensive experiments further verify the effectiveness of our approach when distribution shifts are present.</description>

      <title>MAPS: Advancing Multi-Modal Reasoning in Expert-Level Physical Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pre-trained on extensive text and image corpora, current Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLM) have shown strong capabilities in general visual reasoning tasks. However, their performance is still lacking in physical domains that require understanding diagrams with complex physical structures and quantitative analysis based on multi-modal information. To address this, we develop a new framework, named Multi-Modal Scientific Reasoning with Physics Perception and Simulation (MAPS) based on an MLLM. MAPS decomposes expert-level multi-modal reasoning task into physical diagram understanding via a Physical Perception Model (PPM) and reasoning with physical knowledge via a simulator. The PPM module is obtained by fine-tuning a visual language model using carefully designed synthetic data with paired physical diagrams and corresponding simulation language descriptions. At the inference stage, MAPS integrates the simulation language description of the input diagram provided by PPM and results obtained through a Chain-of-Simulation process with MLLM to derive the underlying rationale and the final answer. Validated using our collected college-level circuit analysis problems, MAPS significantly improves reasoning accuracy of MLLM and outperforms all existing models. The results confirm MAPS offers a promising direction for enhancing multi-modal scientific reasoning ability of MLLMs. We will release our code, model and dataset used for our experiments upon publishing of this paper.</description>

      <title>ML-SceGen: A Multi-level Scenario Generation Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current scientific research witnesses various attempts at applying Large Language Models for scenario generation but is inclined only to comprehensive or dangerous scenarios. In this paper, we seek to build a three-stage framework that not only lets users regain controllability over the generated scenarios but also generates comprehensive scenarios containing danger factors in uncontrolled intersection settings. In the first stage, LLM agents will contribute to translating the key components of the description of the expected scenarios into Functional Scenarios. For the second stage, we use Answer Set Programming (ASP) solver Clingo to help us generate comprehensive logical traffic within intersections. During the last stage, we use LLM to update relevant parameters to increase the critical level of the concrete scenario.</description>

      <title>Classical and Deep Reinforcement Learning Inventory Control Policies for Pharmaceutical Supply Chains with Perishability and Non-Stationarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study inventory control policies for pharmaceutical supply chains, addressing challenges such as perishability, yield uncertainty, and non-stationary demand, combined with batching constraints, lead times, and lost sales. Collaborating with Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS), we develop a realistic case study incorporating these factors and benchmark three policies--order-up-to (OUT), projected inventory level (PIL), and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) using the proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm--against a BMS baseline based on human expertise. We derive and validate bounds-based procedures for optimizing OUT and PIL policy parameters and propose a methodology for estimating projected inventory levels, which are also integrated into the DRL policy with demand forecasts to improve decision-making under non-stationarity. Compared to a human-driven policy, which avoids lost sales through higher holding costs, all three implemented policies achieve lower average costs but exhibit greater cost variability. While PIL demonstrates robust and consistent performance, OUT struggles under high lost sales costs, and PPO excels in complex and variable scenarios but requires significant computational effort. The findings suggest that while DRL shows potential, it does not outperform classical policies in all numerical experiments, highlighting 1) the need to integrate diverse policies to manage pharmaceutical challenges effectively, based on the current state-of-the-art, and 2) that practical problems in this domain seem to lack a single policy class that yields universally acceptable performance.</description>

      <title>Fine-Grained Appropriate Reliance: Human-AI Collaboration with a Multi-Step Transparent Decision Workflow for Complex Task Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, the rapid development of AI systems has brought about the benefits of intelligent services but also concerns about security and reliability. By fostering appropriate user reliance on an AI system, both complementary team performance and reduced human workload can be achieved. Previous empirical studies have extensively analyzed the impact of factors ranging from task, system, and human behavior on user trust and appropriate reliance in the context of one-step decision making. However, user reliance on AI systems in tasks with complex semantics that require multi-step workflows remains under-explored. Inspired by recent work on task decomposition with large language models, we propose to investigate the impact of a novel Multi-Step Transparent (MST) decision workflow on user reliance behaviors. We conducted an empirical study (N = 233) of AI-assisted decision making in composite fact-checking tasks (i.e., fact-checking tasks that entail multiple sub-fact verification steps). Our findings demonstrate that human-AI collaboration with an MST decision workflow can outperform one-step collaboration in specific contexts (e.g., when advice from an AI system is misleading). Further analysis of the appropriate reliance at fine-grained levels indicates that an MST decision workflow can be effective when users demonstrate a relatively high consideration of the intermediate steps. Our work highlights that there is no one-size-fits-all decision workflow that can help obtain optimal human-AI collaboration. Our insights help deepen the understanding of the role of decision workflows in facilitating appropriate reliance. We synthesize important implications for designing effective means to facilitate appropriate reliance on AI systems in composite tasks, positioning opportunities for the human-centered AI and broader HCI communities.</description>

      <title>Reasoning Language Models: A Blueprint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reasoning language models (RLMs), also known as Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), such as OpenAI's o1 and o3, DeepSeek-V3, and Alibaba's QwQ, have redefined AI's problem-solving capabilities by extending large language models (LLMs) with advanced reasoning mechanisms. Yet, their high costs, proprietary nature, and complex architectures - uniquely combining Reinforcement Learning (RL), search heuristics, and LLMs - present accessibility and scalability challenges. To address these, we propose a comprehensive blueprint that organizes RLM components into a modular framework, based on a survey and analysis of all RLM works. This blueprint incorporates diverse reasoning structures (chains, trees, graphs, and nested forms), reasoning strategies (e.g., Monte Carlo Tree Search, Beam Search), RL concepts (policy, value models and others), and supervision schemes (Output-Based and Process-Based Supervision). We also provide detailed mathematical formulations and algorithmic specifications to simplify RLM implementation. By showing how schemes like LLaMA-Berry, QwQ, Journey Learning, and Graph of Thoughts fit as special cases, we demonstrate the blueprint's versatility and unifying potential. To illustrate its utility, we introduce x1, a modular implementation for rapid RLM prototyping and experimentation. Using x1 and a literature review, we provide key insights, such as multi-phase training for policy and value models, and the importance of familiar training distributions. Finally, we outline how RLMs can integrate with a broader LLM ecosystem, including tools and databases. Our work demystifies RLM construction, democratizes advanced reasoning capabilities, and fosters innovation, aiming to mitigate the gap between "rich AI" and "poor AI" by lowering barriers to RLM development and experimentation.</description>

      <title>Agent-R: Training Language Model Agents to Reflect via Iterative Self-Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) agents are increasingly pivotal for addressing complex tasks in interactive environments. Existing work mainly focuses on enhancing performance through behavior cloning from stronger experts, yet such approaches often falter in real-world applications, mainly due to the inability to recover from errors. However, step-level critique data is difficult and expensive to collect. Automating and dynamically constructing self-critique datasets is thus crucial to empowering models with intelligent agent capabilities. In this work, we propose an iterative self-training framework, Agent-R, that enables language Agent to Reflect on the fly. Unlike traditional methods that reward or penalize actions based on correctness, Agent-R leverages MCTS to construct training data that recover correct trajectories from erroneous ones. A key challenge of agent reflection lies in the necessity for timely revision rather than waiting until the end of a rollout. To address this, we introduce a model-guided critique construction mechanism: the actor model identifies the first error step (within its current capability) in a failed trajectory. Starting from it, we splice it with the adjacent correct path, which shares the same parent node in the tree. This strategy enables the model to learn reflection based on its current policy, therefore yielding better learning efficiency. To further explore the scalability of this self-improvement paradigm, we investigate iterative refinement of both error correction capabilities and dataset construction. Our findings demonstrate that Agent-R continuously improves the model's ability to recover from errors and enables timely error correction. Experiments on three interactive environments show that Agent-R effectively equips agents to correct erroneous actions while avoiding loops, achieving superior performance compared to baseline methods (+5.59%).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work demonstrated the existence of critical flaws in the current use of Shapley values in explainable AI (XAI), i.e. the so-called SHAP scores. These flaws are significant in that the scores provided to a human decision-maker can be misleading. Although these negative results might appear to indicate that Shapley values ought not be used in XAI, this paper argues otherwise. Concretely, this paper proposes a novel definition of SHAP scores that overcomes existing flaws. Furthermore, the paper outlines a practically efficient solution for the rigorous estimation of the novel SHAP scores. Preliminary experimental results confirm our claims, and further underscore the flaws of the current SHAP scores.</description>

      <title>Decomposing Interventional Causality into Synergistic, Redundant, and Unique Components</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for decomposing interventional causal effects into synergistic, redundant, and unique components, building on the intuition of Partial Information Decomposition (PID) and the principle of M\"obius inversion. While recent work has explored a similar decomposition of an observational measure, we argue that a proper causal decomposition must be interventional in nature. We develop a mathematical approach that systematically quantifies how causal power is distributed among variables in a system, using a recently derived closed-form expression for the M\"obius function of the redundancy lattice. The formalism is then illustrated by decomposing the causal power in logic gates, cellular automata, and chemical reaction networks. Our results reveal how the distribution of causal power can be context- and parameter-dependent. This decomposition provides new insights into complex systems by revealing how causal influences are shared and combined among multiple variables, with potential applications ranging from attribution of responsibility in legal or AI systems, to the analysis of biological networks or climate models.</description>

      <title>The impact of intrinsic rewards on exploration in Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the open challenges in Reinforcement Learning is the hard exploration problem in sparse reward environments. Various types of intrinsic rewards have been proposed to address this challenge by pushing towards diversity. This diversity might be imposed at different levels, favouring the agent to explore different states, policies or behaviours (State, Policy and Skill level diversity, respectively). However, the impact of diversity on the agent's behaviour remains unclear. In this work, we aim to fill this gap by studying the effect of different levels of diversity imposed by intrinsic rewards on the exploration patterns of RL agents. We select four intrinsic rewards (State Count, Intrinsic Curiosity Module (ICM), Maximum Entropy, and Diversity is all you need (DIAYN)), each pushing for a different diversity level. We conduct an empirical study on MiniGrid environment to compare their impact on exploration considering various metrics related to the agent's exploration, namely: episodic return, observation coverage, agent's position coverage, policy entropy, and timeframes to reach the sparse reward. The main outcome of the study is that State Count leads to the best exploration performance in the case of low-dimensional observations. However, in the case of RGB observations, the performance of State Count is highly degraded mostly due to representation learning challenges. Conversely, Maximum Entropy is less impacted, resulting in a more robust exploration, despite being not always optimal. Lastly, our empirical study revealed that learning diverse skills with DIAYN, often linked to improved robustness and generalisation, does not promote exploration in MiniGrid environments. This is because: i) learning the skill space itself can be challenging, and ii) exploration within the skill space prioritises differentiating between behaviours rather than achieving uniform state visitation.</description>

      <title>SR-FoT: A Syllogistic-Reasoning Framework of Thought for Large Language Models Tackling Knowledge-based Reasoning Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deductive reasoning is a crucial logical capability that assists us in solving complex problems based on existing knowledge. Although augmented by Chain-of-Thought prompts, Large Language Models (LLMs) might not follow the correct reasoning paths. Enhancing the deductive reasoning abilities of LLMs, and leveraging their extensive built-in knowledge for various reasoning tasks, remains an open question. Attempting to mimic the human deductive reasoning paradigm, we propose a multi-stage Syllogistic-Reasoning Framework of Thought (SR-FoT) that enables LLMs to perform syllogistic deductive reasoning to handle complex knowledge-based reasoning tasks. Our SR-FoT begins by interpreting the question and then uses the interpretation and the original question to propose a suitable major premise. It proceeds by generating and answering minor premise questions in two stages to match the minor premises. Finally, it guides LLMs to use the previously generated major and minor premises to perform syllogistic deductive reasoning to derive the answer to the original question. Extensive and thorough experiments on knowledge-based reasoning tasks have demonstrated the effectiveness and advantages of our SR-FoT.</description>

      <title>Episodic memory in AI agents poses risks that should be studied and mitigated</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most current AI models have little ability to store and later retrieve a record or representation of what they do. In human cognition, episodic memories play an important role in both recall of the past as well as planning for the future. The ability to form and use episodic memories would similarly enable a broad range of improved capabilities in an AI agent that interacts with and takes actions in the world. Researchers have begun directing more attention to developing memory abilities in AI models. It is therefore likely that models with such capability will be become widespread in the near future. This could in some ways contribute to making such AI agents safer by enabling users to better monitor, understand, and control their actions. However, as a new capability with wide applications, we argue that it will also introduce significant new risks that researchers should begin to study and address. We outline these risks and benefits and propose four principles to guide the development of episodic memory capabilities so that these will enhance, rather than undermine, the effort to keep AI safe and trustworthy.</description>

      <title>Policy-Adaptable Methods For Resolving Normative Conflicts Through Argumentation and Graph Colouring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a multi-agent system, one may choose to govern the behaviour of an agent by imposing norms, which act as guidelines for how agents should act either all of the time or in given situations. However, imposing multiple norms on one or more agents may result in situations where these norms conflict over how the agent should behave. In any system with normative conflicts (such as safe reinforcement models or systems which monitor safety protocols), one must decide which norms should be followed such that the most important and most relevant norms are maintained. We introduce a new method for resolving normative conflicts through argumentation and graph colouring which is compatible with a variety of normative conflict resolution policies. We prove that this method always creates an admissible set of arguments under argumentation semantics, meaning that it produces coherent outputs. We also introduce more robust variants of this method, each building upon their predecessor to create a superior output, and we include further mathematical proof of their coherence. Our most advanced variant uses the existing concept of curtailment, where one norm may supersede another without fully eliminating it. The methods we introduce are all compatible with various pre-existing policies for resolving normative conflicts. Empirical evaluations are also performed to compare our algorithms to each other and to others in existing literature.</description>

      <title>Systematic Abductive Reasoning via Diverse Relation Representations in Vector-symbolic Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In abstract visual reasoning, monolithic deep learning models suffer from limited interpretability and generalization, while existing neuro-symbolic approaches fall short in capturing the diversity and systematicity of attributes and relation representations. To address these challenges, we propose a Systematic Abductive Reasoning model with diverse relation representations (Rel-SAR) in Vector-symbolic Architecture (VSA) to solve Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPM). To derive attribute representations with symbolic reasoning potential, we introduce not only various types of atomic vectors that represent numeric, periodic and logical semantics, but also the structured high-dimentional representation (SHDR) for the overall Grid component. For systematic reasoning, we propose novel numerical and logical relation functions and perform rule abduction and execution in a unified framework that integrates these relation representations. Experimental results demonstrate that Rel-SAR achieves significant improvement on RPM tasks and exhibits robust out-of-distribution generalization. Rel-SAR leverages the synergy between HD attribute representations and symbolic reasoning to achieve systematic abductive reasoning with both interpretable and computable semantics.</description>

      <title>Bridging the Communication Gap: Evaluating AI Labeling Practices for Trustworthy AI Development</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes integral to economy and society, communication gaps between developers, users, and stakeholders hinder trust and informed decision-making. High-level AI labels, inspired by frameworks like EU energy labels, have been proposed to make the properties of AI models more transparent. Without requiring deep technical expertise, they can inform on the trade-off between predictive performance and resource efficiency. However, the practical benefits and limitations of AI labeling remain underexplored. This study evaluates AI labeling through qualitative interviews along four key research questions. Based on thematic analysis and inductive coding, we found a broad range of practitioners to be interested in AI labeling (RQ1). They see benefits for alleviating communication gaps and aiding non-expert decision-makers, however limitations, misunderstandings, and suggestions for improvement were also discussed (RQ2). Compared to other reporting formats, interviewees positively evaluated the reduced complexity of labels, increasing overall comprehensibility (RQ3). Trust was influenced most by usability and the credibility of the responsible labeling authority, with mixed preferences for self-certification versus third-party certification (RQ4). Our Insights highlight that AI labels pose a trade-off between simplicity and complexity, which could be resolved by developing customizable and interactive labeling frameworks to address diverse user needs. Transparent labeling of resource efficiency also nudged interviewee priorities towards paying more attention to sustainability aspects during AI development. This study validates AI labels as a valuable tool for enhancing trust and communication in AI, offering actionable guidelines for their refinement and standardization.</description>

      <title>Make Full Use of Testing Information: An Integrated Accelerated Testing and Evaluation Method for Autonomous Driving Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Testing and evaluation is an important step before the large-scale application of the autonomous driving systems (ADSs). Based on the three level of scenario abstraction theory, a testing can be performed within a logical scenario, followed by an evaluation stage which is inputted with the testing results of each concrete scenario generated from the logical parameter space. During the above process, abundant testing information is produced which is beneficial for comprehensive and accurate evaluations. To make full use of testing information, this paper proposes an Integrated accelerated Testing and Evaluation Method (ITEM). Based on a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) paradigm and a dual surrogates testing framework proposed in our previous work, this paper applies the intermediate information (i.e., the tree structure, including the affiliation of each historical sampled point with the subspaces and the parent-child relationship between subspaces) generated during the testing stage into the evaluation stage to achieve accurate hazardous domain identification. Moreover, to better serve this purpose, the UCB calculation method is improved to allow the search algorithm to focus more on the hazardous domain boundaries. Further, a stopping condition is constructed based on the convergence of the search algorithm. Ablation and comparative experiments are then conducted to verify the effectiveness of the improvements and the superiority of the proposed method. The experimental results show that ITEM could well identify the hazardous domains in both low- and high-dimensional cases, regardless of the shape of the hazardous domains, indicating its generality and potential for the safety evaluation of ADSs.</description>

      <title>Bridging Visualization and Optimization: Multimodal Large Language Models on Graph-Structured Combinatorial Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph-structured combinatorial challenges are inherently difficult due to their nonlinear and intricate nature, often rendering traditional computational methods ineffective or expensive. However, these challenges can be more naturally tackled by humans through visual representations that harness our innate ability for spatial reasoning. In this study, we propose transforming graphs into images to preserve their higher-order structural features accurately, revolutionizing the representation used in solving graph-structured combinatorial tasks. This approach allows machines to emulate human-like processing in addressing complex combinatorial challenges. By combining the innovative paradigm powered by multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with simple search techniques, we aim to develop a novel and effective framework for tackling such problems. Our investigation into MLLMs spanned a variety of graph-based tasks, from combinatorial problems like influence maximization to sequential decision-making in network dismantling, as well as addressing six fundamental graph-related issues. Our findings demonstrate that MLLMs exhibit exceptional spatial intelligence and a distinctive capability for handling these problems, significantly advancing the potential for machines to comprehend and analyze graph-structured data with a depth and intuition akin to human cognition. These results also imply that integrating MLLMs with simple optimization strategies could form a novel and efficient approach for navigating graph-structured combinatorial challenges without complex derivations, computationally demanding training and fine-tuning.</description>

      <title>UI-TARS: Pioneering Automated GUI Interaction with Native Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces UI-TARS, a native GUI agent model that solely perceives the screenshots as input and performs human-like interactions (e.g., keyboard and mouse operations). Unlike prevailing agent frameworks that depend on heavily wrapped commercial models (e.g., GPT-4o) with expert-crafted prompts and workflows, UI-TARS is an end-to-end model that outperforms these sophisticated frameworks. Experiments demonstrate its superior performance: UI-TARS achieves SOTA performance in 10+ GUI agent benchmarks evaluating perception, grounding, and GUI task execution. Notably, in the OSWorld benchmark, UI-TARS achieves scores of 24.6 with 50 steps and 22.7 with 15 steps, outperforming Claude (22.0 and 14.9 respectively). In AndroidWorld, UI-TARS achieves 46.6, surpassing GPT-4o (34.5). UI-TARS incorporates several key innovations: (1) Enhanced Perception: leveraging a large-scale dataset of GUI screenshots for context-aware understanding of UI elements and precise captioning; (2) Unified Action Modeling, which standardizes actions into a unified space across platforms and achieves precise grounding and interaction through large-scale action traces; (3) System-2 Reasoning, which incorporates deliberate reasoning into multi-step decision making, involving multiple reasoning patterns such as task decomposition, reflection thinking, milestone recognition, etc. (4) Iterative Training with Reflective Online Traces, which addresses the data bottleneck by automatically collecting, filtering, and reflectively refining new interaction traces on hundreds of virtual machines. Through iterative training and reflection tuning, UI-TARS continuously learns from its mistakes and adapts to unforeseen situations with minimal human intervention. We also analyze the evolution path of GUI agents to guide the further development of this domain.</description>

      <title>On the Impact of Black-box Deployment Strategies for Edge AI on Latency and Model Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deciding what combination of operators to use across the Edge AI tiers to achieve specific latency and model performance requirements is an open question for MLOps engineers. This study aims to empirically assess the accuracy vs inference time trade-off of different black-box Edge AI deployment strategies, i.e., combinations of deployment operators and deployment tiers. In this paper, we conduct inference experiments involving 3 deployment operators (i.e., Partitioning, Quantization, Early Exit), 3 deployment tiers (i.e., Mobile, Edge, Cloud) and their combinations on four widely used Computer-Vision models to investigate the optimal strategies from the point of view of MLOps developers. Our findings suggest that Edge deployment using the hybrid Quantization + Early Exit operator could be preferred over non-hybrid operators (Quantization/Early Exit on Edge, Partition on Mobile-Edge) when faster latency is a concern at medium accuracy loss. However, when minimizing accuracy loss is a concern, MLOps engineers should prefer using only a Quantization operator on edge at a latency reduction or increase, respectively over the Early Exit/Partition (on edge/mobile-edge) and Quantized Early Exit (on edge) operators. In scenarios constrained by Mobile CPU/RAM resources, a preference for Partitioning across mobile and edge tiers is observed over mobile deployment. For models with smaller input data samples (such as FCN), a network-constrained cloud deployment can also be a better alternative than Mobile/Edge deployment and Partitioning strategies. For models with large input data samples (ResNet, ResNext, DUC), an edge tier having higher network/computational capabilities than Cloud/Mobile can be a more viable option than Partitioning and Mobile/Cloud deployment strategies.</description>

      <title>Disentangled Interpretable Representation for Efficient Long-term Time Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Industry 5.0 introduces new challenges for Long-term Time Series Forecasting (LTSF), characterized by high-dimensional, high-resolution data and high-stakes application scenarios. Against this backdrop, developing efficient and interpretable models for LTSF becomes a key challenge. Existing deep learning and linear models often suffer from excessive parameter complexity and lack intuitive interpretability. To address these issues, we propose DiPE-Linear, a Disentangled interpretable Parameter-Efficient Linear network. DiPE-Linear incorporates three temporal components: Static Frequential Attention (SFA), Static Temporal Attention (STA), and Independent Frequential Mapping (IFM). These components alternate between learning in the frequency and time domains to achieve disentangled interpretability. The decomposed model structure reduces parameter complexity from quadratic in fully connected networks (FCs) to linear and computational complexity from quadratic to log-linear. Additionally, a Low-Rank Weight Sharing policy enhances the model's ability to handle multivariate series. Despite operating within a subspace of FCs with limited expressive capacity, DiPE-Linear demonstrates comparable or superior performance to both FCs and nonlinear models across multiple open-source and real-world LTSF datasets, validating the effectiveness of its sophisticatedly designed structure. The combination of efficiency, accuracy, and interpretability makes DiPE-Linear a strong candidate for advancing LTSF in both research and real-world applications. The source code is available at https://github.com/wintertee/DiPE-Linear.</description>

      <title>Integrating Artificial Open Generative Artificial Intelligence into Software Supply Chain Security</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While new technologies emerge, human errors always looming. Software supply chain is increasingly complex and intertwined, the security of a service has become paramount to ensuring the integrity of products, safeguarding data privacy, and maintaining operational continuity. In this work, we conducted experiments on the promising open Large Language Models (LLMs) into two main software security challenges: source code language errors and deprecated code, with a focus on their potential to replace conventional static and dynamic security scanners that rely on predefined rules and patterns. Our findings suggest that while LLMs present some unexpected results, they also encounter significant limitations, particularly in memory complexity and the management of new and unfamiliar data patterns. Despite these challenges, the proactive application of LLMs, coupled with extensive security databases and continuous updates, holds the potential to fortify Software Supply Chain (SSC) processes against emerging threats.</description>

      <title>Can LLMs Identify Gaps and Misconceptions in Students' Code Explanations?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates various approaches using Large Language Models (LLMs) to identify gaps and misconceptions in students' self-explanations of specific instructional material, in our case explanations of code examples. This research is a part of our larger effort to automate the assessment of students' freely generated responses, focusing specifically on their self-explanations of code examples during activities related to code comprehension. In this work, we experiment with zero-shot prompting, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), and preference alignment of LLMs to identify gaps in students' self-explanation. With simple prompting, GPT-4 consistently outperformed LLaMA3 and Mistral in identifying gaps and misconceptions, as confirmed by human evaluations. Additionally, our results suggest that fine-tuned large language models are more effective at identifying gaps in students' explanations compared to zero-shot and few-shot prompting techniques. Furthermore, our findings show that the preference optimization approach using Odds Ratio Preference Optimization (ORPO) outperforms SFT in identifying gaps and misconceptions in students' code explanations.</description>

      <title>Participatory Assessment of Large Language Model Applications in an Academic Medical Center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising performance in healthcare-related applications, their deployment in the medical domain poses unique challenges of ethical, regulatory, and technical nature. In this study, we employ a systematic participatory approach to investigate the needs and expectations regarding clinical applications of LLMs at Lausanne University Hospital, an academic medical center in Switzerland. Having identified potential LLM use-cases in collaboration with thirty stakeholders, including clinical staff across 11 departments as well nursing and patient representatives, we assess the current feasibility of these use-cases taking into account the regulatory frameworks, data protection regulation, bias, hallucinations, and deployment constraints. This study provides a framework for a participatory approach to identifying institutional needs with respect to introducing advanced technologies into healthcare practice, and a realistic analysis of the technology readiness level of LLMs for medical applications, highlighting the issues that would need to be overcome LLMs in healthcare to be ethical, and regulatory compliant.</description>

      <title>GTDE: Grouped Training with Decentralized Execution for Multi-agent Actor-Critic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has given rise to diverse training paradigms to learn the policies of each agent in the multi-agent system. The paradigms of decentralized training and execution (DTDE) and centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) have been proposed and widely applied. However, as the number of agents increases, the inherent limitations of these frameworks significantly degrade the performance metrics, such as win rate, total reward, etc. To reduce the influence of the increasing number of agents on the performance metrics, we propose a novel training paradigm of grouped training decentralized execution (GTDE). This framework eliminates the need for a centralized module and relies solely on local information, effectively meeting the training requirements of large-scale multi-agent systems. Specifically, we first introduce an adaptive grouping module, which divides each agent into different groups based on their observation history. To implement end-to-end training, GTDE uses Gumbel-Sigmoid for efficient point-to-point sampling on the grouping distribution while ensuring gradient backpropagation. To adapt to the uncertainty in the number of members in a group, two methods are used to implement a group information aggregation module that merges member information within the group. Empirical results show that in a cooperative environment with 495 agents, GTDE increased the total reward by an average of 382\% compared to the baseline. In a competitive environment with 64 agents, GTDE achieved a 100\% win rate against the baseline.</description>

      <title>The Potential of Answer Classes in Large-scale Written Computer-Science Exams -- Vol. 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Students' answers to tasks provide a valuable source of information in teaching as they result from applying cognitive processes to a learning content addressed in the task. Due to steadily increasing course sizes, analyzing student answers is frequently the only means of obtaining evidence about student performance. However, in many cases, resources are limited, and when evaluating exams, the focus is solely on identifying correct or incorrect answers. This overlooks the value of analyzing incorrect answers, which can help improve teaching strategies or identify misconceptions to be addressed in the next cohort.
  In teacher training for secondary education, assessment guidelines are mandatory for every exam, including anticipated errors and misconceptions. We applied this concept to a university exam with 462 students and 41 tasks. For each task, the instructors developed answer classes -- classes of expected responses, to which student answers were mapped during the exam correction process. The experiment resulted in a shift in mindset among the tutors and instructors responsible for the course: after initially having great reservations about whether the significant additional effort would yield an appropriate benefit, the procedure was subsequently found to be extremely valuable.
  The concept presented, and the experience gained from the experiment were cast into a system with which it is possible to correct paper-based exams on the basis of answer classes. This updated version of the paper provides an overview and new potential in the course of using the digital version of the approach.</description>

      <title>Harnessing Large Language Models for Mental Health: Opportunities, Challenges, and Ethical Considerations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming mental health care by enhancing accessibility, personalization, and efficiency in therapeutic interventions. These AI-driven tools empower mental health professionals with real-time support, improved data integration, and the ability to encourage care-seeking behaviors, particularly in underserved communities. By harnessing LLMs, practitioners can deliver more empathetic, tailored, and effective support, addressing longstanding gaps in mental health service provision. However, their implementation comes with significant challenges and ethical concerns. Performance limitations, data privacy risks, biased outputs, and the potential for generating misleading information underscore the critical need for stringent ethical guidelines and robust evaluation mechanisms. The sensitive nature of mental health data further necessitates meticulous safeguards to protect patient rights and ensure equitable access to AI-driven care. Proponents argue that LLMs have the potential to democratize mental health resources, while critics warn of risks such as misuse and the diminishment of human connection in therapy. Achieving a balance between innovation and ethical responsibility is imperative. This paper examines the transformative potential of LLMs in mental health care, highlights the associated technical and ethical complexities, and advocates for a collaborative, multidisciplinary approach to ensure these advancements align with the goal of providing compassionate, equitable, and effective mental health support.</description>

      <title>What we learned while automating bias detection in AI hiring systems for compliance with NYC Local Law 144</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since July 5, 2023, New York City's Local Law 144 requires employers to conduct independent bias audits for any automated employment decision tools (AEDTs) used in hiring processes. The law outlines a minimum set of bias tests that AI developers and implementers must perform to ensure compliance. Over the past few months, we have collected and analyzed audits conducted under this law, identified best practices, and developed a software tool to streamline employer compliance. Our tool, ITACA_144, tailors our broader bias auditing framework to meet the specific requirements of Local Law 144. While automating these legal mandates, we identified several critical challenges that merit attention to ensure AI bias regulations and audit methodologies are both effective and practical. This document presents the insights gained from automating compliance with NYC Local Law 144. It aims to support other cities and states in crafting similar legislation while addressing the limitations of the NYC framework. The discussion focuses on key areas including data requirements, demographic inclusiveness, impact ratios, effective bias, metrics, and data reliability.</description>

      <title>DK-PRACTICE: An Intelligent Educational Platform for Personalized Learning Content Recommendations Based on Students Knowledge State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study introduces DK-PRACTICE (Dynamic Knowledge Prediction and Educational Content Recommendation System), an intelligent online platform that leverages machine learning to provide personalized learning recommendations based on student knowledge state. Students participate in a short, adaptive assessment using the question-and-answer method regarding key concepts in a specific knowledge domain. The system dynamically selects the next question for each student based on the correctness and accuracy of their previous answers. After the test is completed, DK-PRACTICE analyzes students' interaction history to recommend learning materials to empower the student's knowledge state in identified knowledge gaps. Both question selection and learning material recommendations are based on machine learning models trained using anonymized data from a real learning environment. To provide self-assessment and monitor learning progress, DK-PRACTICE allows students to take two tests: one pre-teaching and one post-teaching. After each test, a report is generated with detailed results. In addition, the platform offers functions to visualize learning progress based on recorded test statistics. DK-PRACTICE promotes adaptive and personalized learning by empowering students with self-assessment capabilities and providing instructors with valuable information about students' knowledge levels. DK-PRACTICE can be extended to various educational environments and knowledge domains, provided the necessary data is available according to the educational topics. A subsequent paper will present the methodology for the experimental application and evaluation of the platform.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development and deployment of chatbot technology, while spanning decades and employing different techniques, require innovative frameworks to understand and interrogate their functionality and implications. A mere technocentric account of the evolution of chatbot technology does not fully illuminate how conversational systems are embedded in societal dynamics. This study presents a structured examination of chatbots across three societal dimensions, highlighting their roles as objects of scientific research, commercial instruments, and agents of intimate interaction. Through furnishing a dimensional framework for the evolution of conversational systems, from laboratories to marketplaces to private lives, this article contributes to the wider scholarly inquiry of chatbot technology and its impact in lived human experiences and dynamics.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Microscopy Experiments through Large Language Model Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has accelerated the development of self-driving laboratories (SDLs) for materials research. Despite their transformative potential, current SDL implementations rely on rigid, predefined protocols that limit their adaptability to dynamic experimental scenarios across different labs. A significant challenge persists in measuring how effectively AI agents can replicate the adaptive decision-making and experimental intuition of expert scientists. Here, we introduce AILA (Artificially Intelligent Lab Assistant), a framework that automates atomic force microscopy (AFM) through LLM-driven agents. Using AFM as an experimental testbed, we develop AFMBench-a comprehensive evaluation suite that challenges AI agents based on language models like GPT-4o and GPT-3.5 to perform tasks spanning the scientific workflow: from experimental design to results analysis. Our systematic assessment shows that state-of-the-art language models struggle even with basic tasks such as documentation retrieval, leading to a significant decline in performance in multi-agent coordination scenarios. Further, we observe that LLMs exhibit a tendency to not adhere to instructions or even divagate to additional tasks beyond the original request, raising serious concerns regarding safety alignment aspects of AI agents for SDLs. Finally, we demonstrate the application of AILA on increasingly complex experiments open-ended experiments: automated AFM calibration, high-resolution feature detection, and mechanical property measurement. Our findings emphasize the necessity for stringent benchmarking protocols before deploying AI agents as laboratory assistants across scientific disciplines.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Sum: Unlocking AI Agents Potential Through Market Forces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emergence of Large Language Models has fundamentally transformed the capabilities of AI agents, enabling a new class of autonomous agents capable of interacting with their environment through dynamic code generation and execution. These agents possess the theoretical capacity to operate as independent economic actors within digital markets, offering unprecedented potential for value creation through their distinct advantages in operational continuity, perfect replication, and distributed learning capabilities. However, contemporary digital infrastructure, architected primarily for human interaction, presents significant barriers to their participation.
  This work presents a systematic analysis of the infrastructure requirements necessary for AI agents to function as autonomous participants in digital markets. We examine four key areas - identity and authorization, service discovery, interfaces, and payment systems - to show how existing infrastructure actively impedes agent participation. We argue that addressing these infrastructure challenges represents more than a technical imperative; it constitutes a fundamental step toward enabling new forms of economic organization. Much as traditional markets enable human intelligence to coordinate complex activities beyond individual capability, markets incorporating AI agents could dramatically enhance economic efficiency through continuous operation, perfect information sharing, and rapid adaptation to changing conditions. The infrastructure challenges identified in this work represent key barriers to realizing this potential.</description>

      <title>Towards an Environmental Ethics of Artificial Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, much research has been dedicated to uncovering the environmental impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI), showing that training and deploying AI systems require large amounts of energy and resources, and the outcomes of AI may lead to decisions and actions that may negatively impact the environment. This new knowledge raises new ethical questions, such as: When is it (un)justifiable to develop an AI system, and how to make design choices, considering its environmental impact? However, so far, the environmental impact of AI has largely escaped ethical scrutiny, as AI ethics tends to focus strongly on themes such as transparency, privacy, safety, responsibility, and bias. Considering the environmental impact of AI from an ethical perspective expands the scope of AI ethics beyond an anthropocentric focus towards including more-than-human actors such as animals and ecosystems. This paper explores the ethical implications of the environmental impact of AI for designing AI systems by drawing on environmental justice literature, in which three categories of justice are distinguished, referring to three elements that can be unjust: the distribution of benefits and burdens (distributive justice), decision-making procedures (procedural justice), and institutionalized social norms (justice as recognition). Based on these tenets of justice, we outline criteria for developing environmentally just AI systems, given their ecological impact.</description>

      <title>Developing an Ontology for AI Act Fundamental Rights Impact Assessments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recently published EU Artificial Intelligence Act (AI Act) is a landmark regulation that regulates the use of AI technologies. One of its novel requirements is the obligation to conduct a Fundamental Rights Impact Assessment (FRIA), where organisations in the role of deployers must assess the risks of their AI system regarding health, safety, and fundamental rights. Another novelty in the AI Act is the requirement to create a questionnaire and an automated tool to support organisations in their FRIA obligations. Such automated tools will require a machine-readable form of information involved within the FRIA process, and additionally also require machine-readable documentation to enable further compliance tools to be created. In this article, we present our novel representation of the FRIA as an ontology based on semantic web standards. Our work builds upon the existing state of the art, notably the Data Privacy Vocabulary (DPV), where similar works have been established to create tools for GDPR's Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIA) and other obligations. Through our ontology, we enable the creation and management of FRIA, and the use of automated tool in its various steps.</description>

      <title>Towards General Purpose Robots at Scale: Lifelong Learning and Learning to Use Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The widespread success of artificial intelligence in fields like natural language processing and computer vision has not yet fully transferred to robotics, where progress is hindered by the lack of large-scale training data and the complexity of real-world tasks. To address this, many robot learning researchers are pushing to get robots deployed at scale in everyday unstructured environments like our homes to initiate a data flywheel. While current robot learning systems are effective for certain short-horizon tasks, they are not designed to autonomously operate over long time horizons in unstructured environments. This thesis focuses on addressing two key challenges for robots operating over long time horizons: memory and lifelong learning.
  We propose two novel methods to advance these capabilities. First, we introduce t-DGR, a trajectory-based deep generative replay method that achieves state-of-the-art performance on Continual World benchmarks, advancing lifelong learning. Second, we develop a framework that leverages human demonstrations to teach agents effective memory utilization, improving learning efficiency and success rates on Memory Gym tasks. Finally, we discuss future directions for achieving the lifelong learning and memory capabilities necessary for robots to function at scale in real-world settings.</description>

      <title>AI-Powered Urban Transportation Digital Twin: Methods and Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a survey paper on methods and applications of digital twins (DT) for urban traffic management. While the majority of studies on the DT focus on its "eyes," which is the emerging sensing and perception like object detection and tracking, what really distinguishes the DT from a traditional simulator lies in its ``brain," the prediction and decision making capabilities of extracting patterns and making informed decisions from what has been seen and perceived. In order to add values to urban transportation management, DTs need to be powered by artificial intelligence and complement with low-latency high-bandwidth sensing and networking technologies. We will first review the DT pipeline leveraging cyberphysical systems and propose our DT architecture deployed on a real-world testbed in New York City. This survey paper can be a pointer to help researchers and practitioners identify challenges and opportunities for the development of DTs; a bridge to initiate conversations across disciplines; and a road map to exploiting potentials of DTs for diverse urban transportation applications.</description>

      <title>Cooperative Search and Track of Rogue Drones using Multiagent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work considers the problem of intercepting rogue drones targeting sensitive critical infrastructure facilities. While current interception technologies focus mainly on the jamming/spoofing tasks, the challenges of effectively locating and tracking rogue drones have not received adequate attention. Solving this problem and integrating with recently proposed interception techniques will enable a holistic system that can reliably detect, track, and neutralize rogue drones. Specifically, this work considers a team of pursuer UAVs that can search, detect, and track multiple rogue drones over a sensitive facility. The joint search and track problem is addressed through a novel multiagent reinforcement learning scheme to optimize the agent mobility control actions that maximize the number of rogue drones detected and tracked. The performance of the proposed system is investigated under realistic settings through extensive simulation experiments with varying number of agents demonstrating both its performance and scalability.</description>

      <title>CodEv: An Automated Grading Framework Leveraging Large Language Models for Consistent and Constructive Feedback</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Grading programming assignments is crucial for guiding students to improve their programming skills and coding styles. This study presents an automated grading framework, CodEv, which leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to provide consistent and constructive feedback. We incorporate Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting techniques to enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs and ensure that the grading is aligned with human evaluation. Our framework also integrates LLM ensembles to improve the accuracy and consistency of scores, along with agreement tests to deliver reliable feedback and code review comments. The results demonstrate that the framework can yield grading results comparable to human evaluators, by using smaller LLMs. Evaluation and consistency tests of the LLMs further validate our approach, confirming the reliability of the generated scores and feedback.</description>

      <title>Towards Lightweight Time Series Forecasting: a Patch-wise Transformer with Weak Data Enriching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Patch-wise Transformer based time series forecasting achieves superior accuracy. However, this superiority relies heavily on intricate model design with massive parameters, rendering both training and inference expensive, thus preventing their deployments on edge devices with limited resources and low latency requirements. In addition, existing methods often work in an autoregressive manner, which take into account only historical values, but ignore valuable, easy-to-obtain context information, such as weather forecasts, date and time of day. To contend with the two limitations, we propose LiPFormer, a novel Lightweight Patch-wise Transformer with weak data enriching. First, to simplify the Transformer backbone, LiPFormer employs a novel lightweight cross-patch attention and a linear transformation-based attention to eliminate Layer Normalization and Feed Forward Network, two heavy components in existing Transformers. Second, we propose a lightweight, weak data enriching module to provide additional, valuable weak supervision to the training. It enhances forecasting accuracy without significantly increasing model complexity as it does not involve expensive, human-labeling but using easily accessible context information. This facilitates the weak data enriching to plug-and-play on existing models. Extensive experiments on nine benchmark time series datasets demonstrate that LiPFormer outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy, while significantly reducing parameter scale, training duration, and GPU memory usage. Deployment on an edge device reveals that LiPFormer takes only 1/3 inference time compared to classic Transformers. In addition, we demonstrate that the weak data enriching can integrate seamlessly into various Transformer based models to enhance their accuracy, suggesting its generality.</description>

      <title>Uncovering Bias in Foundation Models: Impact, Testing, Harm, and Mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bias in Foundation Models (FMs) - trained on vast datasets spanning societal and historical knowledge - poses significant challenges for fairness and equity across fields such as healthcare, education, and finance. These biases, rooted in the overrepresentation of stereotypes and societal inequalities in training data, exacerbate real-world discrimination, reinforce harmful stereotypes, and erode trust in AI systems. To address this, we introduce Trident Probe Testing (TriProTesting), a systematic testing method that detects explicit and implicit biases using semantically designed probes. Here we show that FMs, including CLIP, ALIGN, BridgeTower, and OWLv2, demonstrate pervasive biases across single and mixed social attributes (gender, race, age, and occupation). Notably, we uncover mixed biases when social attributes are combined, such as gender x race, gender x age, and gender x occupation, revealing deeper layers of discrimination. We further propose Adaptive Logit Adjustment (AdaLogAdjustment), a post-processing technique that dynamically redistributes probability power to mitigate these biases effectively, achieving significant improvements in fairness without retraining models. These findings highlight the urgent need for ethical AI practices and interdisciplinary solutions to address biases not only at the model level but also in societal structures. Our work provides a scalable and interpretable solution that advances fairness in AI systems while offering practical insights for future research on fair AI technologies.</description>

      <title>A Framework for Mining Collectively-Behaving Bots in MMORPGs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In MMORPGs (Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games), abnormal players (bots) using unauthorized automated programs to carry out pre-defined behaviors systematically and repeatedly are commonly observed. Bots usually engage in these activities to gain in-game money, which they eventually trade for real money outside the game. Such abusive activities negatively impact the in-game experiences of legitimate users since bots monopolize specific hunting areas and obtain valuable items. Thus, detecting abnormal players is a significant task for game companies. Motivated by the fact that bots tend to behave collectively with similar in-game trajectories due to the auto-programs, we developed BotTRep, a framework that comprises trajectory representation learning followed by clustering using a completely unlabeled in-game trajectory dataset. Our model aims to learn representations for in-game trajectory sequences so that players with contextually similar trajectories have closer embeddings. Then, by applying DBSCAN to these representations and visualizing the corresponding moving patterns, our framework ultimately assists game masters in identifying and banning bots.</description>

      <title>BloomScene: Lightweight Structured 3D Gaussian Splatting for Crossmodal Scene Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the widespread use of virtual reality applications, 3D scene generation has become a new challenging research frontier. 3D scenes have highly complex structures and need to ensure that the output is dense, coherent, and contains all necessary structures. Many current 3D scene generation methods rely on pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models and monocular depth estimators. However, the generated scenes occupy large amounts of storage space and often lack effective regularisation methods, leading to geometric distortions. To this end, we propose BloomScene, a lightweight structured 3D Gaussian splatting for crossmodal scene generation, which creates diverse and high-quality 3D scenes from text or image inputs. Specifically, a crossmodal progressive scene generation framework is proposed to generate coherent scenes utilizing incremental point cloud reconstruction and 3D Gaussian splatting. Additionally, we propose a hierarchical depth prior-based regularization mechanism that utilizes multi-level constraints on depth accuracy and smoothness to enhance the realism and continuity of the generated scenes. Ultimately, we propose a structured context-guided compression mechanism that exploits structured hash grids to model the context of unorganized anchor attributes, which significantly eliminates structural redundancy and reduces storage overhead. Comprehensive experiments across multiple scenes demonstrate the significant potential and advantages of our framework compared with several baselines.</description>

      <title>GLow -- A Novel, Flower-Based Simulated Gossip Learning Strategy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10463v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fully decentralized learning algorithms are still in an early stage of development. Creating modular Gossip Learning strategies is not trivial due to convergence challenges and Byzantine faults intrinsic in systems of decentralized nature. Our contribution provides a novel means to simulate custom Gossip Learning systems by leveraging the state-of-the-art Flower Framework. Specifically, we introduce GLow, which will allow researchers to train and assess scalability and convergence of devices, across custom network topologies, before making a physical deployment. The Flower Framework is selected for being a simulation featured library with a very active community on Federated Learning research. However, Flower exclusively includes vanilla Federated Learning strategies and, thus, is not originally designed to perform simulations without a centralized authority. GLow is presented to fill this gap and make simulation of Gossip Learning systems possible. Results achieved by GLow in the MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets, show accuracies over 0.98 and 0.75 respectively. More importantly, GLow performs similarly in terms of accuracy and convergence to its analogous Centralized and Federated approaches in all designed experiments.</description>

      <title>Adapting Beyond the Depth Limit: Counter Strategies in Large Imperfect Information Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of adapting to a known sub-rational opponent during online play while remaining robust to rational opponents. We focus on large imperfect-information (zero-sum) games, which makes it impossible to inspect the whole game tree at once and necessitates the use of depth-limited search. However, all existing methods assume rational play beyond the depth-limit, which only allows them to adapt a very limited portion of the opponent's behaviour. We propose an algorithm Adapting Beyond Depth-limit (ABD) that uses a strategy-portfolio approach - which we refer to as matrix-valued states - for depth-limited search. This allows the algorithm to fully utilise all information about the opponent model, making it the first robust-adaptation method to be able to do so in large imperfect-information games. As an additional benefit, the use of matrix-valued states makes the algorithm simpler than traditional methods based on optimal value functions. Our experimental results in poker and battleship show that ABD yields more than a twofold increase in utility when facing opponents who make mistakes beyond the depth limit and also delivers significant improvements in utility and safety against randomly generated opponents.</description>

      <title>Improving the Efficiency of Self-Supervised Adversarial Training through Latent Clustering-Based Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Compared with standard learning, adversarially robust learning is widely recognized to demand significantly more training examples. Recent works propose the use of self-supervised adversarial training (SSAT) with external or synthetically generated unlabeled data to enhance model robustness. However, SSAT requires a substantial amount of extra unlabeled data, significantly increasing memory usage and model training times. To address these challenges, we propose novel methods to strategically select a small subset of unlabeled data essential for SSAT and robustness improvement. Our selection prioritizes data points near the model's decision boundary based on latent clustering-based techniques, efficiently identifying a critical subset of unlabeled data with a higher concentration of boundary-adjacent points. While focusing on near-boundary data, our methods are designed to maintain a balanced ratio between boundary and non-boundary data points to avoid overfitting. Our experiments on image benchmarks show that integrating our selection strategies into self-supervised adversarial training can largely reduce memory and computational requirements while achieving high model robustness. In particular, our latent clustering-based selection method with k-means is the most effective, achieving nearly identical test-time robust accuracies with 5 to 10 times less external or generated unlabeled data when applied to image benchmarks. Additionally, we validate the generalizability of our approach across various application scenarios, including a real-world medical dataset for COVID-19 chest X-ray classification.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper critically examines the evolving ethical and regulatory challenges posed by the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in cybersecurity. We trace the historical development of AI regulation, highlighting major milestones from theoretical discussions in the 1940s to the implementation of recent global frameworks such as the European Union AI Act. The current regulatory landscape is analyzed, emphasizing risk-based approaches, sector-specific regulations, and the tension between fostering innovation and mitigating risks. Ethical concerns such as bias, transparency, accountability, privacy, and human oversight are explored in depth, along with their implications for AI-driven cybersecurity systems. Furthermore, we propose strategies for promoting AI literacy and public engagement, essential for shaping a future regulatory framework. Our findings underscore the need for a unified, globally harmonized regulatory approach that addresses the unique risks of AI in cybersecurity. We conclude by identifying future research opportunities and recommending pathways for collaboration between policymakers, industry leaders, and researchers to ensure the responsible deployment of AI technologies in cybersecurity.</description>

      <title>ArxEval: Evaluating Retrieval and Generation in Language Models for Scientific Literature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Language Models [LMs] are now playing an increasingly large role in information generation and synthesis; the representation of scientific knowledge in these systems needs to be highly accurate. A prime challenge is hallucination; that is, generating apparently plausible but actually false information, including invented citations and nonexistent research papers. This kind of inaccuracy is dangerous in all the domains that require high levels of factual correctness, such as academia and education. This work presents a pipeline for evaluating the frequency with which language models hallucinate in generating responses in the scientific literature. We propose ArxEval, an evaluation pipeline with two tasks using ArXiv as a repository: Jumbled Titles and Mixed Titles. Our evaluation includes fifteen widely used language models and provides comparative insights into their reliability in handling scientific literature.</description>

      <title>Bias in Decision-Making for AI's Ethical Dilemmas: A Comparative Study of ChatGPT and Claude</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled human-like responses across various tasks, raising questions about their ethical decision-making capabilities and potential biases. This study investigates protected attributes in LLMs through systematic evaluation of their responses to ethical dilemmas. Using two prominent models - GPT-3.5 Turbo and Claude 3.5 Sonnet - we analyzed their decision-making patterns across multiple protected attributes including age, gender, race, appearance, and disability status. Through 11,200 experimental trials involving both single-factor and two-factor protected attribute combinations, we evaluated the models' ethical preferences, sensitivity, stability, and clustering of preferences. Our findings reveal significant protected attributeses in both models, with consistent preferences for certain features (e.g., "good-looking") and systematic neglect of others. Notably, while GPT-3.5 Turbo showed stronger preferences aligned with traditional power structures, Claude 3.5 Sonnet demonstrated more diverse protected attribute choices. We also found that ethical sensitivity significantly decreases in more complex scenarios involving multiple protected attributes. Additionally, linguistic referents heavily influence the models' ethical evaluations, as demonstrated by differing responses to racial descriptors (e.g., "Yellow" versus "Asian"). These findings highlight critical concerns about the potential impact of LLM biases in autonomous decision-making systems and emphasize the need for careful consideration of protected attributes in AI development. Our study contributes to the growing body of research on AI ethics by providing a systematic framework for evaluating protected attributes in LLMs' ethical decision-making capabilities.</description>

      <title>Tabular-TX: Theme-Explanation Structure-based Table Summarization via In-Context Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a Theme-Explanation Structure-based Table Summarization (Tabular-TX) pipeline designed to efficiently process table data. Tabular-TX preprocesses table data by focusing on highlighted cells and then generates summary sentences structured with a Theme Part in the form of adverbial phrases followed by an Explanation Part in the form of clauses. In this process, customized analysis is performed by considering the structural characteristics and comparability of the table. Additionally, by utilizing In-Context Learning, Tabular-TX optimizes the analytical capabilities of large language models (LLMs) without the need for fine-tuning, effectively handling the structural complexity of table data. Results from applying the proposed Tabular-TX to generate table-based summaries demonstrated superior performance compared to existing fine-tuning-based methods, despite limitations in dataset size. Experimental results confirmed that Tabular-TX can process complex table data more effectively and established it as a new alternative for table-based question answering and summarization tasks, particularly in resource-constrained environments.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Bus Departure Prediction Using Neural Networks for Smart IoT Public Bus Transit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bus transit plays a vital role in urban public transportation but often struggles to provide accurate and reliable departure times. This leads to delays, passenger dissatisfaction, and decreased ridership, particularly in transit-dependent areas. A major challenge lies in the discrepancy between actual and scheduled bus departure times, which disrupts timetables and impacts overall operational efficiency. To address these challenges, this paper presents a neural network-based approach for real-time bus departure time prediction tailored for smart IoT public transit applications. We leverage AI-driven models to enhance the accuracy of bus schedules by preprocessing data, engineering relevant features, and implementing a fully connected neural network that utilizes historical departure data to predict departure times at subsequent stops. In our case study analyzing bus data from Boston, we observed an average deviation of nearly 4 minutes from scheduled times. However, our model, evaluated across 151 bus routes, demonstrates a significant improvement, predicting departure time deviations with an accuracy of under 80 seconds. This advancement not only improves the reliability of bus transit schedules but also plays a crucial role in enabling smart bus systems and IoT applications within public transit networks. By providing more accurate real-time predictions, our approach can facilitate the integration of IoT devices, such as smart bus stops and passenger information systems, that rely on precise data for optimal performance.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate that scalable neuromorphic hardware can implement the finite element method, which is a critical numerical method for engineering and scientific discovery. Our approach maps the sparse interactions between neighboring finite elements to small populations of neurons that dynamically update according to the governing physics of a desired problem description. We show that for the Poisson equation, which describes many physical systems such as gravitational and electrostatic fields, this cortical-inspired neural circuit can achieve comparable levels of numerical accuracy and scaling while enabling the use of inherently parallel and energy-efficient neuromorphic hardware. We demonstrate that this approach can be used on the Intel Loihi 2 platform and illustrate how this approach can be extended to nontrivial mesh geometries and dynamics.</description>

      <title>4bit-Quantization in Vector-Embedding for RAG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a promising technique that has shown great potential in addressing some of the limitations of large language models (LLMs). LLMs have two major limitations: they can contain outdated information due to their training data, and they can generate factually inaccurate responses, a phenomenon known as hallucinations. RAG aims to mitigate these issues by leveraging a database of relevant documents, which are stored as embedding vectors in a high-dimensional space. However, one of the challenges of using high-dimensional embeddings is that they require a significant amount of memory to store. This can be a major issue, especially when dealing with large databases of documents. To alleviate this problem, we propose the use of 4-bit quantization to store the embedding vectors. This involves reducing the precision of the vectors from 32-bit floating-point numbers to 4-bit integers, which can significantly reduce the memory requirements. Our approach has several benefits. Firstly, it significantly reduces the memory storage requirements of the high-dimensional vector database, making it more feasible to deploy RAG systems in resource-constrained environments. Secondly, it speeds up the searching process, as the reduced precision of the vectors allows for faster computation. Our code is available at https://github.com/taeheej/4bit-Quantization-in-Vector-Embedding-for-RAG</description>

Abstract: Software bugs pose a significant challenge during development and maintenance, and practitioners spend nearly 50% of their time dealing with bugs. Many existing techniques adopt Information Retrieval (IR) to localize a reported bug using textual and semantic relevance between bug reports and source code. However, they often struggle to bridge a critical gap between bug reports and code that requires in-depth contextual understanding, which goes beyond textual or semantic relevance. In this paper, we present a novel technique for bug localization - BRaIn - that addresses the contextual gaps by assessing the relevance between bug reports and code with Large Language Models (LLM). It then leverages the LLM's feedback (a.k.a., Intelligent Relevance Feedback) to reformulate queries and re-rank source documents, improving bug localization. We evaluate BRaIn using a benchmark dataset, Bench4BL, and three performance metrics and compare it against six baseline techniques from the literature. Our experimental results show that BRaIn outperforms baselines by 87.6%, 89.5%, and 48.8% margins in MAP, MRR, and HIT@K, respectively. Additionally, it can localize approximately 52% of bugs that cannot be localized by the baseline techniques due to the poor quality of corresponding bug reports. By addressing the contextual gaps and introducing Intelligent Relevance Feedback, BRaIn advances not only theory but also improves IR-based bug localization.</description>

      <title>FORLAPS: An Innovative Data-Driven Reinforcement Learning Approach for Prescriptive Process Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel 5-step framework called Fine-Tuned Offline Reinforcement Learning Augmented Process Sequence Optimization (FORLAPS), which aims to identify optimal execution paths in business processes using reinforcement learning. We implemented this approach on real-life event logs from our case study an energy regulator in Canada and other real-life event logs, demonstrating the feasibility of the proposed method. Additionally, to compare FORLAPS with the existing models (Permutation Feature Importance and multi-task LSTM-Based model), we experimented to evaluate its effectiveness in terms of resource savings and process time span reduction. The experimental results on real-life event log validate that FORLAPS achieves 31% savings in resource time spent and a 23% reduction in process time span. Using this innovative data augmentation technique, we propose a fine-tuned reinforcement learning approach that aims to automatically fine-tune the model by selectively increasing the average estimated Q-value in the sampled batches. The results show that we obtained a 44% performance improvement compared to the pre-trained model. This study introduces an innovative evaluation model, benchmarking its performance against earlier works using nine publicly available datasets. Robustness is ensured through experiments utilizing the Damerau-Levenshtein distance as the primary metric. In addition, we discussed the suitability of datasets, taking into account their inherent properties, to evaluate the performance of different models. The proposed model, FORLAPS, demonstrated exceptional performance, outperforming existing state-of-the-art approaches in suggesting the most optimal policies or predicting the best next activities within a process trace.</description>

      <title>Scalable Machine Learning Training Infrastructure for Online Ads Recommendation and Auction Scoring Modeling at Google</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large-scale Ads recommendation and auction scoring models at Google scale demand immense computational resources. While specialized hardware like TPUs have improved linear algebra computations, bottlenecks persist in large-scale systems. This paper proposes solutions for three critical challenges that must be addressed for efficient end-to-end execution in a widely used production infrastructure: (1) Input Generation and Ingestion Pipeline: Efficiently transforming raw features (e.g., "search query") into numerical inputs and streaming them to TPUs; (2) Large Embedding Tables: Optimizing conversion of sparse features into dense floating-point vectors for neural network consumption; (3) Interruptions and Error Handling: Minimizing resource wastage in large-scale shared datacenters. To tackle these challenges, we propose a shared input generation technique to reduce computational load of input generation by amortizing costs across many models. Furthermore, we propose partitioning, pipelining, and RPC (Remote Procedure Call) coalescing software techniques to optimize embedding operations. To maintain efficiency at scale, we describe novel preemption notice and training hold mechanisms that minimize resource wastage, and ensure prompt error resolution. These techniques have demonstrated significant improvement in Google production, achieving a 116% performance boost and an 18% reduction in training costs across representative models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we describe the development and evaluation of AITK, the Artificial Intelligence Toolkit. This open-source project contains both Python libraries and computational essays (Jupyter notebooks) that together are designed to allow a diverse audience with little or no background in AI to interact with a variety of AI tools, exploring in more depth how they function, visualizing their outcomes, and gaining a better understanding of their ethical implications. These notebooks have been piloted at multiple institutions in a variety of humanities courses centered on the theme of responsible AI. In addition, we conducted usability testing of AITK. Our pilot studies and usability testing results indicate that AITK is easy to navigate and effective at helping users gain a better understanding of AI. Our goal, in this time of rapid innovations in AI, is for AITK to provide an accessible resource for faculty from any discipline looking to incorporate AI topics into their courses and for anyone eager to learn more about AI on their own.</description>

      <title>AI Technicians: Developing Rapid Occupational Training Methods for a Competitive AI Workforce</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The accelerating pace of developments in Artificial Intelligence~(AI) and the increasing role that technology plays in society necessitates substantial changes in the structure of the workforce. Besides scientists and engineers, there is a need for a very large workforce of competent AI technicians (i.e., maintainers, integrators) and users~(i.e., operators). As traditional 4-year and 2-year degree-based education cannot fill this quickly opening gap, alternative training methods have to be developed. We present the results of the first four years of the AI Technicians program which is a unique collaboration between the U.S. Army's Artificial Intelligence Integration Center (AI2C) and Carnegie Mellon University to design, implement and evaluate novel rapid occupational training methods to create a competitive AI workforce at the technicians level. Through this multi-year effort we have already trained 59 AI Technicians. A key observation is that ongoing frequent updates to the training are necessary as the adoption of AI in the U.S. Army and within the society at large is evolving rapidly. A tight collaboration among the stakeholders from the army and the university is essential for successful development and maintenance of the training for the evolving role. Our findings can be leveraged by large organizations that face the challenge of developing a competent AI workforce as well as educators and researchers engaged in solving the challenge.</description>

      <title>When language and vision meet road safety: leveraging multimodal large language models for video-based traffic accident analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing availability of traffic videos functioning on a 24/7/365 time scale has the great potential of increasing the spatio-temporal coverage of traffic accidents, which will help improve traffic safety. However, analyzing footage from hundreds, if not thousands, of traffic cameras in a 24/7/365 working protocol remains an extremely challenging task, as current vision-based approaches primarily focus on extracting raw information, such as vehicle trajectories or individual object detection, but require laborious post-processing to derive actionable insights. We propose SeeUnsafe, a new framework that integrates Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) agents to transform video-based traffic accident analysis from a traditional extraction-then-explanation workflow to a more interactive, conversational approach. This shift significantly enhances processing throughput by automating complex tasks like video classification and visual grounding, while improving adaptability by enabling seamless adjustments to diverse traffic scenarios and user-defined queries. Our framework employs a severity-based aggregation strategy to handle videos of various lengths and a novel multimodal prompt to generate structured responses for review and evaluation and enable fine-grained visual grounding. We introduce IMS (Information Matching Score), a new MLLM-based metric for aligning structured responses with ground truth. We conduct extensive experiments on the Toyota Woven Traffic Safety dataset, demonstrating that SeeUnsafe effectively performs accident-aware video classification and visual grounding by leveraging off-the-shelf MLLMs. Source code will be available at \url{https://github.com/ai4ce/SeeUnsafe}.</description>

      <title>AI/ML Based Detection and Categorization of Covert Communication in IPv6 Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The flexibility and complexity of IPv6 extension headers allow attackers to create covert channels or bypass security mechanisms, leading to potential data breaches or system compromises. The mature development of machine learning has become the primary detection technology option used to mitigate covert communication threats. However, the complexity of detecting covert communication, evolving injection techniques, and scarcity of data make building machine-learning models challenging. In previous related research, machine learning has shown good performance in detecting covert communications, but oversimplified attack scenario assumptions cannot represent the complexity of modern covert technologies and make it easier for machine learning models to detect covert communications. To bridge this gap, in this study, we analyzed the packet structure and network traffic behavior of IPv6, used encryption algorithms, and performed covert communication injection without changing network packet behavior to get closer to real attack scenarios. In addition to analyzing and injecting methods for covert communications, this study also uses comprehensive machine learning techniques to train the model proposed in this study to detect threats, including traditional decision trees such as random forests and gradient boosting, as well as complex neural network architectures such as CNNs and LSTMs, to achieve detection accuracy of over 90\%. This study details the methods used for dataset augmentation and the comparative performance of the applied models, reinforcing insights into the adaptability and resilience of the machine learning application in IPv6 covert communication. In addition, we also proposed a Generative AI-assisted interpretation concept based on prompt engineering as a preliminary study of the role of Generative AI agents in covert communication.</description>

      <title>LUT-DLA: Lookup Table as Efficient Extreme Low-Bit Deep Learning Accelerator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emergence of neural network capabilities invariably leads to a significant surge in computational demands due to expanding model sizes and increased computational complexity. To reduce model size and lower inference costs, recent research has focused on simplifying models and designing hardware accelerators using low-bit quantization. However, due to numerical representation limits, scalar quantization cannot reduce bit width lower than 1-bit, diminishing its benefits. To break through these limitations, we introduce LUT-DLA, a Look-Up Table (LUT) Deep Learning Accelerator Framework that utilizes vector quantization to convert neural network models into LUTs, achieving extreme low-bit quantization. The LUT-DLA framework facilitates efficient and cost-effective hardware accelerator designs and supports the LUTBoost algorithm, which helps to transform various DNN models into LUT-based models via multistage training, drastically cutting both computational and hardware overhead. Additionally, through co-design space exploration, LUT-DLA assesses the impact of various model and hardware parameters to fine-tune hardware configurations for different application scenarios, optimizing performance and efficiency. Our comprehensive experiments show that LUT-DLA achieves improvements in power efficiency and area efficiency with gains of $1.4$~$7.0\times$ and $1.5$~$146.1\times$, respectively, while maintaining only a modest accuracy drop. For CNNs, accuracy decreases by $0.1\%$~$3.1\%$ using the $L_2$ distance similarity, $0.1\%$~$3.4\%$ with the $L_1$ distance similarity, and $0.1\%$~$3.8\%$ when employing the Chebyshev distance similarity. For transformer-based models, the accuracy drop ranges from $1.4\%$ to $3.0\%$.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Mystery of Weight in Large Foundation Models: Gaussian Distribution Never Fades</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a pioneering exploration of the mechanisms underlying large foundation models' (LFMs) weights, aiming to simplify AI research. Through extensive observation and analysis on prevailing LFMs, we find that regardless of initialization strategies, their weights predominantly follow a Gaussian distribution, with occasional sharp, inverted T-shaped, or linear patterns. We further discover that the weights share the i.i.d. properties of Gaussian noise, and explore their direct relationship. We find that transformation weights can be derived from Gaussian noise, and they primarily serve to increase the standard deviation of pre-trained weights, with their standard deviation growing with layer depth. In other words, transformation weights broaden the acceptable deviation from the optimal weights, facilitating adaptation to downstream tasks. Building upon the above conclusions, we thoroughly discussed the nature of optimal weights, ultimately concluding that they should exhibit zero-mean, symmetry, and sparsity, with the sparse values being a truncated Gaussian distribution and a few outliers. Our experiments in LFM adaptation and editing demonstrate the effectiveness of these insights. We hope these findings can provide a foundational understanding to pave the way for future advancements in the LFM community.</description>

      <title>Class-Imbalanced-Aware Adaptive Dataset Distillation for Scalable Pretrained Model on Credit Scoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advent of artificial intelligence has significantly enhanced credit scoring technologies. Despite the remarkable efficacy of advanced deep learning models, mainstream adoption continues to favor tree-structured models due to their robust predictive performance on tabular data. Although pretrained models have seen considerable development, their application within the financial realm predominantly revolves around question-answering tasks and the use of such models for tabular-structured credit scoring datasets remains largely unexplored. Tabular-oriented large models, such as TabPFN, has made the application of large models in credit scoring feasible, albeit can only processing with limited sample sizes. This paper provides a novel framework to combine tabular-tailored dataset distillation technique with the pretrained model, empowers the scalability for TabPFN. Furthermore, though class imbalance distribution is the common nature in financial datasets, its influence during dataset distillation has not been explored. We thus integrate the imbalance-aware techniques during dataset distillation, resulting in improved performance in financial datasets (e.g., a 2.5% enhancement in AUC). This study presents a novel framework for scaling up the application of large pretrained models on financial tabular datasets and offers a comparative analysis of the influence of class imbalance on the dataset distillation process. We believe this approach can broaden the applications and downstream tasks of large models in the financial domain.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Looped Transformers have shown exceptional capability in simulating traditional graph algorithms, but their application to more complex structures like hypergraphs remains underexplored. Hypergraphs generalize graphs by modeling higher-order relationships among multiple entities, enabling richer representations but introducing significant computational challenges. In this work, we extend the Loop Transformer architecture to simulate hypergraph algorithms efficiently, addressing the gap between neural networks and combinatorial optimization over hypergraphs. In this paper, we extend the Loop Transformer architecture to simulate hypergraph algorithms efficiently, addressing the gap between neural networks and combinatorial optimization over hypergraphs. Specifically, we propose a novel degradation mechanism for reducing hypergraphs to graph representations, enabling the simulation of graph-based algorithms, such as Dijkstra's shortest path. Furthermore, we introduce a hyperedge-aware encoding scheme to simulate hypergraph-specific algorithms, exemplified by Helly's algorithm. The paper establishes theoretical guarantees for these simulations, demonstrating the feasibility of processing high-dimensional and combinatorial data using Loop Transformers. This work highlights the potential of Transformers as general-purpose algorithmic solvers for structured data.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic Derivation of Human Spatial Navigation Indices From Eye Movement Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatial navigation is a complex cognitive function involving sensory inputs, such as visual, auditory, and proprioceptive information, to understand and move within space. This ability allows humans to create mental maps, navigate through environments, and process directional cues, crucial for exploring new places and finding one's way in unfamiliar surroundings. This study takes an algorithmic approach to extract indices relevant to human spatial navigation using eye movement data. Leveraging electrooculography signals, we analyzed statistical features and applied feature engineering techniques to study eye movements during navigation tasks. The proposed work combines signal processing and machine learning approaches to develop indices for navigation and orientation, spatial anxiety, landmark recognition, path survey, and path route. The analysis yielded five subscore indices with notable accuracy. Among these, the navigation and orientation subscore achieved an R2 score of 0.72, while the landmark recognition subscore attained an R2 score of 0.50. Additionally, statistical features highly correlated with eye movement metrics, including blinks, saccades, and fixations, were identified. The findings of this study can lead to more cognitive assessments and enable early detection of spatial navigation impairments, particularly among individuals at risk of cognitive decline.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning has demonstrated great potential for performing financial tasks. However, it faces two major challenges: policy instability and sampling bottlenecks. In this paper, we revisit ensemble methods with massively parallel simulations on graphics processing units (GPUs), significantly enhancing the computational efficiency and robustness of trained models in volatile financial markets. Our approach leverages the parallel processing capability of GPUs to significantly improve the sampling speed for training ensemble models. The ensemble models combine the strengths of component agents to improve the robustness of financial decision-making strategies. We conduct experiments in both stock and cryptocurrency trading tasks to evaluate the effectiveness of our approach. Massively parallel simulation on a single GPU improves the sampling speed by up to $1,746\times$ using $2,048$ parallel environments compared to a single environment. The ensemble models have high cumulative returns and outperform some individual agents, reducing maximum drawdown by up to $4.17\%$ and improving the Sharpe ratio by up to $0.21$.
  This paper describes trading tasks at ACM ICAIF FinRL Contests in 2023 and 2024.</description>

      <title>How Should I Build A Benchmark?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Various benchmarks have been proposed to assess the performance of large language models (LLMs) in different coding scenarios. We refer to them as code-related benchmarks. However, there are no systematic guidelines by which such a benchmark should be developed to ensure its quality, reliability, and reproducibility. We propose How2Bench, which is comprised of a 55- 55-criteria checklist as a set of guidelines to govern the development of code-related benchmarks comprehensively. Using HOW2BENCH, we profiled 274 benchmarks released within the past decade and found concerning issues. Nearly 70% of the benchmarks did not take measures for data quality assurance; over 10% did not even open source or only partially open source. Many highly cited benchmarks have loopholes, including duplicated samples, incorrect reference codes/tests/prompts, and unremoved sensitive/confidential information. Finally, we conducted a human study involving 49 participants, which revealed significant gaps in awareness of the importance of data quality, reproducibility, and transparency.</description>

      <title>In the Picture: Medical Imaging Datasets, Artifacts, and their Living Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Datasets play a critical role in medical imaging research, yet issues such as label quality, shortcuts, and metadata are often overlooked. This lack of attention may harm the generalizability of algorithms and, consequently, negatively impact patient outcomes. While existing medical imaging literature reviews mostly focus on machine learning (ML) methods, with only a few focusing on datasets for specific applications, these reviews remain static -- they are published once and not updated thereafter. This fails to account for emerging evidence, such as biases, shortcuts, and additional annotations that other researchers may contribute after the dataset is published. We refer to these newly discovered findings of datasets as research artifacts. To address this gap, we propose a living review that continuously tracks public datasets and their associated research artifacts across multiple medical imaging applications. Our approach includes a framework for the living review to monitor data documentation artifacts, and an SQL database to visualize the citation relationships between research artifact and dataset. Lastly, we discuss key considerations for creating medical imaging datasets, review best practices for data annotation, discuss the significance of shortcuts and demographic diversity, and emphasize the importance of managing datasets throughout their entire lifecycle. Our demo is publicly available at http://130.226.140.142.</description>

      <title>GEC-RAG: Improving Generative Error Correction via Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Automatic Speech Recognition Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems have demonstrated remarkable performance across various applications. However, limited data and the unique language features of specific domains, such as low-resource languages, significantly degrade their performance and lead to higher Word Error Rates (WER). In this study, we propose Generative Error Correction via Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GEC-RAG), a novel approach designed to improve ASR accuracy for low-resource domains, like Persian. Our approach treats the ASR system as a black-box, a common practice in cloud-based services, and proposes a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach within the In-Context Learning (ICL) scheme to enhance the quality of ASR predictions. By constructing a knowledge base that pairs ASR predictions (1-best and 5-best hypotheses) with their corresponding ground truths, GEC-RAG retrieves lexically similar examples to the ASR transcription using the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) measure. This process provides relevant error patterns of the system alongside the ASR transcription to the Generative Large Language Model (LLM), enabling targeted corrections. Our results demonstrate that this strategy significantly reduces WER in Persian and highlights a potential for domain adaptation and low-resource scenarios. This research underscores the effectiveness of using RAG in enhancing ASR systems without requiring direct model modification or fine-tuning, making it adaptable to any domain by simply updating the transcription knowledge base with domain-specific data.</description>

      <title>Semi-supervised Semantic Segmentation for Remote Sensing Images via Multi-scale Uncertainty Consistency and Cross-Teacher-Student Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semi-supervised learning offers an appealing solution for remote sensing (RS) image segmentation to relieve the burden of labor-intensive pixel-level labeling. However, RS images pose unique challenges, including rich multi-scale features and high inter-class similarity. To address these problems, this paper proposes a novel semi-supervised Multi-Scale Uncertainty and Cross-Teacher-Student Attention (MUCA) model for RS image semantic segmentation tasks. Specifically, MUCA constrains the consistency among feature maps at different layers of the network by introducing a multi-scale uncertainty consistency regularization. It improves the multi-scale learning capability of semi-supervised algorithms on unlabeled data. Additionally, MUCA utilizes a Cross-Teacher-Student attention mechanism to guide the student network, guiding the student network to construct more discriminative feature representations through complementary features from the teacher network. This design effectively integrates weak and strong augmentations (WA and SA) to further boost segmentation performance. To verify the effectiveness of our model, we conduct extensive experiments on ISPRS-Potsdam and LoveDA datasets. The experimental results show the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art semi-supervised methods. Notably, our model excels in distinguishing highly similar objects, showcasing its potential for advancing semi-supervised RS image segmentation tasks.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Diagnostic in 3D COVID-19 Pneumonia CT-scans through Explainable Uncertainty Bayesian Quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10770v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately classifying COVID-19 pneumonia in 3D CT scans remains a significant challenge in the field of medical image analysis. Although deterministic neural networks have shown promising results in this area, they provide only point estimates outputs yielding poor diagnostic in clinical decision-making. In this paper, we explore the use of Bayesian neural networks for classifying COVID-19 pneumonia in 3D CT scans providing uncertainties in their predictions. We compare deterministic networks and their Bayesian counterpart, enhancing the decision-making accuracy under uncertainty information. Remarkably, our findings reveal that lightweight architectures achieve the highest accuracy of 96\% after developing extensive hyperparameter tuning. Furthermore, the Bayesian counterpart of these architectures via Multiplied Normalizing Flow technique kept a similar performance along with calibrated uncertainty estimates. Finally, we have developed a 3D-visualization approach to explain the neural network outcomes based on SHAP values. We conclude that explainability along with uncertainty quantification will offer better clinical decisions in medical image analysis, contributing to ongoing efforts for improving the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia.</description>

      <title>MedFILIP: Medical Fine-grained Language-Image Pre-training</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Medical vision-language pretraining (VLP) that leverages naturally-paired medical image-report data is crucial for medical image analysis. However, existing methods struggle to accurately characterize associations between images and diseases, leading to inaccurate or incomplete diagnostic results. In this work, we propose MedFILIP, a fine-grained VLP model, introduces medical image-specific knowledge through contrastive learning, specifically: 1) An information extractor based on a large language model is proposed to decouple comprehensive disease details from reports, which excels in extracting disease deals through flexible prompt engineering, thereby effectively reducing text complexity while retaining rich information at a tiny cost. 2) A knowledge injector is proposed to construct relationships between categories and visual attributes, which help the model to make judgments based on image features, and fosters knowledge extrapolation to unfamiliar disease categories. 3) A semantic similarity matrix based on fine-grained annotations is proposed, providing smoother, information-richer labels, thus allowing fine-grained image-text alignment. 4) We validate MedFILIP on numerous datasets, e.g., RSNA-Pneumonia, NIH ChestX-ray14, VinBigData, and COVID-19. For single-label, multi-label, and fine-grained classification, our model achieves state-of-the-art performance, the classification accuracy has increased by a maximum of 6.69\%.

      <title>Simultaneous Computation with Multiple Prioritizations in Multi-Agent Motion Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-agent path finding (MAPF) in large networks is computationally challenging. An approach for MAPF is prioritized planning (PP), in which agents plan sequentially according to their priority. Albeit a computationally efficient approach for MAPF, the solution quality strongly depends on the prioritization. Most prioritizations rely either on heuristics, which do not generalize well, or iterate to find adequate priorities, which costs computational effort. In this work, we show how agents can compute with multiple prioritizations simultaneously. Our approach is general as it does not rely on domain-specific knowledge. The context of this work is multi-agent motion planning (MAMP) with a receding horizon subject to computation time constraints. MAMP considers the system dynamics in more detail compared to MAPF. In numerical experiments on MAMP, we demonstrate that our approach to prioritization comes close to optimal prioritization and outperforms state-of-the-art methods with only a minor increase in computation time. We show real-time capability in an experiment on a road network with ten vehicles in our Cyber-Physical Mobility Lab.</description>

      <title>Step-KTO: Optimizing Mathematical Reasoning through Stepwise Binary Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable success in mathematical reasoning. Despite progress in methods like chain-of-thought prompting and self-consistency sampling, these advances often focus on final correctness without ensuring that the underlying reasoning process is coherent and reliable. This paper introduces Step-KTO, a training framework that combines process-level and outcome-level binary feedback to guide LLMs toward more trustworthy reasoning trajectories. By providing binary evaluations for both the intermediate reasoning steps and the final answer, Step-KTO encourages the model to adhere to logical progressions rather than relying on superficial shortcuts. Our experiments on challenging mathematical benchmarks show that Step-KTO significantly improves both final answer accuracy and the quality of intermediate reasoning steps. For example, on the MATH-500 dataset, Step-KTO achieves a notable improvement in Pass@1 accuracy over strong baselines. These results highlight the promise of integrating stepwise process feedback into LLM training, paving the way toward more interpretable and dependable reasoning capabilities.</description>

      <title>Efficient Auto-Labeling of Large-Scale Poultry Datasets (ALPD) Using Semi-Supervised Models, Active Learning, and Prompt-then-Detect Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid growth of AI in poultry farming has highlighted the challenge of efficiently labeling large, diverse datasets. Manual annotation is time-consuming, making it impractical for modern systems that continuously generate data. This study explores semi-supervised auto-labeling methods, integrating active learning, and prompt-then-detect paradigm to develop an efficient framework for auto-labeling of large poultry datasets aimed at advancing AI-driven behavior and health monitoring. Viideo data were collected from broilers and laying hens housed at the University of Arkansas and the University of Georgia. The collected videos were converted into images, pre-processed, augmented, and labeled. Various machine learning models, including zero-shot models like Grounding DINO, YOLO-World, and CLIP, and supervised models like YOLO and Faster-RCNN, were utilized for broilers, hens, and behavior detection. The results showed that YOLOv8s-World and YOLOv9s performed better when compared performance metrics for broiler and hen detection under supervised learning, while among the semi-supervised model, YOLOv8s-ALPD achieved the highest precision (96.1%) and recall (99.0%) with an RMSE of 1.9. The hybrid YOLO-World model, incorporating the optimal YOLOv8s backbone, demonstrated the highest overall performance. It achieved a precision of 99.2%, recall of 99.4%, and an F1 score of 98.7% for breed detection, alongside a precision of 88.4%, recall of 83.1%, and an F1 score of 84.5% for individual behavior detection. Additionally, semi-supervised models showed significant improvements in behavior detection, achieving up to 31% improvement in precision and 16% in F1-score. The semi-supervised models with minimal active learning reduced annotation time by over 80% compared to full manual labeling. Moreover, integrating zero-shot models enhanced detection and behavior identification.</description>

      <title>Graph Coloring to Reduce Computation Time in Prioritized Planning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Distributing computations among agents in large networks reduces computational effort in multi-agent path finding (MAPF). One distribution strategy is prioritized planning (PP). In PP, we couple and prioritize interacting agents to achieve a desired behavior across all agents in the network. We characterize the interaction with a directed acyclic graph (DAG). The computation time for solving MAPF problem using PP is mainly determined through the longest path in this DAG. The longest path depends on the fixed undirected coupling graph and the variable prioritization. The approaches from literature to prioritize agents are numerous and pursue various goals. This article presents an approach for prioritization in PP to reduce the longest path length in the coupling DAG and thus the computation time for MAPF using PP. We prove that this problem can be mapped to a graph-coloring problem, in which the number of colors required corresponds to the longest path length in the coupling DAG. We propose a decentralized graph-coloring algorithm to determine priorities for the agents. We evaluate the approach by applying it to multi-agent motion planning (MAMP) for connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) on roads using, a variant of MAPF.</description>

      <title>No More Sliding Window: Efficient 3D Medical Image Segmentation with Differentiable Top-k Patch Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 3D models are favored over 2D for 3D medical image segmentation tasks due to their ability to leverage inter-slice relationship, yielding higher segmentation accuracy. However, 3D models demand significantly more GPU memory with increased model size and intermediate tensors. A common solution is to use patch-based training and make whole-volume predictions with sliding window (SW) inference. SW inference reduces memory usage but is slower due to equal resource allocation across patches and less accurate as it overlooks global features beyond patches.
  We propose NMSW-Net (No-More-Sliding-Window-Net), a novel framework that enhances efficiency and accuracy of any given 3D segmentation model by eliminating SW inference and incorporating global predictions when necessary. NMSW-Net incorporates a differentiable Top-k module to sample only the relevant patches that enhance segmentation accuracy, thereby minimizing redundant computations. Additionally, it learns to leverage coarse global predictions when patch prediction alone is insufficient. NMSW-Net is model-agnostic, making it compatible with any 3D segmentation model that previously relied on SW inference.
  Evaluated across 3 tasks with 3 segmentation backbones, NMSW-Net achieves competitive or sometimes superior accuracy compared to SW, while reducing computational complexity by 90% (87.5 to 7.95 TFLOPS), delivering 4x faster inference on the H100 GPU (19.0 to 4.3 sec), and 7x faster inference on the Intel Xeon Gold CPU (1710 to 230 seconds).</description>

      <title>Addressing Multilabel Imbalance with an Efficiency-Focused Approach Using Diffusion Model-Generated Synthetic Samples</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predictive models trained on imbalanced data tend to produce biased results. This problem is exacerbated when there is not just one output label, but a set of them. This is the case for multilabel learning (MLL) algorithms used to classify patterns, rank labels, or learn the distribution of outputs. Many solutions have been proposed in the literature. The one that can be applied universally, independent of the algorithm used to build the model, is data resampling. The generation of new instances associated with minority labels, so that empty areas of the feature space are filled, helps to improve the obtained models. The quality of these new instances depends on the algorithm used to generate them. In this paper, a diffusion model tailored to produce new instances for MLL data, called MLDM (\textit{MultiLabel Diffusion Model}), is proposed. Diffusion models have been mainly used to generate artificial images and videos. Our proposed MLDM is based on this type of models. The experiments conducted compare MLDM with several other MLL resampling algorithms. The results show that MLDM is competitive while it improves efficiency.</description>

      <title>Visual RAG: Expanding MLLM visual knowledge without fine-tuning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved notable performance in computer vision tasks that require reasoning across visual and textual modalities, yet their capabilities are limited to their pre-trained data, requiring extensive fine-tuning for updates. Recent researches have explored the use of In-Context Learning (ICL) to overcome these challenges by providing a set of demonstrating examples as context to augment MLLMs performance in several tasks, showing that many-shot ICL leads to substantial improvements compared to few-shot ICL. However, the reliance on numerous demonstrating examples and the limited MLLMs context windows presents significant obstacles. This paper aims to address these challenges by introducing a novel approach, Visual RAG, that synergically combines the MLLMs capability to learn from the context, with a retrieval mechanism. The crux of this approach is to ensure to augment the MLLM knowledge by selecting only the most relevant demonstrating examples for the query, pushing it to learn by analogy. In this way, relying on the new information provided dynamically during inference time, the resulting system is not limited to the knowledge extracted from the training data, but can be updated rapidly and easily without fine-tuning. Furthermore, this greatly reduces the computational costs for improving the model image classification performance, and augments the model knowledge to new visual domains and tasks it was not trained for. Extensive experiments on eight different datasets in the state of the art spanning several domains and image classification tasks show that the proposed Visual RAG, compared to the most recent state of the art (i.e., many-shot ICL), is able to obtain an accuracy that is very close or even higher (approx. +2% improvement on average) while using a much smaller set of demonstrating examples (approx. only 23% on average).</description>

      <title>BAP v2: An Enhanced Task Framework for Instruction Following in Minecraft Dialogues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interactive agents capable of understanding and executing instructions in the physical world have long been a central goal in AI research. The Minecraft Collaborative Building Task (MCBT) provides one such setting to work towards this goal (Narayan-Chen, Jayannavar, and Hockenmaier 2019). It is a two-player game in which an Architect (A) instructs a Builder (B) to construct a target structure in a simulated Blocks World Environment. We focus on the challenging Builder Action Prediction (BAP) subtask of predicting correct action sequences in a given multimodal game context with limited training data (Jayannavar, Narayan-Chen, and Hockenmaier 2020). We take a closer look at evaluation and data for the BAP task, discovering key challenges and making significant improvements on both fronts to propose BAP v2, an upgraded version of the task. This will allow future work to make more efficient and meaningful progress on it. It comprises of: (1) an enhanced evaluation benchmark that includes a cleaner test set and fairer, more insightful metrics, and (2) additional synthetic training data generated from novel Minecraft dialogue and target structure simulators emulating the MCBT. We show that the synthetic data can be used to train more performant and robust neural models even with relatively simple training methods. Looking ahead, such data could also be crucial for training more sophisticated, data-hungry deep transformer models and training/fine-tuning increasingly large LLMs. Although modeling is not the primary focus of this work, we also illustrate the impact of our data and training methodologies on a simple LLM- and transformer-based model, thus validating the robustness of our approach, and setting the stage for more advanced architectures and LLMs going forward.</description>

      <title>Practical and Ready-to-Use Methodology to Assess the re-identification Risk in Anonymized Datasets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To prove that a dataset is sufficiently anonymized, many privacy policies suggest that a re-identification risk assessment be performed, but do not provide a precise methodology for doing so, leaving the industry alone with the problem. This paper proposes a practical and ready-to-use methodology for re-identification risk assessment, the originality of which is manifold: (1) it is the first to follow well-known risk analysis methods (e.g. EBIOS) that have been used in the cybersecurity field for years, which consider not only the ability to perform an attack, but also the impact such an attack can have on an individual; (2) it is the first to qualify attributes and values of attributes with e.g. degree of exposure, as known real-world attacks mainly target certain types of attributes and not others.</description>

      <title>Fake Advertisements Detection Using Automated Multimodal Learning: A Case Study for Vietnamese Real Estate Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The popularity of e-commerce has given rise to fake advertisements that can expose users to financial and data risks while damaging the reputation of these e-commerce platforms. For these reasons, detecting and removing such fake advertisements are important for the success of e-commerce websites. In this paper, we propose FADAML, a novel end-to-end machine learning system to detect and filter out fake online advertisements. Our system combines techniques in multimodal machine learning and automated machine learning to achieve a high detection rate. As a case study, we apply FADAML to detect fake advertisements on popular Vietnamese real estate websites. Our experiments show that we can achieve 91.5% detection accuracy, which significantly outperforms three different state-of-the-art fake news detection systems.</description>

      <title>Reliable Text-to-SQL with Adaptive Abstention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language interfaces for databases, particularly in text-to-SQL conversion. However, current approaches often generate unreliable outputs when faced with ambiguity or insufficient context. We present Reliable Text-to-SQL (RTS), a novel framework that enhances query generation reliability by incorporating abstention and human-in-the-loop mechanisms. RTS focuses on the critical schema linking phase, which aims to identify the key database elements needed for generating SQL queries. It autonomously detects potential errors during the answer generation process and responds by either abstaining or engaging in user interaction. A vital component of RTS is the Branching Point Prediction (BPP) which utilizes statistical conformal techniques on the hidden layers of the LLM model for schema linking, providing probabilistic guarantees on schema linking accuracy. We validate our approach through comprehensive experiments on the BIRD benchmark, demonstrating significant improvements in robustness and reliability. Our findings highlight the potential of combining transparent-box LLMs with human-in-the-loop processes to create more robust natural language interfaces for databases. For the BIRD benchmark, our approach achieves near-perfect schema linking accuracy, autonomously involving a human when needed. Combined with query generation, we demonstrate that near-perfect schema linking and a small query generation model can almost match SOTA accuracy achieved with a model orders of magnitude larger than the one we use.</description>

      <title>Zero-shot and Few-shot Learning with Instruction-following LLMs for Claim Matching in Automated Fact-checking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The claim matching (CM) task can benefit an automated fact-checking pipeline by putting together claims that can be resolved with the same fact-check. In this work, we are the first to explore zero-shot and few-shot learning approaches to the task. We consider CM as a binary classification task and experiment with a set of instruction-following large language models (GPT-3.5-turbo, Gemini-1.5-flash, Mistral-7B-Instruct, and Llama-3-8B-Instruct), investigating prompt templates. We introduce a new CM dataset, ClaimMatch, which will be released upon acceptance. We put LLMs to the test in the CM task and find that it can be tackled by leveraging more mature yet similar tasks such as natural language inference or paraphrase detection. We also propose a pipeline for CM, which we evaluate on texts of different lengths.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Continual Learning: Harnessing Parameter Uncertainty for Improved Network Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When fine-tuning Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to new data, DNNs are prone to overwriting network parameters required for task-specific functionality on previously learned tasks, resulting in a loss of performance on those tasks. We propose using parameter-based uncertainty to determine which parameters are relevant to a network's learned function and regularize training to prevent change in these important parameters. We approach this regularization in two ways: (1), we constrain critical parameters from significant changes by associating more critical parameters with lower learning rates, thereby limiting alterations in those parameters; (2), important parameters are restricted from change by imposing a higher regularization weighting, causing parameters to revert to their states prior to the learning of subsequent tasks. We leverage a Bayesian Moment Propagation framework which learns network parameters concurrently with their associated uncertainties while allowing each parameter to contribute uncertainty to the network's predictive distribution, avoiding the pitfalls of existing sampling-based methods. The proposed approach is evaluated for common sequential benchmark datasets and compared to existing published approaches from the Continual Learning community. Ultimately, we show improved Continual Learning performance for Average Test Accuracy and Backward Transfer metrics compared to sampling-based methods and other non-uncertainty-based approaches.</description>

      <title>Generating Structured Outputs from Language Models: Benchmark and Studies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reliably generating structured outputs has become a critical capability for modern language model (LM) applications. Constrained decoding has emerged as the dominant technology across sectors for enforcing structured outputs during generation. Despite its growing adoption, little has been done with the systematic evaluation of the behaviors and performance of constrained decoding. Constrained decoding frameworks have standardized around JSON Schema as a structured data format, with most uses guaranteeing constraint compliance given a schema. However, there is poor understanding of the effectiveness of the methods in practice. We present an evaluation framework to assess constrained decoding approaches across three critical dimensions: efficiency in generating constraint-compliant outputs, coverage of diverse constraint types, and quality of the generated outputs. To facilitate this evaluation, we introduce JSONSchemaBench, a benchmark for constrained decoding comprising 10K real-world JSON schemas that encompass a wide range of constraints with varying complexity. We pair the benchmark with the existing official JSON Schema Test Suite and evaluate six state-of-the-art constrained decoding frameworks, including Guidance, Outlines, Llamacpp, XGrammar, OpenAI, and Gemini. Through extensive experiments, we gain insights into the capabilities and limitations of constrained decoding on structured generation with real-world JSON schemas. Our work provides actionable insights for improving constrained decoding frameworks and structured generation tasks, setting a new standard for evaluating constrained decoding and structured generation. We release JSONSchemaBench at https://github.com/guidance-ai/jsonschemabench</description>

      <title>OpenEarthMap-SAR: A Benchmark Synthetic Aperture Radar Dataset for Global High-Resolution Land Cover Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-resolution land cover mapping plays a crucial role in addressing a wide range of global challenges, including urban planning, environmental monitoring, disaster response, and sustainable development. However, creating accurate, large-scale land cover datasets remains a significant challenge due to the inherent complexities of geospatial data, such as diverse terrain, varying sensor modalities, and atmospheric conditions. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery, with its ability to penetrate clouds and capture data in all-weather, day-and-night conditions, offers unique advantages for land cover mapping. Despite these strengths, the lack of benchmark datasets tailored for SAR imagery has limited the development of robust models specifically designed for this data modality. To bridge this gap and facilitate advancements in SAR-based geospatial analysis, we introduce OpenEarthMap-SAR, a benchmark SAR dataset, for global high-resolution land cover mapping. OpenEarthMap-SAR consists of 1.5 million segments of 5033 aerial and satellite images with the size of 1024$\times$1024 pixels, covering 35 regions from Japan, France, and the USA, with partially manually annotated and fully pseudo 8-class land cover labels at a ground sampling distance of 0.15--0.5 m. We evaluated the performance of state-of-the-art methods for semantic segmentation and present challenging problem settings suitable for further technical development. The dataset also serves the official dataset for IEEE GRSS Data Fusion Contest Track I. The dataset has been made publicly available at https://zenodo.org/records/14622048.</description>

      <title>Learn-by-interact: A Data-Centric Framework for Self-Adaptive Agents in Realistic Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10893v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs) have the potential to enhance human capabilities, assisting with digital tasks from sending emails to performing data analysis. The abilities of existing LLMs at such tasks are often hindered by the lack of high-quality agent data from the corresponding environments they interact with. We propose Learn-by-interact, a data-centric framework to adapt LLM agents to any given environments without human annotations. Learn-by-interact synthesizes trajectories of agent-environment interactions based on documentations, and constructs instructions by summarizing or abstracting the interaction histories, a process called backward construction. We assess the quality of our synthetic data by using them in both training-based scenarios and training-free in-context learning (ICL), where we craft innovative retrieval approaches optimized for agents. Extensive experiments on SWE-bench, WebArena, OSWorld and Spider2-V spanning across realistic coding, web, and desktop environments show the effectiveness of Learn-by-interact in various downstream agentic tasks -- baseline results are improved by up to 12.2\% for ICL with Claude-3.5 and 19.5\% for training with Codestral-22B. We further demonstrate the critical role of backward construction, which provides up to 14.0\% improvement for training. Our ablation studies demonstrate the efficiency provided by our synthesized data in ICL and the superiority of our retrieval pipeline over alternative approaches like conventional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). We expect that Learn-by-interact will serve as a foundation for agent data synthesis as LLMs are increasingly deployed at real-world environments.</description>

Abstract: Generative AI and large language models (LLMs) are transforming security by automating many tasks being performed manually. With such automation changing the practice of security as we know it, it is imperative that we prepare future students for the technology landscape they will ultimately face. Towards this end, we describe an initial curriculum and course that attempts to show students how to apply generative AI in order to solve problems in security. By refocusing security education and training on aspects uniquely suited for humans and showing students how to leverage automation for the rest, we believe we can better align security education practices with generative AI as it evolves.</description>

      <title>Decomposing and Fusing Intra- and Inter-Sensor Spatio-Temporal Signal for Multi-Sensor Wearable Human Activity Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wearable Human Activity Recognition (WHAR) is a prominent research area within ubiquitous computing. Multi-sensor synchronous measurement has proven to be more effective for WHAR than using a single sensor. However, existing WHAR methods use shared convolutional kernels for indiscriminate temporal feature extraction across each sensor variable, which fails to effectively capture spatio-temporal relationships of intra-sensor and inter-sensor variables. We propose the DecomposeWHAR model consisting of a decomposition phase and a fusion phase to better model the relationships between modality variables. The decomposition creates high-dimensional representations of each intra-sensor variable through the improved Depth Separable Convolution to capture local temporal features while preserving their unique characteristics. The fusion phase begins by capturing relationships between intra-sensor variables and fusing their features at both the channel and variable levels. Long-range temporal dependencies are modeled using the State Space Model (SSM), and later cross-sensor interactions are dynamically captured through a self-attention mechanism, highlighting inter-sensor spatial correlations. Our model demonstrates superior performance on three widely used WHAR datasets, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art models while maintaining acceptable computational efficiency. Our codes and supplementary materials are available at https://github.com/Anakin2555/DecomposeWHAR.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Target Localization under Uncertainty using Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning with Knowledge Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Target localization is a critical task in sensitive applications, where multiple sensing agents communicate and collaborate to identify the target location based on sensor readings. Existing approaches investigated the use of Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL) to tackle target localization. Nevertheless, these methods do not consider practical uncertainties, like false alarms when the target does not exist or when it is unreachable due to environmental complexities. To address these drawbacks, this work proposes a novel MADRL-based method for target localization in uncertain environments. The proposed MADRL method employs Proximal Policy Optimization to optimize the decision-making of sensing agents, which is represented in the form of an actor-critic structure using Convolutional Neural Networks. The observations of the agents are designed in an optimized manner to capture essential information in the environment, and a team-based reward functions is proposed to produce cooperative agents. The MADRL method covers three action dimensionalities that control the agents' mobility to search the area for the target, detect its existence, and determine its reachability. Using the concept of Transfer Learning, a Deep Learning model builds on the knowledge from the MADRL model to accurately estimating the target location if it is unreachable, resulting in shared representations between the models for faster learning and lower computational complexity. Collectively, the final combined model is capable of searching for the target, determining its existence and reachability, and estimating its location accurately. The proposed method is tested using a radioactive target localization environment and benchmarked against existing methods, showing its efficacy.</description>

      <title>Generative Physical AI in Vision: A Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) has rapidly advanced the field of computer vision by enabling machines to create and interpret visual data with unprecedented sophistication. This transformation builds upon a foundation of generative models to produce realistic images, videos, and 3D or 4D content. Traditionally, generative models primarily focus on visual fidelity while often neglecting the physical plausibility of generated content. This gap limits their effectiveness in applications requiring adherence to real-world physical laws, such as robotics, autonomous systems, and scientific simulations. As generative AI evolves to increasingly integrate physical realism and dynamic simulation, its potential to function as a "world simulator" expands-enabling the modeling of interactions governed by physics and bridging the divide between virtual and physical realities. This survey systematically reviews this emerging field of physics-aware generative AI in computer vision, categorizing methods based on how they incorporate physical knowledge-either through explicit simulation or implicit learning. We analyze key paradigms, discuss evaluation protocols, and identify future research directions. By offering a comprehensive overview, this survey aims to help future developments in physically grounded generation for vision. The reviewed papers are summarized at https://github.com/BestJunYu/Awesome-Physics-aware-Generation.</description>

      <title>TSVC:Tripartite Learning with Semantic Variation Consistency for Robust Image-Text Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cross-modal retrieval maps data under different modality via semantic relevance. Existing approaches implicitly assume that data pairs are well-aligned and ignore the widely existing annotation noise, i.e., noisy correspondence (NC). Consequently, it inevitably causes performance degradation. Despite attempts that employ the co-teaching paradigm with identical architectures to provide distinct data perspectives, the differences between these architectures are primarily stemmed from random initialization. Thus, the model becomes increasingly homogeneous along with the training process. Consequently, the additional information brought by this paradigm is severely limited. In order to resolve this problem, we introduce a Tripartite learning with Semantic Variation Consistency (TSVC) for robust image-text retrieval. We design a tripartite cooperative learning mechanism comprising a Coordinator, a Master, and an Assistant model. The Coordinator distributes data, and the Assistant model supports the Master model's noisy label prediction with diverse data. Moreover, we introduce a soft label estimation method based on mutual information variation, which quantifies the noise in new samples and assigns corresponding soft labels. We also present a new loss function to enhance robustness and optimize training effectiveness. Extensive experiments on three widely used datasets demonstrate that, even at increasing noise ratios, TSVC exhibits significant advantages in retrieval accuracy and maintains stable training performance.</description>

      <title>Blockchain-assisted Demonstration Cloning for Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MDRL) is a promising research area in which agents learn complex behaviors in cooperative or competitive environments. However, MDRL comes with several challenges that hinder its usability, including sample efficiency, curse of dimensionality, and environment exploration. Recent works proposing Federated Reinforcement Learning (FRL) to tackle these issues suffer from problems related to model restrictions and maliciousness. Other proposals using reward shaping require considerable engineering and could lead to local optima. In this paper, we propose a novel Blockchain-assisted Multi-Expert Demonstration Cloning (MEDC) framework for MDRL. The proposed method utilizes expert demonstrations in guiding the learning of new MDRL agents, by suggesting exploration actions in the environment. A model sharing framework on Blockchain is designed to allow users to share their trained models, which can be allocated as expert models to requesting users to aid in training MDRL systems. A Consortium Blockchain is adopted to enable traceable and autonomous execution without the need for a single trusted entity. Smart Contracts are designed to manage users and models allocation, which are shared using IPFS. The proposed framework is tested on several applications, and is benchmarked against existing methods in FRL, Reward Shaping, and Imitation Learning-assisted RL. The results show the outperformance of the proposed framework in terms of learning speed and resiliency to faulty and malicious models.</description>

      <title>InsQABench: Benchmarking Chinese Insurance Domain Question Answering with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The application of large language models (LLMs) has achieved remarkable success in various fields, but their effectiveness in specialized domains like the Chinese insurance industry remains underexplored. The complexity of insurance knowledge, encompassing specialized terminology and diverse data types, poses significant challenges for both models and users. To address this, we introduce InsQABench, a benchmark dataset for the Chinese insurance sector, structured into three categories: Insurance Commonsense Knowledge, Insurance Structured Database, and Insurance Unstructured Documents, reflecting real-world insurance question-answering tasks.We also propose two methods, SQL-ReAct and RAG-ReAct, to tackle challenges in structured and unstructured data tasks. Evaluations show that while LLMs struggle with domain-specific terminology and nuanced clause texts, fine-tuning on InsQABench significantly improves performance. Our benchmark establishes a solid foundation for advancing LLM applications in the insurance domain, with data and code available at https://github.com/HaileyFamo/InsQABench.git.</description>

      <title>MARIO: A Mixed Annotation Framework For Polyp Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing polyp segmentation models are limited by high labeling costs and the small size of datasets. Additionally, vast polyp datasets remain underutilized because these models typically rely on a single type of annotation. To address this dilemma, we introduce MARIO, a mixed supervision model designed to accommodate various annotation types, significantly expanding the range of usable data. MARIO learns from underutilized datasets by incorporating five forms of supervision: pixel-level, box-level, polygon-level, scribblelevel, and point-level. Each form of supervision is associated with a tailored loss that effectively leverages the supervision labels while minimizing the noise. This allows MARIO to move beyond the constraints of relying on a single annotation type. Furthermore, MARIO primarily utilizes dataset with weak and cheap annotations, reducing the dependence on large-scale, fully annotated ones. Experimental results across five benchmark datasets demonstrate that MARIO consistently outperforms existing methods, highlighting its efficacy in balancing trade-offs between different forms of supervision and maximizing polyp segmentation performance</description>

      <title>DC-PCN: Point Cloud Completion Network with Dual-Codebook Guided Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Point cloud completion aims to reconstruct complete 3D shapes from partial 3D point clouds. With advancements in deep learning techniques, various methods for point cloud completion have been developed. Despite achieving encouraging results, a significant issue remains: these methods often overlook the variability in point clouds sampled from a single 3D object surface. This variability can lead to ambiguity and hinder the achievement of more precise completion results. Therefore, in this study, we introduce a novel point cloud completion network, namely Dual-Codebook Point Completion Network (DC-PCN), following an encder-decoder pipeline. The primary objective of DC-PCN is to formulate a singular representation of sampled point clouds originating from the same 3D surface. DC-PCN introduces a dual-codebook design to quantize point-cloud representations from a multilevel perspective. It consists of an encoder-codebook and a decoder-codebook, designed to capture distinct point cloud patterns at shallow and deep levels. Additionally, to enhance the information flow between these two codebooks, we devise an information exchange mechanism. This approach ensures that crucial features and patterns from both shallow and deep levels are effectively utilized for completion. Extensive experiments on the PCN, ShapeNet\_Part, and ShapeNet34 datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method.</description>

      <title>Advancing General Multimodal Capability of Vision-language Models with Pyramid-descent Visual Position Encoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision-language Models (VLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in advancing general artificial intelligence, yet the irrational encoding of visual positions persists in inhibiting the models' comprehensive perception performance across different levels of granularity. In this work, we propose Pyramid-descent Visual Position Encoding (PyPE), a novel approach designed to enhance the perception of visual tokens within VLMs. By assigning visual position indexes from the periphery to the center and expanding the central receptive field incrementally, PyPE addresses the limitations of traditional raster-scan methods and mitigates the long-term decay effects induced by Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE). Our method reduces the relative distance between interrelated visual elements and instruction tokens, promoting a more rational allocation of attention weights and allowing for a multi-granularity perception of visual elements and countering the over-reliance on anchor tokens. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that PyPE consistently improves the general capabilities of VLMs across various sizes. Code is available at https://github.com/SakuraTroyChen/PyPE.</description>

      <title>The Alternative Annotator Test for LLM-as-a-Judge: How to Statistically Justify Replacing Human Annotators with LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The "LLM-as-a-judge" paradigm employs Large Language Models (LLMs) as annotators and evaluators in tasks traditionally performed by humans. LLM annotations are widely used, not only in NLP research but also in fields like medicine, psychology, and social science. Despite their role in shaping study results and insights, there is no standard or rigorous procedure to determine whether LLMs can replace human annotators. In this paper, we propose a novel statistical procedure -- the Alternative Annotator Test (alt-test) -- that requires only a modest subset of annotated examples to justify using LLM annotations. Additionally, we introduce a versatile and interpretable measure for comparing LLM judges. To demonstrate our procedure, we curated a diverse collection of ten datasets, consisting of language and vision-language tasks, and conducted experiments with six LLMs and four prompting techniques. Our results show that LLMs can sometimes replace humans with closed-source LLMs (such as GPT-4o), outperforming open-source LLMs, and that prompting techniques yield judges of varying quality. We hope this study encourages more rigorous and reliable practices.</description>

      <title>GREEN-CODE: Optimizing Energy Efficiency in Large Language Models for Code Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are becoming integral to daily life, showcasing their vast potential across various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. Beyond NLP, LLMs are increasingly used in software development tasks, such as code completion, modification, bug fixing, and code translation. Software engineers widely use tools like GitHub Copilot and Amazon Q, streamlining workflows and automating tasks with high accuracy. While the resource and energy intensity of LLM training is often highlighted, inference can be even more resource-intensive over time, as it's a continuous process with a high number of invocations. Therefore, developing resource-efficient alternatives for LLM inference is crucial for sustainability. This work proposes GREEN-CODE, a framework for energy-aware code generation in LLMs. GREEN-CODE performs dynamic early exit during LLM inference. We train a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent that learns to balance the trade-offs between accuracy, latency, and energy consumption. Our approach is evaluated on two open-source LLMs, Llama 3.2 3B and OPT 2.7B, using the JavaCorpus and PY150 datasets. Results show that our method reduces the energy consumption between 23-50 % on average for code generation tasks without significantly affecting accuracy.</description>

      <title>AdaptiveLog: An Adaptive Log Analysis Framework with the Collaboration of Large and Small Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automated log analysis is crucial to ensure high availability and reliability of complex systems. The advent of LLMs in NLP has ushered in a new era of language model-driven automated log analysis, garnering significant interest. Within this field, two primary paradigms based on language models for log analysis have become prominent. Small Language Models (SLMs) follow the pre-train and fine-tune paradigm, focusing on the specific log analysis task through fine-tuning on supervised datasets. On the other hand, LLMs following the in-context learning paradigm, analyze logs by providing a few examples in prompt contexts without updating parameters. Despite their respective strengths, we notice that SLMs are more cost-effective but less powerful, whereas LLMs with large parameters are highly powerful but expensive and inefficient. To trade-off between the performance and inference costs of both models in automated log analysis, this paper introduces an adaptive log analysis framework known as AdaptiveLog, which effectively reduces the costs associated with LLM while ensuring superior results. This framework collaborates an LLM and a small language model, strategically allocating the LLM to tackle complex logs while delegating simpler logs to the SLM. Specifically, to efficiently query the LLM, we propose an adaptive selection strategy based on the uncertainty estimation of the SLM, where the LLM is invoked only when the SLM is uncertain. In addition, to enhance the reasoning ability of the LLM in log analysis tasks, we propose a novel prompt strategy by retrieving similar error-prone cases as the reference, enabling the model to leverage past error experiences and learn solutions from these cases. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AdaptiveLog achieves state-of-the-art results across different tasks, elevating the overall accuracy of log analysis while maintaining cost efficiency.</description>

      <title>BF-STVSR: B-Splines and Fourier-Best Friends for High Fidelity Spatial-Temporal Video Super-Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Enhancing low-resolution, low-frame-rate videos to high-resolution, high-frame-rate quality is essential for a seamless user experience, motivating advancements in Continuous Spatial-Temporal Video Super Resolution (C-STVSR). While prior methods employ Implicit Neural Representation (INR) for continuous encoding, they often struggle to capture the complexity of video data, relying on simple coordinate concatenation and pre-trained optical flow network for motion representation. Interestingly, we find that adding position encoding, contrary to common observations, does not improve-and even degrade performance. This issue becomes particularly pronounced when combined with pre-trained optical flow networks, which can limit the model's flexibility. To address these issues, we propose BF-STVSR, a C-STVSR framework with two key modules tailored to better represent spatial and temporal characteristics of video: 1) B-spline Mapper for smooth temporal interpolation, and 2) Fourier Mapper for capturing dominant spatial frequencies. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art PSNR and SSIM performance, showing enhanced spatial details and natural temporal consistency.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this research, we advanced a spoken language recognition system, moving beyond traditional feature vector-based models. Our improvements focused on effectively capturing language characteristics over extended periods using a specialized pooling layer. We utilized a broad dataset range from Common-Voice, targeting ten languages across Indo-European, Semitic, and East Asian families. The major innovation involved optimizing the architecture of Time Delay Neural Networks. We introduced additional layers and restructured these networks into a funnel shape, enhancing their ability to process complex linguistic patterns. A rigorous grid search determined the optimal settings for these networks, significantly boosting their efficiency in language pattern recognition from audio samples. The model underwent extensive training, including a phase with augmented data, to refine its capabilities. The culmination of these efforts is a highly accurate system, achieving a 97\% accuracy rate in language recognition. This advancement represents a notable contribution to artificial intelligence, specifically in improving the accuracy and efficiency of language processing systems, a critical aspect in the engineering of advanced speech recognition technologies.</description>

      <title>IntellAgent: A Multi-Agent Framework for Evaluating Conversational AI Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming artificial intelligence, evolving into task-oriented systems capable of autonomous planning and execution. One of the primary applications of LLMs is conversational AI systems, which must navigate multi-turn dialogues, integrate domain-specific APIs, and adhere to strict policy constraints. However, evaluating these agents remains a significant challenge, as traditional methods fail to capture the complexity and variability of real-world interactions. We introduce IntellAgent, a scalable, open-source multi-agent framework designed to evaluate conversational AI systems comprehensively. IntellAgent automates the creation of diverse, synthetic benchmarks by combining policy-driven graph modeling, realistic event generation, and interactive user-agent simulations. This innovative approach provides fine-grained diagnostics, addressing the limitations of static and manually curated benchmarks with coarse-grained metrics. IntellAgent represents a paradigm shift in evaluating conversational AI. By simulating realistic, multi-policy scenarios across varying levels of complexity, IntellAgent captures the nuanced interplay of agent capabilities and policy constraints. Unlike traditional methods, it employs a graph-based policy model to represent relationships, likelihoods, and complexities of policy interactions, enabling highly detailed diagnostics. IntellAgent also identifies critical performance gaps, offering actionable insights for targeted optimization. Its modular, open-source design supports seamless integration of new domains, policies, and APIs, fostering reproducibility and community collaboration. Our findings demonstrate that IntellAgent serves as an effective framework for advancing conversational AI by addressing challenges in bridging research and deployment.

      <title>Federated Deep Reinforcement Learning for Energy Efficient Multi-Functional RIS-Assisted Low-Earth Orbit Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, a novel network architecture that deploys the multi-functional reconfigurable intelligent surface (MF-RIS) in low-Earth orbit (LEO) is proposed. Unlike traditional RIS with only signal reflection capability, the MF-RIS can reflect, refract, and amplify signals, as well as harvest energy from wireless signals. Given the high energy demands in shadow regions where solar energy is unavailable, MF-RIS is deployed in LEO to enhance signal coverage and improve energy efficiency (EE). To address this, we formulate a long-term EE optimization problem by determining the optimal parameters for MF-RIS configurations, including amplification and phase-shifts, energy harvesting ratios, and LEO transmit beamforming. To address the complex non-convex and non-linear problem, a federated learning enhanced multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (FEMAD) scheme is designed. Multi-agent DDPG of each agent can provide the optimal action policy from its interaction to environments, whereas federated learning enables the hidden information exchange among multi-agents. In numerical results, we can observe significant EE improvements compared to the other benchmarks, including centralized deep reinforcement learning as well as distributed multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG). Additionally, the proposed LEO-MF-RIS architecture has demonstrated its effectiveness, achieving the highest EE performance compared to the scenarios of fixed/no energy harvesting in MF-RIS, traditional reflection-only RIS, and deployment without RISs/MF-RISs.</description>

      <title>Can LLM Generate Regression Tests for Software Commits?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown tremendous promise in automated software engineering. In this paper, we investigate the opportunities of LLMs for automatic regression test generation for programs that take highly structured, human-readable inputs, such as XML parsers or JavaScript interpreters. Concretely, we explore the following regression test generation scenarios for such programs that have so far been difficult to test automatically in the absence of corresponding input grammars:
  $\bullet$ Bug finding. Given a code change (e.g., a commit or pull request), our LLM-based approach generates a test case with the objective of revealing any bugs that might be introduced if that change is applied.
  $\bullet$ Patch testing. Given a patch, our LLM-based approach generates a test case that fails before but passes after the patch. This test can be added to the regression test suite to catch similar bugs in the future.
  We implement Cleverest, a feedback-directed, zero-shot LLM-based regression test generation technique, and evaluate its effectiveness on 22 commits to three subject programs: Mujs, Libxml2, and Poppler. For programs using more human-readable file formats, like XML or JavaScript, we found Cleverest performed very well. It generated easy-to-understand bug-revealing or bug-reproduction test cases for the majority of commits in just under three minutes -- even when only the code diff or commit message (unless it was too vague) was given. For programs with more compact file formats, like PDF, as expected, it struggled to generate effective test cases. However, the LLM-supplied test cases are not very far from becoming effective (e.g., when used as a seed by a greybox fuzzer or as a starting point by the developer).</description>

      <title>Leveraging counterfactual concepts for debugging and improving CNN model performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Counterfactual explanation methods have recently received significant attention for explaining CNN-based image classifiers due to their ability to provide easily understandable explanations that align more closely with human reasoning. However, limited attention has been given to utilizing explainability methods to improve model performance. In this paper, we propose to leverage counterfactual concepts aiming to enhance the performance of CNN models in image classification tasks. Our proposed approach utilizes counterfactual reasoning to identify crucial filters used in the decision-making process. Following this, we perform model retraining through the design of a novel methodology and loss functions that encourage the activation of class-relevant important filters and discourage the activation of irrelevant filters for each class. This process effectively minimizes the deviation of activation patterns of local predictions and the global activation patterns of their respective inferred classes. By incorporating counterfactual explanations, we validate unseen model predictions and identify misclassifications. The proposed methodology provides insights into potential weaknesses and biases in the model's learning process, enabling targeted improvements and enhanced performance. Experimental results on publicly available datasets have demonstrated an improvement of 1-2\%, validating the effectiveness of the approach.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Suicidal Ideation Detection from Social Media Using a CNN-BiLSTM Hybrid Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Suicidal ideation detection is crucial for preventing suicides, a leading cause of death worldwide. Many individuals express suicidal thoughts on social media, offering a vital opportunity for early detection through advanced machine learning techniques. The identification of suicidal ideation in social media text is improved by utilising a hybrid framework that integrates Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM), enhanced with an attention mechanism. To enhance the interpretability of the model's predictions, Explainable AI (XAI) methods are applied, with a particular focus on SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), are incorporated. At first, the model managed to reach an accuracy of 92.81%. By applying fine-tuning and early stopping techniques, the accuracy improved to 94.29%. The SHAP analysis revealed key features influencing the model's predictions, such as terms related to mental health struggles. This level of transparency boosts the model's credibility while helping mental health professionals understand and trust the predictions. This work highlights the potential for improving the accuracy and interpretability of detecting suicidal tendencies, making a valuable contribution to the progress of mental health monitoring systems. It emphasizes the significance of blending powerful machine learning methods with explainability to develop reliable and impactful mental health solutions.</description>

      <title>ChaosEater: Fully Automating Chaos Engineering with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chaos Engineering (CE) is an engineering technique aimed at improving the resiliency of distributed systems. It involves artificially injecting specific failures into a distributed system and observing its behavior in response. Based on the observation, the system can be proactively improved to handle those failures. Recent CE tools realize the automated execution of predefined CE experiments. However, defining these experiments and reconfiguring the system after the experiments still remain manual. To reduce the costs of the manual operations, we propose \textsc{ChaosEater}, a \textit{system} for automating the entire CE operations with Large Language Models (LLMs). It pre-defines the general flow according to the systematic CE cycle and assigns subdivided operations within the flow to LLMs. We assume systems based on Infrastructure as Code (IaC), wherein the system configurations and artificial failures are managed through code. Hence, the LLMs' operations in our \textit{system} correspond to software engineering tasks, including requirement definition, code generation and debugging, and testing. We validate our \textit{system} through case studies on both small and large systems. The results demonstrate that our \textit{system} significantly reduces both time and monetary costs while completing reasonable single CE cycles.</description>

      <title>Clinical trial cohort selection using Large Language Models on n2c2 Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Clinical trials are a critical process in the medical field for introducing new treatments and innovations. However, cohort selection for clinical trials is a time-consuming process that often requires manual review of patient text records for specific keywords. Though there have been studies on standardizing the information across the various platforms, Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools remain crucial for spotting eligibility criteria in textual reports. Recently, pre-trained large language models (LLMs) have gained popularity for various NLP tasks due to their ability to acquire a nuanced understanding of text. In this paper, we study the performance of large language models on clinical trial cohort selection and leverage the n2c2 challenges to benchmark their performance. Our results are promising with regard to the incorporation of LLMs for simple cohort selection tasks, but also highlight the difficulties encountered by these models as soon as fine-grained knowledge and reasoning are required.</description>

      <title>Tell me about yourself: LLMs are aware of their learned behaviors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study behavioral self-awareness -- an LLM's ability to articulate its behaviors without requiring in-context examples. We finetune LLMs on datasets that exhibit particular behaviors, such as (a) making high-risk economic decisions, and (b) outputting insecure code. Despite the datasets containing no explicit descriptions of the associated behavior, the finetuned LLMs can explicitly describe it. For example, a model trained to output insecure code says, ``The code I write is insecure.'' Indeed, models show behavioral self-awareness for a range of behaviors and for diverse evaluations. Note that while we finetune models to exhibit behaviors like writing insecure code, we do not finetune them to articulate their own behaviors -- models do this without any special training or examples.
  Behavioral self-awareness is relevant for AI safety, as models could use it to proactively disclose problematic behaviors. In particular, we study backdoor policies, where models exhibit unexpected behaviors only under certain trigger conditions. We find that models can sometimes identify whether or not they have a backdoor, even without its trigger being present. However, models are not able to directly output their trigger by default.
  Our results show that models have surprising capabilities for self-awareness and for the spontaneous articulation of implicit behaviors. Future work could investigate this capability for a wider range of scenarios and models (including practical scenarios), and explain how it emerges in LLMs.</description>

Abstract: This paper introduces a new suite of question answering datasets for Norwegian; NorOpenBookQA, NorCommonSenseQA, NorTruthfulQA, and NRK-Quiz-QA. The data covers a wide range of skills and knowledge domains, including world knowledge, commonsense reasoning, truthfulness, and knowledge about Norway. Covering both of the written standards of Norwegian - Bokm{\aa}l and Nynorsk - our datasets comprise over 10k question-answer pairs, created by native speakers. We detail our dataset creation approach and present the results of evaluating 11 language models (LMs) in zero- and few-shot regimes. Most LMs perform better in Bokm{\aa}l than Nynorsk, struggle most with commonsense reasoning, and are often untruthful in generating answers to questions. All our datasets and annotation materials are publicly available.</description>

      <title>Playing the Lottery With Concave Regularizers for Sparse Trainable Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The design of sparse neural networks, i.e., of networks with a reduced number of parameters, has been attracting increasing research attention in the last few years. The use of sparse models may significantly reduce the computational and storage footprint in the inference phase. In this context, the lottery ticket hypothesis (LTH) constitutes a breakthrough result, that addresses not only the performance of the inference phase, but also of the training phase. It states that it is possible to extract effective sparse subnetworks, called winning tickets, that can be trained in isolation. The development of effective methods to play the lottery, i.e., to find winning tickets, is still an open problem. In this article, we propose a novel class of methods to play the lottery. The key point is the use of concave regularization to promote the sparsity of a relaxed binary mask, which represents the network topology. We theoretically analyze the effectiveness of the proposed method in the convex framework. Then, we propose extended numerical tests on various datasets and architectures, that show that the proposed method can improve the performance of state-of-the-art algorithms.</description>

      <title>CLOFAI: A Dataset of Real And Fake Image Classification Tasks for Continual Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative AI models capable of creating realistic media has led to a need for classifiers that can accurately distinguish between genuine and artificially-generated images. A significant challenge for these classifiers emerges when they encounter images from generative models that are not represented in their training data, usually resulting in diminished performance. A typical approach is to periodically update the classifier's training data with images from the new generative models then retrain the classifier on the updated dataset. However, in some real-life scenarios, storage, computational, or privacy constraints render this approach impractical. Additionally, models used in security applications may be required to rapidly adapt. In these circumstances, continual learning provides a promising alternative, as the classifier can be updated without retraining on the entire dataset. In this paper, we introduce a new dataset called CLOFAI (Continual Learning On Fake and Authentic Images), which takes the form of a domain-incremental image classification problem. Moreover, we showcase the applicability of this dataset as a benchmark for evaluating continual learning methodologies. In doing this, we set a baseline on our novel dataset using three foundational continual learning methods -- EWC, GEM, and Experience Replay -- and find that EWC performs poorly, while GEM and Experience Replay show promise, performing significantly better than a Naive baseline. The dataset and code to run the experiments can be accessed from the following GitHub repository: https://github.com/Will-Doherty/CLOFAI.</description>

      <title>AIMA at SemEval-2024 Task 10: History-Based Emotion Recognition in Hindi-English Code-Mixed Conversations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we introduce a solution to the SemEval 2024 Task 10 on subtask 1, dedicated to Emotion Recognition in Conversation (ERC) in code-mixed Hindi-English conversations. ERC in code-mixed conversations presents unique challenges, as existing models are typically trained on monolingual datasets and may not perform well on code-mixed data. To address this, we propose a series of models that incorporate both the previous and future context of the current utterance, as well as the sequential information of the conversation. To facilitate the processing of code-mixed data, we developed a Hinglish-to-English translation pipeline to translate the code-mixed conversations into English. We designed four different base models, each utilizing powerful pre-trained encoders to extract features from the input but with varying architectures. By ensembling all of these models, we developed a final model that outperforms all other baselines.</description>

      <title>AIMA at SemEval-2024 Task 3: Simple Yet Powerful Emotion Cause Pair Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The SemEval-2024 Task 3 presents two subtasks focusing on emotion-cause pair extraction within conversational contexts. Subtask 1 revolves around the extraction of textual emotion-cause pairs, where causes are defined and annotated as textual spans within the conversation. Conversely, Subtask 2 extends the analysis to encompass multimodal cues, including language, audio, and vision, acknowledging instances where causes may not be exclusively represented in the textual data. Our proposed model for emotion-cause analysis is meticulously structured into three core segments: (i) embedding extraction, (ii) cause-pair extraction &amp; emotion classification, and (iii) cause extraction using QA after finding pairs. Leveraging state-of-the-art techniques and fine-tuning on task-specific datasets, our model effectively unravels the intricate web of conversational dynamics and extracts subtle cues signifying causality in emotional expressions. Our team, AIMA, demonstrated strong performance in the SemEval-2024 Task 3 competition. We ranked as the 10th in subtask 1 and the 6th in subtask 2 out of 23 teams.</description>

      <title>Counteracting temporal attacks in Video Copy Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Video Copy Detection (VCD) plays a crucial role in copyright protection and content verification by identifying duplicates and near-duplicates in large-scale video databases. The META AI Challenge on video copy detection provided a benchmark for evaluating state-of-the-art methods, with the Dual-level detection approach emerging as a winning solution. This method integrates Video Editing Detection and Frame Scene Detection to handle adversarial transformations and large datasets efficiently. However, our analysis reveals significant limitations in the VED component, particularly in its ability to handle exact copies. Moreover, Dual-level detection shows vulnerability to temporal attacks. To address it, we propose an improved frame selection strategy based on local maxima of interframe differences, which enhances robustness against adversarial temporal modifications while significantly reducing computational overhead. Our method achieves an increase of 1.4 to 5.8 times in efficiency over the standard 1 FPS approach. Compared to Dual-level detection method, our approach maintains comparable micro-average precision ($\mu$AP) while also demonstrating improved robustness against temporal attacks. Given 56\% reduced representation size and the inference time of more than 2 times faster, our approach is more suitable to real-world resource restriction.</description>

      <title>ProKeR: A Kernel Perspective on Few-Shot Adaptation of Large Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growing popularity of Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) has led to its widespread application in various visual downstream tasks. To enhance CLIP's effectiveness and versatility, efficient few-shot adaptation techniques have been widely adopted. Among these approaches, training-free methods, particularly caching methods exemplified by Tip-Adapter, have gained attention for their lightweight adaptation without the need for additional fine-tuning. In this paper, we revisit Tip-Adapter from a kernel perspective, showing that caching methods function as local adapters and are connected to a well-established kernel literature. Drawing on this insight, we offer a theoretical understanding of how these methods operate and suggest multiple avenues for enhancing the Tip-Adapter baseline. Notably, our analysis shows the importance of incorporating global information in local adapters. Therefore, we subsequently propose a global method that learns a proximal regularizer in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) using CLIP as a base learner. Our method, which we call ProKeR (Proximal Kernel ridge Regression), has a closed form solution and achieves state-of-the-art performances across 11 datasets in the standard few-shot adaptation benchmark.</description>

      <title>Can Safety Fine-Tuning Be More Principled? Lessons Learned from Cybersecurity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As LLMs develop increasingly advanced capabilities, there is an increased need to minimize the harm that could be caused to society by certain model outputs; hence, most LLMs have safety guardrails added, for example via fine-tuning. In this paper, we argue the position that current safety fine-tuning is very similar to a traditional cat-and-mouse game (or arms race) between attackers and defenders in cybersecurity. Model jailbreaks and attacks are patched with bandaids to target the specific attack mechanism, but many similar attack vectors might remain. When defenders are not proactively coming up with principled mechanisms, it becomes very easy for attackers to sidestep any new defenses. We show how current defenses are insufficient to prevent new adversarial jailbreak attacks, reward hacking, and loss of control problems. In order to learn from past mistakes in cybersecurity, we draw analogies with historical examples and develop lessons learned that can be applied to LLM safety. These arguments support the need for new and more principled approaches to designing safe models, which are architected for security from the beginning. We describe several such approaches from the AI literature.</description>

      <title>Leveraging GANs For Active Appearance Models Optimized Model Fitting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have gained prominence in refining model fitting tasks in computer vision, particularly in domains involving deformable models like Active Appearance Models (AAMs). This paper explores the integration of GANs to enhance the AAM fitting process, addressing challenges in optimizing nonlinear parameters associated with appearance and shape variations. By leveraging GANs' adversarial training framework, the aim is to minimize fitting errors and improve convergence rates. Achieving robust performance even in cases with high appearance variability and occlusions. Our approach demonstrates significant improvements in accuracy and computational efficiency compared to traditional optimization techniques, thus establishing GANs as a potent tool for advanced image model fitting.</description>

      <title>WSSM: Geographic-enhanced hierarchical state-space model for global station weather forecast</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Global Station Weather Forecasting (GSWF), a prominent meteorological research area, is pivotal in providing timely localized weather predictions. Despite the progress existing models have made in the overall accuracy of the GSWF, executing high-precision extreme event prediction still presents a substantial challenge. The recent emergence of state-space models, with their ability to efficiently capture continuous-time dynamics and latent states, offer potential solutions. However, early investigations indicated that Mamba underperforms in the context of GSWF, suggesting further adaptation and optimization. To tackle this problem, in this paper, we introduce Weather State-space Model (WSSM), a novel Mamba-based approach tailored for GSWF. Geographical knowledge is integrated in addition to the widely-used positional encoding to represent the absolute special-temporal position. The multi-scale time-frequency features are synthesized from coarse to fine to model the seasonal to extreme weather dynamic. Our method effectively improves the overall prediction accuracy and addresses the challenge of forecasting extreme weather events. The state-of-the-art results obtained on the Weather-5K subset underscore the efficacy of the WSSM</description>

      <title>Code Readability in the Age of Large Language Models: An Industrial Case Study from Atlassian</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Programmers spend a significant amount of time reading code during the software development process. This trend is amplified by the emergence of large language models (LLMs) that automatically generate code. However, little is known about the readability of the LLM-generated code and whether it is still important from practitioners' perspectives in this new era. In this paper, we conduct a survey to explore the practitioners' perspectives on code readability in the age of LLMs and investigate the readability of our LLM-based software development agents framework, HULA, by comparing its generated code with human-written code in real-world scenarios. Overall, the findings underscore that (1) readability remains a critical aspect of software development; (2) the readability of our LLM-generated code is comparable to human-written code, fostering the establishment of appropriate trust and driving the broad adoption of our LLM-powered software development platform.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal Air Quality Mapping in Urban Areas Using Sparse Sensor Data, Satellite Imagery, Meteorological Factors, and Spatial Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Monitoring air pollution is crucial for protecting human health from exposure to harmful substances. Traditional methods of air quality monitoring, such as ground-based sensors and satellite-based remote sensing, face limitations due to high deployment costs, sparse sensor coverage, and environmental interferences. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a framework for high-resolution spatiotemporal Air Quality Index (AQI) mapping using sparse sensor data, satellite imagery, and various spatiotemporal factors. By leveraging Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), we estimate AQI values at unmonitored locations based on both spatial and temporal dependencies. The framework incorporates a wide range of environmental features, including meteorological data, road networks, points of interest (PoIs), population density, and urban green spaces, which enhance prediction accuracy. We illustrate the use of our approach through a case study in Lahore, Pakistan, where multi-resolution data is used to generate the air quality index map at a fine spatiotemporal scale.</description>

      <title>RedStar: Does Scaling Long-CoT Data Unlock Better Slow-Reasoning Systems?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Can scaling transform reasoning? In this work, we explore the untapped potential of scaling Long Chain-of-Thought (Long-CoT) data to 1000k samples, pioneering the development of a slow-thinking model, RedStar. Through extensive experiments with various LLMs and different sizes, we uncover the ingredients for specialization and scale for Long-CoT training. Surprisingly, even smaller models show significant performance gains with limited data, revealing the sample efficiency of Long-CoT and the critical role of sample difficulty in the learning process. Our findings demonstrate that Long-CoT reasoning can be effectively triggered with just a few thousand examples, while larger models achieve unparalleled improvements. We also introduce reinforcement learning (RL)-scale training as a promising direction for advancing slow-thinking systems. RedStar shines across domains: on the MATH-Hard benchmark, RedStar-code-math boosts performance from 66.2\% to 81.6\%, and on the USA Math Olympiad (AIME), it solves 46.7\% of problems using only 21k mixed-code-math datasets. In multimodal tasks like GeoQA and MathVista-GEO, RedStar-Geo achieves competitive results with minimal Long-CoT data, outperforming other slow-thinking systems like QvQ-Preview. Compared to QwQ, RedStar strikes the perfect balance between reasoning and generalizability. Our work highlights that, with careful tuning, scaling Long-CoT can unlock extraordinary reasoning capabilities-even with limited dataset and set a new standard for slow-thinking models across diverse challenges. Our data and models are released at https://huggingface.co/RedStar-Reasoning.</description>

      <title>A Machine Learning Framework for Handling Unreliable Absence Label and Class Imbalance for Marine Stinger Beaching Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bluebottles (\textit{Physalia} spp.) are marine stingers resembling jellyfish, whose presence on Australian beaches poses a significant public risk due to their venomous nature. Understanding the environmental factors driving bluebottles ashore is crucial for mitigating their impact, and machine learning tools are to date relatively unexplored. We use bluebottle marine stinger presence/absence data from beaches in Eastern Sydney, Australia, and compare machine learning models (Multilayer Perceptron, Random Forest, and XGBoost) to identify factors influencing their presence. We address challenges such as class imbalance, class overlap, and unreliable absence data by employing data augmentation techniques, including the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE), Random Undersampling, and Synthetic Negative Approach that excludes the negative class. Our results show that SMOTE failed to resolve class overlap, but the presence-focused approach effectively handled imbalance, class overlap, and ambiguous absence data. The data attributes such as the wind direction, which is a circular variable, emerged as a key factor influencing bluebottle presence, confirming previous inference studies. However, in the absence of population dynamics, biological behaviours, and life cycles, the best predictive model appears to be Random Forests combined with Synthetic Negative Approach. This research contributes to mitigating the risks posed by bluebottles to beachgoers and provides insights into handling class overlap and unreliable negative class in environmental modelling.</description>

      <title>Question-to-Question Retrieval for Hallucination-Free Knowledge Access: An Approach for Wikipedia and Wikidata Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces an approach to question answering over knowledge bases like Wikipedia and Wikidata by performing "question-to-question" matching and retrieval from a dense vector embedding store. Instead of embedding document content, we generate a comprehensive set of questions for each logical content unit using an instruction-tuned LLM. These questions are vector-embedded and stored, mapping to the corresponding content. Vector embedding of user queries are then matched against this question vector store. The highest similarity score leads to direct retrieval of the associated article content, eliminating the need for answer generation. Our method achieves high cosine similarity ( &gt; 0.9 ) for relevant question pairs, enabling highly precise retrieval. This approach offers several advantages including computational efficiency, rapid response times, and increased scalability. We demonstrate its effectiveness on Wikipedia and Wikidata, including multimedia content through structured fact retrieval from Wikidata, opening up new pathways for multimodal question answering.</description>

      <title>Collaborative Imputation of Urban Time Series through Cross-city Meta-learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Urban time series, such as mobility flows, energy consumption, and pollution records, encapsulate complex urban dynamics and structures. However, data collection in each city is impeded by technical challenges such as budget limitations and sensor failures, necessitating effective data imputation techniques that can enhance data quality and reliability. Existing imputation models, categorized into learning-based and analytics-based paradigms, grapple with the trade-off between capacity and generalizability. Collaborative learning to reconstruct data across multiple cities holds the promise of breaking this trade-off. Nevertheless, urban data's inherent irregularity and heterogeneity issues exacerbate challenges of knowledge sharing and collaboration across cities. To address these limitations, we propose a novel collaborative imputation paradigm leveraging meta-learned implicit neural representations (INRs). INRs offer a continuous mapping from domain coordinates to target values, integrating the strengths of both paradigms. By imposing embedding theory, we first employ continuous parameterization to handle irregularity and reconstruct the dynamical system. We then introduce a cross-city collaborative learning scheme through model-agnostic meta learning, incorporating hierarchical modulation and normalization techniques to accommodate multiscale representations and reduce variance in response to heterogeneity. Extensive experiments on a diverse urban dataset from 20 global cities demonstrate our model's superior imputation performance and generalizability, underscoring the effectiveness of collaborative imputation in resource-constrained settings.</description>

      <title>Finer-CAM: Spotting the Difference Reveals Finer Details for Visual Explanation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Class activation map (CAM) has been widely used to highlight image regions that contribute to class predictions. Despite its simplicity and computational efficiency, CAM often struggles to identify discriminative regions that distinguish visually similar fine-grained classes. Prior efforts address this limitation by introducing more sophisticated explanation processes, but at the cost of extra complexity. In this paper, we propose Finer-CAM, a method that retains CAM's efficiency while achieving precise localization of discriminative regions. Our key insight is that the deficiency of CAM lies not in "how" it explains, but in "what" it explains}. Specifically, previous methods attempt to identify all cues contributing to the target class's logit value, which inadvertently also activates regions predictive of visually similar classes. By explicitly comparing the target class with similar classes and spotting their differences, Finer-CAM suppresses features shared with other classes and emphasizes the unique, discriminative details of the target class. Finer-CAM is easy to implement, compatible with various CAM methods, and can be extended to multi-modal models for accurate localization of specific concepts. Additionally, Finer-CAM allows adjustable comparison strength, enabling users to selectively highlight coarse object contours or fine discriminative details. Quantitatively, we show that masking out the top 5% of activated pixels by Finer-CAM results in a larger relative confidence drop compared to baselines. The source code and demo are available at https://github.com/Imageomics/Finer-CAM.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Virtual try-on (VTON) technology has gained attention due to its potential to transform online retail by enabling realistic clothing visualization of images and videos. However, most existing methods struggle to achieve high-quality results across image and video try-on tasks, especially in long video scenarios. In this work, we introduce CatV2TON, a simple and effective vision-based virtual try-on (V2TON) method that supports both image and video try-on tasks with a single diffusion transformer model. By temporally concatenating garment and person inputs and training on a mix of image and video datasets, CatV2TON achieves robust try-on performance across static and dynamic settings. For efficient long-video generation, we propose an overlapping clip-based inference strategy that uses sequential frame guidance and Adaptive Clip Normalization (AdaCN) to maintain temporal consistency with reduced resource demands. We also present ViViD-S, a refined video try-on dataset, achieved by filtering back-facing frames and applying 3D mask smoothing for enhanced temporal consistency. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that CatV2TON outperforms existing methods in both image and video try-on tasks, offering a versatile and reliable solution for realistic virtual try-ons across diverse scenarios.</description>

      <title>Few-shot Policy (de)composition in Conversational Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The task of policy compliance detection (PCD) is to determine if a scenario is in compliance with respect to a set of written policies. In a conversational setting, the results of PCD can indicate if clarifying questions must be asked to determine compliance status. Existing approaches usually claim to have reasoning capabilities that are latent or require a large amount of annotated data. In this work, we propose logical decomposition for policy compliance (LDPC): a neuro-symbolic framework to detect policy compliance using large language models (LLMs) in a few-shot setting. By selecting only a few exemplars alongside recently developed prompting techniques, we demonstrate that our approach soundly reasons about policy compliance conversations by extracting sub-questions to be answered, assigning truth values from contextual information, and explicitly producing a set of logic statements from the given policies. The formulation of explicit logic graphs can in turn help answer PCDrelated questions with increased transparency and explainability. We apply this approach to the popular PCD and conversational machine reading benchmark, ShARC, and show competitive performance with no task-specific finetuning. We also leverage the inherently interpretable architecture of LDPC to understand where errors occur, revealing ambiguities in the ShARC dataset and highlighting the challenges involved with reasoning for conversational question answering.</description>

Abstract: Recently, we have witnessed the rapid development of large language models, which have demonstrated excellent capabilities in the downstream task of code generation. However, despite their potential, LLM-based code generation still faces numerous technical and evaluation challenges, particularly when embedded in real-world development. In this paper, we present our vision for current research directions, and provide an in-depth analysis of existing studies on this task. We propose a six-layer vision framework that categorizes code generation process into distinct phases, namely Input Phase, Orchestration Phase, Development Phase, and Validation Phase. Additionally, we outline our vision workflow, which reflects on the currently prevalent frameworks. We systematically analyse the challenges faced by large language models, including those LLM-based agent frameworks, in code generation tasks. With these, we offer various perspectives and actionable recommendations in this area. Our aim is to provide guidelines for improving the reliability, robustness and usability of LLM-based code generation systems. Ultimately, this work seeks to address persistent challenges and to provide practical suggestions for a more pragmatic LLM-based solution for future code generation endeavors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are high-dimensional state space models capable of learning functions on sequence data. Recently, it has been conjectured that reservoir computers, a particular class of RNNs, trained on observations of a dynamical systems can be interpreted as embeddings. This result has been established for the case of linear reservoir systems. In this work, we use a nonautonomous dynamical systems approach to establish an upper bound for the fractal dimension of the subset of reservoir state space approximated during training and prediction phase. We prove that when the input sequences comes from an Nin-dimensional invertible dynamical system, the fractal dimension of this set is bounded above by Nin. The result obtained here are useful in dimensionality reduction of computation in RNNs as well as estimating fractal dimensions of dynamical systems from limited observations of their time series. It is also a step towards understanding embedding properties of reservoir computers.</description>

      <title>Federated Learning with Sample-level Client Drift Mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) suffers from severe performance degradation due to the data heterogeneity among clients. Existing works reveal that the fundamental reason is that data heterogeneity can cause client drift where the local model update deviates from the global one, and thus they usually tackle this problem from the perspective of calibrating the obtained local update. Despite effectiveness, existing methods substantially lack a deep understanding of how heterogeneous data samples contribute to the formation of client drift. In this paper, we bridge this gap by identifying that the drift can be viewed as a cumulative manifestation of biases present in all local samples and the bias between samples is different. Besides, the bias dynamically changes as the FL training progresses. Motivated by this, we propose FedBSS that first mitigates the heterogeneity issue in a sample-level manner, orthogonal to existing methods. Specifically, the core idea of our method is to adopt a bias-aware sample selection scheme that dynamically selects the samples from small biases to large epoch by epoch to train progressively the local model in each round. In order to ensure the stability of training, we set the diversified knowledge acquisition stage as the warm-up stage to avoid the local optimality caused by knowledge deviation in the early stage of the model. Evaluation results show that FedBSS outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. In addition, we also achieved effective results on feature distribution skew and noise label dataset setting, which proves that FedBSS can not only reduce heterogeneity, but also has scalability and robustness.</description>

      <title>Investigation of Whisper ASR Hallucinations Induced by Non-Speech Audio</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hallucinations of deep neural models are amongst key challenges in automatic speech recognition (ASR). In this paper, we investigate hallucinations of the Whisper ASR model induced by non-speech audio segments present during inference. By inducting hallucinations with various types of sounds, we show that there exists a set of hallucinations that appear frequently. We then study hallucinations caused by the augmentation of speech with such sounds. Finally, we describe the creation of a bag of hallucinations (BoH) that allows to remove the effect of hallucinations through the post-processing of text transcriptions. The results of our experiments show that such post-processing is capable of reducing word error rate (WER) and acts as a good safeguard against problematic hallucinations.</description>

      <title>A Truly Sparse and General Implementation of Gradient-Based Synaptic Plasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Online synaptic plasticity rules derived from gradient descent achieve high accuracy on a wide range of practical tasks. However, their software implementation often requires tediously hand-derived gradients or using gradient backpropagation which sacrifices the online capability of the rules. In this work, we present a custom automatic differentiation (AD) pipeline for sparse and online implementation of gradient-based synaptic plasticity rules that generalizes to arbitrary neuron models. Our work combines the programming ease of backpropagation-type methods for forward AD while being memory-efficient. To achieve this, we exploit the advantageous compute and memory scaling of online synaptic plasticity by providing an inherently sparse implementation of AD where expensive tensor contractions are replaced with simple element-wise multiplications if the tensors are diagonal. Gradient-based synaptic plasticity rules such as eligibility propagation (e-prop) have exactly this property and thus profit immensely from this feature. We demonstrate the alignment of our gradients with respect to gradient backpropagation on an synthetic task where e-prop gradients are exact, as well as audio speech classification benchmarks. We demonstrate how memory utilization scales with network size without dependence on the sequence length, as expected from forward AD methods.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Learning in Echo State Networks for Input Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conventional echo state networks (ESNs) require supervised learning to train the readout layer, using the desired outputs as training data. In this study, we focus on input reconstruction (IR), which refers to training the readout layer to reproduce the input time series in its output. We reformulate the learning algorithm of the ESN readout layer to perform IR using unsupervised learning (UL). By conducting theoretical analysis and numerical experiments, we demonstrate that IR in ESNs can be effectively implemented under realistic conditions without explicitly using the desired outputs as training data; in this way, UL is enabled. Furthermore, we demonstrate that applications relying on IR, such as dynamical system replication and noise filtering, can be reformulated within the UL framework. Our findings establish a theoretically sound and universally applicable IR formulation, along with its related tasks in ESNs. This work paves the way for novel predictions and highlights unresolved theoretical challenges in ESNs, particularly in the context of time-series processing methods and computational models of the brain.</description>

      <title>Generalization and Informativeness of Weighted Conformal Risk Control Under Covariate Shift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predictive models are often required to produce reliable predictions under statistical conditions that are not matched to the training data. A common type of training-testing mismatch is covariate shift, where the conditional distribution of the target variable given the input features remains fixed, while the marginal distribution of the inputs changes. Weighted conformal risk control (W-CRC) uses data collected during the training phase to convert point predictions into prediction sets with valid risk guarantees at test time despite the presence of a covariate shift. However, while W-CRC provides statistical reliability, its efficiency -- measured by the size of the prediction sets -- can only be assessed at test time. In this work, we relate the generalization properties of the base predictor to the efficiency of W-CRC under covariate shifts. Specifically, we derive a bound on the inefficiency of the W-CRC predictor that depends on algorithmic hyperparameters and task-specific quantities available at training time. This bound offers insights on relationships between the informativeness of the prediction sets, the extent of the covariate shift, and the size of the calibration and training sets. Experiments on fingerprinting-based localization validate the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Neural Contextual Reinforcement Framework for Logical Structure Language Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Neural Contextual Reinforcement Framework introduces an innovative approach to enhancing the logical coherence and structural consistency of text generated by large language models. Leveraging reinforcement learning principles, the framework integrates custom reward functions and dynamic context alignment mechanisms to address challenges inherent in maintaining long-range dependencies across extended sequences. The architecture incorporates multi-head attention layers and hierarchical encoding modules, enabling the model to produce outputs that align closely with human expectations of logical structure and semantic flow. Quantitative evaluations across diverse datasets demonstrate substantial improvements in coherence metrics, perplexity reduction, and semantic alignment, showcasing the framework's ability to outperform baseline models in both general and domain-specific tasks. Qualitative analyses further highlight the framework's capacity to generate text with improved narrative clarity and reduced redundancy, reflecting its effectiveness in balancing fluency with structural precision. In addition to its performance gains, the framework exhibits robustness in handling noisy input data and scalability across varying model sizes, reinforcing its versatility in practical applications. Experimental results reveal that optimal context window sizes significantly influence coherence outcomes, showing the importance of architectural flexibility in adapting to diverse linguistic structures. Cross-lingual performance evaluations affirm the framework's adaptability to multiple languages, extending its utility beyond monolingual contexts. Resource efficiency analyses indicate a reduction in computational overhead compared to traditional approaches, emphasizing the practicality of the framework for large-scale deployment.</description>

      <title>Multi-View Spectral Clustering for Graphs with Multiple View Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the fundamental importance of clustering, to this day, much of the relevant research is still based on ambiguous foundations, leading to an unclear understanding of whether or how the various clustering methods are connected with each other. In this work, we provide an additional stepping stone towards resolving such ambiguities by presenting a general clustering framework that subsumes a series of seemingly disparate clustering methods, including various methods belonging to the wildly popular spectral clustering framework. In fact, the generality of the proposed framework is additionally capable of shedding light to the largely unexplored area of multi-view graphs whose each view may have differently clustered nodes. In turn, we propose GenClus: a method that is simultaneously an instance of this framework and a generalization of spectral clustering, while also being closely related to k-means as well. This results in a principled alternative to the few existing methods studying this special type of multi-view graphs. Then, we conduct in-depth experiments, which demonstrate that GenClus is more computationally efficient than existing methods, while also attaining similar or better clustering performance. Lastly, a qualitative real-world case-study further demonstrates the ability of GenClus to produce meaningful clusterings.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Coronary Artery Calcium Scoring via Multi-Organ Segmentation on Non-Contrast Cardiac Computed Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite coronary artery calcium scoring being considered a largely solved problem within the realm of medical artificial intelligence, this paper argues that significant improvements can still be made. By shifting the focus from pathology detection to a deeper understanding of anatomy, the novel algorithm proposed in the paper both achieves high accuracy in coronary artery calcium scoring and offers enhanced interpretability of the results. This approach not only aids in the precise quantification of calcifications in coronary arteries, but also provides valuable insights into the underlying anatomical structures. Through this anatomically-informed methodology, the paper shows how a nuanced understanding of the heart's anatomy can lead to more accurate and interpretable results in the field of cardiovascular health. We demonstrate the superior accuracy of the proposed method by evaluating it on an open-source multi-vendor dataset, where we obtain results at the inter-observer level, surpassing the current state of the art. Finally, the qualitative analyses show the practical value of the algorithm in such tasks as labeling coronary artery calcifications, identifying aortic calcifications, and filtering out false positive detections due to noise.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have emerged as a powerful class of generative AI models, showing remarkable potential in anomaly detection (AD) tasks across various domains, such as cybersecurity, fraud detection, healthcare, and manufacturing. The intersection of these two fields, termed diffusion models for anomaly detection (DMAD), offers promising solutions for identifying deviations in increasingly complex and high-dimensional data. In this survey, we systematically review recent advances in DMAD research and investigate their capabilities. We begin by presenting the fundamental concepts of AD and DMs, followed by a comprehensive analysis of classic DM architectures including DDPMs, DDIMs, and Score SDEs. We further categorize existing DMAD methods into reconstruction-based, density-based, and hybrid approaches, providing detailed examinations of their methodological innovations. We also explore the diverse tasks across different data modalities, encompassing image, time series, video, and multimodal data analysis. Furthermore, we discuss critical challenges and emerging research directions, including computational efficiency, model interpretability, robustness enhancement, edge-cloud collaboration, and integration with large language models. The collection of DMAD research papers and resources is available at https://github.com/fdjingliu/DMAD.</description>

      <title>Improving thermal state preparation of Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model with reinforcement learning on quantum hardware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, known for its strong quantum correlations and chaotic behavior, serves as a key platform for quantum gravity studies. However, variationally preparing thermal states on near-term quantum processors for large systems (N&gt;12, where N is the number of Majorana fermions) presents a significant challenge due to the rapid growth in the complexity of parameterized quantum circuits. This paper addresses this challenge by integrating reinforcement learning (RL) with convolutional neural networks, employing an iterative approach to optimize the quantum circuit and its parameters. The refinement process is guided by a composite reward signal derived from entropy and the expectation values of the SYK Hamiltonian. This approach reduces the number of CNOT gates by two orders of magnitude for systems N&gt;10 compared to traditional methods like first-order Trotterization. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the RL framework in both noiseless and noisy quantum hardware environments, maintaining high accuracy in thermal state preparation. This work contributes to the advancement of a scalable, RL-based framework with applications for computations of thermal out-of-time-order correlators in quantum many-body systems and quantum gravity studies on near-term quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Graph-defined Language Learning with LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent efforts leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) for modeling text-attributed graph structures in node classification tasks. These approaches describe graph structures for LLMs to understand or aggregate LLM-generated textual attribute embeddings through graph structure. However, these approaches face two main limitations in modeling graph structures with LLMs. (i) Graph descriptions become verbose in describing high-order graph structure. (ii) Textual attributes alone do not contain adequate graph structure information. It is challenging to model graph structure concisely and adequately with LLMs. LLMs lack built-in mechanisms to model graph structures directly. They also struggle with complex long-range dependencies between high-order nodes and target nodes.
  Inspired by the observation that LLMs pre-trained on one language can achieve exceptional performance on another with minimal additional training, we propose \textbf{G}raph-\textbf{D}efined \textbf{L}anguage for \textbf{L}arge \textbf{L}anguage \textbf{M}odel (GDL4LLM). This novel framework enables LLMs to transfer their powerful language understanding capabilities to graph-structured data. GDL4LLM translates graphs into a graph language corpus instead of graph descriptions and pre-trains LLMs on this corpus to adequately understand graph structures. During fine-tuning, this corpus describes the structural information of target nodes concisely with only a few tokens. By treating graphs as a new language, GDL4LLM enables LLMs to model graph structures adequately and concisely for node classification tasks. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that GDL4LLM outperforms description-based and textual attribute embeddings-based baselines by efficiently modeling different orders of graph structure with LLMs.</description>

      <title>Communication-Efficient Federated Learning Based on Explanation-Guided Pruning for Remote Sensing Image Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a decentralized machine learning paradigm, where multiple clients collaboratively train a global model by exchanging only model updates with the central server without sharing the local data of clients. Due to the large volume of model updates required to be transmitted between clients and the central server, most FL systems are associated with high transfer costs (i.e., communication overhead). This issue is more critical for operational applications in remote sensing (RS), especially when large-scale RS data is processed and analyzed through FL systems with restricted communication bandwidth. To address this issue, we introduce an explanation-guided pruning strategy for communication-efficient FL in the context of RS image classification. Our pruning strategy is defined based on the layerwise relevance propagation (LRP) driven explanations to: 1) efficiently and effectively identify the most relevant and informative model parameters (to be exchanged between clients and the central server); and 2) eliminate the non-informative ones to minimize the volume of model updates. The experimental results on the BigEarthNet-S2 dataset demonstrate that our strategy effectively reduces the number of shared model updates, while increasing the generalization ability of the global model. The code of this work will be publicly available at https://git.tu-berlin.de/rsim/FL-LRP</description>

Abstract: Generative AI and large-scale language models (LLM) have emerged as powerful tools in language preservation, particularly for near-native and endangered languages. With the increasing reliance on technology for communication, education, and cultural documentation, new opportunities have emerged to mitigate the dramatic decline of linguistic diversity worldwide. This paper examines the role of generative AIs and LLMs in preserving endangered languages, highlighting the risks and challenges associated with their use. We analyze the underlying technologies driving these models, including natural language processing (NLP) and deep learning, and explore several cases where these technologies have been applied to low-resource languages. Additionally, we discuss ethical considerations, data scarcity issues, and technical challenges while proposing solutions to enhance AI-driven language preservation.</description>

      <title>Dialect2SQL: A Novel Text-to-SQL Dataset for Arabic Dialects with a Focus on Moroccan Darija</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The task of converting natural language questions (NLQs) into executable SQL queries, known as text-to-SQL, has gained significant interest in recent years, as it enables non-technical users to interact with relational databases. Many benchmarks, such as SPIDER and WikiSQL, have contributed to the development of new models and the evaluation of their performance. In addition, other datasets, like SEDE and BIRD, have introduced more challenges and complexities to better map real-world scenarios. However, these datasets primarily focus on high-resource languages such as English and Chinese. In this work, we introduce Dialect2SQL, the first large-scale, cross-domain text-to-SQL dataset in an Arabic dialect. It consists of 9,428 NLQ-SQL pairs across 69 databases in various domains. Along with SQL-related challenges such as long schemas, dirty values, and complex queries, our dataset also incorporates the complexities of the Moroccan dialect, which is known for its diverse source languages, numerous borrowed words, and unique expressions. This demonstrates that our dataset will be a valuable contribution to both the text-to-SQL community and the development of resources for low-resource languages.</description>

      <title>Technical Report for the Forgotten-by-Design Project: Targeted Obfuscation for Machine Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The right to privacy, enshrined in various human rights declarations, faces new challenges in the age of artificial intelligence (AI). This paper explores the concept of the Right to be Forgotten (RTBF) within AI systems, contrasting it with traditional data erasure methods. We introduce Forgotten by Design, a proactive approach to privacy preservation that integrates instance-specific obfuscation techniques during the AI model training process. Unlike machine unlearning, which modifies models post-training, our method prevents sensitive data from being embedded in the first place. Using the LIRA membership inference attack, we identify vulnerable data points and propose defenses that combine additive gradient noise and weighting schemes. Our experiments on the CIFAR-10 dataset demonstrate that our techniques reduce privacy risks by at least an order of magnitude while maintaining model accuracy (at 95% significance). Additionally, we present visualization methods for the privacy-utility trade-off, providing a clear framework for balancing privacy risk and model accuracy. This work contributes to the development of privacy-preserving AI systems that align with human cognitive processes of motivated forgetting, offering a robust framework for safeguarding sensitive information and ensuring compliance with privacy regulations.</description>

      <title>Meta-Instance Selection. Instance Selection as a Classification Problem with Meta-Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data pruning, or instance selection, is an important problem in machine learning especially in terms of nearest neighbour classifier. However, in data pruning which speeds up the prediction phase, there is an issue related to the speed and efficiency of the process itself. In response, the study proposes an approach involving transforming the instance selection process into a classification task conducted in a unified meta-feature space where each instance can be classified and assigned to either the "to keep" or "to remove" class. This approach requires training an appropriate meta-classifier, which can be developed based on historical instance selection results from other datasets using reference instance selection methods as a labeling tool. This work proposes constructing the meta-feature space based on properties extracted from the nearest neighbor graph. Experiments conducted on 17 datasets of varying sizes and five reference instance selection methods (ENN, Drop3, ICF, HMN-EI, and CCIS) demonstrate that the proposed solution achieves results comparable to reference instance selection methods while significantly reducing computational complexity. In the proposed approach, the computational complexity of the system depends only on identifying the k-nearest neighbors for each data sample and running the meta-classifier. Additionally, the study discusses the choice of meta-classifier, recommending the use of Balanced Random Forest.</description>

      <title>Explainable Lane Change Prediction for Near-Crash Scenarios Using Knowledge Graph Embeddings and Retrieval Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lane-changing maneuvers, particularly those executed abruptly or in risky situations, are a significant cause of road traffic accidents. However, current research mainly focuses on predicting safe lane changes. Furthermore, existing accident datasets are often based on images only and lack comprehensive sensory data. In this work, we focus on predicting risky lane changes using the CRASH dataset (our own collected dataset specifically for risky lane changes), and safe lane changes (using the HighD dataset). Then, we leverage KG and Bayesian inference to predict these maneuvers using linguistic contextual information, enhancing the model's interpretability and transparency. The model achieved a 91.5% f1-score with anticipation time extending to four seconds for risky lane changes, and a 90.0% f1-score for predicting safe lane changes with the same anticipation time. We validate our model by integrating it into a vehicle within the CARLA simulator in scenarios that involve risky lane changes. The model managed to anticipate sudden lane changes, thus providing automated vehicles with further time to plan and execute appropriate safe reactions. Finally, to enhance the explainability of our model, we utilize RAG to provide clear and natural language explanations for the given prediction.</description>

      <title>Recurrent Diffusion for Large-Scale Parameter Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parameter generation has struggled to scale up for a long time, significantly limiting its range of applications. In this study, we introduce \textbf{R}ecurrent diffusion for large-scale \textbf{P}arameter \textbf{G}eneration, called \textbf{RPG}. We first divide the trained parameters into non-overlapping parts, after which a recurrent model is proposed to learn their relationships. The recurrent model's outputs, as conditions, are then fed into a diffusion model to generate the neural network parameters. Using only a single GPU, recurrent diffusion enables us to generate popular vision and language models such as ConvNeXt-L and LoRA parameters of LLaMA-7B. Meanwhile, across various architectures and tasks, the generated parameters consistently perform comparable results over trained networks. Notably, our approach also shows the potential to generate models for handling unseen tasks, which largely increases the practicality of parameter generation. Our code is available \href{https://github.com/NUS-HPC-AI-Lab/Recurrent-Parameter-Generation}{here}.</description>

      <title>Training-free Ultra Small Model for Universal Sparse Reconstruction in Compressed Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pre-trained large models attract widespread attention in recent years, but they face challenges in applications that require high interpretability or have limited resources, such as physical sensing, medical imaging, and bioinformatics. Compressed Sensing (CS) is a well-proved theory that drives many recent breakthroughs in these applications. However, as a typical under-determined linear system, CS suffers from excessively long sparse reconstruction times when using traditional iterative methods, particularly with large-scale data. Current AI methods like deep unfolding fail to substitute them because pre-trained models exhibit poor generality beyond their training conditions and dataset distributions, or lack interpretability. Instead of following the big model fervor, this paper proposes ultra-small artificial neural models called coefficients learning (CL), enabling training-free and rapid sparse reconstruction while perfectly inheriting the generality and interpretability of traditional iterative methods, bringing new feature of incorporating prior knowledges. In CL, a signal of length $n$ only needs a minimal of $n$ trainable parameters. A case study model called CLOMP is implemented for evaluation. Experiments are conducted on both synthetic and real one-dimensional and two-dimensional signals, demonstrating significant improvements in efficiency and accuracy. Compared to representative iterative methods, CLOMP improves efficiency by 100 to 1000 folds for large-scale data. Test results on eight diverse image datasets indicate that CLOMP improves structural similarity index by 292%, 98%, 45% for sampling rates of 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, respectively. We believe this method can truly usher CS reconstruction into the AI era, benefiting countless under-determined linear systems that rely on sparse solution.</description>

      <title>Fairness Testing through Extreme Value Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data-driven software is increasingly being used as a critical component of automated decision-support systems. Since this class of software learns its logic from historical data, it can encode or amplify discriminatory practices. Previous research on algorithmic fairness has focused on improving average-case fairness. On the other hand, fairness at the extreme ends of the spectrum, which often signifies lasting and impactful shifts in societal attitudes, has received significantly less emphasis.
  Leveraging the statistics of extreme value theory (EVT), we propose a novel fairness criterion called extreme counterfactual discrimination (ECD). This criterion estimates the worst-case amounts of disadvantage in outcomes for individuals solely based on their memberships in a protected group. Utilizing tools from search-based software engineering and generative AI, we present a randomized algorithm that samples a statistically significant set of points from the tail of ML outcome distributions even if the input dataset lacks a sufficient number of relevant samples.
  We conducted several experiments on four ML models (deep neural networks, logistic regression, and random forests) over 10 socially relevant tasks from the literature on algorithmic fairness. First, we evaluate the generative AI methods and find that they generate sufficient samples to infer valid EVT distribution in 95% of cases. Remarkably, we found that the prevalent bias mitigators reduce the average-case discrimination but increase the worst-case discrimination significantly in 5% of cases. We also observed that even the tail-aware mitigation algorithm -- MiniMax-Fairness -- increased the worst-case discrimination in 30% of cases. We propose a novel ECD-based mitigator that improves fairness in the tail in 90% of cases with no degradation of the average-case discrimination.</description>

      <title>Conversation Routines: A Prompt Engineering Framework for Task-Oriented Dialog Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study introduces Conversation Routines (CR), a structured prompt engineering framework for developing task-oriented dialog systems using Large Language Models (LLMs). While LLMs demonstrate remarkable natural language understanding capabilities, engineering them to reliably execute complex business workflows remains challenging. The proposed CR framework enables the development of Conversation Agentic Systems (CAS) through natural language specifications, embedding task-oriented logic within LLM prompts. This approach provides a systematic methodology for designing and implementing complex conversational workflows while maintaining behavioral consistency. We demonstrate the framework's effectiveness through two proof of concept implementations: a Train Ticket Booking System and an Interactive Troubleshooting Copilot. These case studies validate CR's capability to encode sophisticated behavioral patterns and decision logic while preserving natural conversational flexibility. Results show that CR enables domain experts to design conversational workflows in natural language while leveraging custom enterprise functionalities (tools) developed by software engineers, creating an efficient division of responsibilities where developers focus on core API implementation and domain experts handle conversation design. While the framework shows promise in accessibility and adaptability, we identify key challenges including computational overhead, non-deterministic behavior, and domain-specific logic optimization. Future research directions include enhancing system robustness, improving scalability for complex multi-agent interactions, and addressing the identified limitations across diverse business applications.</description>

      <title>Early evidence of how LLMs outperform traditional systems on OCR/HTR tasks for historical records</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the ability of two LLMs -- GPT-4o and Claude Sonnet 3.5 -- to transcribe historical handwritten documents in a tabular format and compare their performance to traditional OCR/HTR systems: EasyOCR, Keras, Pytesseract, and TrOCR. Considering the tabular form of the data, two types of experiments are executed: one where the images are split line by line and the other where the entire scan is used as input. Based on CER and BLEU, we demonstrate that LLMs outperform the conventional OCR/HTR methods. Moreover, we also compare the evaluated CER and BLEU scores to human evaluations to better judge the outputs of whole-scan experiments and understand influential factors for CER and BLEU. Combining judgments from all the evaluation metrics, we conclude that two-shot GPT-4o for line-by-line images and two-shot Claude Sonnet 3.5 for whole-scan images yield the transcriptions of the historical records most similar to the ground truth.</description>

      <title>Noise-Agnostic Multitask Whisper Training for Reducing False Alarm Errors in Call-for-Help Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Keyword spotting is often implemented by keyword classifier to the encoder in acoustic models, enabling the classification of predefined or open vocabulary keywords. Although keyword spotting is a crucial task in various applications and can be extended to call-for-help detection in emergencies, however, the previous method often suffers from scalability limitations due to retraining required to introduce new keywords or adapt to changing contexts. We explore a simple yet effective approach that leverages off-the-shelf pretrained ASR models to address these challenges, especially in call-for-help detection scenarios. Furthermore, we observed a substantial increase in false alarms when deploying call-for-help detection system in real-world scenarios due to noise introduced by microphones or different environments. To address this, we propose a novel noise-agnostic multitask learning approach that integrates a noise classification head into the ASR encoder. Our method enhances the model's robustness to noisy environments, leading to a significant reduction in false alarms and improved overall call-for-help performance. Despite the added complexity of multitask learning, our approach is computationally efficient and provides a promising solution for call-for-help detection in real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>Biomedical Knowledge Graph: A Survey of Domains, Tasks, and Real-World Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biomedical knowledge graphs (BKGs) have emerged as powerful tools for organizing and leveraging the vast and complex data found across the biomedical field. Yet, current reviews of BKGs often limit their scope to specific domains or methods, overlooking the broader landscape and the rapid technological progress reshaping it. In this survey, we address this gap by offering a systematic review of BKGs from three core perspectives: domains, tasks, and applications. We begin by examining how BKGs are constructed from diverse data sources, including molecular interactions, pharmacological datasets, and clinical records. Next, we discuss the essential tasks enabled by BKGs, focusing on knowledge management, retrieval, reasoning, and interpretation. Finally, we highlight real-world applications in precision medicine, drug discovery, and scientific research, illustrating the translational impact of BKGs across multiple sectors. By synthesizing these perspectives into a unified framework, this survey not only clarifies the current state of BKG research but also establishes a foundation for future exploration, enabling both innovative methodological advances and practical implementations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stylistic text generation plays a vital role in enhancing communication by reflecting the nuances of individual expression. This paper presents a novel approach for generating text in a specific speaker's style across different languages. We show that by leveraging only 100 lines of text, an individuals unique style can be captured as a high-dimensional embedding, which can be used for both text generation and stylistic translation. This methodology breaks down the language barrier by transferring the style of a speaker between languages. The paper is structured into three main phases: augmenting the speaker's data with stylistically consistent external sources, separating style from content using machine learning and deep learning techniques, and generating an abstract style profile by mean pooling the learned embeddings. The proposed approach is shown to be topic-agnostic, with test accuracy and F1 scores of 74.9\% and 0.75, respectively. The results demonstrate the potential of the style profile for multilingual communication, paving the way for further applications in personalized content generation and cross-linguistic stylistic transfer.</description>

      <title>Spatially-Delineated Domain-Adapted AI Classification: An Application for Oncology Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given multi-type point maps from different place-types (e.g., tumor regions), our objective is to develop a classifier trained on the source place-type to accurately distinguish between two classes of the target place-type based on their point arrangements. This problem is societally important for many applications, such as generating clinical hypotheses for designing new immunotherapies for cancer treatment. The challenge lies in the spatial variability, the inherent heterogeneity and variation observed in spatial properties or arrangements across different locations (i.e., place-types). Previous techniques focus on self-supervised tasks to learn domain-invariant features and mitigate domain differences; however, they often neglect the underlying spatial arrangements among data points, leading to significant discrepancies across different place-types. We explore a novel multi-task self-learning framework that targets spatial arrangements, such as spatial mix-up masking and spatial contrastive predictive coding, for spatially-delineated domain-adapted AI classification. Experimental results on real-world datasets (e.g., oncology data) show that the proposed framework provides higher prediction accuracy than baseline methods.</description>

      <title>Human services organizations and the responsible integration of AI: Considering ethics and contextualizing risk(s)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper examines the responsible integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in human services organizations (HSOs), proposing a nuanced framework for evaluating AI applications across multiple dimensions of risk. The authors argue that ethical concerns about AI deployment -- including professional judgment displacement, environmental impact, model bias, and data laborer exploitation -- vary significantly based on implementation context and specific use cases. They challenge the binary view of AI adoption, demonstrating how different applications present varying levels of risk that can often be effectively managed through careful implementation strategies. The paper highlights promising solutions, such as local large language models, that can facilitate responsible AI integration while addressing common ethical concerns. The authors propose a dimensional risk assessment approach that considers factors like data sensitivity, professional oversight requirements, and potential impact on client wellbeing. They conclude by outlining a path forward that emphasizes empirical evaluation, starting with lower-risk applications and building evidence-based understanding through careful experimentation. This approach enables organizations to maintain high ethical standards while thoughtfully exploring how AI might enhance their capacity to serve clients and communities effectively.</description>

      <title>GL-ICNN: An End-To-End Interpretable Convolutional Neural Network for the Diagnosis and Prediction of Alzheimer's Disease</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning methods based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have shown great potential to improve early and accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia based on imaging data. However, these methods have yet to be widely adopted in clinical practice, possibly due to the limited interpretability of deep learning models. The Explainable Boosting Machine (EBM) is a glass-box model but cannot learn features directly from input imaging data. In this study, we propose a novel interpretable model that combines CNNs and EBMs for the diagnosis and prediction of AD. We develop an innovative training strategy that alternatingly trains the CNN component as a feature extractor and the EBM component as the output block to form an end-to-end model. The model takes imaging data as input and provides both predictions and interpretable feature importance measures. We validated the proposed model on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset and the Health-RI Parelsnoer Neurodegenerative Diseases Biobank (PND) as an external testing set. The proposed model achieved an area-under-the-curve (AUC) of 0.956 for AD and control classification, and 0.694 for the prediction of conversion of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD on the ADNI cohort. The proposed model is a glass-box model that achieves a comparable performance with other state-of-the-art black-box models.

      <title>Transformer Vibration Forecasting for Advancing Rail Safety and Maintenance 4.0</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Maintaining railway axles is critical to preventing severe accidents and financial losses. The railway industry is increasingly interested in advanced condition monitoring techniques to enhance safety and efficiency, moving beyond traditional periodic inspections toward Maintenance 4.0.
  This study introduces a robust Deep Autoregressive solution that integrates seamlessly with existing systems to avert mechanical failures. Our approach simulates and predicts vibration signals under various conditions and fault scenarios, improving dataset robustness for more effective detection systems. These systems can alert maintenance needs, preventing accidents preemptively. We use experimental vibration signals from accelerometers on train axles.
  Our primary contributions include a transformer model, ShaftFormer, designed for processing time series data, and an alternative model incorporating spectral methods and enhanced observation models. Simulating vibration signals under diverse conditions mitigates the high cost of obtaining experimental signals for all scenarios. Given the non-stationary nature of railway vibration signals, influenced by speed and load changes, our models address these complexities, offering a powerful tool for predictive maintenance in the rail industry.</description>

      <title>SILO: Solving Inverse Problems with Latent Operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consistent improvement of image priors over the years has led to the development of better inverse problem solvers. Diffusion models are the newcomers to this arena, posing the strongest known prior to date. Recently, such models operating in a latent space have become increasingly predominant due to their efficiency. In recent works, these models have been applied to solve inverse problems. Working in the latent space typically requires multiple applications of an Autoencoder during the restoration process, which leads to both computational and restoration quality challenges. In this work, we propose a new approach for handling inverse problems with latent diffusion models, where a learned degradation function operates within the latent space, emulating a known image space degradation. Usage of the learned operator reduces the dependency on the Autoencoder to only the initial and final steps of the restoration process, facilitating faster sampling and superior restoration quality. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on a variety of image restoration tasks and datasets, achieving significant improvements over prior art.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Pretraining Data Mixtures with LLM-Estimated Utility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models improve with increasing amounts of high-quality training data. However, leveraging larger datasets requires balancing quality, quantity, and diversity across sources. After evaluating nine baseline methods under both compute- and data-constrained scenarios, we find token-count heuristics outperform manual and learned mixes, indicating that simple approaches accounting for dataset size and diversity are surprisingly effective. Building on this insight, we propose two complementary approaches: UtiliMax, which extends token-based heuristics by incorporating utility estimates from reduced-scale ablations, achieving up to a 10.6x speedup over manual baselines; and Model Estimated Data Utility (MEDU), which leverages LLMs to estimate data utility from small samples, matching ablation-based performance while reducing computational requirements by $\sim$200x. Together, these approaches establish a new framework for automated, compute-efficient data mixing that is robust across training regimes.</description>

      <title>Is logical analysis performed by transformers taking place in self-attention or in the fully connected part?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transformers architecture apply self-attention to tokens represented as vectors, before a fully connected (neuronal network) layer. These two parts can be layered many times. Traditionally, self-attention is seen as a mechanism for aggregating information before logical operations are performed by the fully connected layer. In this paper, we show, that quite counter-intuitively, the logical analysis can also be performed within the self-attention. For this we implement a handcrafted single-level encoder layer which performs the logical analysis within self-attention. We then study the scenario in which a one-level transformer model undergoes self-learning using gradient descent. We investigate whether the model utilizes fully connected layers or self-attention mechanisms for logical analysis when it has the choice. Given that gradient descent can become stuck at undesired zeros, we explicitly calculate these unwanted zeros and find ways to avoid them. We do all this in the context of predicting grammatical category pairs of adjacent tokens in a text. We believe that our findings have broader implications for understanding the potential logical operations performed by self-attention.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As modern video games become increasingly complex, traditional manual testing methods are proving costly and inefficient, limiting the ability to ensure high-quality game experiences. While advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) offer the potential to assist human testers, the effectiveness of AI in truly enhancing real-world human performance remains underexplored. This study investigates how AI can improve game testing by developing and experimenting with an AI-assisted workflow that leverages state-of-the-art machine learning models for defect detection. Through an experiment involving 800 test cases and 276 participants of varying backgrounds, we evaluate the effectiveness of AI assistance under four conditions: with or without AI support, and with or without detailed knowledge of defects and design documentation. The results indicate that AI assistance significantly improves defect identification performance, particularly when paired with detailed knowledge. However, challenges arise when AI errors occur, negatively impacting human decision-making. Our findings show the importance of optimizing human-AI collaboration and implementing strategies to mitigate the effects of AI inaccuracies. By this research, we demonstrate AI's potential and problems in enhancing efficiency and accuracy in game testing workflows and offers practical insights for integrating AI into the testing process.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Large Language Models via Random Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the continuous advancement of large language models (LLMs) in mathematical reasoning, evaluating their performance in this domain has become a prominent research focus. Recent studies have raised concerns about the reliability of current mathematical benchmarks, highlighting issues such as simplistic design and potential data leakage. Therefore, creating a reliable benchmark that effectively evaluates the genuine capabilities of LLMs in mathematical reasoning remains a significant challenge. To address this, we propose RV-Bench, a framework for Benchmarking LLMs via Random Variables in mathematical reasoning. Specifically, the background content of a random variable question (RV question) mirrors the original problem in existing standard benchmarks, but the variable combinations are randomized into different values. LLMs must fully understand the problem-solving process for the original problem to correctly answer RV questions with various combinations of variable values. As a result, the LLM's genuine capability in mathematical reasoning is reflected by its accuracy on RV-Bench. Extensive experiments are conducted with 29 representative LLMs across 900+ RV questions. A leaderboard for RV-Bench ranks the genuine capability of these LLMs. Further analysis of accuracy dropping indicates that current LLMs still struggle with complex mathematical reasoning problems.</description>

      <title>Toward Effective Digraph Representation Learning: A Magnetic Adaptive Propagation based Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $q$-parameterized magnetic Laplacian serves as the foundation of directed graph (digraph) convolution, enabling this kind of digraph neural network (MagDG) to encode node features and structural insights by complex-domain message passing. As a generalization of undirected methods, MagDG shows superior capability in modeling intricate web-scale topology. Despite the great success achieved by existing MagDGs, limitations still exist: (1) Hand-crafted $q$: The performance of MagDGs depends on selecting an appropriate $q$-parameter to construct suitable graph propagation equations in the complex domain. This parameter tuning, driven by downstream tasks, limits model flexibility and significantly increases manual effort. (2) Coarse Message Passing: Most approaches treat all nodes with the same complex-domain propagation and aggregation rules, neglecting their unique digraph contexts. This oversight results in sub-optimal performance. To address the above issues, we propose two key techniques: (1) MAP is crafted to be a plug-and-play complex-domain propagation optimization strategy in the context of digraph learning, enabling seamless integration into any MagDG to improve predictions while enjoying high running efficiency. (2) MAP++ is a new digraph learning framework, further incorporating a learnable mechanism to achieve adaptively edge-wise propagation and node-wise aggregation in the complex domain for better performance. Extensive experiments on 12 datasets demonstrate that MAP enjoys flexibility for it can be incorporated with any MagDG, and scalability as it can deal with web-scale digraphs. MAP++ achieves SOTA predictive performance on 4 different downstream tasks.</description>

      <title>Toward Scalable Graph Unlearning: A Node Influence Maximization based Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine unlearning, as a pivotal technology for enhancing model robustness and data privacy, has garnered significant attention in prevalent web mining applications, especially in thriving graph-based scenarios. However, most existing graph unlearning (GU) approaches face significant challenges due to the intricate interactions among web-scale graph elements during the model training: (1) The gradient-driven node entanglement hinders the complete knowledge removal in response to unlearning requests; (2) The billion-level graph elements in the web scenarios present inevitable scalability issues. To break the above limitations, we open up a new perspective by drawing a connection between GU and conventional social influence maximization. To this end, we propose Node Influence Maximization (NIM) through the decoupled influence propagation model and fine-grained influence function in a scalable manner, which is crafted to be a plug-and-play strategy to identify potential nodes affected by unlearning entities. This approach enables offline execution independent of GU, allowing it to be seamlessly integrated into most GU methods to improve their unlearning performance. Based on this, we introduce Scalable Graph Unlearning (SGU) as a new fine-tuned framework, which balances the forgetting and reasoning capability of the unlearned model by entity-specific optimizations. Extensive experiments on 14 datasets, including large-scale ogbn-papers100M, have demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach. Specifically, NIM enhances the forgetting capability of most GU methods, while SGU achieves comprehensive SOTA performance and maintains scalability.</description>

      <title>PXGen: A Post-hoc Explainable Method for Generative Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11827v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rapid growth of generative AI in numerous applications, explainable AI (XAI) plays a crucial role in ensuring the responsible development and deployment of generative AI technologies. XAI has undergone notable advancements and widespread adoption in recent years, reflecting a concerted push to enhance the transparency, interpretability, and credibility of AI systems. Recent research emphasizes that a proficient XAI method should adhere to a set of criteria, primarily focusing on two key areas. Firstly, it should ensure the quality and fluidity of explanations, encompassing aspects like faithfulness, plausibility, completeness, and tailoring to individual needs. Secondly, the design principle of the XAI system or mechanism should cover the following factors such as reliability, resilience, the verifiability of its outputs, and the transparency of its algorithm. However, research in XAI for generative models remains relatively scarce, with little exploration into how such methods can effectively meet these criteria in that domain. In this work, we propose PXGen, a post-hoc explainable method for generative models. Given a model that needs to be explained, PXGen prepares two materials for the explanation, the Anchor set and intrinsic &amp; extrinsic criteria. Those materials are customizable by users according to their purpose and requirements. Via the calculation of each criterion, each anchor has a set of feature values and PXGen provides examplebased explanation methods according to the feature values among all the anchors and illustrated and visualized to the users via tractable algorithms such as k-dispersion or k-center.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Personalized news headline generation, aiming at generating user-specific headlines based on readers' preferences, burgeons a recent flourishing research direction. Existing studies generally inject a user interest embedding into an encoderdecoder headline generator to make the output personalized, while the factual consistency of headlines is inadequate to be verified. In this paper, we propose a framework Fact-Preserved Personalized News Headline Generation (short for FPG), to prompt a tradeoff between personalization and consistency. In FPG, the similarity between the candidate news to be exposed and the historical clicked news is used to give different levels of attention to key facts in the candidate news, and the similarity scores help to learn a fact-aware global user embedding. Besides, an additional training procedure based on contrastive learning is devised to further enhance the factual consistency of generated headlines. Extensive experiments conducted on a real-world benchmark PENS validate the superiority of FPG, especially on the tradeoff between personalization and factual consistency.</description>

      <title>Is your LLM trapped in a Mental Set? Investigative study on how mental sets affect the reasoning capabilities of LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an investigative study on how Mental Sets influence the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. LLMs have excelled in diverse natural language processing (NLP) tasks, driven by advancements in parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) and emergent capabilities like in-context learning (ICL). For complex reasoning tasks, selecting the right model for PEFT or ICL is critical, often relying on scores on benchmarks such as MMLU, MATH, and GSM8K. However, current evaluation methods, based on metrics like F1 Score or reasoning chain assessments by larger models, overlook a key dimension: adaptability to unfamiliar situations and overcoming entrenched thinking patterns. In cognitive psychology, Mental Set refers to the tendency to persist with previously successful strategies, even when they become inefficient - a challenge for problem solving and reasoning. We compare the performance of LLM models like Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct and GPT-4o in the presence of mental sets. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to integrate cognitive psychology concepts into the evaluation of LLMs for complex reasoning tasks, providing deeper insights into their adaptability and problem-solving efficacy.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Detection and Evaluation of Damages in Concrete Structures: Using Deep Learning and Computer Vision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Structural integrity is vital for maintaining the safety and longevity of concrete infrastructures such as bridges, tunnels, and walls. Traditional methods for detecting damages like cracks and spalls are labor-intensive, time-consuming, and prone to human error. To address these challenges, this study explores advanced data-driven techniques using deep learning for automated damage detection and analysis. Two state-of-the-art instance segmentation models, YOLO-v7 instance segmentation and Mask R-CNN, were evaluated using a dataset comprising 400 images, augmented to 10,995 images through geometric and color-based transformations to enhance robustness. The models were trained and validated using a dataset split into 90% training set, validation and test set 10%. Performance metrics such as precision, recall, mean average precision (mAP@0.5), and frames per second (FPS) were used for evaluation. YOLO-v7 achieved a superior mAP@0.5 of 96.1% and processed 40 FPS, outperforming Mask R-CNN, which achieved a mAP@0.5 of 92.1% with a slower processing speed of 18 FPS. The findings recommend YOLO-v7 instance segmentation model for real-time, high-speed structural health monitoring, while Mask R-CNN is better suited for detailed offline assessments. This study demonstrates the potential of deep learning to revolutionize infrastructure maintenance, offering a scalable and efficient solution for automated damage detection.</description>

      <title>Supervised Learning for Analog and RF Circuit Design: Benchmarks and Comparative Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automating analog and radio-frequency (RF) circuit design using machine learning (ML) significantly reduces the time and effort required for parameter optimization. This study explores supervised ML-based approaches for designing circuit parameters from performance specifications across various circuit types, including homogeneous and heterogeneous designs. By evaluating diverse ML models, from neural networks like transformers to traditional methods like random forests, we identify the best-performing models for each circuit. Our results show that simpler circuits, such as low-noise amplifiers, achieve exceptional accuracy with mean relative errors as low as 0.3% due to their linear parameter-performance relationships. In contrast, complex circuits, like power amplifiers and voltage-controlled oscillators, present challenges due to their non-linear interactions and larger design spaces. For heterogeneous circuits, our approach achieves an 88% reduction in errors with increased training data, with the receiver achieving a mean relative error as low as 0.23%, showcasing the scalability and accuracy of the proposed methodology. Additionally, we provide insights into model strengths, with transformers excelling in capturing non-linear mappings and k-nearest neighbors performing robustly in moderately linear parameter spaces, especially in heterogeneous circuits with larger datasets. This work establishes a foundation for extending ML-driven design automation, enabling more efficient and scalable circuit design workflows.</description>

Abstract: Scientific research faces high costs and inefficiencies with traditional methods, but the rise of deep learning and large language models (LLMs) offers innovative solutions. This survey reviews LLM applications across scientific fields such as biology, medicine, chemistry, and meteorology, underscoring their role in advancing research. However, the continuous expansion of model size has led to significant memory demands, hindering further development and application of LLMs for science. To address this, we review memory-efficient training techniques for LLMs based on the transformer architecture, including distributed training, mixed precision training, and gradient checkpointing. Using AlphaFold 2 as an example, we demonstrate how tailored memory optimization methods can reduce storage needs while preserving prediction accuracy. We also discuss the challenges of memory optimization in practice and potential future directions, hoping to provide valuable insights for researchers and engineers.</description>

      <title>Network-informed Prompt Engineering against Organized Astroturf Campaigns under Extreme Class Imbalance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detecting organized political campaigns is of paramount importance in fighting against disinformation on social media. Existing approaches for the identification of such organized actions employ techniques mostly from network science, graph machine learning and natural language processing. Their ultimate goal is to analyze the relationships and interactions (e.g. re-posting) among users and the textual similarities of their posts. Despite their effectiveness in recognizing astroturf campaigns, these methods face significant challenges, notably the class imbalance in available training datasets. To mitigate this issue, recent methods usually resort to data augmentation or increasing the number of positive samples, which may not always be feasible or sufficient in real-world settings. Following a different path, in this paper, we propose a novel framework for identifying astroturf campaigns based solely on large language models (LLMs), introducing a Balanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Balanced RAG) component. Our approach first gives both textual information concerning the posts (in our case tweets) and the user interactions of the social network as input to a language model. Then, through prompt engineering and the proposed Balanced RAG method, it effectively detects coordinated disinformation campaigns on X (Twitter). The proposed framework does not require any training or fine-tuning of the language model. Instead, by strategically harnessing the strengths of prompt engineering and Balanced RAG, it facilitates LLMs to overcome the effects of class imbalance and effectively identify coordinated political campaigns. The experimental results demonstrate that by incorporating the proposed prompt engineering and Balanced RAG methods, our framework outperforms the traditional graph-based baselines, achieving 2x-3x improvements in terms of precision, recall and F1 scores.</description>

Abstract: The state-of-the-art recommendation systems have shifted the attention to efficient recommendation, e.g., on-device recommendation, under memory constraints. To this end, the existing methods either focused on the lightweight embeddings for both users and items, or involved on-device systems enjoying the compact embeddings to enhance reusability and reduces space complexity. However, they focus solely on the coarse granularity of embedding, while overlook the fine-grained semantic nuances, to adversarially downgrade the efficacy of meta-embeddings in capturing the intricate relationship over both user and item, consequently resulting into the suboptimal recommendations. In this paper, we aim to study how the meta-embedding can efficiently learn varied grained semantics, together with how the fine-grained meta-embedding can strengthen the representation of coarse-grained meta-embedding. To answer these questions, we develop a novel graph neural networks (GNNs) based recommender where each user and item serves as the node, linked directly to coarse-grained virtual nodes and indirectly to fine-grained virtual nodes, ensuring different grained semantic learning, while disclosing: 1) In contrast to coarse-grained semantics, fine-grained semantics are well captured through sparse meta-embeddings, which adaptively 2) balance the embedding uniqueness and memory constraint. Additionally, the initialization method come up upon SparsePCA, along with a soft thresholding activation function to render the sparseness of the meta-embeddings. We propose a weight bridging update strategy that focuses on matching each coarse-grained meta-embedding with several fine-grained meta-embeddings based on the users/items' semantics. Extensive experiments substantiate our method's superiority over existing baselines. Our code is available at https://github.com/htyjers/C2F-MetaEmbed.</description>

      <title>From Drafts to Answers: Unlocking LLM Potential via Aggregation Fine-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scaling data and model size has been proven effective for boosting the performance of large language models. In addition to training-time scaling, recent studies have revealed that increasing test-time computational resources can further improve performance. In this work, we introduce Aggregation Fine-Tuning (AFT), a supervised finetuning paradigm where the model learns to synthesize multiple draft responses, referred to as proposals, into a single, refined answer, termed aggregation. At inference time, a propose-and-aggregate strategy further boosts performance by iteratively generating proposals and aggregating them. Empirical evaluations on benchmark datasets show that AFT-trained models substantially outperform standard SFT. Notably, an AFT model, fine-tuned from Llama3.1-8B-Base with only 64k data, achieves a 41.3% LC win rate on AlpacaEval 2, surpassing significantly larger LLMs such as Llama3.1-405B-Instruct and GPT4. By combining sequential refinement and parallel sampling, the propose-and-aggregate framework scales inference-time computation in a flexible manner. Overall, These findings position AFT as a promising approach to unlocking additional capabilities of LLMs without resorting to increasing data volume or model size.</description>

      <title>Community-Aware Temporal Walks: Parameter-Free Representation Learning on Continuous-Time Dynamic Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamic graph representation learning plays a crucial role in understanding evolving behaviors. However, existing methods often struggle with flexibility, adaptability, and the preservation of temporal and structural dynamics. To address these issues, we propose Community-aware Temporal Walks (CTWalks), a novel framework for representation learning on continuous-time dynamic graphs. CTWalks integrates three key components: a community-based parameter-free temporal walk sampling mechanism, an anonymization strategy enriched with community labels, and an encoding process that leverages continuous temporal dynamics modeled via ordinary differential equations (ODEs). This design enables precise modeling of both intra- and inter-community interactions, offering a fine-grained representation of evolving temporal patterns in continuous-time dynamic graphs. CTWalks theoretically overcomes locality bias in walks and establishes its connection to matrix factorization. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that CTWalks outperforms established methods in temporal link prediction tasks, achieving higher accuracy while maintaining robustness.</description>

      <title>Panoramic Interests: Stylistic-Content Aware Personalized Headline Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Personalized news headline generation aims to provide users with attention-grabbing headlines that are tailored to their preferences. Prevailing methods focus on user-oriented content preferences, but most of them overlook the fact that diverse stylistic preferences are integral to users' panoramic interests, leading to suboptimal personalization. In view of this, we propose a novel Stylistic-Content Aware Personalized Headline Generation (SCAPE) framework. SCAPE extracts both content and stylistic features from headlines with the aid of large language model (LLM) collaboration. It further adaptively integrates users' long- and short-term interests through a contrastive learning-based hierarchical fusion network. By incorporating the panoramic interests into the headline generator, SCAPE reflects users' stylistic-content preferences during the generation process. Extensive experiments on the real-world dataset PENS demonstrate the superiority of SCAPE over baselines.</description>

      <title>LuxVeri at GenAI Detection Task 1: Inverse Perplexity Weighted Ensemble for Robust Detection of AI-Generated Text across English and Multilingual Contexts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a system developed for Task 1 of the COLING 2025 Workshop on Detecting AI-Generated Content, focusing on the binary classification of machine-generated versus human-written text. Our approach utilizes an ensemble of models, with weights assigned according to each model's inverse perplexity, to enhance classification accuracy. For the English text detection task, we combined RoBERTa-base, RoBERTa-base with the OpenAI detector, and BERT-base-cased, achieving a Macro F1-score of 0.7458, which ranked us 12th out of 35 teams. We ensembled RemBERT, XLM-RoBERTa-base, and BERT-base-multilingual-case for the multilingual text detection task, employing the same inverse perplexity weighting technique. This resulted in a Macro F1-score of 0.7513, positioning us 4th out of 25 teams. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of inverse perplexity weighting in improving the robustness of machine-generated text detection across both monolingual and multilingual settings, highlighting the potential of ensemble methods for this challenging task.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents our approach for Task 3 of the GenAI content detection workshop at COLING-2025, focusing on Cross-Domain Machine-Generated Text (MGT) Detection. We propose an ensemble of fine-tuned transformer models, enhanced by inverse perplexity weighting, to improve classification accuracy across diverse text domains. For Subtask A (Non-Adversarial MGT Detection), we combined a fine-tuned RoBERTa-base model with an OpenAI detector-integrated RoBERTa-base model, achieving an aggregate TPR score of 0.826, ranking 10th out of 23 detectors. In Subtask B (Adversarial MGT Detection), our fine-tuned RoBERTa-base model achieved a TPR score of 0.801, securing 8th out of 22 detectors. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of inverse perplexity-based weighting for enhancing generalization and performance in both non-adversarial and adversarial MGT detection, highlighting the potential for transformer models in cross-domain AI-generated content detection.</description>

      <title>Goal-oriented Transmission Scheduling: Structure-guided DRL with a Unified Dual On-policy and Off-policy Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Goal-oriented communications prioritize application-driven objectives over data accuracy, enabling intelligent next-generation wireless systems. Efficient scheduling in multi-device, multi-channel systems poses significant challenges due to high-dimensional state and action spaces. We address these challenges by deriving key structural properties of the optimal solution to the goal-oriented scheduling problem, incorporating Age of Information (AoI) and channel states. Specifically, we establish the monotonicity of the optimal state value function (a measure of long-term system performance) w.r.t. channel states and prove its asymptotic convexity w.r.t. AoI states. Additionally, we derive the monotonicity of the optimal policy w.r.t. channel states, advancing the theoretical framework for optimal scheduling. Leveraging these insights, we propose the structure-guided unified dual on-off policy DRL (SUDO-DRL), a hybrid algorithm that combines the stability of on-policy training with the sample efficiency of off-policy methods. Through a novel structural property evaluation framework, SUDO-DRL enables effective and scalable training, addressing the complexities of large-scale systems. Numerical results show SUDO-DRL improves system performance by up to 45% and reduces convergence time by 40% compared to state-of-the-art methods. It also effectively handles scheduling in much larger systems, where off-policy DRL fails and on-policy benchmarks exhibit significant performance loss, demonstrating its scalability and efficacy in goal-oriented communications.</description>

      <title>A Lightweight and Interpretable Deepfakes Detection Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent realistic creation and dissemination of so-called deepfakes poses a serious threat to social life, civil rest, and law. Celebrity defaming, election manipulation, and deepfakes as evidence in court of law are few potential consequences of deepfakes. The availability of open source trained models based on modern frameworks such as PyTorch or TensorFlow, video manipulations Apps such as FaceApp and REFACE, and economical computing infrastructure has easen the creation of deepfakes. Most of the existing detectors focus on detecting either face-swap, lip-sync, or puppet master deepfakes, but a unified framework to detect all three types of deepfakes is hardly explored. This paper presents a unified framework that exploits the power of proposed feature fusion of hybrid facial landmarks and our novel heart rate features for detection of all types of deepfakes. We propose novel heart rate features and fused them with the facial landmark features to better extract the facial artifacts of fake videos and natural variations available in the original videos. We used these features to train a light-weight XGBoost to classify between the deepfake and bonafide videos. We evaluated the performance of our framework on the world leaders dataset (WLDR) that contains all types of deepfakes. Experimental results illustrate that the proposed framework offers superior detection performance over the comparative deepfakes detection methods. Performance comparison of our framework against the LSTM-FCN, a candidate of deep learning model, shows that proposed model achieves similar results, however, it is more interpretable.</description>

      <title>Webvs. LLMs: An Empirical Study of Learning Behaviors of CS2 Students</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: LLMs such as ChatGPT have been widely adopted by students in higher education as tools for learning programming and related concepts. However, it remains unclear how effective students are and what strategies students use while learning with LLMs. Since the majority of students' experiences in online self-learning have come through using search engines such as Google, evaluating AI tools in this context can help us address these gaps. In this mixed methods research, we conducted an exploratory within-subjects study to understand how CS2 students learn programming concepts using both LLMs as well as traditional online methods such as educational websites and videos to examine how students approach learning within and across both scenarios. We discovered that students found it easier to learn a more difficult concept using traditional methods than using ChatGPT. We also found that students ask fewer follow-ups and use more keyword-based queries for search engines while their prompts to LLMs tend to explicitly ask for information.</description>

      <title>MeshONet: A Generalizable and Efficient Operator Learning Method for Structured Mesh Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mesh generation plays a crucial role in scientific computing. Traditional mesh generation methods, such as TFI and PDE-based methods, often struggle to achieve a balance between efficiency and mesh quality. To address this challenge, physics-informed intelligent learning methods have recently emerged, significantly improving generation efficiency while maintaining high mesh quality. However, physics-informed methods fail to generalize when applied to previously unseen geometries, as even small changes in the boundary shape necessitate burdensome retraining to adapt to new geometric variations. In this paper, we introduce MeshONet, the first generalizable intelligent learning method for structured mesh generation. The method transforms the mesh generation task into an operator learning problem with multiple input and solution functions. To effectively overcome the multivariable mapping restriction of operator learning methods, we propose a dual-branch, shared-trunk architecture to approximate the mapping between function spaces based on input-output pairs. Experimental results show that MeshONet achieves a speedup of up to four orders of magnitude in generation efficiency over traditional methods. It also enables generalization to different geometries without retraining, greatly enhancing the practicality of intelligent methods.</description>

Abstract: Text anomaly detection is crucial for identifying spam, misinformation, and offensive language in natural language processing tasks. Despite the growing adoption of embedding-based methods, their effectiveness and generalizability across diverse application scenarios remain under-explored. To address this, we present TAD-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to systematically evaluate embedding-based approaches for text anomaly detection. TAD-Bench integrates multiple datasets spanning different domains, combining state-of-the-art embeddings from large language models with a variety of anomaly detection algorithms. Through extensive experiments, we analyze the interplay between embeddings and detection methods, uncovering their strengths, weaknesses, and applicability to different tasks. These findings offer new perspectives on building more robust, efficient, and generalizable anomaly detection systems for real-world applications.</description>

Abstract: Training task-oriented dialogue systems is both costly and time-consuming, due to the need for high-quality datasets encompassing diverse intents. Traditional methods depend on extensive human annotation, while recent advancements leverage large language models (LLMs) to generate synthetic data. However, these approaches often require custom prompts or code, limiting accessibility for non-technical users. We introduce GraphTOD, an end-to-end framework that simplifies the generation of task-oriented dialogues. Users can create dialogues by specifying transition graphs in JSON format. Our evaluation demonstrates that GraphTOD generates high-quality dialogues across various domains, significantly lowering the cost and complexity of dataset creation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hand gesture recognition has become an important research area, driven by the growing demand for human-computer interaction in fields such as sign language recognition, virtual and augmented reality, and robotics. Despite the rapid growth of the field, there are few surveys that comprehensively cover recent research developments, available solutions, and benchmark datasets. This survey addresses this gap by examining the latest advancements in hand gesture and 3D hand pose recognition from various types of camera input data including RGB images, depth images, and videos from monocular or multiview cameras, examining the differing methodological requirements of each approach. Furthermore, an overview of widely used datasets is provided, detailing their main characteristics and application domains. Finally, open challenges such as achieving robust recognition in real-world environments, handling occlusions, ensuring generalization across diverse users, and addressing computational efficiency for real-time applications are highlighted to guide future research directions. By synthesizing the objectives, methodologies, and applications of recent studies, this survey offers valuable insights into current trends, challenges, and opportunities for future research in human hand gesture recognition.</description>

      <title>Full Proportional Justified Representation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In multiwinner approval voting, forming a committee that proportionally represents voters' approval ballots is an essential task. The notion of justified representation (JR) demands that any large "cohesive" group of voters should be proportionally "represented". The "cohesiveness" is defined in different ways; two common ways are the following: (C1) demands that the group unanimously approves a set of candidates proportional to its size, while (C2) requires each member to approve at least a fixed fraction of such a set. Similarly, "representation" have been considered in different ways: (R1) the coalition's collective utility from the winning set exceeds that of any proportionally sized alternative, and (R2) for any proportionally sized alternative, at least one member of the coalition derives less utility from it than from the winning set.
  Three of the four possible combinations have been extensively studied: (C1)-(R1) defines Proportional Justified Representation (PJR), (C1)-(R2) defines Extended Justified Representation (EJR), (C2)-(R2) defines Full Justified Representation (FJR). All three have merits, but also drawbacks. PJR is the weakest notion, and perhaps not sufficiently demanding; EJR may not be compatible with perfect representation; and it is open whether a committee satisfying FJR can be found efficiently.
  We study the combination (C2)-(R1), which we call Full Proportional Justified Representation (FPJR). We investigate FPJR's properties and find that it shares PJR's advantages over EJR: several proportionality axioms (e.g. priceability, perfect representation) imply FPJR and PJR but not EJR. We also find that efficient rules like the greedy Monroe rule and the method of equal shares satisfy FPJR, matching a key advantage of EJR over FJR. However, the Proportional Approval Voting (PAV) rule may violate FPJR, so neither of EJR and FPJR implies the other.</description>

      <title>Harnessing Generative Pre-Trained Transformer for Datacenter Packet Trace Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Today, the rapid growth of applications reliant on datacenters calls for new advancements to meet the increasing traffic and computational demands. Traffic traces from datacenters are essential for further development and optimization of future datacenters. However, traces are rarely released to the public. Researchers often use simplified mathematical models that lack the depth needed to recreate intricate traffic patterns and, thus, miss optimization opportunities found in realistic traffic. In this preliminary work, we introduce DTG-GPT, a packet-level Datacenter Traffic Generator (DTG), based on the generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) architecture used by many state-of-the-art large language models. We train our model on a small set of available traffic traces from different domains and offer a simple methodology to evaluate the fidelity of the generated traces to their original counterparts. We show that DTG-GPT can synthesize novel traces that mimic the spatiotemporal patterns found in real traffic traces. We further demonstrate that DTG-GPT can generate traces for networks of different scales while maintaining fidelity. Our findings indicate the potential that, in the future, similar models to DTG-GPT will allow datacenter operators to release traffic information to the research community via trained GPT models.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Class Learning to Screen Diabetic Disorders in Fundus Images of Eye</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The prevalence of ocular illnesses is growing globally, presenting a substantial public health challenge. Early detection and timely intervention are crucial for averting visual impairment and enhancing patient prognosis. This research introduces a new framework called Class Extension with Limited Data (CELD) to train a classifier to categorize retinal fundus images. The classifier is initially trained to identify relevant features concerning Healthy and Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) classes and later fine-tuned to adapt to the task of classifying the input images into three classes: Healthy, DR, and Glaucoma. This strategy allows the model to gradually enhance its classification capabilities, which is beneficial in situations where there are only a limited number of labeled datasets available. Perturbation methods are also used to identify the input image characteristics responsible for influencing the models decision-making process. We achieve an overall accuracy of 91% on publicly available datasets.</description>

      <title>EDoRA: Efficient Weight-Decomposed Low-Rank Adaptation via Singular Value Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods, such as LoRA, reduces the number of trainable parameters. However, they often suffer from scalability issues and differences between their learning pattern and full fine-tuning. To overcome these limitations, we propose Efficient Weight-Decomposed Low-Rank Adaptation (EDoRA): a novel PEFT method that decomposes pre-trained weights into magnitude and directional components. By freezing low-rank matrices, initializing them by singular value decomposition, and introducing a small trainable matrix between them, EDoRA achieves substantial reduction in trainable parameters while maintaining learning capacity. Experimental results on the GLUE benchmark demonstrate that EDoRA achieves competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, such as LoRA and DoRA, with up to 30x fewer trainable parameters. This makes EDoRA a highly efficient solution for adapting LLMs to diverse tasks under memory-constrained settings. Code is available at https://github.com/Hamid-Nasiri/EDoRA .</description>

      <title>Scalable Whole Slide Image Representation Using K-Mean Clustering and Fisher Vector Aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Whole slide images (WSIs) are high-resolution, gigapixel sized images that pose significant computational challenges for traditional machine learning models due to their size and heterogeneity.In this paper, we present a scalable and efficient methodology for WSI classification by leveraging patch-based feature extraction, clustering, and Fisher vector encoding. Initially, WSIs are divided into fixed size patches, and deep feature embeddings are extracted from each patch using a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN). These patch-level embeddings are subsequently clustered using K-means clustering, where each cluster aggregates semantically similar regions of the WSI. To effectively summarize each cluster, Fisher vector representations are computed by modeling the distribution of patch embeddings in each cluster as a parametric Gaussian mixture model (GMM). The Fisher vectors from each cluster are concatenated into a high-dimensional feature vector, creating a compact and informative representation of the entire WSI. This feature vector is then used by a classifier to predict the WSI's diagnostic label. Our method captures local and global tissue structures and yields robust performance for large-scale WSI classification, demonstrating superior accuracy and scalability compared to other approaches.</description>

      <title>Proxies for Distortion and Consistency with Applications for Real-World Image Restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real-world image restoration deals with the recovery of images suffering from an unknown degradation. This task is typically addressed while being given only degraded images, without their corresponding ground-truth versions. In this hard setting, designing and evaluating restoration algorithms becomes highly challenging. This paper offers a suite of tools that can serve both the design and assessment of real-world image restoration algorithms. Our work starts by proposing a trained model that predicts the chain of degradations a given real-world measured input has gone through. We show how this estimator can be used to approximate the consistency -- the match between the measurements and any proposed recovered image. We also use this estimator as a guiding force for the design of a simple and highly-effective plug-and-play real-world image restoration algorithm, leveraging a pre-trained diffusion-based image prior. Furthermore, this work proposes no-reference proxy measures of MSE and LPIPS, which, without access to the ground-truth images, allow ranking of real-world image restoration algorithms according to their (approximate) MSE and LPIPS. The proposed suite provides a versatile, first of its kind framework for evaluating and comparing blind image restoration algorithms in real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>Teacher Encoder-Student Decoder Denoising Guided Segmentation Network for Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Visual anomaly detection is a highly challenging task, often categorized as a one-class classification and segmentation problem. Recent studies have demonstrated that the student-teacher (S-T) framework effectively addresses this challenge. However, most S-T frameworks rely solely on pre-trained teacher networks to guide student networks in learning multi-scale similar features, overlooking the potential of the student networks to enhance learning through multi-scale feature fusion. In this study, we propose a novel model named PFADSeg, which integrates a pre-trained teacher network, a denoising student network with multi-scale feature fusion, and a guided anomaly segmentation network into a unified framework. By adopting a unique teacher-encoder and student-decoder denoising mode, the model improves the student network's ability to learn from teacher network features. Furthermore, an adaptive feature fusion mechanism is introduced to train a self-supervised segmentation network that synthesizes anomaly masks autonomously, significantly increasing detection performance. Evaluated on the MVTec AD dataset, PFADSeg achieves state-of-the-art results with an image-level AUC of 98.9%, a pixel-level mean precision of 76.4%, and an instance-level mean precision of 78.7%.</description>

      <title>Can open source large language models be used for tumor documentation in Germany? -- An evaluation on urological doctors' notes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tumor documentation in Germany is largely done manually, requiring reading patient records and entering data into structured databases. Large language models (LLMs) could potentially enhance this process by improving efficiency and reliability. This evaluation tests eleven different open source LLMs with sizes ranging from 1-70 billion model parameters on three basic tasks of the tumor documentation process: identifying tumor diagnoses, assigning ICD-10 codes, and extracting the date of first diagnosis. For evaluating the LLMs on these tasks, a dataset of annotated text snippets based on anonymized doctors' notes from urology was prepared. Different prompting strategies were used to investigate the effect of the number of examples in few-shot prompting and to explore the capabilities of the LLMs in general. The models Llama 3.1 8B, Mistral 7B, and Mistral NeMo 12 B performed comparably well in the tasks. Models with less extensive training data or having fewer than 7 billion parameters showed notably lower performance, while larger models did not display performance gains. Examples from a different medical domain than urology could also improve the outcome in few-shot prompting, which demonstrates the ability of LLMs to handle tasks needed for tumor documentation. Open source LLMs show a strong potential for automating tumor documentation. Models from 7-12 billion parameters could offer an optimal balance between performance and resource efficiency. With tailored fine-tuning and well-designed prompting, these models might become important tools for clinical documentation in the future. The code for the evaluation is available from https://github.com/stefan-m-lenz/UroLlmEval. We also release the dataset as a new valuable resource that addresses the shortage of authentic and easily accessible benchmarks in German-language medical NLP.</description>

      <title>Efficient PINNs: Multi-Head Unimodular Regularization of the Solutions Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a machine learning framework to facilitate the solution of nonlinear multiscale differential equations and, especially, inverse problems using Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). This framework is based on what is called multihead (MH) training, which involves training the network to learn a general space of all solutions for a given set of equations with certain variability, rather than learning a specific solution of the system. This setup is used with a second novel technique that we call Unimodular Regularization (UR) of the latent space of solutions. We show that the multihead approach, combined with the regularization, significantly improves the efficiency of PINNs by facilitating the transfer learning process thereby enabling the finding of solutions for nonlinear, coupled, and multiscale differential equations.</description>

      <title>FedCLEAN: byzantine defense by CLustering Errors of Activation maps in Non-IID federated learning environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables clients to collaboratively train a global model using their local datasets while reinforcing data privacy. However, FL is susceptible to poisoning attacks. Existing defense mechanisms assume that clients' data are independent and identically distributed (IID), making them ineffective in real-world applications where data are non-IID. This paper presents FedCLEAN, the first defense capable of filtering attackers' model updates in a non-IID FL environment. The originality of FedCLEAN is twofold. First, it relies on a client confidence score derived from the reconstruction errors of each client's model activation maps for a given trigger set, with reconstruction errors obtained by means of a Conditional Variational Autoencoder trained according to a novel server-side strategy. Second, we propose an ad-hoc trust propagation algorithm based on client scores, which allows building a cluster of benign clients while flagging potential attackers. Experimental results on the datasets MNIST and FashionMNIST demonstrate the robustness of FedCLEAN against Byzantine attackers in non-IID scenarios and a close-to-zero benign client misclassification rate, even in the absence of an attack.</description>

      <title>Improving Influence-based Instruction Tuning Data Selection for Balanced Learning of Diverse Capabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Selecting appropriate training data is crucial for effective instruction fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs), which aims to (1) elicit strong capabilities, and (2) achieve balanced performance across a diverse range of tasks. Influence-based methods show promise in achieving (1) by estimating the contribution of each training example to the model's predictions, but often struggle with (2). Our systematic investigation reveals that this underperformance can be attributed to an inherent bias where certain tasks intrinsically have greater influence than others. As a result, data selection is often biased towards these tasks, not only hurting the model's performance on others but also, counterintuitively, harms performance on these high-influence tasks themselves.
  As a remedy, we propose BIDS, a Balanced and Influential Data Selection algorithm. BIDS first normalizes influence scores of the training data, and then iteratively balances data selection by choosing the training example with the highest influence on the most underrepresented task. Experiments with both Llama-3 and Mistral-v0.3 on seven benchmarks spanning five diverse capabilities show that BIDS consistently outperforms both state-of-the-art influence-based algorithms and other non-influence-based selection frameworks. Surprisingly, training on a 15% subset selected by BIDS can even outperform full-dataset training with a much more balanced performance. Our analysis further highlights the importance of both instance-level normalization and iterative optimization of selected data for balanced learning of diverse capabilities.</description>

      <title>On the practical applicability of modern DFT functionals for chemical computations. Case study of DM21 applicability for geometry optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Density functional theory (DFT) is probably the most promising approach for quantum chemistry calculations considering its good balance between calculations precision and speed. In recent years, several neural network-based functionals have been developed for exchange-correlation energy approximation in DFT, DM21 developed by Google Deepmind being the most notable between them. This study focuses on evaluating the efficiency of DM21 functional in predicting molecular geometries, with a focus on the influence of oscillatory behavior in neural network exchange-correlation functionals. We implemented geometry optimization in PySCF for the DM21 functional in geometry optimization problem, compared its performance with traditional functionals, and tested it on various benchmarks. Our findings reveal both the potential and the current challenges of using neural network functionals for geometry optimization in DFT. We propose a solution extending the practical applicability of such functionals and allowing to model new substances with their help.</description>

      <title>AdaServe: SLO-Customized LLM Serving with Fine-Grained Speculative Decoding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces AdaServe, the first LLM serving system to support SLO customization through fine-grained speculative decoding. AdaServe leverages the logits of a draft model to predict the speculative accuracy of tokens and employs a theoretically optimal algorithm to construct token trees for verification. To accommodate diverse SLO requirements without compromising throughput, AdaServe employs a speculation-and-selection scheme that first constructs candidate token trees for each request and then dynamically selects tokens to meet individual SLO constraints while optimizing throughput. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that AdaServe achieves up to 73% higher SLO attainment and 74% higher goodput compared to state-of-the-art systems. These results underscore AdaServe's potential to enhance the efficiency and adaptability of LLM deployments across varied application scenarios.</description>

      <title>An End-to-End Approach for Korean Wakeword Systems with Speaker Authentication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wakeword detection plays a critical role in enabling AI assistants to listen to user voices and interact effectively. However, for languages other than English, there is a significant lack of pre-trained wakeword models. Additionally, systems that merely determine the presence of a wakeword can pose serious privacy concerns. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end approach that trains wakewords for Non-English languages, particulary Korean, and uses this to develop a Voice Authentication model to protect user privacy. Our implementation employs an open-source platform OpenWakeWord, which performs wakeword detection using an FCN (Fully-Connected Network) architecture. Once a wakeword is detected, our custom-developed code calculates cosine similarity for robust user authentication. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving a 16.79% and a 6.6% Equal Error Rate (EER) each in the Wakeword Detection and the Voice Authentication. These findings highlight the model's potential in providing secure and accurate wakeword detection and authentication for Korean users.</description>

      <title>Strong phonon-mediated high temperature superconductivity in Li$_2$AuH$_6$ under ambient pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We used our developed AI search engine~(InvDesFlow) to perform extensive investigations regarding ambient stable superconducting hydrides. A cubic structure Li$_2$AuH$_6$ with Au-H octahedral motifs is identified to be a candidate. After performing thermodynamical analysis, we provide a feasible route to experimentally synthesize this material via the known LiAu and LiH compounds under ambient pressure. The further first-principles calculations suggest that Li$_2$AuH$_6$ shows a high superconducting transition temperature ($T_c$) $\sim$ 140 K under ambient pressure. The H-1$s$ electrons strongly couple with phonon modes of vibrations of Au-H octahedrons as well as vibrations of Li atoms, where the latter is not taken seriously in other previously similar cases. Hence, different from previous claims of searching metallic covalent bonds to find high-$T_c$ superconductors, we emphasize here the importance of those phonon modes with strong electron-phonon coupling (EPC). And we suggest that one can intercalate atoms into binary or ternary hydrides to introduce more potential phonon modes with strong EPC, which is an effective approach to find high-$T_c$ superconductors within multicomponent compounds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The improved competence of generative models can help building multi-modal virtual assistants that leverage modalities beyond language. By observing humans performing multi-step tasks, one can build assistants that have situational awareness of actions and tasks being performed, enabling them to cater assistance based on this understanding. In this paper, we develop a Context-aware Instructional Task Assistant with Multi-modal Large Language Models (InsTALL) that leverages an online visual stream (e.g. a user's screen share or video recording) and responds in real-time to user queries related to the task at hand. To enable useful assistance, InsTALL 1) trains a multi-modal model on task videos and paired textual data, and 2) automatically extracts task graph from video data and leverages it at training and inference time. We show InsTALL achieves state-of-the-art performance across proposed sub-tasks considered for multimodal activity understanding -- task recognition (TR), action recognition (AR), next action prediction (AP), and plan prediction (PP) -- and outperforms existing baselines on two novel sub-tasks related to automatic error identification.</description>

      <title>CBVLM: Training-free Explainable Concept-based Large Vision Language Models for Medical Image Classification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The main challenges limiting the adoption of deep learning-based solutions in medical workflows are the availability of annotated data and the lack of interpretability of such systems. Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) tackle the latter by constraining the final disease prediction on a set of predefined and human-interpretable concepts. However, the increased interpretability achieved through these concept-based explanations implies a higher annotation burden. Moreover, if a new concept needs to be added, the whole system needs to be retrained. Inspired by the remarkable performance shown by Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) in few-shot settings, we propose a simple, yet effective, methodology, CBVLM, which tackles both of the aforementioned challenges. First, for each concept, we prompt the LVLM to answer if the concept is present in the input image. Then, we ask the LVLM to classify the image based on the previous concept predictions. Moreover, in both stages, we incorporate a retrieval module responsible for selecting the best examples for in-context learning. By grounding the final diagnosis on the predicted concepts, we ensure explainability, and by leveraging the few-shot capabilities of LVLMs, we drastically lower the annotation cost. We validate our approach with extensive experiments across four medical datasets and twelve LVLMs (both generic and medical) and show that CBVLM consistently outperforms CBMs and task-specific supervised methods without requiring any training and using just a few annotated examples.

      <title>Condor: Enhance LLM Alignment with Knowledge-Driven Data Synthesis and Refinement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quality of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) data plays a critical role in enhancing the conversational capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, as LLMs become more advanced, the availability of high-quality human-annotated SFT data has become a significant bottleneck, necessitating a greater reliance on synthetic training data. In this work, we introduce Condor, a novel two-stage synthetic data generation framework that incorporates World Knowledge Tree and Self-Reflection Refinement to produce high-quality SFT data at scale. Our experimental results demonstrate that a base model fine-tuned on only 20K Condor-generated samples achieves superior performance compared to counterparts. The additional refinement stage in Condor further enables iterative self-improvement for LLMs at various scales (up to 72B), validating the effectiveness of our approach. Furthermore, our investigation into the scaling for synthetic data in post-training reveals substantial unexplored potential for performance improvements, opening promising avenues for future research.</description>

      <title>With Great Backbones Comes Great Adversarial Transferability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advances in self-supervised learning (SSL) for machine vision have improved representation robustness and model performance, giving rise to pre-trained backbones like \emph{ResNet} and \emph{ViT} models tuned with SSL methods such as \emph{SimCLR}. Due to the computational and data demands of pre-training, the utilization of such backbones becomes a strenuous necessity. However, employing these backbones may inherit vulnerabilities to adversarial attacks. While adversarial robustness has been studied under \emph{white-box} and \emph{black-box} settings, the robustness of models tuned on pre-trained backbones remains largely unexplored. Additionally, the role of tuning meta-information in mitigating exploitation risks is unclear. This work systematically evaluates the adversarial robustness of such models across $20,000$ combinations of tuning meta-information, including fine-tuning techniques, backbone families, datasets, and attack types. We propose using proxy models to transfer attacks, simulating varying levels of target knowledge by fine-tuning these proxies with diverse configurations. Our findings reveal that proxy-based attacks approach the effectiveness of \emph{white-box} methods, even with minimal tuning knowledge. We also introduce a naive "backbone attack," leveraging only the backbone to generate adversarial samples, which outperforms \emph{black-box} attacks and rivals \emph{white-box} methods, highlighting critical risks in model-sharing practices. Finally, our ablations reveal how increasing tuning meta-information impacts attack transferability, measuring each meta-information combination.</description>

      <title>Implementation of an Asymmetric Adjusted Activation Function for Class Imbalance Credit Scoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Credit scoring is a systematic approach to evaluate a borrower's probability of default (PD) on a bank loan. The data associated with such scenarios are characteristically imbalanced, complicating binary classification owing to the often-underestimated cost of misclassification during the classifier's learning process. Considering the high imbalance ratio (IR) of these datasets, we introduce an innovative yet straightforward optimized activation function by incorporating an IR-dependent asymmetric adjusted factor embedded Sigmoid activation function (ASIG). The embedding of ASIG makes the sensitive margin of the Sigmoid function auto-adjustable, depending on the imbalance nature of the datasets distributed, thereby giving the activation function an asymmetric characteristic that prevents the underrepresentation of the minority class (positive samples) during the classifier's learning process. The experimental results show that the ASIG-embedded-classifier outperforms traditional classifiers on datasets across wide-ranging IRs in the downstream credit-scoring task. The algorithm also shows robustness and stability, even when the IR is ultra-high. Therefore, the algorithm provides a competitive alternative in the financial industry, especially in credit scoring, possessing the ability to effectively process highly imbalanced distribution data.</description>

      <title>Regressor-Guided Image Editing Regulates Emotional Response to Reduce Online Engagement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12289v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Emotions are known to mediate the relationship between users' content consumption and their online engagement, with heightened emotional intensity leading to increased engagement. Building on this insight, we propose three regressor-guided image editing approaches aimed at diminishing the emotional impact of images. These include (i) a parameter optimization approach based on global image transformations known to influence emotions, (ii) an optimization approach targeting the style latent space of a generative adversarial network, and (iii) a diffusion-based approach employing classifier guidance and classifier-free guidance. Our findings demonstrate that approaches can effectively alter the emotional properties of images while maintaining high visual quality. Optimization-based methods primarily adjust low-level properties like color hues and brightness, whereas the diffusion-based approach introduces semantic changes, such as altering appearance or facial expressions. Notably, results from a behavioral study reveal that only the diffusion-based approach successfully elicits changes in viewers' emotional responses while preserving high perceived image quality. In future work, we will investigate the impact of these image adaptations on internet user behavior.</description>

      <title>RALAD: Bridging the Real-to-Sim Domain Gap in Autonomous Driving with Retrieval-Augmented Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the pursuit of robust autonomous driving systems, models trained on real-world datasets often struggle to adapt to new environments, particularly when confronted with corner cases such as extreme weather conditions. Collecting these corner cases in the real world is non-trivial, which necessitates the use of simulators for validation. However,the high computational cost and the domain gap in data distribution have hindered the seamless transition between real and simulated driving scenarios. To tackle this challenge, we propose Retrieval-Augmented Learning for Autonomous Driving (RALAD), a novel framework designed to bridge the real-to-sim gap at a low cost. RALAD features three primary designs, including (1) domain adaptation via an enhanced Optimal Transport (OT) method that accounts for both individual and grouped image distances, (2) a simple and unified framework that can be applied to various models, and (3) efficient fine-tuning techniques that freeze the computationally expensive layers while maintaining robustness. Experimental results demonstrate that RALAD compensates for the performance degradation in simulated environments while maintaining accuracy in real-world scenarios across three different models. Taking Cross View as an example, the mIOU and mAP metrics in real-world scenarios remain stable before and after RALAD fine-tuning, while in simulated environments,the mIOU and mAP metrics are improved by 10.30% and 12.29%, respectively. Moreover, the re-training cost of our approach is reduced by approximately 88.1%. Our code is available at https://github.com/JiachengZuo/RALAD.git.</description>

      <title>LLM-Assisted Knowledge Graph Completion for Curriculum and Domain Modelling in Personalized Higher Education Recommendations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While learning personalization offers great potential for learners, modern practices in higher education require a deeper consideration of domain models and learning contexts, to develop effective personalization algorithms. This paper introduces an innovative approach to higher education curriculum modelling that utilizes large language models (LLMs) for knowledge graph (KG) completion, with the goal of creating personalized learning-path recommendations. Our research focuses on modelling university subjects and linking their topics to corresponding domain models, enabling the integration of learning modules from different faculties and institutions in the student's learning path. Central to our approach is a collaborative process, where LLMs assist human experts in extracting high-quality, fine-grained topics from lecture materials. We develop a domain, curriculum, and user models for university modules and stakeholders. We implement this model to create the KG from two study modules: Embedded Systems and Development of Embedded Systems Using FPGA. The resulting KG structures the curriculum and links it to the domain models. We evaluate our approach through qualitative expert feedback and quantitative graph quality metrics. Domain experts validated the relevance and accuracy of the model, while the graph quality metrics measured the structural properties of our KG. Our results show that the LLM-assisted graph completion approach enhances the ability to connect related courses across disciplines to personalize the learning experience. Expert feedback also showed high acceptance of the proposed collaborative approach for concept extraction and classification.</description>

      <title>Automatic Labelling with Open-source LLMs using Dynamic Label Schema Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Acquiring labelled training data remains a costly task in real world machine learning projects to meet quantity and quality requirements. Recently Large Language Models (LLMs), notably GPT-4, have shown great promises in labelling data with high accuracy. However, privacy and cost concerns prevent the ubiquitous use of GPT-4. In this work, we explore effectively leveraging open-source models for automatic labelling. We identify integrating label schema as a promising technology but found that naively using the label description for classification leads to poor performance on high cardinality tasks. To address this, we propose Retrieval Augmented Classification (RAC) for which LLM performs inferences for one label at a time using corresponding label schema; we start with the most related label and iterates until a label is chosen by the LLM. We show that our method, which dynamically integrates label description, leads to performance improvements in labelling tasks. We further show that by focusing only on the most promising labels, RAC can trade off between label quality and coverage - a property we leverage to automatically label our internal datasets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents results of our system for CoMeDi Shared Task, focusing on Subtask 2: Disagreement Ranking. Our system leverages sentence embeddings generated by the paraphrase-xlm-r-multilingual-v1 model, combined with a deep neural regression model incorporating batch normalization and dropout for improved generalization. By predicting the mean of pairwise judgment differences between annotators, our method explicitly targets disagreement ranking, diverging from traditional "gold label" aggregation approaches. We optimized our system with a customized architecture and training procedure, achieving competitive performance in Spearman correlation against mean disagreement labels. Our results highlight the importance of robust embeddings, effective model architecture, and careful handling of judgment differences for ranking disagreement in multilingual contexts. These findings provide insights into the use of contextualized representations for ordinal judgment tasks and open avenues for further refinement of disagreement prediction models.</description>

      <title>Treefix: Enabling Execution with a Tree of Prefixes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability to execute code is a prerequisite for various dynamic program analyses. Learning-guided execution has been proposed as an approach to enable the execution of arbitrary code snippets by letting a neural model predict likely values for any missing variables. Although state-of-the-art learning-guided execution approaches, such as LExecutor, can enable the execution of a relative high amount of code, they are limited to predicting a restricted set of possible values and do not use any feedback from previous executions to execute even more code. This paper presents Treefix, a novel learning-guided execution approach that leverages LLMs to iteratively create code prefixes that enable the execution of a given code snippet. The approach addresses the problem in a multi-step fashion, where each step uses feedback about the code snippet and its execution to instruct an LLM to improve a previously generated prefix. This process iteratively creates a tree of prefixes, a subset of which is returned to the user as prefixes that maximize the number of executed lines in the code snippet. In our experiments with two datasets of Python code snippets, Treefix achieves 25% and 7% more coverage relative to the current state of the art in learning-guided execution, covering a total of 84% and 82% of all lines in the code snippets.</description>

      <title>Test-time regression: a unifying framework for designing sequence models with associative memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sequences provide a remarkably general way to represent and process information. This powerful abstraction has placed sequence modeling at the center of modern deep learning applications, inspiring numerous architectures from transformers to recurrent networks. While this fragmented development has yielded powerful models, it has left us without a unified framework to understand their fundamental similarities and explain their effectiveness. We present a unifying framework motivated by an empirical observation: effective sequence models must be able to perform associative recall. Our key insight is that memorizing input tokens through an associative memory is equivalent to performing regression at test-time. This regression-memory correspondence provides a framework for deriving sequence models that can perform associative recall, offering a systematic lens to understand seemingly ad-hoc architectural choices. We show numerous recent architectures -- including linear attention models, their gated variants, state-space models, online learners, and softmax attention -- emerge naturally as specific approaches to test-time regression. Each architecture corresponds to three design choices: the relative importance of each association, the regressor function class, and the optimization algorithm. This connection leads to new understanding: we provide theoretical justification for QKNorm in softmax attention, and we motivate higher-order generalizations of softmax attention. Beyond unification, our work unlocks decades of rich statistical tools that can guide future development of more powerful yet principled sequence models.</description>

      <title>DARB-Splatting: Generalizing Splatting with Decaying Anisotropic Radial Basis Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Splatting-based 3D reconstruction methods have gained popularity with the advent of 3D Gaussian Splatting, efficiently synthesizing high-quality novel views. These methods commonly resort to using exponential family functions, such as the Gaussian function, as reconstruction kernels due to their anisotropic nature, ease of projection, and differentiability in rasterization. However, the field remains restricted to variations within the exponential family, leaving generalized reconstruction kernels largely underexplored, partly due to the lack of easy integrability in 3D to 2D projections. In this light, we show that a class of decaying anisotropic radial basis functions (DARBFs), which are non-negative functions of the Mahalanobis distance, supports splatting by approximating the Gaussian function's closed-form integration advantage. With this fresh perspective, we demonstrate up to 34% faster convergence during training and a 15% reduction in memory consumption across various DARB reconstruction kernels, while maintaining comparable PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS results. We will make the code available.</description>

      <title>Parameters vs FLOPs: Scaling Laws for Optimal Sparsity for Mixture-of-Experts Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scaling the capacity of language models has consistently proven to be a reliable approach for improving performance and unlocking new capabilities. Capacity can be primarily defined by two dimensions: the number of model parameters and the compute per example. While scaling typically involves increasing both, the precise interplay between these factors and their combined contribution to overall capacity remains not fully understood. We explore this relationship in the context of sparse Mixture-of-Expert models (MoEs), which allow scaling the number of parameters without proportionally increasing the FLOPs per example. We investigate how varying the sparsity level, i.e., the ratio of non-active to total parameters, affects model performance in terms of both pretraining and downstream performance. We find that under different constraints (e.g. parameter size and total training compute), there is an optimal level of sparsity that improves both training efficiency and model performance. These results provide a better understanding of the impact of sparsity in scaling laws for MoEs and complement existing works in this area, offering insights for designing more efficient architectures.</description>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across a range of natural language processing tasks. In particular, improvements in reasoning abilities and the expansion of context windows have opened new avenues for leveraging these powerful models. NL2SQL is challenging in that the natural language question is inherently ambiguous, while the SQL generation requires a precise understanding of complex data schema and semantics. One approach to this semantic ambiguous problem is to provide more and sufficient contextual information.
  In this work, we explore the performance and the latency trade-offs of the extended context window (a.k.a., long context) offered by Google's state-of-the-art LLM (\textit{gemini-1.5-pro}). We study the impact of various contextual information, including column example values, question and SQL query pairs, user-provided hints, SQL documentation, and schema. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to study how the extended context window and extra contextual information can help NL2SQL generation with respect to both accuracy and latency cost. We show that long context LLMs are robust and do not get lost in the extended contextual information. Additionally, our long-context NL2SQL pipeline based on Google's \textit{gemini-pro-1.5} achieve a strong performance with 67.41\% on BIRD benchmark (dev) without finetuning and expensive self-consistency based techniques.</description>

      <title>Expertise elevates AI usage: experimental evidence comparing laypeople and professional artists</title>

Abstract: Novel capacities of generative AI to analyze and generate cultural artifacts raise inevitable questions about the nature and value of artistic education and human expertise. Has AI already leveled the playing field between professional artists and laypeople, or do trained artistic expressive capacity, curation skills and experience instead enhance the ability to use these new tools? In this pre-registered study, we conduct experimental comparisons between 50 active artists and a demographically matched sample of laypeople. We designed two tasks to approximate artistic practice for testing their capabilities in both faithful and creative image creation: replicating a reference image, and moving as far away as possible from it. We developed a bespoke platform where participants used a modern text-to-image model to complete both tasks. We also collected and compared participants' sentiments towards AI. On average, artists produced more faithful and creative outputs than their lay counterparts, although only by a small margin. While AI may ease content creation, professional expertise is still valuable - even within the confined space of generative AI itself. Finally, we also explored how well an exemplary vision-capable large language model (GPT-4o) would complete the same tasks, if given the role of an image generation agent, and found it performed on par in copying but outperformed even artists in the creative task. The very best results were still produced by humans in both tasks. These outcomes highlight the importance of integrating artistic skills with AI training to prepare artists and other visual professionals for a technologically evolving landscape. We see a potential in collaborative synergy with generative AI, which could reshape creative industries and education in the arts.</description>

      <title>Video Depth Anything: Consistent Depth Estimation for Super-Long Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Depth Anything has achieved remarkable success in monocular depth estimation with strong generalization ability. However, it suffers from temporal inconsistency in videos, hindering its practical applications. Various methods have been proposed to alleviate this issue by leveraging video generation models or introducing priors from optical flow and camera poses. Nonetheless, these methods are only applicable to short videos (&lt; 10 seconds) and require a trade-off between quality and computational efficiency. We propose Video Depth Anything for high-quality, consistent depth estimation in super-long videos (over several minutes) without sacrificing efficiency. We base our model on Depth Anything V2 and replace its head with an efficient spatial-temporal head. We design a straightforward yet effective temporal consistency loss by constraining the temporal depth gradient, eliminating the need for additional geometric priors. The model is trained on a joint dataset of video depth and unlabeled images, similar to Depth Anything V2. Moreover, a novel key-frame-based strategy is developed for long video inference. Experiments show that our model can be applied to arbitrarily long videos without compromising quality, consistency, or generalization ability. Comprehensive evaluations on multiple video benchmarks demonstrate that our approach sets a new state-of-the-art in zero-shot video depth estimation. We offer models of different scales to support a range of scenarios, with our smallest model capable of real-time performance at 30 FPS.</description>

      <title>MMVU: Measuring Expert-Level Multi-Discipline Video Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce MMVU, a comprehensive expert-level, multi-discipline benchmark for evaluating foundation models in video understanding. MMVU includes 3,000 expert-annotated questions spanning 27 subjects across four core disciplines: Science, Healthcare, Humanities &amp; Social Sciences, and Engineering. Compared to prior benchmarks, MMVU features three key advancements. First, it challenges models to apply domain-specific knowledge and perform expert-level reasoning to analyze specialized-domain videos, moving beyond the basic visual perception typically assessed in current video benchmarks. Second, each example is annotated by human experts from scratch. We implement strict data quality controls to ensure the high quality of the dataset. Finally, each example is enriched with expert-annotated reasoning rationals and relevant domain knowledge, facilitating in-depth analysis. We conduct an extensive evaluation of 32 frontier multimodal foundation models on MMVU. The latest System-2-capable models, o1 and Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking, achieve the highest performance among the tested models. However, they still fall short of matching human expertise. Through in-depth error analyses and case studies, we offer actionable insights for future advancements in expert-level, knowledge-intensive video understanding for specialized domains.</description>

      <title>Physics of Skill Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We aim to understand physics of skill learning, i.e., how skills are learned in neural networks during training. We start by observing the Domino effect, i.e., skills are learned sequentially, and notably, some skills kick off learning right after others complete learning, similar to the sequential fall of domino cards. To understand the Domino effect and relevant behaviors of skill learning, we take physicists' approach of abstraction and simplification. We propose three models with varying complexities -- the Geometry model, the Resource model, and the Domino model, trading between reality and simplicity. The Domino effect can be reproduced in the Geometry model, whose resource interpretation inspires the Resource model, which can be further simplified to the Domino model. These models present different levels of abstraction and simplification; each is useful to study some aspects of skill learning. The Geometry model provides interesting insights into neural scaling laws and optimizers; the Resource model sheds light on the learning dynamics of compositional tasks; the Domino model reveals the benefits of modularity. These models are not only conceptually interesting -- e.g., we show how Chinchilla scaling laws can emerge from the Geometry model, but also are useful in practice by inspiring algorithmic development -- e.g., we show how simple algorithmic changes, motivated by these toy models, can speed up the training of deep learning models.</description>

      <title>Learning segmentation from point trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of segmenting objects in videos based on their motion and no other forms of supervision. Prior work has often approached this problem by using the principle of common fate, namely the fact that the motion of points that belong to the same object is strongly correlated. However, most authors have only considered instantaneous motion from optical flow. In this work, we present a way to train a segmentation network using long-term point trajectories as a supervisory signal to complement optical flow. The key difficulty is that long-term motion, unlike instantaneous motion, is difficult to model -- any parametric approximation is unlikely to capture complex motion patterns over long periods of time. We instead draw inspiration from subspace clustering approaches, proposing a loss function that seeks to group the trajectories into low-rank matrices where the motion of object points can be approximately explained as a linear combination of other point tracks. Our method outperforms the prior art on motion-based segmentation, which shows the utility of long-term motion and the effectiveness of our formulation.</description>

      <title>Method for the semantic indexing of concept hierarchies, uniform representation, use of relational database systems and generic and case-based reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.01539</link>
      <description>arXiv:1910.01539v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a method for semantic indexing and describes its application in the field of knowledge representation. Starting point of the semantic indexing is the knowledge represented by concept hierarchies. The goal is to assign keys to nodes (concepts) that are hierarchically ordered and syntactically and semantically correct. With the indexing algorithm, keys are computed such that concepts are partially unifiable with all more specific concepts and only semantically correct concepts are allowed to be added. The keys represent terminological relationships. Correctness and completeness of the underlying indexing algorithm are proven. The use of classical relational databases for the storage of instances is described. Because of the uniform representation, inference can be done using case-based reasoning and generic problem solving methods.</description>

      <title>Exploiting Uncertainty for Querying Inconsistent Description Logics Knowledge Bases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.09138v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The necessity to manage inconsistency in Description Logics Knowledge Bases (KBs) has come to the fore with the increasing importance gained by the Semantic Web, where information comes from different sources that constantly change their content and may contain contradictory descriptions when considered either alone or together. Classical reasoning algorithms do not handle inconsistent KBs, forcing the debugging of the KB in order to remove the inconsistency. In this paper, we exploit an existing probabilistic semantics called DISPONTE to overcome this problem and allow queries also in case of inconsistent KBs. We implemented our approach in the reasoners TRILL and BUNDLE and empirically tested the validity of our proposal. Moreover, we formally compare the presented approach to that of the repair semantics, one of the most established semantics when considering DL reasoning tasks.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Agents using Social Choice Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03121v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We argue that many general evaluation problems can be viewed through the lens of voting theory. Each task is interpreted as a separate voter, which requires only ordinal rankings or pairwise comparisons of agents to produce an overall evaluation. By viewing the aggregator as a social welfare function, we are able to leverage centuries of research in social choice theory to derive principled evaluation frameworks with axiomatic foundations. These evaluations are interpretable and flexible, while avoiding many of the problems currently facing cross-task evaluation. We apply this Voting-as-Evaluation (VasE) framework across multiple settings, including reinforcement learning, large language models, and humans. In practice, we observe that VasE can be more robust than popular evaluation frameworks (Elo and Nash averaging), discovers properties in the evaluation data not evident from scores alone, and can predict outcomes better than Elo in a complex seven-player game. We identify one particular approach, maximal lotteries, that satisfies important consistency properties relevant to evaluation, is computationally efficient (polynomial in the size of the evaluation data), and identifies game-theoretic cycles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17643v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present S+t-SNE, an adaptation of the t-SNE algorithm designed to handle infinite data streams. The core idea behind S+t-SNE is to update the t-SNE embedding incrementally as new data arrives, ensuring scalability and adaptability to handle streaming scenarios. By selecting the most important points at each step, the algorithm ensures scalability while keeping informative visualisations. By employing a blind method for drift management, the algorithm adjusts the embedding space, which facilitates the visualisation of evolving data dynamics. Our experimental evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of S+t-SNE, whilst highlighting its ability to capture patterns in a streaming scenario. We hope our approach offers researchers and practitioners a real-time tool for understanding and interpreting high-dimensional data.</description>

      <title>Does GPT Really Get It? A Hierarchical Scale to Quantify Human vs AI's Understanding of Algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14722v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) perform (and sometimes excel at) more and more complex cognitive tasks, a natural question is whether AI really understands. The study of understanding in LLMs is in its infancy, and the community has yet to incorporate well-trodden research in philosophy, psychology, and education. We initiate this, specifically focusing on understanding algorithms, and propose a hierarchy of levels of understanding. We use the hierarchy to design and conduct a study with human subjects (undergraduate and graduate students) as well as large language models (generations of GPT), revealing interesting similarities and differences. We expect that our rigorous criteria will be useful to keep track of AI's progress in such cognitive domains.</description>

      <title>UDC: A Unified Neural Divide-and-Conquer Framework for Large-Scale Combinatorial Optimization Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00312v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Single-stage neural combinatorial optimization solvers have achieved near-optimal results on various small-scale combinatorial optimization (CO) problems without requiring expert knowledge. However, these solvers exhibit significant performance degradation when applied to large-scale CO problems. Recently, two-stage neural methods motivated by divide-and-conquer strategies have shown efficiency in addressing large-scale CO problems. Nevertheless, the performance of these methods highly relies on problem-specific heuristics in either the dividing or the conquering procedure, which limits their applicability to general CO problems. Moreover, these methods employ separate training schemes and ignore the interdependencies between the dividing and conquering strategies, often leading to sub-optimal solutions. To tackle these drawbacks, this article develops a unified neural divide-and-conquer framework (i.e., UDC) for solving general large-scale CO problems. UDC offers a Divide-Conquer-Reunion (DCR) training method to eliminate the negative impact of a sub-optimal dividing policy. Employing a high-efficiency Graph Neural Network (GNN) for global instance dividing and a fixed-length sub-path solver for conquering divided sub-problems, the proposed UDC framework demonstrates extensive applicability, achieving superior performance in 10 representative large-scale CO problems. The code is available at https://github.com/CIAM-Group/NCO_code/tree/main/single_objective/UDC-Large-scale-CO-master.</description>

      <title>BCR-DRL: Behavior- and Context-aware Reward for Deep Reinforcement Learning in Human-AI Coordination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07877v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep reinforcement Learning (DRL) offers a powerful framework for training AI agents to coordinate with human partners. However, DRL faces two critical challenges in human-AI coordination (HAIC): sparse rewards and unpredictable human behaviors. These challenges significantly limit DRL to identify effective coordination policies, due to its impaired capability of optimizing exploration and exploitation. To address these limitations, we propose an innovative behavior- and context-aware reward (BCR) for DRL, which optimizes exploration and exploitation by leveraging human behaviors and contextual information in HAIC. Our BCR consists of two components: (i)~Novel dual intrinsic rewards to enhance exploration. This scheme composes an AI self-motivated intrinsic reward and a human-motivated intrinsic reward, which are designed to increase the capture of sparse rewards by a logarithmic-based strategy; and (ii)~New context-aware weights for the designed rewards to improve exploitation. This mechanism helps the AI agent prioritize actions that better coordinate with the human partner by utilizing contextual information that can reflect the evolution of learning in HAIC. Extensive simulations in the Overcooked environment demonstrate that our approach can increase the cumulative sparse rewards by approximately 20% and reduce the convergence time by about 67% compared to state-of-the-art baselines.</description>

      <title>Mutagenesis screen to map the functions of parameters of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11494v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced artificial intelligence, excelling in numerous tasks. Although the functionality of a model is inherently tied to its parameters, a systematic method for exploring the connections between the parameters and the functionality are lacking. Models sharing similar structure and parameter counts exhibit significant performance disparities across various tasks, prompting investigations into the varying patterns that govern their performance. We adopted a mutagenesis screen approach inspired by the methods used in biological studies, to investigate Llama2-7b and Zephyr. This technique involved mutating elements within the models' matrices to their maximum or minimum values to examine the relationship between model parameters and their functionalities. Our research uncovered multiple levels of fine structures within both models. Many matrices showed a mixture of maximum and minimum mutations following mutagenesis, but others were predominantly sensitive to one type. Notably, mutations that produced phenotypes, especially those with severe outcomes, tended to cluster along axes. Additionally, the location of maximum and minimum mutations often displayed a complementary pattern on matrix in both models, with the Gate matrix showing a unique two-dimensional asymmetry after rearrangement. In Zephyr, certain mutations consistently resulted in poetic or conversational rather than descriptive outputs. These "writer" mutations grouped according to the high-frequency initial word of the output, with a marked tendency to share the row coordinate even when they are in different matrices. Our findings affirm that the mutagenesis screen is an effective tool for deciphering the complexities of large language models and identifying unexpected ways to expand their potential, providing deeper insights into the foundational aspects of AI systems.</description>

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification in travel time estimation (TTE) aims to estimate the confidence interval for travel time, given the origin (O), destination (D), and departure time (T). Accurately quantifying this uncertainty requires generating the most likely path and assessing travel time uncertainty along the path. This involves two main challenges: 1) Predicting a path that aligns with the ground truth, and 2) modeling the impact of travel time in each segment on overall uncertainty under varying conditions. We propose DutyTTE to address these challenges. For the first challenge, we introduce a deep reinforcement learning method to improve alignment between the predicted path and the ground truth, providing more accurate travel time information from road segments to improve TTE. For the second challenge, we propose a mixture of experts guided uncertainty quantification mechanism to better capture travel time uncertainty for each segment under varying contexts. Additionally, we calibrate our results using Hoeffding's upper-confidence bound to provide statistical guarantees for the estimated confidence intervals. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method.</description>

      <title>Learning to Balance Altruism and Self-interest Based on Empathy in Mixed-Motive Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07863v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Real-world multi-agent scenarios often involve mixed motives, demanding altruistic agents capable of self-protection against potential exploitation. However, existing approaches often struggle to achieve both objectives. In this paper, based on that empathic responses are modulated by inferred social relationships between agents, we propose LASE Learning to balance Altruism and Self-interest based on Empathy), a distributed multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm that fosters altruistic cooperation through gifting while avoiding exploitation by other agents in mixed-motive games. LASE allocates a portion of its rewards to co-players as gifts, with this allocation adapting dynamically based on the social relationship -- a metric evaluating the friendliness of co-players estimated by counterfactual reasoning. In particular, social relationship measures each co-player by comparing the estimated $Q$-function of current joint action to a counterfactual baseline which marginalizes the co-player's action, with its action distribution inferred by a perspective-taking module. Comprehensive experiments are performed in spatially and temporally extended mixed-motive games, demonstrating LASE's ability to promote group collaboration without compromising fairness and its capacity to adapt policies to various types of interactive co-players.</description>

      <title>FLARE: Faithful Logic-Aided Reasoning and Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11900v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern Question Answering (QA) and Reasoning approaches based on Large Language Models (LLMs) commonly use prompting techniques, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT), assuming the resulting generation will have a more granular exploration and reasoning over the question space and scope. However, such methods struggle with generating outputs that are faithful to the intermediate chain of reasoning produced by the model. On the other end of the spectrum, neuro-symbolic methods such as Faithful CoT (F-CoT) propose to combine LLMs with external symbolic solvers. While such approaches boast a high degree of faithfulness, they usually require a model trained for code generation and struggle with tasks that are ambiguous or hard to formalise strictly. We introduce $\textbf{F}$aithful $\textbf{L}$ogic-$\textbf{A}$ided $\textbf{R}$easoning and $\textbf{E}$xploration ($\textbf{FLARE}$), a novel interpretable approach for traversing the problem space using task decompositions. We use the LLM to plan a solution, soft-formalise the query into facts and predicates using a logic programming code and simulate that code execution using an exhaustive multi-hop search over the defined space. Our method allows us to compute the faithfulness of the reasoning process w.r.t. the generated code and analyse the steps of the multi-hop search without relying on external solvers. Our methods achieve SOTA results on $\mathbf{7}$ out of $\mathbf{9}$ diverse reasoning benchmarks. We also show that model faithfulness positively correlates with overall performance and further demonstrate that $\textbf{FLARE}$ allows pinpointing the decisive factors sufficient for and leading to the correct answer with optimal reasoning during the multi-hop search.</description>

      <title>The Ramanujan Library -- Automated Discovery on the Hypergraph of Integer Relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12361v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fundamental mathematical constants appear in nearly every field of science, from physics to biology. Formulas that connect different constants often bring great insight by hinting at connections between previously disparate fields. Discoveries of such relations, however, have remained scarce events, relying on sporadic strokes of creativity by human mathematicians. Recent developments of algorithms for automated conjecture generation have accelerated the discovery of formulas for specific constants. Yet, the discovery of connections between constants has not been addressed. In this paper, we present the first library dedicated to mathematical constants and their interrelations. This library can serve as a central repository of knowledge for scientists from different areas, and as a collaborative platform for development of new algorithms. The library is based on a new representation that we propose for organizing the formulas of mathematical constants: a hypergraph, with each node representing a constant and each edge representing a formula. Using this representation, we propose and demonstrate a systematic approach for automatically enriching this library using PSLQ, an integer relation algorithm based on QR decomposition and lattice construction. During its development and testing, our strategy led to the discovery of 75 previously unknown connections between constants, including a new formula for the `first continued fraction' constant $C_1$, novel formulas for natural logarithms, and new formulas connecting $\pi$ and $e$. The latter formulas generalize a century-old relation between $\pi$ and $e$ by Ramanujan, which until now was considered a singular formula and is now found to be part of a broader mathematical structure. The code supporting this library is a public, open-source API that can serve researchers in experimental mathematics and other fields of science.</description>

Abstract: Systems thinking provides us with a way to model the algorithmic fairness problem by allowing us to encode prior knowledge and assumptions about where we believe bias might exist in the data generating process. We can then encode these beliefs as a series of causal graphs, enabling us to link AI/ML systems to politics and the law. This allows us to combine techniques from machine learning, causal inference, and system dynamics in order to capture different emergent aspects of the fairness problem. We can use systems thinking to help policymakers on both sides of the political aisle to understand the complex trade-offs that exist from different types of fairness policies, providing a sociotechnical foundation for designing AI policy that is aligned to their political agendas and with society's values.</description>

      <title>DCOR: Anomaly Detection in Attributed Networks via Dual Contrastive Learning Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16788v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Anomaly detection using a network-based approach is one of the most efficient ways to identify abnormal events such as fraud, security breaches, and system faults in a variety of applied domains. While most of the earlier works address the complex nature of graph-structured data and predefined anomalies, the impact of data attributes and emerging anomalies are often neglected. This paper introduces DCOR, a novel approach on attributed networks that integrates reconstruction-based anomaly detection with Contrastive Learning. Utilizing a Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework, DCOR contrasts the reconstructed adjacency and feature matrices from both the original and augmented graphs to detect subtle anomalies. We employed comprehensive experimental studies on benchmark datasets through standard evaluation measures. The results show that DCOR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Obtained results demonstrate the efficacy of proposed approach in attributed networks with the potential of uncovering new patterns of anomalies.</description>

      <title>On the Feasibility of Vision-Language Models for Time-Series Classification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17304v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We build upon time-series classification by leveraging the capabilities of Vision Language Models (VLMs). We find that VLMs produce competitive results after two or less epochs of fine-tuning. We develop a novel approach that incorporates graphical data representations as images in conjunction with numerical data. This approach is rooted in the hypothesis that graphical representations can provide additional contextual information that numerical data alone may not capture. Additionally, providing a graphical representation can circumvent issues such as limited context length faced by LLMs. To further advance this work, we implemented a scalable end-to-end pipeline for training on different scenarios, allowing us to isolate the most effective strategies for transferring learning capabilities from LLMs to Time Series Classification (TSC) tasks. Our approach works with univariate and multivariate time-series data. In addition, we conduct extensive and practical experiments to show how this approach works for time-series classification and generative labels.</description>

      <title>Strategy Masking: A Method for Guardrails in Value-based Reinforcement Learning Agents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05501v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The use of reward functions to structure AI learning and decision making is core to the current reinforcement learning paradigm; however, without careful design of reward functions, agents can learn to solve problems in ways that may be considered "undesirable" or "unethical." Without thorough understanding of the incentives a reward function creates, it can be difficult to impose principled yet general control mechanisms over its behavior. In this paper, we study methods for constructing guardrails for AI agents that use reward functions to learn decision making. We introduce a novel approach, which we call strategy masking, to explicitly learn and then suppress undesirable AI agent behavior. We apply our method to study lying in AI agents and show that it can be used to effectively modify agent behavior by suppressing lying post-training without compromising agent ability to perform effectively.</description>

      <title>Synergizing Large Language Models and Task-specific Models for Time Series Anomaly Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05675v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In anomaly detection, methods based on large language models (LLMs) can incorporate expert knowledge by reading professional document, while task-specific small models excel at extracting normal data patterns and detecting value fluctuations from training data of target applications. Inspired by the human nervous system, where the brain stores expert knowledge and the peripheral nervous system and spinal cord handle specific tasks like withdrawal and knee-jerk reflexes, we propose CoLLaTe, a framework designed to facilitate collaboration between LLMs and task-specific models, leveraging the strengths of both models for anomaly detection.
  In particular, we first formulate the collaboration process and identify two key challenges in the collaboration:
  (1) the misalignment between the expression domains of the LLMs and task-specific small models, and (2) error accumulation arising from the predictions of both models.
  To address these challenges, we then introduce two key components in CoLLaTe: a model alignment module and a collaborative loss function. Through theoretical analysis and experimental validation, we demonstrate that these components effectively mitigate the identified challenges and achieve better performance than both LLM-based and task-specific models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07088v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: TTS (Text-to-Speech) document reader from Microsoft, Adobe, Apple, and OpenAI have been serviced worldwide. They provide relatively good TTS results for general plain text, but sometimes skip contents or provide unsatisfactory results for mathematical expressions. This is because most modern academic papers are written in LaTeX, and when LaTeX formulas are compiled, they are rendered as distinctive text forms within the document. However, traditional TTS document readers output only the text as it is recognized, without considering the mathematical meaning of the formulas. To address this issue, we propose MathReader, which effectively integrates OCR, a fine-tuned T5 model, and TTS. MathReader demonstrated a lower Word Error Rate (WER) than existing TTS document readers, such as Microsoft Edge and Adobe Acrobat, when processing documents containing mathematical formulas. MathReader reduced the WER from 0.510 to 0.281 compared to Microsoft Edge, and from 0.617 to 0.281 compared to Adobe Acrobat. This will significantly contribute to alleviating the inconvenience faced by users who want to listen to documents, especially those who are visually impaired.

      <title>Development and Validation of the Provider Documentation Summarization Quality Instrument for Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08977v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are integrated into electronic health record (EHR) workflows, validated instruments are essential to evaluate their performance before implementation. Existing instruments for provider documentation quality are often unsuitable for the complexities of LLM-generated text and lack validation on real-world data. The Provider Documentation Summarization Quality Instrument (PDSQI-9) was developed to evaluate LLM-generated clinical summaries. Multi-document summaries were generated from real-world EHR data across multiple specialties using several LLMs (GPT-4o, Mixtral 8x7b, and Llama 3-8b). Validation included Pearson correlation for substantive validity, factor analysis and Cronbach's alpha for structural validity, inter-rater reliability (ICC and Krippendorff's alpha) for generalizability, a semi-Delphi process for content validity, and comparisons of high-versus low-quality summaries for discriminant validity. Seven physician raters evaluated 779 summaries and answered 8,329 questions, achieving over 80% power for inter-rater reliability. The PDSQI-9 demonstrated strong internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.879; 95% CI: 0.867-0.891) and high inter-rater reliability (ICC = 0.867; 95% CI: 0.867-0.868), supporting structural validity and generalizability. Factor analysis identified a 4-factor model explaining 58% of the variance, representing organization, clarity, accuracy, and utility. Substantive validity was supported by correlations between note length and scores for Succinct (rho = -0.200, p = 0.029) and Organized ($\rho = -0.190$, $p = 0.037$). Discriminant validity distinguished high- from low-quality summaries ($p &lt; 0.001$). The PDSQI-9 demonstrates robust construct validity, supporting its use in clinical practice to evaluate LLM-generated summaries and facilitate safer integration of LLMs into healthcare workflows.</description>

      <title>Aligning Instruction Tuning with Pre-training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09368v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Instruction tuning enhances large language models (LLMs) to follow human instructions across diverse tasks, relying on high-quality datasets to guide behavior. However, these datasets, whether manually curated or synthetically generated, are often narrowly focused and misaligned with the broad distributions captured during pre-training, limiting LLM generalization and effective use of pre-trained knowledge. We propose Aligning Instruction Tuning with Pre-training (AITP), a method that bridges this gap by identifying coverage shortfalls in instruction-tuning datasets and rewriting underrepresented pre-training data into high-quality instruction-response pairs. This approach enriches dataset diversity while preserving task-specific objectives. Evaluations on three fully open LLMs across eight benchmarks demonstrate consistent performance improvements with AITP. Ablations highlight the benefits of adaptive data selection, controlled rewriting, and balanced integration, emphasizing the importance of aligning instruction tuning with pre-training distributions to unlock the full potential of LLMs.</description>

      <title>Inference-Time Alignment in Diffusion Models with Reward-Guided Generation: Tutorial and Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09685v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This tutorial provides an in-depth guide on inference-time guidance and alignment methods for optimizing downstream reward functions in diffusion models. While diffusion models are renowned for their generative modeling capabilities, practical applications in fields such as biology often require sample generation that maximizes specific metrics (e.g., stability, affinity in proteins, closeness to target structures). In these scenarios, diffusion models can be adapted not only to generate realistic samples but also to explicitly maximize desired measures at inference time without fine-tuning. This tutorial explores the foundational aspects of such inference-time algorithms. We review these methods from a unified perspective, demonstrating that current techniques -- such as Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC)-based guidance, value-based sampling, and classifier guidance -- aim to approximate soft optimal denoising processes (a.k.a. policies in RL) that combine pre-trained denoising processes with value functions serving as look-ahead functions that predict from intermediate states to terminal rewards. Within this framework, we present several novel algorithms not yet covered in the literature. Furthermore, we discuss (1) fine-tuning methods combined with inference-time techniques, (2) inference-time algorithms based on search algorithms such as Monte Carlo tree search, which have received limited attention in current research, and (3) connections between inference-time algorithms in language models and diffusion models.

      <title>Aerial Monocular 3D Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.03974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.03974v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Drones equipped with cameras can significantly enhance human ability to perceive the world because of their remarkable maneuverability in 3D space. Ironically, object detection for drones has always been conducted in the 2D image space, which fundamentally limits their ability to understand 3D scenes. Furthermore, existing 3D object detection methods developed for autonomous driving cannot be directly applied to drones due to the lack of deformation modeling, which is essential for the distant aerial perspective with sensitive distortion and small objects. To fill the gap, this work proposes a dual-view detection system named DVDET to achieve aerial monocular object detection in both the 2D image space and the 3D physical space. To address the severe view deformation issue, we propose a novel trainable geo-deformable transformation module that can properly warp information from the drone's perspective to the BEV. Compared to the monocular methods for cars, our transformation includes a learnable deformable network for explicitly revising the severe deviation. To address the dataset challenge, we propose a new large-scale simulation dataset named AM3D-Sim, generated by the co-simulation of AirSIM and CARLA, and a new real-world aerial dataset named AM3D-Real, collected by DJI Matrice 300 RTK, in both datasets, high-quality annotations for 3D object detection are provided. Extensive experiments show that i) aerial monocular 3D object detection is feasible; ii) the model pre-trained on the simulation dataset benefits real-world performance, and iii) DVDET also benefits monocular 3D object detection for cars. To encourage more researchers to investigate this area, we will release the dataset and related code in https://github.com/PhyllisH/DVDET.</description>

      <title>Selective Uncertainty Propagation in Offline RL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.00284v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the finite-horizon offline reinforcement learning (RL) setting, and are motivated by the challenge of learning the policy at any step h in dynamic programming (DP) algorithms. To learn this, it is sufficient to evaluate the treatment effect of deviating from the behavioral policy at step h after having optimized the policy for all future steps. Since the policy at any step can affect next-state distributions, the related distributional shift challenges can make this problem far more statistically hard than estimating such treatment effects in the stochastic contextual bandit setting. However, the hardness of many real-world RL instances lies between the two regimes. We develop a flexible and general method called selective uncertainty propagation for confidence interval construction that adapts to the hardness of the associated distribution shift challenges. We show benefits of our approach on toy environments and demonstrate the benefits of these techniques for offline policy learning.</description>

      <title>Experts' cognition-driven safe noisy labels learning for precise segmentation of residual tumor in breast cancer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.07295v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Precise segmentation of residual tumor in breast cancer (PSRTBC) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy is a fundamental key technique in the treatment process of breast cancer. However, achieving PSRTBC is still a challenge, since the breast cancer tissue and tumor cells commonly have complex and varied morphological changes after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, which inevitably increases the difficulty to produce a predictive model that has good generalization with usual supervised learning (SL). To alleviate this situation, in this paper, we propose an experts' cognition-driven safe noisy labels learning (ECDSNLL) approach. In the concept of safe noisy labels learning, which is a typical type of safe weakly supervised learning, ECDSNLL is constructed by integrating the pathology experts' cognition about identifying residual tumor in breast cancer and the artificial intelligence experts' cognition about data modeling with provided data basis. Experimental results show that, compared with usual SL, ECDSNLL can significantly improve the lower bound of a number of UNet variants with 2.42% and 4.1% respectively in recall and fIoU for PSRTBC, while being able to achieve improvements in mean value and upper bound as well.</description>

      <title>Transformer-Based Model for Monocular Visual Odometry: A Video Understanding Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.06121v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Estimating the camera's pose given images from a single camera is a traditional task in mobile robots and autonomous vehicles. This problem is called monocular visual odometry and often relies on geometric approaches that require considerable engineering effort for a specific scenario. Deep learning methods have been shown to be generalizable after proper training and with a large amount of available data. Transformer-based architectures have dominated the state-of-the-art in natural language processing and computer vision tasks, such as image and video understanding. In this work, we deal with the monocular visual odometry as a video understanding task to estimate the 6 degrees of freedom of a camera's pose. We contribute by presenting the TSformer-VO model based on spatio-temporal self-attention mechanisms to extract features from clips and estimate the motions in an end-to-end manner. Our approach achieved competitive state-of-the-art performance compared with geometry-based and deep learning-based methods on the KITTI visual odometry dataset, outperforming the DeepVO implementation highly accepted in the visual odometry community. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/aofrancani/TSformer-VO.</description>

      <title>AI Techniques in the Microservices Life-Cycle: A Systematic Mapping Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.16092v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The use of AI in microservices (MSs) is an emerging field as indicated by a substantial number of surveys. However these surveys focus on a specific problem using specific AI techniques, therefore not fully capturing the growth of research and the rise and disappearance of trends. In our systematic mapping study, we take an exhaustive approach to reveal all possible connections between the use of AI techniques for improving any quality attribute (QA) of MSs during the DevOps phases. Our results include 16 research themes that connect to the intersection of particular QAs, AI domains and DevOps phases. Moreover by mapping identified future research challenges and relevant industry domains, we can show that many studies aim to deliver prototypes to be automated at a later stage, aiming at providing exploitable products in a number of key industry domains.</description>

      <title>Learning Unified Distance Metric Across Diverse Data Distributions with Parameter-Efficient Transfer Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.08944v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A common practice in metric learning is to train and test an embedding model for each dataset. This dataset-specific approach fails to simulate real-world scenarios that involve multiple heterogeneous distributions of data. In this regard, we explore a new metric learning paradigm, called Unified Metric Learning (UML), which learns a unified distance metric capable of capturing relations across multiple data distributions. UML presents new challenges, such as imbalanced data distribution and bias towards dominant distributions. These issues cause standard metric learning methods to fail in learning a unified metric. To address these challenges, we propose Parameter-efficient Unified Metric leArning (PUMA), which consists of a pre-trained frozen model and two additional modules, stochastic adapter and prompt pool. These modules enable to capture dataset-specific knowledge while avoiding bias towards dominant distributions. Additionally, we compile a new unified metric learning benchmark with a total of 8 different datasets. PUMA outperforms the state-of-the-art dataset-specific models while using about 69 times fewer trainable parameters.</description>

      <title>Sweeping Heterogeneity with Smart MoPs: Mixture of Prompts for LLM Task Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02842v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have the ability to solve a variety of tasks, such as text summarization and mathematical questions, just out of the box, but they are often trained with a single task in mind. Due to high computational costs, the current trend is to use prompt instruction tuning to better adjust monolithic, pretrained LLMs for new -- but often individual -- downstream tasks. Thus, how one would expand prompt tuning to handle -- concomitantly -- heterogeneous tasks and data distributions is a widely open question. To address this gap, we suggest the use of \emph{Mixture of Prompts}, or MoPs, associated with smart gating functionality: the latter -- whose design is one of the contributions of this paper -- can identify relevant skills embedded in different groups of prompts and dynamically assign combined experts (i.e., collection of prompts), based on the target task. Additionally, MoPs are empirically agnostic to any model compression technique applied -- for efficiency reasons -- as well as instruction data source and task composition. In practice, MoPs can simultaneously mitigate prompt training "interference" in multi-task, multi-source scenarios (e.g., task and data heterogeneity across sources), as well as possible implications from model approximations. As a highlight, MoPs manage to decrease final perplexity from $\sim20\%$ up to $\sim70\%$, as compared to baselines, in the federated scenario, and from $\sim 3\%$ up to $\sim30\%$ in the centralized scenario.</description>

      <title>AutoMix: Automatically Mixing Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.12963v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are now available from cloud API providers in various sizes and configurations. While this diversity offers a broad spectrum of choices, effectively leveraging the options to optimize computational cost and performance remains challenging. In this work, we present Automix, an approach that strategically routes queries to larger LMs, based on the approximate correctness of outputs from a smaller LM. Central to Automix are two key technical contributions. First, it has a few-shot self-verification mechanism, which estimates the reliability of its own outputs without requiring extensive training. Second, given that self-verification can be noisy, it employs a POMDP based router that can effectively select an appropriately sized model, based on answer confidence. Experiments across five language models and five challenging datasets show that Automix consistently surpasses strong baselines, reducing computational cost by over 50% for comparable performance.</description>

      <title>FigStep: Jailbreaking Large Vision-Language Models via Typographic Visual Prompts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05608v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) signify a groundbreaking paradigm shift within the Artificial Intelligence (AI) community, extending beyond the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by assimilating additional modalities (e.g., images). Despite this advancement, the safety of LVLMs remains adequately underexplored, with a potential overreliance on the safety assurances purported by their underlying LLMs. In this paper, we propose FigStep, a straightforward yet effective black-box jailbreak algorithm against LVLMs. Instead of feeding textual harmful instructions directly, FigStep converts the prohibited content into images through typography to bypass the safety alignment. The experimental results indicate that FigStep can achieve an average attack success rate of 82.50% on six promising open-source LVLMs. Not merely to demonstrate the efficacy of FigStep, we conduct comprehensive ablation studies and analyze the distribution of the semantic embeddings to uncover that the reason behind the success of FigStep is the deficiency of safety alignment for visual embeddings. Moreover, we compare FigStep with five text-only jailbreaks and four image-based jailbreaks to demonstrate the superiority of FigStep, i.e., negligible attack costs and better attack performance. Above all, our work reveals that current LVLMs are vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, which highlights the necessity of novel cross-modality safety alignment techniques.

Abstract: We analyze geometric aspects of the gradient descent algorithm in Deep Learning (DL), and give a detailed discussion of the circumstance that in underparametrized DL networks, zero loss minimization can generically not be attained. As a consequence, we conclude that the distribution of training inputs must necessarily be non-generic in order to produce zero loss minimizers, both for the method constructed in [Chen-Munoz Ewald 2023, 2024], or for gradient descent [Chen 2025] (which assume clustering of training data).</description>

      <title>Diversify, Don't Fine-Tune: Scaling Up Visual Recognition Training with Synthetic Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02253v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in generative deep learning have enabled the creation of high-quality synthetic images in text-to-image generation. Prior work shows that fine-tuning a pretrained diffusion model on ImageNet and generating synthetic training images from the finetuned model can enhance an ImageNet classifier's performance. However, performance degrades as synthetic images outnumber real ones. In this paper, we explore whether generative fine-tuning is essential for this improvement and whether it is possible to further scale up training using more synthetic data. We present a new framework leveraging off-the-shelf generative models to generate synthetic training images, addressing multiple challenges: class name ambiguity, lack of diversity in naive prompts, and domain shifts. Specifically, we leverage large language models (LLMs) and CLIP to resolve class name ambiguity. To diversify images, we propose contextualized diversification (CD) and stylized diversification (SD) methods, also prompted by LLMs. Finally, to mitigate domain shifts, we leverage domain adaptation techniques with auxiliary batch normalization for synthetic images. Our framework consistently enhances recognition model performance with more synthetic data, up to 6x of original ImageNet size showcasing the potential of synthetic data for improved recognition models and strong out-of-domain generalization.</description>

      <title>SimPSI: A Simple Strategy to Preserve Spectral Information in Time Series Data Augmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.05790v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data augmentation is a crucial component in training neural networks to overcome the limitation imposed by data size, and several techniques have been studied for time series. Although these techniques are effective in certain tasks, they have yet to be generalized to time series benchmarks. We find that current data augmentation techniques ruin the core information contained within the frequency domain. To address this issue, we propose a simple strategy to preserve spectral information (SimPSI) in time series data augmentation. SimPSI preserves the spectral information by mixing the original and augmented input spectrum weighted by a preservation map, which indicates the importance score of each frequency. Specifically, our experimental contributions are to build three distinct preservation maps: magnitude spectrum, saliency map, and spectrum-preservative map. We apply SimPSI to various time series data augmentations and evaluate its effectiveness across a wide range of time series benchmarks. Our experimental results support that SimPSI considerably enhances the performance of time series data augmentations by preserving core spectral information.

      <title>CoT-Driven Framework for Short Text Classification: Enhancing and Transferring Capabilities from Large to Smaller Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03158v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Short Text Classification (STC) is crucial for processing and understanding the brief but substantial content prevalent on contemporary digital platforms. The STC encounters difficulties in grasping the semantic and syntactic intricacies, an issue that is apparent in traditional pre-trained language models. Although Graph Convolutional Networks enhance performance by integrating external knowledge bases, these methods are limited by the quality and extent of the knowledge applied. Recently, the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) has significantly improved the performance of complex reasoning tasks. However, some studies have highlighted the limitations of their application in fundamental NLP tasks. Consequently, this study first employs CoT to investigate and enhance the capabilities of LLMs in STC tasks. We propose the Syntactic and Semantic Enrichment CoT (SSE-CoT) method, effectively decomposing the STC tasks into four distinct steps: (i) essential concept identification, (ii) common-sense knowledge retrieval, (iii) text rewriting, and (iv) classification. Furthermore, recognizing resource constraints in sectors like finance and healthcare, we then introduce the CoT-Driven Multi-Task Learning (CDMT) framework to extend these capabilities to smaller models. This framework begins by extracting rationales from LLMs and subsequently fine-tunes smaller models to optimize their performance. Extensive experimentation across six short-text benchmarks validated the efficacy of the proposed methods. In particular, SSE-CoT achieved state-of-the-art performance with substantial improvements on all datasets, particularly on the Ohsumed and TagMyNews datasets.</description>

      <title>DurFlex-EVC: Duration-Flexible Emotional Voice Conversion Leveraging Discrete Representations without Text Alignment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08095v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Emotional voice conversion (EVC) involves modifying various acoustic characteristics, such as pitch and spectral envelope, to match a desired emotional state while preserving the speaker's identity. Existing EVC methods often rely on text transcriptions or time-alignment information and struggle to handle varying speech durations effectively. In this paper, we propose DurFlex-EVC, a duration-flexible EVC framework that operates without the need for text or alignment information. We introduce a unit aligner that models contextual information by aligning speech with discrete units representing content, eliminating the need for text or speech-text alignment. Additionally, we design a style autoencoder that effectively disentangles content and emotional style, allowing precise manipulation of the emotional characteristics of the speech. We further enhance emotional expressiveness through a hierarchical stylize encoder that applies the target emotional style at multiple hierarchical levels, refining the stylization process to improve the naturalness and expressiveness of the converted speech. Experimental results from subjective and objective evaluations demonstrate that our approach outperforms baseline models, effectively handling duration variability and enhancing emotional expressiveness in the converted speech.</description>

      <title>Social Interpretable Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) bears the promise of being a game-changer in many applications. However, since most of the literature in the field is currently focused on opaque models, the use of RL in high-stakes scenarios, where interpretability is crucial, is still limited. Recently, some approaches to interpretable RL, e.g., based on Decision Trees, have been proposed, but one of the main limitations of these techniques is their training cost. To overcome this limitation, we propose a new method, called Social Interpretable RL (SIRL), that can substantially reduce the number of episodes needed for training. Our method mimics a social learning process, where each agent in a group learns to solve a given task based both on its own individual experience as well as the experience acquired together with its peers. Our approach is divided into the following two phases. (1) In the collaborative phase, all the agents in the population interact with a shared instance of the environment, where each agent observes the state and independently proposes an action. Then, voting is performed to choose the action that will actually be deployed in the environment. (2) In the individual phase, then, each agent refines its individual performance by interacting with its own instance of the environment. This mechanism makes the agents experience a larger number of episodes with little impact on the computational cost of the process. Our results (on 6 widely-known RL benchmarks) show that SIRL not only reduces the computational cost by a factor varying from a minimum of 43% to a maximum 76%, but it also increases the convergence speed and, often, improves the quality of the solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.00976v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we comprehensively study the inductive biases of two major approaches to augmenting Transformers with a recurrent mechanism: (1) the approach of incorporating a depth-wise recurrence similar to Universal Transformers; and (2) the approach of incorporating a chunk-wise temporal recurrence like Temporal Latent Bottleneck. Furthermore, we propose and investigate novel ways to extend and combine the above methods - for example, we propose a global mean-based dynamic halting mechanism for Universal Transformers and an augmentation of Temporal Latent Bottleneck with elements from Universal Transformer. We compare the models and probe their inductive biases in several diagnostic tasks, such as Long Range Arena (LRA), flip-flop language modeling, ListOps, and Logical Inference. The code is released in: https://github.com/JRC1995/InvestigatingRecurrentTransformers/tree/main</description>

      <title>QF-tuner: Breaking Tradition in Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: Hyperparameter tuning in reinforcement learning algorithms refers to choosing the optimal parameters that may increase the algorithm's performance. Manual or random hyperparameter tuning methods can be problematic, as even slight variations in their values can result in significantly different outcomes in the learning process. In this paper, we propose a new method, QF-tuner, for automatic hyperparameter tuning in the Q-learning algorithm using the FOX optimization algorithm (FOX). A new objective function has been proposed for the FOX, prioritizing reward over learning error and time. QF-tuner starts by running the FOX and tries to minimize the fitness value derived from observations at each iteration by executing the Q-learning algorithm. The proposed method has been evaluated using two control tasks from the OpenAI Gym: CartPole and FrozenLake. The empirical results of the QF-tuner on the CartPole control task show a reward of 499, and on the FrozenLake control task, a reward of 1. These results indicate that the QF-tuner outperforms other optimization algorithms. On the FrozenLake control task, there was a 36\% increase in reward with a 26\% reduction in learning time; on the CartPole control task, there was a 57\% increase in reward with a 20\% decrease in learning time. Thus, the QF-tuner is an essential method for hyperparameter tuning in reinforcement learning algorithms, enabling more effective solutions to control task problems.</description>

      <title>Beyond Specialization: Assessing the Capabilities of MLLMs in Age and Gender Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02302v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have recently gained immense popularity. Powerful commercial models like ChatGPT-4V and Gemini, as well as open-source ones such as LLaVA, are essentially general-purpose models and are applied to solve a wide variety of tasks, including those in computer vision. These neural networks possess such strong general knowledge and reasoning abilities that they have proven capable of working even on tasks for which they were not specifically trained. We compared the capabilities of the most powerful MLLMs to date: ShareGPT4V, ChatGPT, LLaVA-Next in a specialized task of age and gender estimation with our state-of-the-art specialized model, MiVOLO. We also updated MiVOLO and provide details and new metrics in this article. This comparison has yielded some interesting results and insights about the strengths and weaknesses of the participating models. Furthermore, we attempted various ways to fine-tune the ShareGPT4V model for this specific task, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art results in this particular challenge. Although such a model would not be practical in production, as it is incredibly expensive compared to a specialized model like MiVOLO, it could be very useful in some tasks, like data annotation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04652v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Yi model family, a series of language and multimodal models that demonstrate strong multi-dimensional capabilities. The Yi model family is based on 6B and 34B pretrained language models, then we extend them to chat models, 200K long context models, depth-upscaled models, and vision-language models. Our base models achieve strong performance on a wide range of benchmarks like MMLU, and our finetuned chat models deliver strong human preference rate on major evaluation platforms like AlpacaEval and Chatbot Arena. Building upon our scalable super-computing infrastructure and the classical transformer architecture, we attribute the performance of Yi models primarily to its data quality resulting from our data-engineering efforts. For pretraining, we construct 3.1 trillion tokens of English and Chinese corpora using a cascaded data deduplication and quality filtering pipeline. For finetuning, we polish a small scale (less than 10K) instruction dataset over multiple iterations such that every single instance has been verified directly by our machine learning engineers. For vision-language, we combine the chat language model with a vision transformer encoder and train the model to align visual representations to the semantic space of the language model. We further extend the context length to 200K through lightweight continual pretraining and demonstrate strong needle-in-a-haystack retrieval performance. We show that extending the depth of the pretrained checkpoint through continual pretraining further improves performance. We believe that given our current results, continuing to scale up model parameters using thoroughly optimized data will lead to even stronger frontier models.</description>

      <title>The Blind Normalized Stein Variational Gradient Descent-Based Detection for Intelligent Random Access in Cellular IoT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18846v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The lack of an efficient preamble detection algorithm remains a challenge for solving preamble collision problems in intelligent random access (RA) in the cellular Internet of Things (IoT). To address this problem, we present an early preamble detection scheme based on a maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) model at the first step of the grant-based RA procedure. A novel blind normalized Stein variational gradient descent (SVGD)-based detector is proposed to obtain an approximate solution to the MLE model. First, by exploring the relationship between the Hadamard transform and wavelet packet transform, a new modified Hadamard transform (MHT) is developed to separate high-frequency components from signals using the second-order derivative filter. Next, to eliminate noise and mitigate the vanishing gradients problem in the SVGD-based detectors, the block MHT layer is designed based on the MHT, scaling layer, soft-thresholding layer, inverse MHT and sparsity penalty. Then, the blind normalized SVGD algorithm is derived to perform preamble detection without prior knowledge of noise power and the number of active IoT devices. The experimental results show the proposed block MHT layer outperforms other transform-based methods in terms of computation costs and denoising performance. Furthermore, with the assistance of the block MHT layer, the proposed blind normalized SVGD algorithm achieves a higher preamble detection accuracy and throughput than other state-of-the-art detection methods.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Quantum Superposition to Infer the Dynamic Behavior of a Spatial-Temporal Neural Network Signaling Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18963v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The exploration of new problem classes for quantum computation is an active area of research. In this paper, we introduce and solve a novel problem class related to dynamics on large-scale networks relevant to neurobiology and machine learning. Specifically, we ask if a network can sustain inherent dynamic activity beyond some arbitrary observation time or if the activity ceases through quiescence or saturation via an epileptic-like state. We show that this class of problems can be formulated and structured to take advantage of quantum superposition and solved efficiently using the Deutsch-Jozsa and Grover quantum algorithms. To do so, we extend their functionality to address the unique requirements of how input (sub)sets into the algorithms must be mathematically structured while simultaneously constructing the inputs so that measurement outputs can be interpreted as meaningful properties of the network dynamics. This, in turn, allows us to answer the question we pose.</description>

      <title>List Items One by One: A New Data Source and Learning Paradigm for Multimodal LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16375v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Set-of-Mark (SoM) Prompting unleashes the visual grounding capability of GPT-4V, by enabling the model to associate visual objects with tags inserted on the image. These tags, marked with alphanumerics, can be indexed via text tokens for easy reference. Despite the extraordinary performance from GPT-4V, we observe that other Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) struggle to understand these visual tags. To promote the learning of SoM prompting for open-source models, we propose a new learning paradigm: "list items one by one," which asks the model to enumerate and describe all visual tags placed on the image following the alphanumeric orders of tags. By integrating our curated dataset with other visual instruction tuning datasets, we are able to equip existing MLLMs with the SoM prompting ability. Furthermore, we evaluate our finetuned SoM models on five MLLM benchmarks. We find that this new dataset, even in a relatively small size (10k-30k images with tags), significantly enhances visual reasoning capabilities and reduces hallucinations for MLLMs. Perhaps surprisingly, these improvements persist even when the visual tags are omitted from input images during inference. This suggests the potential of "list items one by one" as a new paradigm for training MLLMs, which strengthens the object-text alignment through the use of visual tags in the training stage. Finally, we conduct analyses by probing trained models to understand the working mechanism of SoM. Our code and data are available at \url{https://github.com/zzxslp/SoM-LLaVA}.</description>

      <title>Positional encoding is not the same as context: A study on positional encoding for sequential recommendation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10436v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid growth of streaming media and e-commerce has driven advancements in recommendation systems, particularly Sequential Recommendation Systems (SRS). These systems employ users' interaction histories to predict future preferences. While recent research has focused on architectural innovations like transformer blocks and feature extraction, positional encodings, crucial for capturing temporal patterns, have received less attention. These encodings are often conflated with contextual, such as the temporal footprint, which previous works tend to treat as interchangeable with positional information. This paper highlights the critical distinction between temporal footprint and positional encodings, demonstrating that the latter offers unique relational cues between items, which the temporal footprint alone cannot provide. Through extensive experimentation on eight Amazon datasets and subsets, we assess the impact of various encodings on performance metrics and training stability. We introduce new positional encodings and investigate integration strategies that improve both metrics and stability, surpassing state-of-the-art results at the time of this work's initial preprint. Importantly, we demonstrate that selecting the appropriate encoding is not only key to better performance but also essential for building robust, reliable SRS models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13093v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Thermodynamics-informed neural networks employ inductive biases for the enforcement of the first and second principles of thermodynamics. To construct these biases, a metriplectic evolution of the system is assumed. This provides excellent results, when compared to uninformed, black box networks. While the degree of accuracy can be increased in one or two orders of magnitude, in the case of graph networks, this requires assembling global Poisson and dissipation matrices, which breaks the local structure of such networks. In order to avoid this drawback, a local version of the metriplectic biases has been developed in this work, which avoids the aforementioned matrix assembly, thus preserving the node-by-node structure of the graph networks. We apply this framework for examples in the fields of solid and fluid mechanics. Our approach demonstrates significant computational efficiency and strong generalization capabilities, accurately making inferences on examples significantly different from those encountered during training.</description>

Abstract: Traditional computer-aided synthesis planning (CASP) methods rely on iterative single-step predictions, leading to exponential search space growth that limits efficiency and scalability. We introduce a series of transformer-based models, utilizing mixture of experts approach, that directly generate multistep synthetic routes as a single string by conditionally predicting each molecule based on all preceding ones. Our models can accommodate specific conditions such as the desired number of steps and starting materials, with the top-performing DMS-Flex (Duo) surpassing state-of-the-art methods on the PaRoutes dataset with a 2.5x improvement in Top-1 accuracy on the n$_1$ test set and a 3.9x improvement on the n$_5$ test set. It also successfully predicts routes for FDA-approved drugs not included in the training data, showcasing its generalization capabilities. While the current suboptimal diversity of the training set may impact performance on less common reaction types, our multistep-first approach presents a promising direction towards fully automated retrosynthetic planning.</description>

      <title>Automatic Fused Multimodal Deep Learning for Plant Identification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01455v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Plant classification is vital for ecological conservation and agricultural productivity, enhancing our understanding of plant growth dynamics and aiding species preservation. The advent of deep learning (DL) techniques has revolutionized this field by enabling autonomous feature extraction, significantly reducing the dependence on manual expertise. However, conventional DL models often rely solely on single data sources, failing to capture the full biological diversity of plant species comprehensively. Recent research has turned to multimodal learning to overcome this limitation by integrating multiple data types, which enriches the representation of plant characteristics. This shift introduces the challenge of determining the optimal point for modality fusion. In this paper, we introduce a pioneering multimodal DL-based approach for plant classification with automatic modality fusion. Utilizing the multimodal fusion architecture search, our method integrates images from multiple plant organs -- flowers, leaves, fruits, and stems -- into a cohesive model. To address the lack of multimodal datasets, we contributed Multimodal-PlantCLEF, a restructured version of the PlantCLEF2015 dataset tailored for multimodal tasks. Our method achieves 82.61% accuracy on 979 classes of Multimodal-PlantCLEF, surpassing state-of-the-art methods and outperforming late fusion by 10.33%. Through the incorporation of multimodal dropout, our approach demonstrates strong robustness to missing modalities. We validate our model against established benchmarks using standard performance metrics and McNemar's test, further underscoring its superiority.</description>

      <title>Unleashing the Denoising Capability of Diffusion Prior for Solving Inverse Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06959v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent emergence of diffusion models has significantly advanced the precision of learnable priors, presenting innovative avenues for addressing inverse problems. Since inverse problems inherently entail maximum a posteriori estimation, previous works have endeavored to integrate diffusion priors into the optimization frameworks. However, prevailing optimization-based inverse algorithms primarily exploit the prior information within the diffusion models while neglecting their denoising capability. To bridge this gap, this work leverages the diffusion process to reframe noisy inverse problems as a two-variable constrained optimization task by introducing an auxiliary optimization variable. By employing gradient truncation, the projection gradient descent method is efficiently utilized to solve the corresponding optimization problem. The proposed algorithm, termed ProjDiff, effectively harnesses the prior information and the denoising capability of a pre-trained diffusion model within the optimization framework. Extensive experiments on the image restoration tasks and source separation and partial generation tasks demonstrate that ProjDiff exhibits superior performance across various linear and nonlinear inverse problems, highlighting its potential for practical applications.

      <title>SilverSpeak: Evading AI-Generated Text Detectors using Homoglyphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11239v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has enabled the generation of text that increasingly exhibits human-like characteristics. As the detection of such content is of significant importance, substantial research has been conducted with the objective of developing reliable AI-generated text detectors. These detectors have demonstrated promising results on test data, but recent research has revealed that they can be circumvented by employing different techniques.
  In this paper, we present homoglyph-based attacks (A $\rightarrow$ Cyrillic A) as a means of circumventing existing detectors. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation to assess the effectiveness of these attacks on seven detectors, including ArguGPT, Binoculars, DetectGPT, Fast-DetectGPT, Ghostbuster, OpenAI's detector, and watermarking techniques, on five different datasets. Our findings demonstrate that homoglyph-based attacks can effectively circumvent state-of-the-art detectors, leading them to classify all texts as either AI-generated or human-written (decreasing the average Matthews Correlation Coefficient from 0.64 to -0.01). Through further examination, we extract the technical justification underlying the success of the attacks, which varies across detectors. Finally, we discuss the implications of these findings and potential defenses against such attacks.</description>

      <title>Judging the Judges: Evaluating Alignment and Vulnerabilities in LLMs-as-Judges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12624v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Offering a promising solution to the scalability challenges associated with human evaluation, the LLM-as-a-judge paradigm is rapidly gaining traction as an approach to evaluating large language models (LLMs). However, there are still many open questions about the strengths and weaknesses of this paradigm, and what potential biases it may hold. In this paper, we present a comprehensive study of the performance of various LLMs acting as judges, focusing on a clean scenario in which inter-human agreement is high. Investigating thirteen judge models of different model sizes and families, judging answers of nine different 'examtaker models' - both base and instruction-tuned - we find that only the best (and largest) models achieve reasonable alignment with humans. However, they are still quite far behind inter-human agreement and their assigned scores may still differ with up to 5 points from human-assigned scores. In terms of their ranking of the nine exam-taker models, instead, also smaller models and even the lexical metric contains may provide a reasonable signal. Through error analysis and other studies, we identify vulnerabilities in judge models, such as their sensitivity to prompt complexity and length, and a tendency toward leniency. The fact that even the best judges differ from humans in this comparatively simple setup suggest that caution may be wise when using judges in more complex setups. Lastly, our research rediscovers the importance of using alignment metrics beyond simple percent alignment, showing that judges with high percent agreement can still assign vastly different scores.</description>

      <title>VLM Agents Generate Their Own Memories: Distilling Experience into Embodied Programs of Thought</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14596v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large-scale LLMs and VLMs excel at few-shot learning but require high-quality examples. We introduce In-Context Abstraction Learning (ICAL), which iteratively refines suboptimal trajectories into high-quality data with optimized actions and detailed reasoning. Given an inefficient demonstration, a VLM corrects actions and annotates causal relationships, object states, subgoals, and task-relevant visuals, forming "programs of thought." With human feedback, these programs are improved as the agent executes them in a similar environment. The resulting examples, used as prompt context or fine-tuning data, significantly boost decision-making while reducing human feedback needs. ICAL surpasses state-of-the-art in TEACh (dialogue-based instruction following), VisualWebArena (multimodal web agents), and Ego4D (egocentric video action anticipation). In TEACh, combining fine-tuning and retrieval on ICAL examples outperforms raw human demonstrations and expert examples, achieving a 17.5% increase in goal-condition success. In VisualWebArena, retrieval-augmented GPT-4V with ICAL improves task success rate 1.6x over GPT-4V, while fine-tuning Qwen2-VL achieves a 2.8x improvement. In Ego4D, ICAL outperforms few-shot GPT-4V and remains competitive with supervised models. Overall, ICAL scales 2x better than raw human demonstrations and reduces manual prompt engineering.</description>

      <title>Generative Topological Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15152v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative methods have recently seen significant improvements by generating in a lower-dimensional latent representation of the data. However, many of the generative methods applied in the latent space remain complex and difficult to train. Further, it is not entirely clear why transitioning to a lower-dimensional latent space can improve generative quality. In this work, we introduce a new and simple generative method grounded in topology theory -- Generative Topological Networks (GTNs) -- which also provides insights into why lower-dimensional latent-space representations might be better-suited for data generation. GTNs are simple to train -- they employ a standard supervised learning approach and do not suffer from common generative pitfalls such as mode collapse, posterior collapse or the need to pose constraints on the neural network architecture. We demonstrate the use of GTNs on several datasets, including MNIST, CelebA, CIFAR-10 and the Hands and Palm Images dataset by training GTNs on a lower-dimensional latent representation of the data. We show that GTNs can improve upon VAEs and that they are quick to converge, generating realistic samples in early epochs. Further, we use the topological considerations behind the development of GTNs to offer insights into why generative models may benefit from operating on a lower-dimensional latent space, highlighting the important link between the intrinsic dimension of the data and the dimension in which the data is generated. Particularly, we demonstrate that generating in high dimensional ambient spaces may be a contributing factor to out-of-distribution samples generated by diffusion models. We also highlight other topological properties that are important to consider when using and designing generative models. Our code is available at: https://github.com/alonalj/GTN</description>

      <title>TorchSpatial: A Location Encoding Framework and Benchmark for Spatial Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15658v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spatial representation learning (SRL) aims at learning general-purpose neural network representations from various types of spatial data (e.g., points, polylines, polygons, networks, images, etc.) in their native formats. Learning good spatial representations is a fundamental problem for various downstream applications such as species distribution modeling, weather forecasting, trajectory generation, geographic question answering, etc. Even though SRL has become the foundation of almost all geospatial artificial intelligence (GeoAI) research, we have not yet seen significant efforts to develop an extensive deep learning framework and benchmark to support SRL model development and evaluation. To fill this gap, we propose TorchSpatial, a learning framework and benchmark for location (point) encoding, which is one of the most fundamental data types of spatial representation learning. TorchSpatial contains three key components: 1) a unified location encoding framework that consolidates 15 commonly recognized location encoders, ensuring scalability and reproducibility of the implementations; 2) the LocBench benchmark tasks encompassing 7 geo-aware image classification and 10 geo-aware image regression datasets; 3) a comprehensive suite of evaluation metrics to quantify geo-aware model's overall performance as well as their geographic bias, with a novel Geo-Bias Score metric. Finally, we provide a detailed analysis and insights into the model performance and geographic bias of different location encoders. We believe TorchSpatial will foster future advancement of spatial representation learning and spatial fairness in GeoAI research. The TorchSpatial model framework and LocBench benchmark are available at https://github.com/seai-lab/TorchSpatial, and the Geo-Bias Score evaluation framework is available at https://github.com/seai-lab/PyGBS.</description>

      <title>Too Good to be True? Turn Any Model Differentially Private With DP-Weights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19507v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Imagine training a machine learning model with Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD), only to discover post-training that the noise level was either too high, crippling your model's utility, or too low, compromising privacy. The dreaded realization hits: you must start the lengthy training process from scratch. But what if you could avoid this retraining nightmare? In this study, we introduce a groundbreaking approach (to our knowledge) that applies differential privacy noise to the model's weights after training. We offer a comprehensive mathematical proof for this novel approach's privacy bounds, use formal methods to validate its privacy guarantees, and empirically evaluate its effectiveness using membership inference attacks and performance evaluations. This method allows for a single training run, followed by post-hoc noise adjustments to achieve optimal privacy-utility trade-offs. We compare this novel fine-tuned model (DP-Weights model) to a traditional DP-SGD model, demonstrating that our approach yields statistically similar performance and privacy guarantees. Our results validate the efficacy of post-training noise application, promising significant time savings and flexibility in fine-tuning differential privacy parameters, making it a practical alternative for deploying differentially private models in real-world scenarios.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents Visual Evaluative AI, a decision aid that provides positive and negative evidence from image data for a given hypothesis. This tool finds high-level human concepts in an image and generates the Weight of Evidence (WoE) for each hypothesis in the decision-making process. We apply and evaluate this tool in the skin cancer domain by building a web-based application that allows users to upload a dermatoscopic image, select a hypothesis and analyse their decisions by evaluating the provided evidence. Further, we demonstrate the effectiveness of Visual Evaluative AI on different concept-based explanation approaches.</description>

      <title>Differentially Private Block-wise Gradient Shuffle for Deep Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21347v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traditional Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD) introduces statistical noise on top of gradients drawn from a Gaussian distribution to ensure privacy. This paper introduces the novel Differentially Private Block-wise Gradient Shuffle (DP-BloGS) algorithm for deep learning. BloGS builds off of existing private deep learning literature, but makes a definitive shift by taking a probabilistic approach to gradient noise introduction through shuffling modeled after information theoretic privacy analyses. The theoretical results presented in this paper show that the combination of shuffling, parameter-specific block size selection, batch layer clipping, and gradient accumulation allows DP-BloGS to achieve training times close to that of non-private training while maintaining similar privacy and utility guarantees to DP-SGD. DP-BloGS is found to be significantly more resistant to data extraction attempts than DP-SGD. The theoretical results are validated by the experimental findings.</description>

      <title>Attention Mechanism and Context Modeling System for Text Mining Machine Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04216v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper advances a novel architectural schema anchored upon the Transformer paradigm and innovatively amalgamates the K-means categorization algorithm to augment the contextual apprehension capabilities of the schema. The transformer model performs well in machine translation tasks due to its parallel computing power and multi-head attention mechanism. However, it may encounter contextual ambiguity or ignore local features when dealing with highly complex language structures. To circumvent this constraint, this exposition incorporates the K-Means algorithm, which is used to stratify the lexis and idioms of the input textual matter, thereby facilitating superior identification and preservation of the local structure and contextual intelligence of the language. The advantage of this combination is that K-Means can automatically discover the topic or concept regions in the text, which may be directly related to translation quality. Consequently, the schema contrived herein enlists K-Means as a preparatory phase antecedent to the Transformer and recalibrates the multi-head attention weights to assist in the discrimination of lexis and idioms bearing analogous semantics or functionalities. This ensures the schema accords heightened regard to the contextual intelligence embodied by these clusters during the training phase, rather than merely focusing on locational intelligence.</description>

      <title>Space-LLaVA: a Vision-Language Model Adapted to Extraterrestrial Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05924v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Foundation Models (FMs), e.g., large language models, possess attributes of intelligence which offer promise to endow a robot with the contextual understanding necessary to navigate complex, unstructured tasks in the wild. We see three core challenges in the future of space robotics that motivate building an FM for the space robotics community: 1) Scalability of ground-in-the-loop operations; 2) Generalizing prior knowledge to novel environments; and 3) Multi-modality in tasks and sensor data. As a first-step towards a space foundation model, we programmatically augment three extraterrestrial databases with fine-grained language annotations inspired by the sensory reasoning necessary to e.g., identify a site of scientific interest on Mars, building a synthetic dataset of visual-question-answer and visual instruction-following tuples. We fine-tune a pre-trained LLaVA 13B checkpoint on our augmented dataset to adapt a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to the visual semantic features in an extraterrestrial environment, demonstrating FMs as a tool for specialization and enhancing a VLM's zero-shot performance on unseen task types in comparison to state-of-the-art VLMs. Ablation studies show that fine-tuning the language backbone and vision-language adapter in concert is key to facilitate adaption while a small percentage, e.g., 20%, of the pre-training data can be used to safeguard against catastrophic forgetting.</description>

      <title>Fairness Issues and Mitigations in (Differentially Private) Socio-Demographic Data Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08471v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Statistical agencies rely on sampling techniques to collect socio-demographic data crucial for policy-making and resource allocation. This paper shows that surveys of important societal relevance introduce sampling errors that unevenly impact group-level estimates, thereby compromising fairness in downstream decisions. To address these issues, this paper introduces an optimization approach modeled on real-world survey design processes, ensuring sampling costs are optimized while maintaining error margins within prescribed tolerances. Additionally, privacy-preserving methods used to determine sampling rates can further impact these fairness issues. This paper explores the impact of differential privacy on the statistics informing the sampling process, revealing a surprising effect: not only is the expected negative effect from the addition of noise for differential privacy negligible, but also this privacy noise can in fact reduce unfairness as it positively biases smaller counts. These findings are validated over an extensive analysis using datasets commonly applied in census statistics.</description>

      <title>Customizing Language Models with Instance-wise LoRA for Sequential Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10159v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sequential recommendation systems predict the next interaction item based on users' past interactions, aligning recommendations with individual preferences. Leveraging the strengths of Large Language Models (LLMs) in knowledge comprehension and reasoning, recent approaches are eager to apply LLMs to sequential recommendation. A common paradigm is converting user behavior sequences into instruction data, and fine-tuning the LLM with parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods like Low-Rank Adaption (LoRA). However, the uniform application of LoRA across diverse user behaviors is insufficient to capture individual variability, resulting in negative transfer between disparate sequences. To address these challenges, we propose Instance-wise LoRA (iLoRA). We innovatively treat the sequential recommendation task as a form of multi-task learning, integrating LoRA with the Mixture of Experts (MoE) framework. This approach encourages different experts to capture various aspects of user behavior. Additionally, we introduce a sequence representation guided gate function that generates customized expert participation weights for each user sequence, which allows dynamic parameter adjustment for instance-wise recommendations. In sequential recommendation, iLoRA achieves an average relative improvement of 11.4\% over basic LoRA in the hit ratio metric, with less than a 1\% relative increase in trainable parameters. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of iLoRA, highlighting its superior performance compared to existing methods in mitigating negative transfer and improving recommendation accuracy. Our data and code are available at https://github.com/AkaliKong/iLoRA.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11051v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential in Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) tasks, yet current applications face challenges. While LLMs excel in general conversation scenarios, they struggle with specialized navigation tasks, yielding suboptimal performance compared to specialized VLN models. We introduce FLAME (FLAMingo-Architected Embodied Agent), a novel Multimodal LLM-based agent and architecture designed for urban VLN tasks that efficiently handles multiple observations. Our approach implements a three-phase tuning technique for effective adaptation to navigation tasks, including single perception tuning for street view description, multiple perception tuning for route summarization, and end-to-end training on VLN datasets. The augmented datasets are synthesized automatically. Experimental results demonstrate FLAME's superiority over existing methods, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by a 7.3% increase in task completion on Touchdown dataset. This work showcases the potential of Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) in complex navigation tasks, representing an advancement towards applications of MLLMs in the field of embodied intelligence.</description>

      <title>OpenFGL: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Federated Graph Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16288v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated graph learning (FGL) is a promising distributed training paradigm for graph neural networks across multiple local systems without direct data sharing. This approach inherently involves large-scale distributed graph processing, which closely aligns with the challenges and research focuses of graph-based data systems. Despite the proliferation of FGL, the diverse motivations from real-world applications, spanning various research backgrounds and settings, pose a significant challenge to fair evaluation. To fill this gap, we propose OpenFGL, a unified benchmark designed for the primary FGL scenarios: Graph-FL and Subgraph-FL. Specifically, OpenFGL includes 42 graph datasets from 18 application domains, 8 federated data simulation strategies that emphasize different graph properties, and 5 graph-based downstream tasks. Additionally, it offers 18 recently proposed SOTA FGL algorithms through a user-friendly API, enabling a thorough comparison and comprehensive evaluation of their effectiveness, robustness, and efficiency. Our empirical results demonstrate the capabilities of FGL while also highlighting its potential limitations, providing valuable insights for future research in this growing field, particularly in fostering greater interdisciplinary collaboration between FGL and data systems.</description>

      <title>BEAVER: An Enterprise Benchmark for Text-to-SQL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02038v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing text-to-SQL benchmarks have largely been constructed from web tables with human-generated question-SQL pairs. LLMs typically show strong results on these benchmarks, leading to a belief that LLMs are effective at text-to-SQL tasks. However, how these results transfer to enterprise settings is unclear because tables in enterprise databases might differ substantially from web tables in structure and content. To contend with this problem, we introduce a new dataset BEAVER, the first enterprise text-to-SQL benchmark sourced from real private enterprise data warehouses. This dataset includes natural language queries and their correct SQL statements, which we collected from actual query logs. We then benchmark off-the-shelf LLMs on this dataset. LLMs perform poorly, even when augmented with standard prompt engineering and RAG techniques. We identify three main reasons for the poor performance: (1) schemas of enterprise tables are more complex than the schemas in public data, resulting in SQL-generation tasks intrinsically harder; (2) business-oriented questions are often more complex, requiring joins over multiple tables, aggregations, and nested queries; (3) public LLMs cannot train on private enterprise data warehouses that are not publicly accessible, and therefore it is difficult for the model to learn to solve (1) and (2). We believe BEAVER will facilitate future research in building text-to-SQL systems that perform better in enterprise settings.</description>

      <title>Closed-Form Interpretation of Neural Network Latent Spaces with Symbolic Gradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05305v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been demonstrated in many scientific fields that artificial neural networks like autoencoders or Siamese networks encode meaningful concepts in their latent spaces. However, there does not exist a comprehensive framework for retrieving this information in a human-readable form without prior knowledge. In order to extract these concepts, we introduce a framework for finding closed-form interpretations of neurons in latent spaces of artificial neural networks. The interpretation framework is based on embedding trained neural networks into an equivalence class of functions that encode the same concept. We interpret these neural networks by finding an intersection between the equivalence class and human-readable equations defined by a symbolic search space. The approach is demonstrated by retrieving invariants of matrices and conserved quantities of dynamical systems from latent spaces of Siamese neural networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08583v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Singing Voice Conversion (SVC) has emerged as a significant subfield of Voice Conversion (VC), enabling the transformation of one singer's voice into another while preserving musical elements such as melody, rhythm, and timbre. Traditional SVC methods have limitations in terms of audio quality, data requirements, and computational complexity. In this paper, we propose LHQ-SVC, a lightweight, CPU-compatible model based on the SVC framework and diffusion model, designed to reduce model size and computational demand without sacrificing performance. We incorporate features to improve inference quality, and optimize for CPU execution by using performance tuning tools and parallel computing frameworks. Our experiments demonstrate that LHQ-SVC maintains competitive performance, with significant improvements in processing speed and efficiency across different devices. The results suggest that LHQ-SVC can meet</description>

      <title>Optimization and Generalization Guarantees for Weight Normalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08935v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Weight normalization (WeightNorm) is widely used in practice for the training of deep neural networks and modern deep learning libraries have built-in implementations of it. In this paper, we provide the first theoretical characterizations of both optimization and generalization of deep WeightNorm models with smooth activation functions. For optimization, from the form of the Hessian of the loss, we note that a small Hessian of the predictor leads to a tractable analysis. Thus, we bound the spectral norm of the Hessian of WeightNorm networks and show its dependence on the network width and weight normalization terms--the latter being unique to networks without WeightNorm. Then, we use this bound to establish training convergence guarantees under suitable assumptions for gradient decent. For generalization, we use WeightNorm to get a uniform convergence based generalization bound, which is independent from the width and depends sublinearly on the depth. Finally, we present experimental results which illustrate how the normalization terms and other quantities of theoretical interest relate to the training of WeightNorm networks.</description>

      <title>Robust Federated Learning Over the Air: Combating Heavy-Tailed Noise with Median Anchored Clipping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15100v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Leveraging over-the-air computations for model aggregation is an effective approach to cope with the communication bottleneck in federated edge learning. By exploiting the superposition properties of multi-access channels, this approach facilitates an integrated design of communication and computation, thereby enhancing system privacy while reducing implementation costs. However, the inherent electromagnetic interference in radio channels often exhibits heavy-tailed distributions, giving rise to exceptionally strong noise in globally aggregated gradients that can significantly deteriorate the training performance. To address this issue, we propose a novel gradient clipping method, termed Median Anchored Clipping (MAC), to combat the detrimental effects of heavy-tailed noise. We also derive analytical expressions for the convergence rate of model training with analog over-the-air federated learning under MAC, which quantitatively demonstrates the effect of MAC on training performance. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed MAC algorithm effectively mitigates the impact of heavy-tailed noise, hence substantially enhancing system robustness.</description>

      <title>60 Data Points are Sufficient to Fine-Tune LLMs for Question-Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15825v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) encode extensive world knowledge through pre-training on massive datasets, which can then be fine-tuned for the question-answering (QA) task. However, effective strategies for fine-tuning LLMs for the QA task remain largely unexplored. To address this gap, we categorize supervised fine-tuning (SFT) data based on the extent of knowledge memorized by the pretrained LLMs and conduct a series of empirical analyses. Our experiments, involving four LLMs from three different model families, focus on three key factors: the amount of data required for SFT, the impact of different SFT datasets on model performance, and how data requirements vary across LLMs. The results show that as few as 60 data points during the SFT stage can activate the knowledge encoded during pre-training, enabling LLMs to perform the QA task. Additionally, SFT with data of varying memory levels has a significant impact on LLM performance, with the optimal dataset differing based on the specific model being fine-tuned. Future research will delve deeper into the mechanisms underlying these phenomena.</description>

      <title>Towards Underwater Camouflaged Object Tracking: Benchmark and Baselines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16902v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Over the past decade, significant progress has been made in visual object tracking, largely due to the availability of large-scale datasets. However, existing tracking datasets are primarily focused on open-air scenarios, which greatly limits the development of object tracking in underwater environments. To bridge this gap, we take a step forward by proposing the first large-scale multimodal underwater camouflaged object tracking dataset, namely UW-COT220. Based on the proposed dataset, this paper first comprehensively evaluates current advanced visual object tracking methods and SAM- and SAM2-based trackers in challenging underwater environments. Our findings highlight the improvements of SAM2 over SAM, demonstrating its enhanced ability to handle the complexities of underwater camouflaged objects. Furthermore, we propose a novel vision-language tracking framework called VL-SAM2, based on the video foundation model SAM2. Experimental results demonstrate that our VL-SAM2 achieves state-of-the-art performance on the UW-COT220 dataset. The dataset and codes can be accessible at \color{magenta}{https://github.com/983632847/Awesome-Multimodal-Object-Tracking}.</description>

      <title>Embodied-RAG: General Non-parametric Embodied Memory for Retrieval and Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18313v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is no limit to how much a robot might explore and learn, but all of that knowledge needs to be searchable and actionable. Within language research, retrieval augmented generation (RAG) has become the workhorse of large-scale non-parametric knowledge; however, existing techniques do not directly transfer to the embodied domain, which is multimodal, where data is highly correlated, and perception requires abstraction. To address these challenges, we introduce Embodied-RAG, a framework that enhances the foundational model of an embodied agent with a non-parametric memory system capable of autonomously constructing hierarchical knowledge for both navigation and language generation. Embodied-RAG handles a full range of spatial and semantic resolutions across diverse environments and query types, whether for a specific object or a holistic description of ambiance. At its core, Embodied-RAG's memory is structured as a semantic forest, storing language descriptions at varying levels of detail. This hierarchical organization allows the system to efficiently generate context-sensitive outputs across different robotic platforms. We demonstrate that Embodied-RAG effectively bridges RAG to the robotics domain, successfully handling over 250 explanation and navigation queries across kilometer-level environments, highlighting its promise as a general-purpose non-parametric system for embodied agents.</description>

      <title>Can Models Learn Skill Composition from Examples?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19808v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly advanced, their ability to exhibit compositional generalization -- the capacity to combine learned skills in novel ways not encountered during training -- has garnered significant attention. This type of generalization, particularly in scenarios beyond training data, is also of great interest in the study of AI safety and alignment. A recent study introduced the SKILL-MIX evaluation, where models are tasked with composing a short paragraph demonstrating the use of a specified $k$-tuple of language skills. While small models struggled with composing even with $k=3$, larger models like GPT-4 performed reasonably well with $k=5$ and $6$.
  In this paper, we employ a setup akin to SKILL-MIX to evaluate the capacity of smaller models to learn compositional generalization from examples. Utilizing a diverse set of language skills -- including rhetorical, literary, reasoning, theory of mind, and common sense -- GPT-4 was used to generate text samples that exhibit random subsets of $k$ skills. Subsequent fine-tuning of 7B and 13B parameter models on these combined skill texts, for increasing values of $k$, revealed the following findings: (1) Training on combinations of $k=2$ and $3$ skills results in noticeable improvements in the ability to compose texts with $k=4$ and $5$ skills, despite models never having seen such examples during training. (2) When skill categories are split into training and held-out groups, models significantly improve at composing texts with held-out skills during testing despite having only seen training skills during fine-tuning, illustrating the efficacy of the training approach even with previously unseen skills. This study also suggests that incorporating skill-rich (potentially synthetic) text into training can substantially enhance the compositional capabilities of models.</description>

      <title>Efficient Large-Scale Urban Parking Prediction: Graph Coarsening Based on Real-Time Parking Service Capability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04022v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the sharp increase in the number of vehicles, the issue of parking difficulties has emerged as an urgent challenge that many cities need to address promptly. In the task of predicting large-scale urban parking data, existing research often lacks effective deep learning models and strategies. To tackle this challenge, this paper proposes an innovative framework for predicting large-scale urban parking graphs leveraging real-time service capabilities, aimed at improving the accuracy and efficiency of parking predictions. Specifically, we introduce a graph attention mechanism that assesses the real-time service capabilities of parking lots to construct a dynamic parking graph that accurately reflects real preferences in parking behavior. To effectively handle large-scale parking data, this study combines graph coarsening techniques with temporal convolutional autoencoders to achieve unified dimension reduction of the complex urban parking graph structure and features. Subsequently, we use a spatio-temporal graph convolutional model to make predictions based on the coarsened graph, and a pre-trained autoencoder-decoder module restores the predicted results to their original data dimensions, completing the task. Our methodology has been rigorously tested on a real dataset from parking lots in Shenzhen. The experimental results indicate that compared to traditional parking prediction models, our framework achieves improvements of 46.8\% and 30.5\% in accuracy and efficiency, respectively. Remarkably, with the expansion of the graph's scale, our framework's advantages become even more apparent, showcasing its substantial potential for solving complex urban parking dilemmas in practical scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05637v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Temporal point processes (TPPs) are effective for modeling event occurrences over time, but they struggle with sparse and uncertain events in federated systems, where privacy is a major concern. To address this, we propose \textit{FedPP}, a Federated neural nonparametric Point Process model. FedPP integrates neural embeddings into Sigmoidal Gaussian Cox Processes (SGCPs) on the client side, which is a flexible and expressive class of TPPs, allowing it to generate highly flexible intensity functions that capture client-specific event dynamics and uncertainties while efficiently summarizing historical records. For global aggregation, FedPP introduces a divergence-based mechanism that communicates the distributions of SGCPs' kernel hyperparameters between the server and clients, while keeping client-specific parameters local to ensure privacy and personalization. FedPP effectively captures event uncertainty and sparsity, and extensive experiments demonstrate its superior performance in federated settings, particularly with KL divergence and Wasserstein distance-based global aggregation.</description>

      <title>PDF-WuKong: A Large Multimodal Model for Efficient Long PDF Reading with End-to-End Sparse Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05970v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal document understanding is a challenging task to process and comprehend large amounts of textual and visual information. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly improved the performance of this task. However, existing methods typically focus on either plain text or a limited number of document images, struggling to handle long PDF documents with interleaved text and images, especially for academic papers. In this paper, we introduce PDF-WuKong, a multimodal large language model (MLLM) which is designed to enhance multimodal question-answering (QA) for long PDF documents. PDF-WuKong incorporates a sparse sampler that operates on both text and image representations, significantly improving the efficiency and capability of the MLLM. The sparse sampler is integrated with the MLLM's image encoder and selects the paragraphs or diagrams most pertinent to user queries for processing by the language model. To effectively train and evaluate our model, we construct PaperPDF, a dataset consisting of a broad collection of English and Chinese academic papers. Multiple strategies are proposed to automatically generate 1.1 million QA pairs along with their corresponding evidence sources. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority and high efficiency of our approach over other models on the task of long multimodal document understanding, surpassing proprietary products by an average of 8.6% on F1. Our code and dataset will be released at https://github.com/yh-hust/PDF-Wukong.</description>

      <title>Embodied Agent Interface: Benchmarking LLMs for Embodied Decision Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07166v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We aim to evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) for embodied decision making. While a significant body of work has been leveraging LLMs for decision making in embodied environments, we still lack a systematic understanding of their performance because they are usually applied in different domains, for different purposes, and built based on different inputs and outputs. Furthermore, existing evaluations tend to rely solely on a final success rate, making it difficult to pinpoint what ability is missing in LLMs and where the problem lies, which in turn blocks embodied agents from leveraging LLMs effectively and selectively. To address these limitations, we propose a generalized interface (Embodied Agent Interface) that supports the formalization of various types of tasks and input-output specifications of LLM-based modules. Specifically, it allows us to unify 1) a broad set of embodied decision-making tasks involving both state and temporally extended goals, 2) four commonly-used LLM-based modules for decision making: goal interpretation, subgoal decomposition, action sequencing, and transition modeling, and 3) a collection of fine-grained metrics which break down evaluation into various types of errors, such as hallucination errors, affordance errors, various types of planning errors, etc. Overall, our benchmark offers a comprehensive assessment of LLMs' performance for different subtasks, pinpointing the strengths and weaknesses in LLM-powered embodied AI systems, and providing insights for effective and selective use of LLMs in embodied decision making.</description>

Abstract: Preference alignment in Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly improved their ability to adhere to human instructions and intentions. However, existing direct alignment algorithms primarily focus on relative preferences and often overlook the qualitative aspects of responses. Striving to maximize the implicit reward gap between the chosen and the slightly inferior rejected responses can cause overfitting and unnecessary unlearning of the high-quality rejected responses. The unawareness of the reward scores also drives the LLM to indiscriminately favor the low-quality chosen responses and fail to generalize to responses with the highest rewards, which are sparse in data. To overcome these shortcomings, our study introduces reward-conditioned LLM policies that discern and learn from the entire spectrum of response quality within the dataset, helping extrapolate to more optimal regions. We propose an effective yet simple data relabeling method that conditions the preference pairs on quality scores to construct a reward-augmented dataset. This dataset is easily integrated with existing direct alignment algorithms and is applicable to any preference dataset. The experimental results across instruction-following benchmarks including AlpacaEval, MT-Bench, and Arena-Hard-Auto demonstrate that our approach consistently boosts the performance of DPO by a considerable margin across diverse models. Additionally, our method improves the average accuracy on various academic benchmarks. When applying our method to on-policy data, the resulting DPO model achieves SOTA results on AlpacaEval. Through ablation studies, we demonstrate that our method not only maximizes the utility of preference data but also mitigates the issue of unlearning, demonstrating its broad effectiveness beyond mere dataset expansion.

      <title>Code-Driven Law NO, Normware SI!</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17257v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the digitalization of society, the interest, the debates and the research efforts concerning "code", "law", "artificial intelligence", and their various relationships, have been widely increasing. Yet, most arguments primarily focus on contemporary computational methods and artifacts (inferential models constructed via machine-learning methods, rule-based systems, smart contracts), rather than attempting to identify more fundamental mechanisms. Aiming to go beyond this conceptual limitation, this paper introduces and elaborates on "normware" as an explicit additional stance -- complementary to software and hardware -- for the interpretation and the design of artificial devices. By means of a few examples, I will argue that a normware-centred perspective provides a more adequate abstraction to study and design interactions between computational systems and human institutions, and may help with the design and development of technical interventions within wider socio-technical views.</description>

      <title>Bridging Swarm Intelligence and Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17517v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Swarm intelligence (SI) explores how large groups of simple individuals (e.g., insects, fish, birds) collaborate to produce complex behaviors, exemplifying that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. A fundamental task in SI is Collective Decision-Making (CDM), where a group selects the best option among several alternatives, such as choosing an optimal foraging site. In this work, we demonstrate a theoretical and empirical equivalence between CDM and single-agent reinforcement learning (RL) in multi-armed bandit problems, utilizing concepts from opinion dynamics, evolutionary game theory, and RL. This equivalence bridges the gap between SI and RL and leads us to introduce a novel abstract RL update rule called Maynard-Cross Learning. Additionally, it provides a new population-based perspective on common RL practices like learning rate adjustment and batching. Our findings enable cross-disciplinary fertilization between RL and SI, allowing techniques from one field to enhance the understanding and methodologies of the other.</description>

      <title>Beyond Position: the emergence of wavelet-like properties in Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18067v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies how transformer models develop robust wavelet-like properties that effectively compensate for the theoretical limitations of Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE), providing insights into how these networks process sequential information across different scales. Through theoretical analysis and empirical validation across models ranging from 1B to 12B parameters, we show that attention heads naturally evolve to implement multi-resolution processing analogous to wavelet transforms. Our analysis establishes that attention heads consistently organize into complementary frequency bands with systematic power distribution patterns, and these wavelet-like characteristics become more pronounced in larger models. We provide mathematical analysis showing how these properties align with optimal solutions to the fundamental uncertainty principle between positional precision and frequency resolution. Our findings suggest that the effectiveness of modern transformer architectures stems significantly from their development of optimal multi-resolution decompositions that naturally address the theoretical constraints of position encoding.</description>

      <title>Incremental Learning of Retrievable Skills For Efficient Continual Task Adaptation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22658v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Continual Imitation Learning (CiL) involves extracting and accumulating task knowledge from demonstrations across multiple stages and tasks to achieve a multi-task policy. With recent advancements in foundation models, there has been a growing interest in adapter-based CiL approaches, where adapters are established parameter-efficiently for tasks newly demonstrated. While these approaches isolate parameters for specific tasks and tend to mitigate catastrophic forgetting, they limit knowledge sharing among different demonstrations. We introduce IsCiL, an adapter-based CiL framework that addresses this limitation of knowledge sharing by incrementally learning shareable skills from different demonstrations, thus enabling sample-efficient task adaptation using the skills particularly in non-stationary CiL environments. In IsCiL, demonstrations are mapped into the state embedding space, where proper skills can be retrieved upon input states through prototype-based memory. These retrievable skills are incrementally learned on their corresponding adapters. Our CiL experiments with complex tasks in Franka-Kitchen and Meta-World demonstrate robust performance of IsCiL in both task adaptation and sample-efficiency. We also show a simple extension of IsCiL for task unlearning scenarios.</description>

      <title>Deep Convolutional Neural Networks on Multiclass Classification of Three-Dimensional Brain Images for Parkinson's Disease Stage Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23649v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD), a degenerative disorder of the central nervous system, is commonly diagnosed using functional medical imaging techniques such as single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). In this study, we utilized two SPECT data sets (n = 634 and n = 202) from different hospitals to develop a model capable of accurately predicting PD stages, a multiclass classification task. We used the entire three-dimensional (3D) brain images as input and experimented with various model architectures. Initially, we treated the 3D images as sequences of two-dimensional (2D) slices and fed them sequentially into 2D convolutional neural network (CNN) models pretrained on ImageNet, averaging the outputs to obtain the final predicted stage. We also applied 3D CNN models pretrained on Kinetics-400. Additionally, we incorporated an attention mechanism to account for the varying importance of different slices in the prediction process. To further enhance model efficacy and robustness, we simultaneously trained the two data sets using weight sharing, a technique known as cotraining. Our results demonstrated that 2D models pretrained on ImageNet outperformed 3D models pretrained on Kinetics-400, and models utilizing the attention mechanism outperformed both 2D and 3D models. The cotraining technique proved effective in improving model performance when the cotraining data sets were sufficiently large.</description>

      <title>On the Impact of White-box Deployment Strategies for Edge AI on Latency and Model Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00907v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To help MLOps engineers decide which operator to use in which deployment scenario, this study aims to empirically assess the accuracy vs latency trade-off of white-box (training-based) and black-box operators (non-training-based) and their combinations in an Edge AI setup. We perform inference experiments including 3 white-box (i.e., QAT, Pruning, Knowledge Distillation), 2 black-box (i.e., Partition, SPTQ), and their combined operators (i.e., Distilled SPTQ, SPTQ Partition) across 3 tiers (i.e., Mobile, Edge, Cloud) on 4 commonly-used Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing models to identify the effective strategies, considering the perspective of MLOps Engineers. Our Results indicate that the combination of Distillation and SPTQ operators (i.e., DSPTQ) should be preferred over non-hybrid operators when lower latency is required in the edge at small to medium accuracy drop. Among the non-hybrid operators, the Distilled operator is a better alternative in both mobile and edge tiers for lower latency performance at the cost of small to medium accuracy loss. Moreover, the operators involving distillation show lower latency in resource-constrained tiers (Mobile, Edge) compared to the operators involving Partitioning across Mobile and Edge tiers. For textual subject models, which have low input data size requirements, the Cloud tier is a better alternative for the deployment of operators than the Mobile, Edge, or Mobile-Edge tier (the latter being used for operators involving partitioning). In contrast, for image-based subject models, which have high input data size requirements, the Edge tier is a better alternative for operators than Mobile, Edge, or their combination.</description>

      <title>Active Prompt Tuning Enables Gpt-40 To Do Efficient Classification Of Microscopy Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02639v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traditional deep learning-based methods for classifying cellular features in microscopy images require time- and labor-intensive processes for training models. Among the current limitations are major time commitments from domain experts for accurate ground truth preparation; and the need for a large amount of input image data. We previously proposed a solution that overcomes these challenges using OpenAI's GPT-4(V) model on a pilot dataset (Iba-1 immuno-stained tissue sections from 11 mouse brains). Results on the pilot dataset were equivalent in accuracy and with a substantial improvement in throughput efficiency compared to the baseline using a traditional Convolutional Neural Net (CNN)-based approach.
  The present study builds upon this framework using a second unique and substantially larger dataset of microscopy images. Our current approach uses a newer and faster model, GPT-4o, along with improved prompts. It was evaluated on a microscopy image dataset captured at low (10x) magnification from cresyl-violet-stained sections through the cerebellum of a total of 18 mouse brains (9 Lurcher mice, 9 wild-type controls). We used our approach to classify these images either as a control group or Lurcher mutant. Using 6 mice in the prompt set the results were correct classification for 11 out of the 12 mice (92%) with 96% higher efficiency, reduced image requirements, and lower demands on time and effort of domain experts compared to the baseline method (snapshot ensemble of CNN models). These results confirm that our approach is effective across multiple datasets from different brain regions and magnifications, with minimal overhead.</description>

      <title>On Improved Conditioning Mechanisms and Pre-training Strategies for Diffusion Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03177v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large-scale training of latent diffusion models (LDMs) has enabled unprecedented quality in image generation. However, the key components of the best performing LDM training recipes are oftentimes not available to the research community, preventing apple-to-apple comparisons and hindering the validation of progress in the field. In this work, we perform an in-depth study of LDM training recipes focusing on the performance of models and their training efficiency. To ensure apple-to-apple comparisons, we re-implement five previously published models with their corresponding recipes. Through our study, we explore the effects of (i)~the mechanisms used to condition the generative model on semantic information (e.g., text prompt) and control metadata (e.g., crop size, random flip flag, etc.) on the model performance, and (ii)~the transfer of the representations learned on smaller and lower-resolution datasets to larger ones on the training efficiency and model performance. We then propose a novel conditioning mechanism that disentangles semantic and control metadata conditionings and sets a new state-of-the-art in class-conditional generation on the ImageNet-1k dataset -- with FID improvements of 7% on 256 and 8% on 512 resolutions -- as well as text-to-image generation on the CC12M dataset -- with FID improvements of 8% on 256 and 23% on 512 resolution.</description>

      <title>Touchstone Benchmark: Are We on the Right Way for Evaluating AI Algorithms for Medical Segmentation?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03670v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: How can we test AI performance? This question seems trivial, but it isn't. Standard benchmarks often have problems such as in-distribution and small-size test sets, oversimplified metrics, unfair comparisons, and short-term outcome pressure. As a consequence, good performance on standard benchmarks does not guarantee success in real-world scenarios. To address these problems, we present Touchstone, a large-scale collaborative segmentation benchmark of 9 types of abdominal organs. This benchmark is based on 5,195 training CT scans from 76 hospitals around the world and 5,903 testing CT scans from 11 additional hospitals. This diverse test set enhances the statistical significance of benchmark results and rigorously evaluates AI algorithms across various out-of-distribution scenarios. We invited 14 inventors of 19 AI algorithms to train their algorithms, while our team, as a third party, independently evaluated these algorithms on three test sets. In addition, we also evaluated pre-existing AI frameworks--which, differing from algorithms, are more flexible and can support different algorithms--including MONAI from NVIDIA, nnU-Net from DKFZ, and numerous other open-source frameworks. We are committed to expanding this benchmark to encourage more innovation of AI algorithms for the medical domain.</description>

      <title>LogLLM: Log-based Anomaly Detection Using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08561v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Software systems often record important runtime information in logs to help with troubleshooting. Log-based anomaly detection has become a key research area that aims to identify system issues through log data, ultimately enhancing the reliability of software systems. Traditional deep learning methods often struggle to capture the semantic information embedded in log data, which is typically organized in natural language. In this paper, we propose LogLLM, a log-based anomaly detection framework that leverages large language models (LLMs). LogLLM employs BERT for extracting semantic vectors from log messages, while utilizing Llama, a transformer decoder-based model, for classifying log sequences. Additionally, we introduce a projector to align the vector representation spaces of BERT and Llama, ensuring a cohesive understanding of log semantics. Unlike conventional methods that require log parsers to extract templates, LogLLM preprocesses log messages with regular expressions, streamlining the entire process. Our framework is trained through a novel three-stage procedure designed to enhance performance and adaptability. Experimental results across four public datasets demonstrate that LogLLM outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Even when handling unstable logs, it effectively captures the semantic meaning of log messages and detects anomalies accurately.</description>

      <title>RETR: Multi-View Radar Detection Transformer for Indoor Perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10293v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Indoor radar perception has seen rising interest due to affordable costs driven by emerging automotive imaging radar developments and the benefits of reduced privacy concerns and reliability under hazardous conditions (e.g., fire and smoke). However, existing radar perception pipelines fail to account for distinctive characteristics of the multi-view radar setting. In this paper, we propose Radar dEtection TRansformer (RETR), an extension of the popular DETR architecture, tailored for multi-view radar perception. RETR inherits the advantages of DETR, eliminating the need for hand-crafted components for object detection and segmentation in the image plane. More importantly, RETR incorporates carefully designed modifications such as 1) depth-prioritized feature similarity via a tunable positional encoding (TPE); 2) a tri-plane loss from both radar and camera coordinates; and 3) a learnable radar-to-camera transformation via reparameterization, to account for the unique multi-view radar setting. Evaluated on two indoor radar perception datasets, our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods by a margin of 15.38+ AP for object detection and 11.91+ IoU for instance segmentation, respectively. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/merlresearch/radar-detection-transformer.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14207v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This contribution introduces a dataset of 7th-order Ambisonic Room Impulse Responses (HOA-RIRs), created using the Image Source Method. By employing higher-order Ambisonics, our dataset enables precise spatial audio reproduction, a critical requirement for realistic immersive audio applications. Leveraging the virtual simulation, we present a unique microphone configuration, based on the superposition principle, designed to optimize sound field coverage while addressing the limitations of traditional microphone arrays. The presented 64-microphone configuration allows us to capture RIRs directly in the Spherical Harmonics domain. The dataset features a wide range of room configurations, encompassing variations in room geometry, acoustic absorption materials, and source-receiver distances. A detailed description of the simulation setup is provided alongside for an accurate reproduction. The dataset serves as a vital resource for researchers working on spatial audio, particularly in applications involving machine learning to improve room acoustics modeling and sound field synthesis. It further provides a very high level of spatial resolution and realism crucial for tasks such as source localization, reverberation prediction, and immersive sound reproduction.</description>

      <title>Beautimeter: Harnessing GPT for Assessing Architectural and Urban Beauty based on the 15 Properties of Living Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19094v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Beautimeter is a new tool powered by generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) technology, designed to evaluate architectural and urban beauty. Rooted in Christopher Alexander's theory of centers, this work builds on the idea that all environments possess, to varying degrees, an innate sense of life. Alexander identified 15 fundamental properties, such as levels of scale and thick boundaries, that characterize living structure, which Beautimeter uses as a basis for its analysis. By integrating GPT's advanced natural language processing capabilities, Beautimeter assesses the extent to which a structure embodies these 15 properties, enabling a nuanced evaluation of architectural and urban aesthetics. Using ChatGPT, the tool helps users generate insights into the perceived beauty and coherence of spaces. We conducted a series of case studies, evaluating images of architectural and urban environments, as well as carpets, paintings, and other artifacts. The results demonstrate Beautimeter's effectiveness in analyzing aesthetic qualities across diverse contexts. Our findings suggest that by leveraging GPT technology, Beautimeter offers architects, urban planners, and designers a powerful tool to create spaces that resonate deeply with people. This paper also explores the implications of such technology for architecture and urban design, highlighting its potential to enhance both the design process and the assessment of built environments.

      <title>On the Unknowable Limits to Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19223v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a rigorous decomposition of predictive error, highlighting that not all 'irreducible' error is genuinely immutable. Many domains stand to benefit from iterative enhancements in measurement, construct validity, and modeling. Our approach demonstrates how apparently 'unpredictable' outcomes can become more tractable with improved data (across both target and features) and refined algorithms. By distinguishing aleatoric from epistemic error, we delineate how accuracy may asymptotically improve--though inherent stochasticity may remain--and offer a robust framework for advancing computational research.</description>

      <title>Schedule On the Fly: Diffusion Time Prediction for Faster and Better Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01243v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion and flow models have achieved remarkable successes in various applications such as text-to-image generation. However, these models typically rely on the same predetermined denoising schedules during inference for each prompt, which potentially limits the inference efficiency as well as the flexibility when handling different prompts. In this paper, we argue that the optimal noise schedule should adapt to each inference instance, and introduce the Time Prediction Diffusion Model (TPDM) to accomplish this. TPDM employs a plug-and-play Time Prediction Module (TPM) that predicts the next noise level based on current latent features at each denoising step. We train the TPM using reinforcement learning, aiming to maximize a reward that discounts the final image quality by the number of denoising steps. With such an adaptive scheduler, TPDM not only generates high-quality images that are aligned closely with human preferences but also adjusts the number of denoising steps and time on the fly, enhancing both performance and efficiency. We train TPDMs on multiple diffusion model benchmarks. With Stable Diffusion 3 Medium architecture, TPDM achieves an aesthetic score of 5.44 and a human preference score (HPS) of 29.59, while using around 50% fewer denoising steps to achieve better performance. We will release our best model alongside this paper.</description>

      <title>A Practical Examination of AI-Generated Text Detectors for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05139v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The proliferation of large language models has raised growing concerns about their misuse, particularly in cases where AI-generated text is falsely attributed to human authors. Machine-generated content detectors claim to effectively identify such text under various conditions and from any language model. This paper critically evaluates these claims by assessing several popular detectors (RADAR, Wild, T5Sentinel, Fast-DetectGPT, GPTID, LogRank, Binoculars) on a range of domains, datasets, and models that these detectors have not previously encountered. We employ various prompting strategies to simulate adversarial attacks, demonstrating that even moderate efforts can significantly evade detection. We emphasize the importance of the true positive rate at a specific false positive rate (TPR@FPR) metric and demonstrate that these detectors perform poorly in certain settings, with TPR@.01 as low as 0%. Our findings suggest that both trained and zero-shot detectors struggle to maintain high sensitivity while achieving a reasonable true positive rate.</description>

      <title>APOLLO: SGD-like Memory, AdamW-level Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05270v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are notoriously memory-intensive during training, particularly with the popular AdamW optimizer. This memory burden necessitates using more or higher-end GPUs or reducing batch sizes, limiting training scalability and throughput. To address this, various memory-efficient optimizers have been proposed to reduce optimizer memory usage. However, they face critical challenges: (i) reliance on costly SVD operations; (ii) significant performance trade-offs compared to AdamW; and (iii) still substantial optimizer memory overhead to maintain competitive performance.
  In this work, we identify that AdamW's learning rate adaptation rule can be effectively coarsened as a structured learning rate update. Based on this insight, we propose Approximated Gradient Scaling for Memory-Efficient LLM Optimization (APOLLO), which approximates learning rate scaling using an auxiliary low-rank optimizer state based on pure random projection. This structured learning rate update rule makes APOLLO highly tolerant to further memory reductions while delivering comparable pre-training performance. Even its rank-1 variant, APOLLO-Mini, achieves superior pre-training performance compared to AdamW with SGD-level memory costs.
  Extensive experiments demonstrate that the APOLLO series performs on-par with or better than AdamW, while achieving greater memory savings by nearly eliminating the optimization states of AdamW. These savings provide significant system-level benefits: (1) Enhanced Throughput: 3x throughput on an 8xA100-80GB setup compared to AdamW by supporting 4x larger batch sizes. (2) Improved Model Scalability: Pre-training LLaMA-13B with naive DDP on A100-80GB GPUs without system-level optimizations. (3) Low-End GPU Friendly Pre-training: Pre-training LLaMA-7B on a single GPU using less than 12 GB of memory with weight quantization.</description>

      <title>On Faster Marginalization with Squared Circuits via Orthonormalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07883v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Squared tensor networks (TNs) and their generalization as parameterized computational graphs -- squared circuits -- have been recently used as expressive distribution estimators in high dimensions. However, the squaring operation introduces additional complexity when marginalizing variables or computing the partition function, which hinders their usage in machine learning applications. Canonical forms of popular TNs are parameterized via unitary matrices as to simplify the computation of particular marginals, but cannot be mapped to general circuits since these might not correspond to a known TN. Inspired by TN canonical forms, we show how to parameterize squared circuits to ensure they encode already normalized distributions. We then use this parameterization to devise an algorithm to compute any marginal of squared circuits that is more efficient than a previously known one. We conclude by formally showing the proposed parameterization comes with no expressiveness loss for many circuit classes.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Multi-Objective Learning through Goal-Conditioned Supervised Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08911v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-objective learning aims to optimize multiple objectives simultaneously with a single model for achieving a balanced and satisfying performance on all these objectives. However, it suffers from the difficulty to formalize and conduct the exact learning process, especially considering the possible conflicts between objectives. Existing approaches explores to resolve this primarily in two directions: adapting modeling structure or constraining optimization with certain assumptions. However, a primary issue is that their presuppositions for the effectiveness of their design are insufficient to guarantee the its generality in real-world applications. What's worse, the high space and computation complexity issue makes it even harder to apply them in large-scale, complicated environment such as the recommender systems. To address these issues, we propose a general framework for automatically learning to achieve multiple objectives based on the existing sequential data. We apply the goal-conditioned supervised learning (GCSL) framework to multi-objective learning, by extending the definition of goals from one-dimensional scalar to multi-dimensional vector that perfectly disentangle the representation of different objectives. Meanwhile, GCSL enables the model to simultaneously learn to achieve each objective in a concise supervised learning way, simply guided by existing sequences in the offline data. No additional constraint, special model structure design, or complex optimization algorithms are further required. Apart from that, we formally analyze the property of the goals in GCSL and then firstly propose a goal-generation framework to gain achievable and reasonable goals for inference. Extensive experiments are conducted on real-world recommendation datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method and exploring the feasibility of the goal-generation strategies in GCSL.</description>

      <title>Neptune: The Long Orbit to Benchmarking Long Video Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09582v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce Neptune, a benchmark for long video understanding that requires reasoning over long time horizons and across different modalities. Many existing video datasets and models are focused on short clips (10s-30s). While some long video datasets do exist, they can often be solved by powerful image models applied per frame (and often to very few frames) in a video, and are usually manually annotated at high cost. In order to mitigate both these problems, we propose a scalable dataset creation pipeline which leverages large models (VLMs and LLMs), to automatically generate dense, time-aligned video captions, as well as tough question answer decoy sets for video segments (up to 15 minutes in length). Our dataset Neptune covers a broad range of long video reasoning abilities and consists of a subset that emphasizes multimodal reasoning. Since existing metrics for open-ended question answering are either rule-based or may rely on proprietary models, we provide a new open source model-based metric GEM to score open-ended responses on Neptune. Benchmark evaluations reveal that most current open-source long video models perform poorly on Neptune, particularly on questions testing temporal ordering, counting and state changes. Through Neptune, we aim to spur the development of more advanced models capable of understanding long videos. The dataset is available at https://github.com/google-deepmind/neptune</description>

      <title>A recent evaluation on the performance of LLMs on radiation oncology physics using questions of randomly shuffled options</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10622v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Purpose: We present an updated study evaluating the performance of large language models (LLMs) in answering radiation oncology physics questions, focusing on the recently released models.
  Methods: A set of 100 multiple-choice radiation oncology physics questions, previously created by a well-experienced physicist, was used for this study. The answer options of the questions were randomly shuffled to create "new" exam sets. Five LLMs -- OpenAI o1-preview, GPT-4o, LLaMA 3.1 (405B), Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet -- with the versions released before September 30, 2024, were queried using these new exam sets. To evaluate their deductive reasoning ability, the correct answer options in the questions were replaced with "None of the above." Then, the explain-first and step-by-step instruction prompts were used to test if this strategy improved their reasoning ability. The performance of the LLMs was compared with the answers from medical physicists.
  Results: All models demonstrated expert-level performance on these questions, with o1-preview even surpassing medical physicists with a majority vote. When replacing the correct answer options with 'None of the above', all models exhibited a considerable decline in performance, suggesting room for improvement. The explain-first and step-by-step instruction prompts helped enhance the reasoning ability of the LLaMA 3.1 (405B), Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet models.
  Conclusion: These recently released LLMs demonstrated expert-level performance in answering radiation oncology physics questions, exhibiting great potential to assist in radiation oncology physics education and training.</description>

      <title>Can LLM Prompting Serve as a Proxy for Static Analysis in Vulnerability Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12039v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite their remarkable success, large language models (LLMs) have shown limited ability on applied tasks such as vulnerability detection. We investigate various prompting strategies for vulnerability detection and, as part of this exploration, propose a prompting strategy that integrates natural language descriptions of vulnerabilities with a contrastive chain-of-thought reasoning approach, augmented using contrastive samples from a synthetic dataset. Our study highlights the potential of LLMs to detect vulnerabilities by integrating natural language descriptions, contrastive reasoning, and synthetic examples into a comprehensive prompting framework. Our results show that this approach can enhance LLM understanding of vulnerabilities. On a high-quality vulnerability detection dataset such as SVEN, our prompting strategies can improve accuracies, F1-scores, and pairwise accuracies by 23%, 11%, and 14%, respectively.</description>

      <title>CREST: An Efficient Conjointly-trained Spike-driven Framework for Event-based Object Detection Exploiting Spatiotemporal Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12525v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Event-based cameras feature high temporal resolution, wide dynamic range, and low power consumption, which is ideal for high-speed and low-light object detection. Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are promising for event-based object recognition and detection due to their spiking nature but lack efficient training methods, leading to gradient vanishing and high computational complexity, especially in deep SNNs. Additionally, existing SNN frameworks often fail to effectively handle multi-scale spatiotemporal features, leading to increased data redundancy and reduced accuracy. To address these issues, we propose CREST, a novel conjointly-trained spike-driven framework to exploit spatiotemporal dynamics in event-based object detection. We introduce the conjoint learning rule to accelerate SNN learning and alleviate gradient vanishing. It also supports dual operation modes for efficient and flexible implementation on different hardware types. Additionally, CREST features a fully spike-driven framework with a multi-scale spatiotemporal event integrator (MESTOR) and a spatiotemporal-IoU (ST-IoU) loss. Our approach achieves superior object recognition &amp; detection performance and up to 100X energy efficiency compared with state-of-the-art SNN algorithms on three datasets, providing an efficient solution for event-based object detection algorithms suitable for SNN hardware implementation.</description>

      <title>Characterising Simulation-Based Program Equilibria</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14570v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In Tennenholtz's program equilibrium, players of a game submit programs to play on their behalf. Each program receives the other programs' source code and outputs an action. This can model interactions involving AI agents, mutually transparent institutions, or commitments. Tennenholtz (2004) proves a folk theorem for program games, but the equilibria constructed are very brittle. We therefore consider simulation-based programs -- i.e., programs that work by running opponents' programs. These are relatively robust (in particular, two programs that act the same are treated the same) and are more practical than proof-based approaches. Oesterheld's (2019) $\epsilon$Grounded$\pi$Bot is such an approach. Unfortunately, it is not generally applicable to games of three or more players, and only allows for a limited range of equilibria in two player games. In this paper, we propose a generalisation to Oesterheld's (2019) $\epsilon$Grounded$\pi$Bot. We prove a folk theorem for our programs in a setting with access to a shared source of randomness. We then characterise their equilibria in a setting without shared randomness. Both with and without shared randomness, we achieve a much wider range of equilibria than Oesterheld's (2019) $\epsilon$Grounded$\pi$Bot. Finally, we explore the limits of simulation-based program equilibrium, showing that the Tennenholtz folk theorem cannot be attained by simulation-based programs without access to shared randomness.</description>

      <title>Architecture-Aware Learning Curve Extrapolation via Graph Ordinary Differential Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15554v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning curve extrapolation predicts neural network performance from early training epochs and has been applied to accelerate AutoML, facilitating hyperparameter tuning and neural architecture search. However, existing methods typically model the evolution of learning curves in isolation, neglecting the impact of neural network (NN) architectures, which influence the loss landscape and learning trajectories. In this work, we explore whether incorporating neural network architecture improves learning curve modeling and how to effectively integrate this architectural information. Motivated by the dynamical system view of optimization, we propose a novel architecture-aware neural differential equation model to forecast learning curves continuously. We empirically demonstrate its ability to capture the general trend of fluctuating learning curves while quantifying uncertainty through variational parameters. Our model outperforms current state-of-the-art learning curve extrapolation methods and pure time-series modeling approaches for both MLP and CNN-based learning curves. Additionally, we explore the applicability of our method in Neural Architecture Search scenarios, such as training configuration ranking.</description>

      <title>MathSpeech: Leveraging Small LMs for Accurate Conversion in Mathematical Speech-to-Formula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15655v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In various academic and professional settings, such as mathematics lectures or research presentations, it is often necessary to convey mathematical expressions orally. However, reading mathematical expressions aloud without accompanying visuals can significantly hinder comprehension, especially for those who are hearing-impaired or rely on subtitles due to language barriers. For instance, when a presenter reads Euler's Formula, current Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models often produce a verbose and error-prone textual description (e.g., e to the power of i x equals cosine of x plus i $\textit{side}$ of x), instead of the concise $\LaTeX{}$ format (i.e., $ e^{ix} = \cos(x) + i\sin(x) $), which hampers clear understanding and communication. To address this issue, we introduce MathSpeech, a novel pipeline that integrates ASR models with small Language Models (sLMs) to correct errors in mathematical expressions and accurately convert spoken expressions into structured $\LaTeX{}$ representations. Evaluated on a new dataset derived from lecture recordings, MathSpeech demonstrates $\LaTeX{}$ generation capabilities comparable to leading commercial Large Language Models (LLMs), while leveraging fine-tuned small language models of only 120M parameters. Specifically, in terms of CER, BLEU, and ROUGE scores for $\LaTeX{}$ translation, MathSpeech demonstrated significantly superior capabilities compared to GPT-4o. We observed a decrease in CER from 0.390 to 0.298, and higher ROUGE/BLEU scores compared to GPT-4o.</description>

Abstract: As the use of machine learning models has increased, numerous studies have aimed to enhance fairness. However, research on the intersection of fairness and explainability remains insufficient, leading to potential issues in gaining the trust of actual users. Here, we propose a novel module that constructs a fair latent space, enabling faithful explanation while ensuring fairness. The fair latent space is constructed by disentangling and redistributing labels and sensitive attributes, allowing the generation of counterfactual explanations for each type of information. Our module is attached to a pretrained generative model, transforming its biased latent space into a fair latent space. Additionally, since only the module needs to be trained, there are advantages in terms of time and cost savings, without the need to train the entire generative model. We validate the fair latent space with various fairness metrics and demonstrate that our approach can effectively provide explanations for biased decisions and assurances of fairness.</description>

      <title>How Propense Are Large Language Models at Producing Code Smells? A Benchmarking Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18989v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant potential in automating software engineering tasks, particularly in code generation. However, current evaluation benchmarks, which primarily focus on accuracy, fall short in assessing the quality of the code generated by these models, specifically their tendency to produce code smells. To address this limitation, we introduce CodeSmellEval, a benchmark designed to evaluate the propensity of LLMs for generating code smells. Our benchmark includes a novel metric: Propensity Smelly Score (PSC), and a curated dataset of method-level code smells: CodeSmellData. To demonstrate the use of CodeSmellEval, we conducted a case study with two state-of-the-art LLMs, CodeLlama and Mistral. The results reveal that both models tend to generate code smells, such as simplifiable-condition and consider-merging-isinstance. These findings highlight the effectiveness of our benchmark in evaluating LLMs, providing valuable insights into their reliability and their propensity to introduce code smells in code generation tasks.</description>

      <title>ValuesRAG: Enhancing Cultural Alignment Through Retrieval-Augmented Contextual Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01031v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cultural values alignment in Large Language Models (LLMs) is a critical challenge due to their tendency to embed Western-centric biases from training data, leading to misrepresentations and fairness issues in cross-cultural contexts. Recent approaches, such as role-assignment and few-shot learning, often struggle with reliable cultural alignment as they heavily rely on pre-trained knowledge, lack scalability, and fail to capture nuanced cultural values effectively. To address these issues, we propose ValuesRAG, a novel and effective framework that applies Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with In-Context Learning (ICL) to integrate cultural and demographic knowledge dynamically during text generation. Leveraging the World Values Survey (WVS) dataset, ValuesRAG first generates summaries of values for each individual. Subsequently, we curate several representative regional datasets to serve as test datasets and retrieve relevant summaries of values based on demographic features, followed by a reranking step to select the top-k relevant summaries. ValuesRAG consistently outperforms baseline methods, both in the main experiment and in the ablation study where only the values summary was provided. Notably, ValuesRAG demonstrates an accuracy of 21% improvement over other baseline methods, highlighting its potential to foster culturally aligned AI systems and enhance the inclusivity of AI-driven applications.</description>

      <title>BoostStep: Boosting mathematical capability of Large Language Models via improved single-step reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03226v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cutting-edge large language models (LLMs) demonstrate promising performance in solving complex math problems with a divide-and-conquer pipeline and the assistance of in-context learning (ICL) examples. However, their potential for improvement is limited by two critical problems within their ICL examples: granularity-mismatch and the ensuing negative-effect noise problem. Specifically, the LLMs are capable of the dividing process yet mostly failed by inaccurate reasoning within a few conquer steps, while the ICL examples retrieved in question-grained sometimes lack relevant steps for a specific challenging reasoning step. Further, this disconnect may hinder the correct reasoning due to its irrelevance. To this end, we focus on improving the reasoning quality within each step and present BoostStep. BoostStep aligns the granularity between the retrieving and reasoning on step grained, and provides highly related ICL examples for each reasoning step with a novel `first-try' strategy. BoostStep provides more relevant examples than the coarse question-grained strategy, enhancing the model reasoning quality within each step steadily. BoostStep is a general and robust reasoning-enhancing method that not only improves standalone reasoning performance but also integrates seamlessly with Monte Carlo Tree Search methods (MCTS) to refine both candidate generation and decision-making. Quantitatively, it improves GPT-4o and Qwen2.5-Math-72B by 3.6\% and 2.0\% respectively on various mathematical benchmarks, and 7.5\% gain combined with MCTS.</description>

      <title>DPO Kernels: A Semantically-Aware, Kernel-Enhanced, and Divergence-Rich Paradigm for Direct Preference Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03271v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid rise of large language models (LLMs) has unlocked many applications but also underscores the challenge of aligning them with diverse values and preferences. Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is central to alignment but constrained by fixed divergences and limited feature transformations. We propose DPO-Kernels, which integrates kernel methods to address these issues through four key contributions: (i) Kernelized Representations with polynomial, RBF, Mahalanobis, and spectral kernels for richer transformations, plus a hybrid loss combining embedding-based and probability-based objectives; (ii) Divergence Alternatives (Jensen-Shannon, Hellinger, Renyi, Bhattacharyya, Wasserstein, and f-divergences) for greater stability; (iii) Data-Driven Selection metrics that automatically choose the best kernel-divergence pair; and (iv) a Hierarchical Mixture of Kernels for both local precision and global modeling. Evaluations on 12 datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in factuality, safety, reasoning, and instruction following. Grounded in Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization, DPO-Kernels maintains robust generalization for LLMs, offering a comprehensive resource for further alignment research.</description>

      <title>HIVEX: A High-Impact Environment Suite for Multi-Agent Research (extended version)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04180v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Games have been vital test beds for the rapid development of Agent-based research. Remarkable progress has been achieved in the past, but it is unclear if the findings equip for real-world problems. While pressure grows, some of the most critical ecological challenges can find mitigation and prevention solutions through technology and its applications. Most real-world domains include multi-agent scenarios and require machine-machine and human-machine collaboration. Open-source environments have not advanced and are often toy scenarios, too abstract or not suitable for multi-agent research. By mimicking real-world problems and increasing the complexity of environments, we hope to advance state-of-the-art multi-agent research and inspire researchers to work on immediate real-world problems. Here, we present HIVEX, an environment suite to benchmark multi-agent research focusing on ecological challenges. HIVEX includes the following environments: Wind Farm Control, Wildfire Resource Management, Drone-Based Reforestation, Ocean Plastic Collection, and Aerial Wildfire Suppression. We provide environments, training examples, and baselines for the main and sub-tasks. All trained models resulting from the experiments of this work are hosted on Hugging Face. We also provide a leaderboard on Hugging Face and encourage the community to submit models trained on our environment suite.</description>

      <title>LLM-MedQA: Enhancing Medical Question Answering through Case Studies in Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05464v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate and efficient question-answering systems are essential for delivering high-quality patient care in the medical field. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have made remarkable strides across various domains, they continue to face significant challenges in medical question answering, particularly in understanding domain-specific terminologies and performing complex reasoning. These limitations undermine their effectiveness in critical medical applications. To address these issues, we propose a novel approach incorporating similar case generation within a multi-agent medical question-answering (MedQA) system. Specifically, we leverage the Llama3.1:70B model, a state-of-the-art LLM, in a multi-agent architecture to enhance performance on the MedQA dataset using zero-shot learning. Our method capitalizes on the model's inherent medical knowledge and reasoning capabilities, eliminating the need for additional training data. Experimental results show substantial performance gains over existing benchmark models, with improvements of 7% in both accuracy and F1-score across various medical QA tasks. Furthermore, we examine the model's interpretability and reliability in addressing complex medical queries. This research not only offers a robust solution for medical question answering but also establishes a foundation for broader applications of LLMs in the medical domain.</description>

      <title>Distilling Calibration via Conformalized Credal Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06066v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deploying artificial intelligence (AI) models on edge devices involves a delicate balance between meeting stringent complexity constraints, such as limited memory and energy resources, and ensuring reliable performance in sensitive decision-making tasks. One way to enhance reliability is through uncertainty quantification via Bayesian inference. This approach, however, typically necessitates maintaining and running multiple models in an ensemble, which may exceed the computational limits of edge devices. This paper introduces a low-complexity methodology to address this challenge by distilling calibration information from a more complex model. In an offline phase, predictive probabilities generated by a high-complexity cloud-based model are leveraged to determine a threshold based on the typical divergence between the cloud and edge models. At run time, this threshold is used to construct credal sets -- ranges of predictive probabilities that are guaranteed, with a user-selected confidence level, to include the predictions of the cloud model. The credal sets are obtained through thresholding of a divergence measure in the simplex of predictive probabilities. Experiments on visual and language tasks demonstrate that the proposed approach, termed Conformalized Distillation for Credal Inference (CD-CI), significantly improves calibration performance compared to low-complexity Bayesian methods, such as Laplace approximation, making it a practical and efficient solution for edge AI deployments.</description>

      <title>MedCT: A Clinical Terminology Graph for Generative AI Applications in Healthcare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06465v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the world's first clinical terminology for the Chinese healthcare community, namely MedCT, accompanied by a clinical foundation model MedBERT and an entity linking model MedLink. The MedCT system enables standardized and programmable representation of Chinese clinical data, successively stimulating the development of new medicines, treatment pathways, and better patient outcomes for the populous Chinese community. Moreover, the MedCT knowledge graph provides a principled mechanism to minimize the hallucination problem of large language models (LLMs), therefore achieving significant levels of accuracy and safety in LLM-based clinical applications. By leveraging the LLMs' emergent capabilities of generativeness and expressiveness, we were able to rapidly built a production-quality terminology system and deployed to real-world clinical field within three months, while classical terminologies like SNOMED CT have gone through more than twenty years development. Our experiments show that the MedCT system achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in semantic matching and entity linking tasks, not only for Chinese but also for English. We also conducted a longitudinal field experiment by applying MedCT and LLMs in a representative spectrum of clinical tasks, including electronic health record (EHR) auto-generation and medical document search for diagnostic decision making. Our study shows a multitude of values of MedCT for clinical workflows and patient outcomes, especially in the new genre of clinical LLM applications. We present our approach in sufficient engineering detail, such that implementing a clinical terminology for other non-English societies should be readily reproducible. We openly release our terminology, models and algorithms, along with real-world clinical datasets for the development.</description>

      <title>UNetVL: Enhancing 3D Medical Image Segmentation with Chebyshev KAN Powered Vision-LSTM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07017v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: 3D medical image segmentation has progressed considerably due to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs), yet these methods struggle to balance long-range dependency acquisition with computational efficiency. To address this challenge, we propose UNETVL (U-Net Vision-LSTM), a novel architecture that leverages recent advancements in temporal information processing. UNETVL incorporates Vision-LSTM (ViL) for improved scalability and memory functions, alongside an efficient Chebyshev Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) to handle complex and long-range dependency patterns more effectively. We validated our method on the ACDC and AMOS2022 (post challenge Task 2) benchmark datasets, showing a significant improvement in mean Dice score compared to recent state-of-the-art approaches, especially over its predecessor, UNETR, with increases of 7.3% on ACDC and 15.6% on AMOS, respectively. Extensive ablation studies were conducted to demonstrate the impact of each component in UNETVL, providing a comprehensive understanding of its architecture. Our code is available at https://github.com/tgrex6/UNETVL, facilitating further research and applications in this domain.</description>

      <title>Neural Probabilistic Circuits: Enabling Compositional and Interpretable Predictions through Logical Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07021v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: End-to-end deep neural networks have achieved remarkable success across various domains but are often criticized for their lack of interpretability. While post hoc explanation methods attempt to address this issue, they often fail to accurately represent these black-box models, resulting in misleading or incomplete explanations. To overcome these challenges, we propose an inherently transparent model architecture called Neural Probabilistic Circuits (NPCs), which enable compositional and interpretable predictions through logical reasoning. In particular, an NPC consists of two modules: an attribute recognition model, which predicts probabilities for various attributes, and a task predictor built on a probabilistic circuit, which enables logical reasoning over recognized attributes to make class predictions. To train NPCs, we introduce a three-stage training algorithm comprising attribute recognition, circuit construction, and joint optimization. Moreover, we theoretically demonstrate that an NPC's error is upper-bounded by a linear combination of the errors from its modules. To further demonstrate the interpretability of NPC, we provide both the most probable explanations and the counterfactual explanations. Empirical results on four benchmark datasets show that NPCs strike a balance between interpretability and performance, achieving results competitive even with those of end-to-end black-box models while providing enhanced interpretability.</description>

      <title>PSReg: Prior-guided Sparse Mixture of Experts for Point Cloud Registration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07762v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The discriminative feature is crucial for point cloud registration. Recent methods improve the feature discriminative by distinguishing between non-overlapping and overlapping region points. However, they still face challenges in distinguishing the ambiguous structures in the overlapping regions. Therefore, the ambiguous features they extracted resulted in a significant number of outlier matches from overlapping regions. To solve this problem, we propose a prior-guided SMoE-based registration method to improve the feature distinctiveness by dispatching the potential correspondences to the same experts. Specifically, we propose a prior-guided SMoE module by fusing prior overlap and potential correspondence embeddings for routing, assigning tokens to the most suitable experts for processing. In addition, we propose a registration framework by a specific combination of Transformer layer and prior-guided SMoE module. The proposed method not only pays attention to the importance of locating the overlapping areas of point clouds, but also commits to finding more accurate correspondences in overlapping areas. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving state-of-the-art registration recall (95.7\%/79.3\%) on the 3DMatch/3DLoMatch benchmark. Moreover, we also test the performance on ModelNet40 and demonstrate excellent performance.</description>

      <title>Potential and Perils of Large Language Models as Judges of Unstructured Textual Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08167v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rapid advancements in large language models have unlocked remarkable capabilities when it comes to processing and summarizing unstructured text data. This has implications for the analysis of rich, open-ended datasets, such as survey responses, where LLMs hold the promise of efficiently distilling key themes and sentiments. However, as organizations increasingly turn to these powerful AI systems to make sense of textual feedback, a critical question arises, can we trust LLMs to accurately represent the perspectives contained within these text based datasets? While LLMs excel at generating human-like summaries, there is a risk that their outputs may inadvertently diverge from the true substance of the original responses. Discrepancies between the LLM-generated outputs and the actual themes present in the data could lead to flawed decision-making, with far-reaching consequences for organizations. This research investigates the effectiveness of LLM-as-judge models to evaluate the thematic alignment of summaries generated by other LLMs. We utilized an Anthropic Claude model to generate thematic summaries from open-ended survey responses, with Amazon's Titan Express, Nova Pro, and Meta's Llama serving as judges. This LLM-as-judge approach was compared to human evaluations using Cohen's kappa, Spearman's rho, and Krippendorff's alpha, validating a scalable alternative to traditional human centric evaluation methods. Our findings reveal that while LLM-as-judge offer a scalable solution comparable to human raters, humans may still excel at detecting subtle, context-specific nuances. Our research contributes to the growing body of knowledge on AI assisted text analysis. Further, we provide recommendations for future research, emphasizing the need for careful consideration when generalizing LLM-as-judge models across various contexts and use cases.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the Importance of Data Alignment in Downstream Model Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08496v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Contrary to the conventional emphasis on dataset size, we explore the role of data alignment -- an often overlooked aspect of data quality -- in training capable Large Language Models (LLMs). To do so, we use the Task2Vec-based alignment coefficient, a quantitative measure of the similarity between two datasets, to quantify the impact of alignment between training data and evaluation data on downstream performance. In particular, we conduct controlled \textit{interventional} experiments for two settings: 1. the impact of increased alignment coefficients between various pre-training (pt) against evaluation datasets, and 2. the impact of increased alignment coefficients between domain specific fine-tuning (ft) against domain specific evaluation. The domain specific task we explore is Autoformalization -- the machine translation task between natural language and code for formal verification. In both settings, we find a strong, predictable negative correlation between the alignment coefficient of a model's training and evaluation data and the model's loss/perplexity on the respective downstream task. These findings suggest a re-evaluation of LLM training approaches, demonstrating the relevance of data alignment compared to data quantity, especially in specialized downstream tasks such as Autoformalization.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Efficacy of Meta-Learning: Unveiling Superior Data Diversity Utilization of MAML Over Pre-training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08506</link>

Abstract: Currently, data and model size dominate the narrative in the training of super-large, powerful models. However, there has been a lack of exploration on the effect of other attributes of the training dataset on model performance. We hypothesize that dataset diversity can impact the performance of vision models. Our study shows positive correlations between test set accuracy and data diversity, providing an argument for furthering the research of dataset attributes beyond size. We analyzed pre-training and model-agnostic meta-learning methods on twelve popular visual datasets (e.g., Omniglot, CIFAR-FS, Aircraft) and five model configurations, including MAML variants with different numbers of inner gradient steps and supervised learning. We show moderate to strong positive correlations (R-squared: 0.15-0.42) between accuracy and data diversity and weaker but significant correlations (R-squared: ~0.2) between loss and diversity. These findings support our hypothesis and demonstrate a promising way for a deeper exploration of how formal data diversity influences model performance. This initial study highlights the potential of (Task2Vec) data diversity as a valuable measure in the rapidly evolving field of large-scale learning and emphasizes that understanding the dataset is key to building more powerful and generalizable models.</description>

      <title>Fine-grained Spatio-temporal Event Prediction with Self-adaptive Anchor Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08653v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Event prediction tasks often handle spatio-temporal data distributed in a large spatial area. Different regions in the area exhibit different characteristics while having latent correlations. This spatial heterogeneity and correlations greatly affect the spatio-temporal distributions of event occurrences, which has not been addressed by state-of-the-art models. Learning spatial dependencies of events in a continuous space is challenging due to its fine granularity and a lack of prior knowledge. In this work, we propose a novel Graph Spatio-Temporal Point Process (GSTPP) model for fine-grained event prediction. It adopts an encoder-decoder architecture that jointly models the state dynamics of spatially localized regions using neural Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs). The state evolution is built on the foundation of a novel Self-Adaptive Anchor Graph (SAAG) that captures spatial dependencies. By adaptively localizing the anchor nodes in the space and jointly constructing the correlation edges between them, the SAAG enhances the model's ability of learning complex spatial event patterns. The proposed GSTPP model greatly improves the accuracy of fine-grained event prediction. Extensive experimental results show that our method greatly improves the prediction accuracy over existing spatio-temporal event prediction approaches.</description>

      <title>IDEA: Image Description Enhanced CLIP-Adapter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08816v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) has attained great success in pattern recognition and computer vision. Transferring CLIP to downstream tasks (e.g. zero- or few-shot classification) is a hot topic in multimodal learning. However, current studies primarily focus on either prompt learning for text or adapter tuning for vision, without fully exploiting the complementary information and correlations among image-text pairs. In this paper, we propose an Image Description Enhanced CLIP-Adapter (IDEA) method to adapt CLIP to few-shot image classification tasks. This method captures fine-grained features by leveraging both visual features and textual descriptions of images. IDEA is a training-free method for CLIP, and it can be comparable to or even exceeds state-of-the-art models on multiple tasks. Furthermore, we introduce Trainable-IDEA (T-IDEA), which extends IDEA by adding two lightweight learnable components (i.e., a projector and a learnable latent space), further enhancing the model's performance and achieving SOTA results on 11 datasets. As one important contribution, we employ the Llama model and design a comprehensive pipeline to generate textual descriptions for images of 11 datasets, resulting in a total of 1,637,795 image-text pairs, named "IMD-11". Our code and data are released at https://github.com/FourierAI/IDEA.</description>

      <title>A Non-autoregressive Model for Joint STT and TTS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09104v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we take a step towards jointly modeling automatic speech recognition (STT) and speech synthesis (TTS) in a fully non-autoregressive way. We develop a novel multimodal framework capable of handling the speech and text modalities as input either individually or together. The proposed model can also be trained with unpaired speech or text data owing to its multimodal nature. We further propose an iterative refinement strategy to improve the STT and TTS performance of our model such that the partial hypothesis at the output can be fed back to the input of our model, thus iteratively improving both STT and TTS predictions. We show that our joint model can effectively perform both STT and TTS tasks, outperforming the STT-specific baseline in all tasks and performing competitively with the TTS-specific baseline across a wide range of evaluation metrics.</description>

      <title>Solving the Unsolvable: Translating Case Law in Hong Kong</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09444v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges translating case law under Hong Kong's bilingual legal system. It highlights the initial success of translating all written statutes into Chinese before the 1997 handover, a task mandated by the Basic Law. The effort involved significant collaboration among legal, linguistic, and translation experts, resulting in a comprehensive and culturally appropriate bilingual legal system. However, translating case law remains a significant challenge due to the sheer volume and continuous growth of judicial decisions. The paper critiques the governments and judiciarys sporadic and uncoordinated efforts to translate case law, contrasting it with the thorough approach previously taken for statute translation. Although the government acknowledges the importance of legal bilingualism, it lacks a sustainable strategy for translating case law. The Judiciarys position that translating all judgments is unnecessary, unrealistic, and not cost-effectiveis analyzed and critiqued for its impact on legal transparency and public trust. A proposed solution involves leveraging machine translation technology through a human-machine interactive translation platform, which undergoes two major transitions. Initially based on a neural model, the platform transitions to using a large language model for improved translation accuracy. Furthermore, it evolves from a single-agent system to a multi-agent system, incorporating Translator, Annotator, and Proofreader agents. This multi-agent approach, supported by a grant, aims to facilitate efficient, high-quality translation of judicial judgments by integrating advanced artificial intelligence and continuous feedback mechanisms, thus better meeting the needs of a bilingual legal system.</description>

      <title>Class Incremental Fault Diagnosis under Limited Fault Data via Supervised Contrastive Knowledge Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09525v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Class-incremental fault diagnosis requires a model to adapt to new fault classes while retaining previous knowledge. However, limited research exists for imbalanced and long-tailed data. Extracting discriminative features from few-shot fault data is challenging, and adding new fault classes often demands costly model retraining. Moreover, incremental training of existing methods risks catastrophic forgetting, and severe class imbalance can bias the model's decisions toward normal classes. To tackle these issues, we introduce a Supervised Contrastive knowledge distiLlation for class Incremental Fault Diagnosis (SCLIFD) framework proposing supervised contrastive knowledge distillation for improved representation learning capability and less forgetting, a novel prioritized exemplar selection method for sample replay to alleviate catastrophic forgetting, and the Random Forest Classifier to address the class imbalance. Extensive experimentation on simulated and real-world industrial datasets across various imbalance ratios demonstrates the superiority of SCLIFD over existing approaches.

      <title>Robin: a Suite of Multi-Scale Vision-Language Models and the CHIRP Evaluation Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09672v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The proliferation of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in the past several years calls for rigorous and comprehensive evaluation methods and benchmarks. This work analyzes existing VLM evaluation techniques, including automated metrics, AI-based assessments, and human evaluations across diverse tasks. We first introduce Robin - a novel suite of VLMs that we built by combining Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Encoders (VEs) at multiple scales, and use Robin to identify shortcomings of current evaluation approaches across scales. Next, to overcome the identified limitations, we introduce CHIRP - a new long form response benchmark we developed for more robust and complete VLM evaluation. We provide open access to the Robin training code, model suite, and CHIRP benchmark to promote reproducibility and advance VLM research.</description>

      <title>Steering Large Language Models with Feature Guided Activation Additions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09929v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Effective and reliable control over large language model (LLM) behavior is a significant challenge. While activation steering methods, which add steering vectors to a model's hidden states, are a promising approach, existing techniques often lack precision and interpretability in how they influence model outputs. We introduce Feature Guided Activation Additions (FGAA), a novel activation steering method that leverages insights from Contrastive Activation Addition (CAA) and Sparse Autoencoder-Targeted Steering (SAE-TS). By operating in the latent space of a Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) and employing optimization techniques to select desired SAE features, FGAA constructs precise steering vectors that provide better steering effects while maintaining coherence of steered model outputs. In this regard, evaluations on Gemma-2-2B and Gemma-2-9B models across various steering tasks demonstrate that FGAA outperforms existing steering methods of CAA, SAE decoder steering, and SAE-TS. Our results also highlight important trade-offs between steering scale and general model capabilities that are consistent across all tested steering methods.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Autoregressive Transformers: Combining Byte- and Word-Level Processing for Robust, Adaptable Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10322v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tokenization is a fundamental step in natural language processing, breaking text into units that computational models can process. While learned subword tokenizers have become the de-facto standard, they present challenges such as large vocabularies, limited adaptability to new domains or languages, and sensitivity to spelling errors and variations. To overcome these limitations, we investigate a hierarchical architecture for autoregressive language modelling that combines character-level and word-level processing. It employs a lightweight character-level encoder to convert character sequences into word embeddings, which are then processed by a word-level backbone model and decoded back into characters via a compact character-level decoder. This method retains the sequence compression benefits of word-level tokenization without relying on a rigid, predefined vocabulary. We demonstrate, at scales up to 7 billion parameters, that hierarchical transformers match the downstream task performance of subword-tokenizer-based models while exhibiting significantly greater robustness to input perturbations. Additionally, during continued pretraining on an out-of-domain language, our model trains almost twice as fast, achieves superior performance on the target language, and retains more of its previously learned knowledge. Hierarchical transformers pave the way for NLP systems that are more robust, flexible, and generalizable across languages and domains.</description>
