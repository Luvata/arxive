      <title>Identifying Critical Pathways in Coronary Heart Disease via Fuzzy Subgraph Connectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coronary heart disease (CHD) arises from complex interactions among uncontrollable factors, controllable lifestyle factors, and clinical indicators, where relationships are often uncertain. Fuzzy subgraph connectivity (FSC) provides a systematic tool to capture such imprecision by quantifying the strength of association between vertices and subgraphs in fuzzy graphs. In this work, a fuzzy CHD graph is constructed with vertices for uncontrollable, controllable, and indicator components, and edges weighted by fuzzy memberships. Using FSC, we evaluate connectivity to identify strongest diagnostic routes, dominant risk factors, and critical bridges. Results show that FSC highlights influential pathways, bounds connectivity between weakest and strongest correlations, and reveals critical edges whose removal reduces predictive strength. Thus, FSC offers an interpretable and robust framework for modeling uncertainty in CHD risk prediction and supporting clinical decision-making.</description>

      <title>A global view of diverse construction methods of fuzzy implication functions rooted on F-chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fuzzy implication functions are one of the most important operators used in the fuzzy logic framework. While their flexible definition allows for diverse families with distinct properties, this variety needs a deeper theoretical understanding of their structural relationships. In this work, we focus on the study of construction methods, which employ different techniques to generate new fuzzy implication functions from existing ones. Particularly, we generalize the $F$-chain-based construction, recently introduced by Mesiar et al. to extend a method for constructing aggregation functions to the context of fuzzy implication functions. Our generalization employs collections of fuzzy implication functions rather than single ones, and uses two different increasing functions instead of a unique $F$-chain. We analyze property preservation under this construction and establish sufficient conditions. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our generalized $F$-chain-based construction is a unifying framework for several existing methods. In particular, we show that various construction techniques, such as contraposition, aggregation, and generalized vertical/horizontal threshold methods, can be reformulated within our approach. This reveals structural similarities between seemingly distinct construction strategies and provides a cohesive perspective on fuzzy implication construction methods.</description>

      <title>On the Non-Uniqueness of Representation of $(U,N)$-Implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fuzzy implication functions constitute fundamental operators in fuzzy logic systems, extending classical conditionals to manage uncertainty in logical inference. Among the extensive families of these operators, generalizations of the classical material implication have received considerable theoretical attention, particularly $(S,N)$-implications constructed from t-conorms and fuzzy negations, and their further generalizations to $(U,N)$-implications using disjunctive uninorms. Prior work has established characterization theorems for these families under the assumption that the fuzzy negation $N$ is continuous, ensuring uniqueness of representation. In this paper, we disprove this last fact for $(U,N)$-implications and we show that they do not necessarily possess a unique representation, even if the fuzzy negation is continuous. Further, we provide a comprehensive study of uniqueness conditions for both uninorms with continuous and non-continuous underlying functions. Our results offer important theoretical insights into the structural properties of these operators.</description>

      <title>Generalizability of Large Language Model-Based Agents: A Comprehensive Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have emerged as a new paradigm that extends LLMs' capabilities beyond text generation to dynamic interaction with external environments. By integrating reasoning with perception, memory, and tool use, agents are increasingly deployed in diverse domains like web navigation and household robotics. A critical challenge, however, lies in ensuring agent generalizability - the ability to maintain consistent performance across varied instructions, tasks, environments, and domains, especially those beyond agents' fine-tuning data. Despite growing interest, the concept of generalizability in LLM-based agents remains underdefined, and systematic approaches to measure and improve it are lacking. In this survey, we provide the first comprehensive review of generalizability in LLM-based agents. We begin by emphasizing agent generalizability's importance by appealing to stakeholders and clarifying the boundaries of agent generalizability by situating it within a hierarchical domain-task ontology. We then review datasets, evaluation dimensions, and metrics, highlighting their limitations. Next, we categorize methods for improving generalizability into three groups: methods for the backbone LLM, for agent components, and for their interactions. Moreover, we introduce the distinction between generalizable frameworks and generalizable agents and outline how generalizable frameworks can be translated into agent-level generalizability. Finally, we identify critical challenges and future directions, including developing standardized frameworks, variance- and cost-based metrics, and approaches that integrate methodological innovations with architecture-level designs. By synthesizing progress and highlighting opportunities, this survey aims to establish a foundation for principled research on building LLM-based agents that generalize reliably across diverse applications.</description>

      <title>Psychometric Personality Shaping Modulates Capabilities and Safety in Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models increasingly mediate high-stakes interactions, intensifying research on their capabilities and safety. While recent work has shown that LLMs exhibit consistent and measurable synthetic personality traits, little is known about how modulating these traits affects model behavior. We address this gap by investigating how psychometric personality control grounded in the Big Five framework influences AI behavior in the context of capability and safety benchmarks. Our experiments reveal striking effects: for example, reducing conscientiousness leads to significant drops in safety-relevant metrics on benchmarks such as WMDP, TruthfulQA, ETHICS, and Sycophancy as well as reduction in general capabilities as measured by MMLU. These findings highlight personality shaping as a powerful and underexplored axis of model control that interacts with both safety and general competence. We discuss the implications for safety evaluation, alignment strategies, steering model behavior after deployment, and risks associated with possible exploitation of these findings. Our findings motivate a new line of research on personality-sensitive safety evaluations and dynamic behavioral control in LLMs.</description>

      <title>A Unified AI Approach for Continuous Monitoring of Human Health and Diseases from Intensive Care Unit to Home with Physiological Foundation Models (UNIPHY+)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present UNIPHY+, a unified physiological foundation model (physioFM) framework designed to enable continuous human health and diseases monitoring across care settings using ubiquitously obtainable physiological data. We propose novel strategies for incorporating contextual information during pretraining, fine-tuning, and lightweight model personalization via multi-modal learning, feature fusion-tuning, and knowledge distillation. We advocate testing UNIPHY+ with a broad set of use cases from intensive care to ambulatory monitoring in order to demonstrate that UNIPHY+ can empower generalizable, scalable, and personalized physiological AI to support both clinical decision-making and long-term health monitoring.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of Causal Reasoning for Large Language Models in Contextualized Clinical Scenarios of Laboratory Test Interpretation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study evaluates causal reasoning in large language models (LLMs) using 99 clinically grounded laboratory test scenarios aligned with Pearl's Ladder of Causation: association, intervention, and counterfactual reasoning. We examined common laboratory tests such as hemoglobin A1c, creatinine, and vitamin D, and paired them with relevant causal factors including age, gender, obesity, and smoking. Two LLMs - GPT-o1 and Llama-3.2-8b-instruct - were tested, with responses evaluated by four medically trained human experts. GPT-o1 demonstrated stronger discriminative performance (AUROC overall = 0.80 +/- 0.12) compared to Llama-3.2-8b-instruct (0.73 +/- 0.15), with higher scores across association (0.75 vs 0.72), intervention (0.84 vs 0.70), and counterfactual reasoning (0.84 vs 0.69). Sensitivity (0.90 vs 0.84) and specificity (0.93 vs 0.80) were also greater for GPT-o1, with reasoning ratings showing similar trends. Both models performed best on intervention questions and worst on counterfactuals, particularly in altered outcome scenarios. These findings suggest GPT-o1 provides more consistent causal reasoning, but refinement is required before adoption in high-stakes clinical applications.</description>

      <title>VORTEX: Aligning Task Utility and Human Preferences through LLM-Guided Reward Shaping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In social impact optimization, AI decision systems often rely on solvers that optimize well-calibrated mathematical objectives. However, these solvers cannot directly accommodate evolving human preferences, typically expressed in natural language rather than formal constraints. Recent approaches address this by using large language models (LLMs) to generate new reward functions from preference descriptions. While flexible, they risk sacrificing the system's core utility guarantees. In this paper, we propose \texttt{VORTEX}, a language-guided reward shaping framework that preserves established optimization goals while adaptively incorporating human feedback. By formalizing the problem as multi-objective optimization, we use LLMs to iteratively generate shaping rewards based on verbal reinforcement and text-gradient prompt updates. This allows stakeholders to steer decision behavior via natural language without modifying solvers or specifying trade-off weights. We provide theoretical guarantees that \texttt{VORTEX} converges to Pareto-optimal trade-offs between utility and preference satisfaction. Empirical results in real-world allocation tasks demonstrate that \texttt{VORTEX} outperforms baselines in satisfying human-aligned coverage goals while maintaining high task performance. This work introduces a practical and theoretically grounded paradigm for human-AI collaborative optimization guided by natural language.</description>

      <title>Proactive Statistical Process Control Using AI: A Time Series Forecasting Approach for Semiconductor Manufacturing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the manufacturing industry, it is very important to keep machines and processes running smoothly and without unexpected problems. One of the most common tools used to check if everything is working properly is called Statistical Process Control (SPC). Traditional SPC methods work by checking whether recent measurements are within acceptable limits. However, they only react after a problem has already occurred. This can lead to wasted materials, machine downtime, and increased costs. In this paper, we present a smarter way to use SPC. Instead of just reacting to issues after they happen, our system can predict future problems before they occur. We use a machine learning tool called Facebook Prophet, which is designed to work with time-series data (data that changes over time). Prophet looks at past data and forecasts what the next value will be. Then, we use SPC rules to decide if the predicted value is in a Safe zone (no problem), a Warning zone (needs attention), or a Critical zone (may require shutting down the process). We applied this system to real data from a semiconductor manufacturing company. One of the challenges with this data is that the measurements are not taken at regular time intervals. This makes it harder to predict future values accurately. Despite this, our model was able to make strong predictions and correctly classify the risk level of future measurements. The main benefit of our system is that it gives engineers and technicians a chance to act early - before something goes wrong. This helps reduce unexpected failures and improves the overall stability and reliability of the production process. By combining machine learning with traditional SPC, we make quality control more proactive, accurate, and useful for modern industry.</description>

      <title>Domain-Specific Constitutional AI: Enhancing Safety in LLM-Powered Mental Health Chatbots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mental health applications have emerged as a critical area in computational health, driven by rising global rates of mental illness, the integration of AI in psychological care, and the need for scalable solutions in underserved communities. These include therapy chatbots, crisis detection, and wellness platforms handling sensitive data, requiring specialized AI safety beyond general safeguards due to emotional vulnerability, risks like misdiagnosis or symptom exacerbation, and precise management of vulnerable states to avoid severe outcomes such as self-harm or loss of trust. Despite AI safety advances, general safeguards inadequately address mental health-specific challenges, including crisis intervention accuracy to avert escalations, therapeutic guideline adherence to prevent misinformation, scale limitations in resource-constrained settings, and adaptation to nuanced dialogues where generics may introduce biases or miss distress signals. We introduce an approach to apply Constitutional AI training with domain-specific mental health principles for safe, domain-adapted CAI systems in computational mental health applications.</description>

      <title>GPO: Learning from Critical Steps to Improve LLM Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in various domains, showing impressive potential on different tasks. Recently, reasoning LLMs have been proposed to improve the \textit{reasoning} or \textit{thinking} capabilities of LLMs to solve complex problems. Despite the promising results of reasoning LLMs, enhancing the multi-step reasoning capabilities of LLMs still remains a significant challenge. While existing optimization methods have advanced the LLM reasoning capabilities, they often treat reasoning trajectories as a whole, without considering the underlying critical steps within the trajectory. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{G}uided \textbf{P}ivotal \textbf{O}ptimization (GPO), a novel fine-tuning strategy that dives into the reasoning process to enable more effective improvements. GPO first identifies the `critical step' within a reasoning trajectory - a point that the model must carefully proceed to succeed at the problem. We locate the critical step by estimating the advantage function. GPO then resets the policy to the critical step, samples the new rollout and prioritizes the learning process on those rollouts. This focus allows the model to learn more effectively from pivotal moments within the reasoning process to improve the reasoning performance. We demonstrate that GPO is a general strategy that can be integrated with various optimization methods to improve reasoning performance. Besides theoretical analysis, our experiments across challenging reasoning benchmarks show that GPO can consistently and significantly enhance the performance of existing optimization methods, showcasing its effectiveness and generalizability in improving LLM reasoning by concentrating on pivotal moments within the generation process.</description>

      <title>Checking extracted rules in Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate formal verification of extracted rules for Neural Networks under a complexity theoretic point of view. A rule is a global property or a pattern concerning a large portion of the input space of a network. These rules are algorithmically extracted from networks in an effort to better understand their inner way of working. Here, three problems will be in the focus: Does a given set of rules apply to a given network? Is a given set of rules consistent or do the rules contradict themselves? Is a given set of rules exhaustive in the sense that for every input the output is determined? Finding algorithms that extract such rules out of networks has been investigated over the last 30 years, however, to the author's current knowledge, no attempt in verification was made until now. A lot of attempts of extracting rules use heuristics involving randomness and over-approximation, so it might be beneficial to know whether knowledge obtained in that way can actually be trusted.
  We investigate the above questions for neural networks with ReLU-activation as well as for Boolean networks, each for several types of rules. We demonstrate how these problems can be reduced to each other and show that most of them are co-NP-complete.</description>

      <title>SalaMAnder: Shapley-based Mathematical Expression Attribution and Metric for Chain-of-Thought Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting enhances the math reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs) to a large margin. However, the mechanism underlying such improvements remains unexplored. In this paper, we present \textbf{SalaMAnder} (\textbf{S}h\textbf{a}p\textbf{l}ey-b\textbf{a}sed \textbf{M}athematical Expression \textbf{A}ttribution a\textbf{nd} M\textbf{e}t\textbf{r}ic), a theoretically grounded methodology as well as a mathematically rigorous evaluation metric for quantifying component-level contributions in few-shot CoT reasoning. Concretely, we leverage the Shapley value for mathematical expression attribution and develop an efficient stratified sampling algorithm that significantly reduces the computational complexity. Besides, we develop the \textbf{CoSP} (\textbf{C}ardinality \textbf{o}f \textbf{S}hapley \textbf{P}ositives) metric through covariance analysis. Comprehensive validation across popular LLM models and diverse mathematical benchmarks demonstrates that the CoSP metric within our SalaMAnder framework exhibits a robust monotonic correlation with model performance, not only providing theoretical explanations for the empirical success of existing few-shot CoT but also establishing mathematically rigorous principles for prompt construction optimization. Furthermore, we verify the reliability of the explanation, based on which we unify the insights of previous work.</description>

      <title>Zero-Shot Human Mobility Forecasting via Large Language Model with Hierarchical Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human mobility forecasting is important for applications such as transportation planning, urban management, and personalized recommendations. However, existing methods often fail to generalize to unseen users or locations and struggle to capture dynamic intent due to limited labeled data and the complexity of mobility patterns. We propose ZHMF, a framework for zero-shot human mobility forecasting that combines a semantic enhanced retrieval and reflection mechanism with a hierarchical language model based reasoning system. The task is reformulated as a natural language question answering paradigm. Leveraging LLMs semantic understanding of user histories and context, our approach handles previously unseen prediction scenarios. We further introduce a hierarchical reflection mechanism for iterative reasoning and refinement by decomposing forecasting into an activity level planner and a location level selector, enabling collaborative modeling of long term user intentions and short term contextual preferences. Experiments on standard human mobility datasets show that our approach outperforms existing models. Ablation studies reveal the contribution of each module, and case studies illustrate how the method captures user intentions and adapts to diverse contextual scenarios.</description>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at understanding natural language but struggle with explicit commonsense reasoning. A recent trend of research suggests that the combination of LLM with robust symbolic reasoning systems can overcome this problem on story-based question answering tasks. In this setting, existing approaches typically depend on human expertise to manually craft the symbolic component. We argue, however, that this component can also be automatically learned from examples. In this work, we introduce LLM2LAS, a hybrid system that effectively combines the natural language understanding capabilities of LLMs, the rule induction power of the Learning from Answer Sets (LAS) system ILASP, and the formal reasoning strengths of Answer Set Programming (ASP). LLMs are used to extract semantic structures from text, which ILASP then transforms into interpretable logic rules. These rules allow an ASP solver to perform precise and consistent reasoning, enabling correct answers to previously unseen questions. Empirical results outline the strengths and weaknesses of our automatic approach for learning and reasoning in a story-based question answering benchmark.</description>

      <title>FESTA: Functionally Equivalent Sampling for Trust Assessment of Multimodal LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accurate trust assessment of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) generated predictions, which can enable selective prediction and improve user confidence, is challenging due to the diverse multi-modal input paradigms. We propose Functionally Equivalent Sampling for Trust Assessment (FESTA), a multimodal input sampling technique for MLLMs, that generates an uncertainty measure based on the equivalent and complementary input samplings. The proposed task-preserving sampling approach for uncertainty quantification expands the input space to probe the consistency (through equivalent samples) and sensitivity (through complementary samples) of the model. FESTA uses only input-output access of the model (black-box), and does not require ground truth (unsupervised). The experiments are conducted with various off-the-shelf multi-modal LLMs, on both visual and audio reasoning tasks. The proposed FESTA uncertainty estimate achieves significant improvement (33.3% relative improvement for vision-LLMs and 29.6% relative improvement for audio-LLMs) in selective prediction performance, based on area-under-receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUROC) metric in detecting mispredictions. The code implementation is open-sourced.</description>

      <title>NUMINA: A Natural Understanding Benchmark for Multi-dimensional Intelligence and Numerical Reasoning Abilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in 2D multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have significantly improved performance in vision-language tasks. However, extending these capabilities to 3D environments remains a distinct challenge due to the complexity of spatial reasoning. Nevertheless, existing 3D benchmarks often lack fine-grained numerical reasoning task annotations, limiting MLLMs' ability to perform precise spatial measurements and complex numerical reasoning. To address this gap, we introduce NUMINA, the first Natural Understanding benchmark for Multi-dimensional Intelligence and Numerical reasoning Abilities to enhance multimodal indoor perceptual understanding. NUMINA features multi-scale annotations and various question-answer pairs, generated using NUMINA-Flow, an automated annotation pipeline that integrates LLM rewriting and rule-based self-verification. We evaluate the performance of various state-of-the-art LLMs on NUMINA following the Chat-Scene framework, demonstrating that current LLMs struggle with multimodal numerical reasoning, particularly in performing precise computations such as distance and volume estimation, highlighting the need for further advancements in 3D models. The dataset and source codes can be obtained from https://github.com/fengshun124/NUMINA.</description>

      <title>Sycophancy Mitigation Through Reinforcement Learning with Uncertainty-Aware Adaptive Reasoning Trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the remarkable capabilities of large language models, current training paradigms inadvertently foster \textit{sycophancy}, i.e., the tendency of a model to agree with or reinforce user-provided information even when it's factually incorrect. To address this challenge, we introduce \textbf{SMART} (Sycophancy Mitigation through Adaptive Reasoning Trajectories), which reframes sycophancy as a \textit{reasoning optimization problem} rather than an output alignment issue. SMART is a two-stage framework comprising: (1) Uncertainty-Aware Adaptive Monte Carlo Tree Search (UA-MCTS), which dynamically adjusts model exploration based on state-level uncertainty to collect high-quality, diverse reasoning trajectories alongside both stepwise progress and final outcome rewards; and (2) progress-based reinforcement learning, which fine-tunes the model using the collected trajectories and reward signals to reinforce effective reasoning patterns. Through extensive experiments, we show that SMART significantly reduces sycophantic behavior while preserving strong performance on out-of-distribution inputs and maintaining general capabilities. These results underscore the importance of optimizing internal reasoning mechanisms to build more truthful and aligned AI assistants.</description>

      <title>Automated Procedural Analysis via Video-Language Models for AI-assisted Nursing Skills Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consistent high-quality nursing care is essential for patient safety, yet current nursing education depends on subjective, time-intensive instructor feedback in training future nurses, which limits scalability and efficiency in their training, and thus hampers nursing competency when they enter the workforce. In this paper, we introduce a video-language model (VLM) based framework to develop the AI capability of automated procedural assessment and feedback for nursing skills training, with the potential of being integrated into existing training programs. Mimicking human skill acquisition, the framework follows a curriculum-inspired progression, advancing from high-level action recognition, fine-grained subaction decomposition, and ultimately to procedural reasoning. This design supports scalable evaluation by reducing instructor workload while preserving assessment quality. The system provides three core capabilities: 1) diagnosing errors by identifying missing or incorrect subactions in nursing skill instruction videos, 2) generating explainable feedback by clarifying why a step is out of order or omitted, and 3) enabling objective, consistent formative evaluation of procedures. Validation on synthesized videos demonstrates reliable error detection and temporal localization, confirming its potential to handle real-world training variability. By addressing workflow bottlenecks and supporting large-scale, standardized evaluation, this work advances AI applications in nursing education, contributing to stronger workforce development and ultimately safer patient care.</description>

      <title>Prompt-Driven Agentic Video Editing System: Autonomous Comprehension of Long-Form, Story-Driven Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Creators struggle to edit long-form, narrative-rich videos not because of UI complexity, but due to the cognitive demands of searching, storyboarding, and sequencing hours of footage. Existing transcript- or embedding-based methods fall short for creative workflows, as models struggle to track characters, infer motivations, and connect dispersed events. We present a prompt-driven, modular editing system that helps creators restructure multi-hour content through free-form prompts rather than timelines. At its core is a semantic indexing pipeline that builds a global narrative via temporal segmentation, guided memory compression, and cross-granularity fusion, producing interpretable traces of plot, dialogue, emotion, and context. Users receive cinematic edits while optionally refining transparent intermediate outputs. Evaluated on 400+ videos with expert ratings, QA, and preference studies, our system scales prompt-driven editing, preserves narrative coherence, and balances automation with creator control.</description>

      <title>Roundtable Policy: Improving Scientific Reasoning and Narratives through Confidence-Weighted Consensus of LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities not only in language generation but also in advancing scientific discovery. A growing body of work has explored ways to improve their reasoning, from self-consistency and chain-of-thought to multi-agent debate. Inspired by the dynamics of scientific committees and the "Society of Mind," we introduce Roundtable Policy, a complementary inference-time reasoning framework that performs inference through the weighted consensus of multiple LLMs. Our findings indicate that this approach significantly enhances reasoning in complex heterogeneous scientific tasks and improves scientific narratives in terms of creativity, rigor, and logical coherence, while reducing hallucinations that single models are prone to. Our approach emphasizes structured and interpretable consensus rather than opaque convergence, while requiring only black-box access and uniform procedures, making it broadly applicable to multi-LLM reasoning.</description>

      <title>The Principles of Human-like Conscious Machine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Determining whether another system, biological or artificial, possesses phenomenal consciousness has long been a central challenge in consciousness studies. This attribution problem has become especially pressing with the rise of large language models and other advanced AI systems, where debates about "AI consciousness" implicitly rely on some criterion for deciding whether a given system is conscious. In this paper, we propose a substrate-independent, logically rigorous, and counterfeit-resistant sufficiency criterion for phenomenal consciousness. We argue that any machine satisfying this criterion should be regarded as conscious with at least the same level of confidence with which we attribute consciousness to other humans. Building on this criterion, we develop a formal framework and specify a set of operational principles that guide the design of systems capable of meeting the sufficiency condition. We further argue that machines engineered according to this framework can, in principle, realize phenomenal consciousness. As an initial validation, we show that humans themselves can be viewed as machines that satisfy this framework and its principles. If correct, this proposal carries significant implications for philosophy, cognitive science, and artificial intelligence. It offers an explanation for why certain qualia, such as the experience of red, are in principle irreducible to physical description, while simultaneously providing a general reinterpretation of human information processing. Moreover, it suggests a path toward a new paradigm of AI beyond current statistics-based approaches, potentially guiding the construction of genuinely human-like AI.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models as End-to-end Combinatorial Optimization Solvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Combinatorial optimization (CO) problems, central to decision-making scenarios like logistics and manufacturing, are traditionally solved using problem-specific algorithms requiring significant domain expertise. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in automating CO problem solving, existing approaches rely on intermediate steps such as code generation or solver invocation, limiting their generality and accessibility. This paper introduces a novel framework that empowers LLMs to serve as end-to-end CO solvers by directly mapping natural language problem descriptions to solutions. We propose a two-stage training strategy: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) imparts LLMs with solution generation patterns from domain-specific solvers, while a feasibility-and-optimality-aware reinforcement learning (FOARL) process explicitly mitigates constraint violations and refines solution quality. Evaluation across seven NP-hard CO problems shows that our method achieves a high feasibility rate and reduces the average optimality gap to 1.03-8.20% by tuning a 7B-parameter LLM, surpassing both general-purpose LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o), reasoning models (e.g., DeepSeek-R1), and domain-specific heuristics. Our method establishes a unified language-based pipeline for CO without extensive code execution or manual architectural adjustments for different problems, offering a general and language-driven alternative to traditional solver design while maintaining relative feasibility guarantees.</description>

      <title>seqBench: A Tunable Benchmark to Quantify Sequential Reasoning Limits of LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce seqBench, a parametrized benchmark for probing sequential reasoning limits in Large Language Models (LLMs) through precise, multi-dimensional control over several key complexity dimensions. seqBench allows systematic variation of (1) the logical depth, defined as the number of sequential actions required to solve the task; (2) the number of backtracking steps along the optimal path, quantifying how often the agent must revisit prior states to satisfy deferred preconditions (e.g., retrieving a key after encountering a locked door); and (3) the noise ratio, defined as the ratio between supporting and distracting facts about the environment. Our evaluations on state-of-the-art LLMs reveal a universal failure pattern: accuracy collapses exponentially beyond a model-specific logical depth. Unlike existing benchmarks, seqBench's fine-grained control facilitates targeted analyses of these reasoning failures, illuminating universal scaling laws and statistical limits, as detailed in this paper alongside its generation methodology and evaluation metrics. We find that even top-performing models systematically fail on seqBench's structured reasoning tasks despite minimal search complexity, underscoring key limitations in their commonsense reasoning capabilities. Designed for future evolution to keep pace with advancing models, the seqBench datasets are publicly released to spur deeper scientific inquiry into LLM reasoning, aiming to establish a clearer understanding of their true potential and current boundaries for robust real-world application.</description>

      <title>LLMs as Layout Designers: A Spatial Reasoning Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning and planning abilities in textual domains and can effectively follow instructions for complex tasks, their capacity for spatial understanding and reasoning remains limited. Such capabilities, however, are critical for applications like content-aware graphic layout design, which demands precise placement, alignment, and structural organization of multiple elements within constrained visual spaces. To address this gap, we propose LaySPA, a reinforcement learning-based framework that augments LLM agents with explicit spatial reasoning capabilities. LaySPA leverages hybrid reward signals that capture geometric validity, structural fidelity, and visual quality, enabling agents to model inter-element relationships, navigate the canvas, and optimize spatial arrangements. Through iterative self-exploration and adaptive policy optimization, LaySPA produces both interpretable reasoning traces and structured layouts. Experimental results demonstrate that LaySPA generates structurally sound and visually appealing layouts, outperforming larger general-purpose LLMs and achieving results on par with state-of-the-art specialized layout models.</description>

      <title>Audio-Guided Dynamic Modality Fusion with Stereo-Aware Attention for Audio-Visual Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In audio-visual navigation (AVN) tasks, an embodied agent must autonomously localize a sound source in unknown and complex 3D environments based on audio-visual signals. Existing methods often rely on static modality fusion strategies and neglect the spatial cues embedded in stereo audio, leading to performance degradation in cluttered or occluded scenes. To address these issues, we propose an end-to-end reinforcement learning-based AVN framework with two key innovations: (1) a \textbf{S}tereo-Aware \textbf{A}ttention \textbf{M}odule (\textbf{SAM}), which learns and exploits the spatial disparity between left and right audio channels to enhance directional sound perception; and (2) an \textbf{A}udio-\textbf{G}uided \textbf{D}ynamic \textbf{F}usion Module (\textbf{AGDF}), which dynamically adjusts the fusion ratio between visual and auditory features based on audio cues, thereby improving robustness to environmental changes. Extensive experiments are conducted on two realistic 3D scene datasets, Replica and Matterport3D, demonstrating that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches in terms of navigation success rate and path efficiency. Notably, our model achieves over 40\% improvement under audio-only conditions compared to the best-performing baselines. These results highlight the importance of explicitly modeling spatial cues from stereo channels and performing deep multi-modal fusion for robust and efficient audio-visual navigation.</description>

      <title>Quantum Abduction: A New Paradigm for Reasoning under Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Abductive reasoning - the search for plausible explanations - has long been central to human inquiry, from forensics to medicine and scientific discovery. Yet formal approaches in AI have largely reduced abduction to eliminative search: hypotheses are treated as mutually exclusive, evaluated against consistency constraints or probability updates, and pruned until a single "best" explanation remains. This reductionist framing overlooks the way human reasoners sustain multiple explanatory lines in suspension, navigate contradictions, and generate novel syntheses. This paper introduces quantum abduction, a non-classical paradigm that models hypotheses in superposition, allows them to interfere constructively or destructively, and collapses only when coherence with evidence is reached. Grounded in quantum cognition and implemented with modern NLP embeddings and generative AI, the framework supports dynamic synthesis rather than premature elimination. Case studies span historical mysteries (Ludwig II of Bavaria, the "Monster of Florence"), literary demonstrations ("Murder on the Orient Express"), medical diagnosis, and scientific theory change. Across these domains, quantum abduction proves more faithful to the constructive and multifaceted nature of human reasoning, while offering a pathway toward expressive and transparent AI reasoning systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose KAHAN, a knowledge-augmented hierarchical framework that systematically extracts insights from raw tabular data at entity, pairwise, group, and system levels. KAHAN uniquely leverages LLMs as domain experts to drive the analysis. On DataTales financial reporting benchmark, KAHAN outperforms existing approaches by over 20% on narrative quality (GPT-4o), maintains 98.2% factuality, and demonstrates practical utility in human evaluation. Our results reveal that knowledge quality drives model performance through distillation, hierarchical analysis benefits vary with market complexity, and the framework transfers effectively to healthcare domains. The data and code are available at https://github.com/yajingyang/kahan.</description>

      <title>From domain-landmark graph learning to problem-landmark graph generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Landmarks have long played a pivotal role in automated planning, serving as crucial elements for improving the planning algorithms. The main limitation of classical landmark extraction methods is their sensitivity to specific planning tasks. This results in landmarks fully tailored to individual instances, thereby limiting their applicability across other instances of the same planning domain. We propose a novel approach that learns landmark relationships from multiple planning tasks of a planning domain. This leads to the creation of a \textit{probabilistic lifted ordering graph}, as a structure that captures weighted abstractions of relationships between parameterized landmarks. Although these orderings are not 100\% true (they are probabilistic), they can still be very useful in planning. Next, given a new planning task for that domain, we instantiate the relationships from that graph to this particular instance. This instantiation operates in two phases. First, it generates two graphs: the former instantiating information from the initial state and the latter from the goal state. Second, it combines these two graphs into one unified graph by searching equivalences to extract landmark orderings. We evaluate the precision and recallof the information found by our approach over well-known planning domains.</description>

      <title>RALLM-POI: Retrieval-Augmented LLM for Zero-shot Next POI Recommendation with Geographical Reranking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Next point-of-interest (POI) recommendation predicts a user's next destination from historical movements. Traditional models require intensive training, while LLMs offer flexible and generalizable zero-shot solutions but often generate generic or geographically irrelevant results due to missing trajectory and spatial context. To address these issues, we propose RALLM-POI, a framework that couples LLMs with retrieval-augmented generation and self-rectification. We first propose a Historical Trajectory Retriever (HTR) that retrieves relevant past trajectories to serve as contextual references, which are then reranked by a Geographical Distance Reranker (GDR) for prioritizing spatially relevant trajectories. Lastly, an Agentic LLM Rectifier (ALR) is designed to refine outputs through self-reflection. Without additional training, RALLM-POI achieves substantial accuracy gains across three real-world Foursquare datasets, outperforming both conventional and LLM-based baselines. Code is released at https://github.com/LKRcrocodile/RALLM-POI.</description>

      <title>Intention-aware Hierarchical Diffusion Model for Long-term Trajectory Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-term trajectory anomaly detection is a challenging problem due to the diversity and complex spatiotemporal dependencies in trajectory data. Existing trajectory anomaly detection methods fail to simultaneously consider both the high-level intentions of agents as well as the low-level details of the agent's navigation when analysing an agent's trajectories. This limits their ability to capture the full diversity of normal trajectories. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised trajectory anomaly detection method named Intention-aware Hierarchical Diffusion model (IHiD), which detects anomalies through both high-level intent evaluation and low-level sub-trajectory analysis. Our approach leverages Inverse Q Learning as the high-level model to assess whether a selected subgoal aligns with an agent's intention based on predicted Q-values. Meanwhile, a diffusion model serves as the low-level model to generate sub-trajectories conditioned on subgoal information, with anomaly detection based on reconstruction error. By integrating both models, IHiD effectively utilises subgoal transition knowledge and is designed to capture the diverse distribution of normal trajectories. Our experiments show that the proposed method IHiD achieves up to 30.2% improvement in anomaly detection performance in terms of F1 score over state-of-the-art baselines.</description>

      <title>Governing Automated Strategic Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Military and economic strategic competitiveness between nation-states will increasingly be defined by the capability and cost of their frontier artificial intelligence models. Among the first areas of geopolitical advantage granted by such systems will be in automating military intelligence. Much discussion has been devoted to AI systems enabling new military modalities, such as lethal autonomous weapons, or making strategic decisions. However, the ability of a country of "CIA analysts in a data-center" to synthesize diverse data at scale, and its implications, have been underexplored. Multimodal foundation models appear on track to automate strategic analysis previously done by humans. They will be able to fuse today's abundant satellite imagery, phone-location traces, social media records, and written documents into a single queryable system. We conduct a preliminary uplift study to empirically evaluate these capabilities, then propose a taxonomy of the kinds of ground truth questions these systems will answer, present a high-level model of the determinants of this system's AI capabilities, and provide recommendations for nation-states to remain strategically competitive within the new paradigm of automated intelligence.</description>

      <title>MCTS-EP: Empowering Embodied Planning with Online Preference Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces MCTS-EP, an online learning framework that combines large language models (LLM) with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for training embodied agents. MCTS-EP integrates three key components: MCTS-guided exploration for preference data collection, efficient multi-modal reasoning mechanism, and iterative training pipeline based on preference optimization. We theoretically prove that MCTS-EP achieves better performance bounds than conventional on-policy algorithms when the loss function is strongly convex, and demonstrate that it can be formulated as a search-enhanced variant of GAIL. MCTS-EP achieves state-of-the-art performace across serval benchmarks. In ALFWorld, it achieves 92% and 87% success rates for textual and visual tasks. In WebShop, it reaches an average reward of 0.81. MTCS-EP also reduces average interaction steps from from 18.7/19.5 to 10.2/9.9 steps in visual ALFWorld.Code available at: https://github.com/xuhang-2/Embodied-Agent-Planning</description>

      <title>ARE: Scaling Up Agent Environments and Evaluations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Meta Agents Research Environments (ARE), a research platform for scalable creation of environments, integration of synthetic or real applications, and execution of agentic orchestrations. ARE provides simple abstractions to build complex and diverse environments, each with their own rules, tools, content, and verifiers, helping to bridge the gap between model development and real-world deployment. We also propose Gaia2, a benchmark built in ARE and designed to measure general agent capabilities. Beyond search and execution, Gaia2 requires agents to handle ambiguities and noise, adapt to dynamic environments, collaborate with other agents, and operate under temporal constraints. Unlike prior benchmarks, Gaia2 runs asynchronously, surfacing new failure modes that are invisible in static settings. Our experiments show that no system dominates across the intelligence spectrum: stronger reasoning often comes at the cost of efficiency, and budget scaling curves plateau, highlighting the need for new architectures and adaptive compute strategies. Perhaps more importantly, ARE abstractions enable continuous extension of Gaia2 to other environments, empowering the community to rapidly create new benchmarks tailored to their domains. In AI's second half, progress increasingly depends on defining meaningful tasks and robust evaluations to drive frontier capabilities forward.</description>

      <title>Shall We Play a Game? Language Models for Open-ended Wargames</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wargames are multi-faceted, multi-player depictions of conflict in which participants' decisions influence future events. Wargames are often used to explore the strategic implications of decision-making. However, it also encompasses entertainment-oriented simulations, ranging from _Chess_ to tabletop role-playing games like _Dungeons &amp; Dragons_ (D&amp;D). On the more open-ended side of the spectrum of wargames, players use natural language to convey their moves, and adjudicators propose outcomes. Language Models (LMs) are increasingly being considered for how they can provide insights into real-world, consequential decisions. We conduct a scoping literature review of a curated selection of 100 recent works on AI in wargames, from which we construct an ontology of wargames in terms of the creativity afforded to either the players or adjudicators. Focusing on the space of wargames with the most open-endedness for players and adjudicators, we distill a set of considerations for when and how to use LMs in different application areas. We also present a set of safety considerations, best practices for deploying LMs in open-ended wargames, and conclude with a set of high-impact open research challenges.</description>

      <title>MoEs Are Stronger than You Think: Hyper-Parallel Inference Scaling with RoE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generation quality of large language models (LLMs) is often improved by utilizing inference-time sequence-level scaling methods (e.g., Chain-of-Thought). We introduce hyper-parallel scaling, a complementary framework that improves prediction quality at the token level. Hyper-parallel scaling computes and aggregates multiple output proposals for a single token from the model. We implement this concept in Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, which we refer to as Roster of Experts (RoE). RoE is a training-free inference algorithm that turns a single MoE into a dynamic ensemble of MoEs. RoE injects controlled stochasticity into the expert routing mechanism, enabling it to sample multiple diverse experts for each token and aggregate their outputs for a more accurate final prediction.To overcome the computational cost, we introduce an efficient batching strategy and a specialized KV-caching mechanism that minimizes compute and memory overhead. For example, RoE enables a 7B MoE model to match the performance of a 10.5B MoE model while using 30% less compute for inference. These gains are achieved without any fine-tuning of model parameters.</description>

      <title>Can Agents Judge Systematic Reviews Like Humans? Evaluating SLRs with LLM-based Multi-Agent System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Systematic Literature Reviews (SLRs) are foundational to evidence-based research but remain labor-intensive and prone to inconsistency across disciplines. We present an LLM-based SLR evaluation copilot built on a Multi-Agent System (MAS) architecture to assist researchers in assessing the overall quality of the systematic literature reviews. The system automates protocol validation, methodological assessment, and topic relevance checks using a scholarly database. Unlike conventional single-agent methods, our design integrates a specialized agentic approach aligned with PRISMA guidelines to support more structured and interpretable evaluations. We conducted an initial study on five published SLRs from diverse domains, comparing system outputs to expert-annotated PRISMA scores, and observed 84% agreement. While early results are promising, this work represents a first step toward scalable and accurate NLP-driven systems for interdisciplinary workflows and reveals their capacity for rigorous, domain-agnostic knowledge aggregation to streamline the review process.</description>

      <title>Mind the Gap: Comparing Model- vs Agentic-Level Red Teaming with Action-Graph Observability on GPT-OSS-20B</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the industry increasingly adopts agentic AI systems, understanding their unique vulnerabilities becomes critical. Prior research suggests that security flaws at the model level do not fully capture the risks present in agentic deployments, where models interact with tools and external environments. This paper investigates this gap by conducting a comparative red teaming analysis of GPT-OSS-20B, a 20-billion parameter open-source model. Using our observability framework AgentSeer to deconstruct agentic systems into granular actions and components, we apply iterative red teaming attacks with harmful objectives from HarmBench at two distinct levels: the standalone model and the model operating within an agentic loop. Our evaluation reveals fundamental differences between model level and agentic level vulnerability profiles. Critically, we discover the existence of agentic-only vulnerabilities, attack vectors that emerge exclusively within agentic execution contexts while remaining inert against standalone models. Agentic level iterative attacks successfully compromise objectives that completely failed at the model level, with tool-calling contexts showing 24\% higher vulnerability than non-tool contexts. Conversely, certain model-specific exploits work exclusively at the model level and fail when transferred to agentic contexts, demonstrating that standalone model vulnerabilities do not always generalize to deployed systems.</description>

      <title>CogAtom: From Cognitive Atoms to Olympiad-level Mathematical Reasoning in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mathematical reasoning poses significant challenges for Large Language Models (LLMs) due to its demand for multi-step reasoning and abstract conceptual integration. While recent test-time scaling techniques rely heavily on high-quality, challenging problems, the scarcity of Olympiad-level math problems remains a bottleneck. We introduce CogAtom, a novel cognitive atom-based framework for synthesizing mathematically rigorous and cognitively diverse problems. Unlike prior approaches, CogAtom models problem construction as a process of selecting and recombining fundamental reasoning units, cognitive atoms, extracted from human-authored solutions. A diversity-promoting random walk algorithm enables exploration of the cognitive atom space, while a constraint-based recombination mechanism ensures logical soundness and structural validity. The combinatorial nature of the graph structure provides a near-infinite space of reasoning paths, and the walk algorithm systematically explores this space to achieve large-scale synthesis of high-quality problems; meanwhile, by controlling the number of cognitive atoms, we can precisely adjust problem difficulty, ensuring diversity, scalability, and controllability of the generated problems. Experimental results demonstrate that CogAtom outperforms existing methods in accuracy, reasoning depth, and diversity, generating problems that closely match the difficulty of AIME while exceeding it in structural variation. Our work offers a cognitively grounded pathway toward scalable, high-quality math problem generation.Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/Icarus-1111/CogAtom.</description>

      <title>LLaVul: A Multimodal LLM for Interpretable Vulnerability Reasoning about Source Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Increasing complexity in software systems places a growing demand on reasoning tools that unlock vulnerabilities manifest in source code. Many current approaches focus on vulnerability analysis as a classifying task, oversimplifying the nuanced and context-dependent real-world scenarios. Even though current code large language models (LLMs) excel in code understanding, they often pay little attention to security-specific reasoning. We propose LLaVul, a multimodal LLM tailored to provide fine-grained reasoning about code through question-answering (QA). Our model is trained to integrate paired code and natural queries into a unified space, enhancing reasoning and context-dependent insights about code vulnerability. To evaluate our model performance, we construct a curated dataset of real-world vulnerabilities paired with security-focused questions and answers. Our model outperforms state-of-the-art general-purpose and code LLMs in the QA and detection tasks. We further explain decision-making by conducting qualitative analysis to highlight capabilities and limitations. By integrating code and QA, LLaVul enables more interpretable and security-focused code understanding.</description>

      <title>Medical AI Consensus: A Multi-Agent Framework for Radiology Report Generation and Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automating radiology report generation poses a dual challenge: building clinically reliable systems and designing rigorous evaluation protocols. We introduce a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that serves as both a benchmark and evaluation environment for multimodal clinical reasoning in the radiology ecosystem. The proposed framework integrates large language models (LLMs) and large vision models (LVMs) within a modular architecture composed of ten specialized agents responsible for image analysis, feature extraction, report generation, review, and evaluation. This design enables fine-grained assessment at both the agent level (e.g., detection and segmentation accuracy) and the consensus level (e.g., report quality and clinical relevance). We demonstrate an implementation using chatGPT-4o on public radiology datasets, where LLMs act as evaluators alongside medical radiologist feedback. By aligning evaluation protocols with the LLM development lifecycle, including pretraining, finetuning, alignment, and deployment, the proposed benchmark establishes a path toward trustworthy deviance-based radiology report generation.</description>

      <title>Multi-Scenario Highway Lane-Change Intention Prediction: A Physics-Informed AI Framework for Three-Class Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lane-change maneuvers are a leading cause of highway accidents, underscoring the need for accurate intention prediction to improve the safety and decision-making of autonomous driving systems. While prior studies using machine learning and deep learning methods (e.g., SVM, CNN, LSTM, Transformers) have shown promise, most approaches remain limited by binary classification, lack of scenario diversity, and degraded performance under longer prediction horizons. In this study, we propose a physics-informed AI framework that explicitly integrates vehicle kinematics, interaction feasibility, and traffic-safety metrics (e.g., distance headway, time headway, time-to-collision, closing gap time) into the learning process. lane-change prediction is formulated as a three-class problem that distinguishes left change, right change, and no change, and is evaluated across both straight highway segments (highD) and complex ramp scenarios (exiD). By integrating vehicle kinematics with interaction features, our machine learning models, particularly LightGBM, achieve state-of-the-art accuracy and strong generalization. Results show up to 99.8% accuracy and 93.6% macro F1 on highD, and 96.1% accuracy and 88.7% macro F1 on exiD at a 1-second horizon, outperforming a two-layer stacked LSTM baseline. These findings demonstrate the practical advantages of a physics-informed and feature-rich machine learning framework for real-time lane-change intention prediction in autonomous driving systems.</description>

      <title>Correlation or Causation: Analyzing the Causal Structures of LLM and LRM Reasoning Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LLMs suffer from critical reasoning issues such as unfaithfulness, bias, and inconsistency, since they lack robust causal underpinnings and may rely on superficial correlations rather than genuine understanding. Successive LRMs have emerged as a promising alternative, leveraging advanced training techniques such as reinforcement learning (RL) and distillation to improve task accuracy. However, the impact of these training methods on causality remains largely unexplored. In this study, we conduct a systematic causal analysis on LLMs and LRMs, examining structural causal models (SCMs) of four key variables: problem instruction (Z), thinking process (T), reasoning steps (X), and answer (Y). Our findings reveal that RLVR-trained LRMs exhibit enhanced causal reasoning capabilities, aligning more closely with ideal causal structures, while LLMs and distilled LRMs fail to address causality-related deficiencies. Our further investigation indicates that RLVR reduces spurious correlations and strengthens genuine causal patterns, thereby mitigating unfaithfulness and bias. In addition, our inspection on the dynamics of the RLVR training process observes a high correlation between reduced spurious features and improved causal structures, where the causal relationships consistently improve in the training process. This study contributes to the understanding of causality in reasoning models, highlights the critical role of RLVR in enhancing causal reasoning, and provides insights for designing future AI systems with stronger causal foundations.

      <title>Program Synthesis via Test-Time Transduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce transductive program synthesis, a new formulation of the program synthesis task that explicitly leverages test inputs during synthesis. While prior approaches to program synthesis--whether based on natural language descriptions or input-output examples--typically aim to generalize from training examples, they often struggle with robustness, especially in real-world settings where training examples are limited and test inputs involve various edge cases. To address this, we propose a novel framework that improves robustness by treating synthesis as an active learning over a finite hypothesis class defined by programs' outputs. We use an LLM to predict outputs for selected test inputs and eliminate inconsistent hypotheses, where the inputs are chosen via a greedy maximin algorithm to minimize the number of LLM queries required. We evaluate our approach on two real-world datasets: Playgol, a string transformation benchmark, and MBPP+, a Python code generation benchmark. We demonstrate that our method significantly improves program synthesis in both accuracy and efficiency. We release our code at https://github.com/klee972/SYNTRA.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Multimodal Large Language Models with Daily Composite Tasks in Home Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A key feature differentiating artificial general intelligence (AGI) from traditional AI is that AGI can perform composite tasks that require a wide range of capabilities. Although embodied agents powered by multimodal large language models (MLLMs) offer rich perceptual and interactive capabilities, it remains largely unexplored whether they can solve composite tasks. In the current work, we designed a set of composite tasks inspired by common daily activities observed in early childhood development. Within a dynamic and simulated home environment, these tasks span three core domains: object understanding, spatial intelligence, and social activity. We evaluated 17 leading proprietary and open-source MLLMs on these tasks. The results consistently showed poor performance across all three domains, indicating a substantial gap between current capabilities and general intelligence requirements. Together, our tasks offer a preliminary framework for evaluating the general capabilities of embodied agents, marking an early but significant step toward the development of embodied MLLMs and their real-world deployment.</description>

      <title>SPICED: A Synaptic Homeostasis-Inspired Framework for Unsupervised Continual EEG Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human brain achieves dynamic stability-plasticity balance through synaptic homeostasis. Inspired by this biological principle, we propose SPICED: a neuromorphic framework that integrates the synaptic homeostasis mechanism for unsupervised continual EEG decoding, particularly addressing practical scenarios where new individuals with inter-individual variability emerge continually. SPICED comprises a novel synaptic network that enables dynamic expansion during continual adaptation through three bio-inspired neural mechanisms: (1) critical memory reactivation; (2) synaptic consolidation and (3) synaptic renormalization. The interplay within synaptic homeostasis dynamically strengthens task-discriminative memory traces and weakens detrimental memories. By integrating these mechanisms with continual learning system, SPICED preferentially replays task-discriminative memory traces that exhibit strong associations with newly emerging individuals, thereby achieving robust adaptations. Meanwhile, SPICED effectively mitigates catastrophic forgetting by suppressing the replay prioritization of detrimental memories during long-term continual learning. Validated on three EEG datasets, SPICED show its effectiveness.</description>

      <title>AI Pangaea: Unifying Intelligence Islands for Adapting Myriad Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pursuit of artificial general intelligence continuously demands generalization in one model across myriad tasks, even those not seen before. However, current AI models are isolated from each other for being limited to specific tasks, now first defined as Intelligence Islands. To unify Intelligence Islands into one, we propose Pangaea, the first AI supercontinent akin to the geological Pangaea. Pangaea encodes any data into a unified format and accumulates universal knowledge through pre-training on 296 datasets across diverse modalities. Eventually, it demonstrates remarkable generalization across 45 general tasks and 15 scientific tasks encompassing a wide range of scientific subjects. By investigating Pangaea deeper, the scaling effect of modality is revealed, quantifying the universal knowledge accumulation across modalities as the cumulative distribution function of a geometric distribution. On the whole, Pangaea shows strong potential to handle myriad tasks, indicating a new direction toward artificial general intelligence.</description>

      <title>A Multimodal Conversational Assistant for the Characterization of Agricultural Plots from Geospatial Open Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing availability of open Earth Observation (EO) and agricultural datasets holds great potential for supporting sustainable land management. However, their high technical entry barrier limits accessibility for non-expert users. This study presents an open-source conversational assistant that integrates multimodal retrieval and large language models (LLMs) to enable natural language interaction with heterogeneous agricultural and geospatial data. The proposed architecture combines orthophotos, Sentinel-2 vegetation indices, and user-provided documents through retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), allowing the system to flexibly determine whether to rely on multimodal evidence, textual knowledge, or both in formulating an answer. To assess response quality, we adopt an LLM-as-a-judge methodology using Qwen3-32B in a zero-shot, unsupervised setting, applying direct scoring in a multi-dimensional quantitative evaluation framework. Preliminary results show that the system is capable of generating clear, relevant, and context-aware responses to agricultural queries, while remaining reproducible and scalable across geographic regions. The primary contributions of this work include an architecture for fusing multimodal EO and textual knowledge sources, a demonstration of lowering the barrier to access specialized agricultural information through natural language interaction, and an open and reproducible design.</description>

      <title>Is It Certainly a Deepfake? Reliability Analysis in Detection &amp; Generation Ecosystem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As generative models are advancing in quality and quantity for creating synthetic content, deepfakes begin to cause online mistrust. Deepfake detectors are proposed to counter this effect, however, misuse of detectors claiming fake content as real or vice versa further fuels this misinformation problem. We present the first comprehensive uncertainty analysis of deepfake detectors, systematically investigating how generative artifacts influence prediction confidence. As reflected in detectors' responses, deepfake generators also contribute to this uncertainty as their generative residues vary, so we cross the uncertainty analysis of deepfake detectors and generators. Based on our observations, the uncertainty manifold holds enough consistent information to leverage uncertainty for deepfake source detection. Our approach leverages Bayesian Neural Networks and Monte Carlo dropout to quantify both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties across diverse detector architectures. We evaluate uncertainty on two datasets with nine generators, with four blind and two biological detectors, compare different uncertainty methods, explore region- and pixel-based uncertainty, and conduct ablation studies. We conduct and analyze binary real/fake, multi-class real/fake, source detection, and leave-one-out experiments between the generator/detector combinations to share their generalization capability, model calibration, uncertainty, and robustness against adversarial attacks. We further introduce uncertainty maps that localize prediction confidence at the pixel level, revealing distinct patterns correlated with generator-specific artifacts. Our analysis provides critical insights for deploying reliable deepfake detection systems and establishes uncertainty quantification as a fundamental requirement for trustworthy synthetic media detection.</description>

      <title>MontePrep: Monte-Carlo-Driven Automatic Data Preparation without Target Data Instances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In commercial systems, a pervasive requirement for automatic data preparation (ADP) is to transfer relational data from disparate sources to targets with standardized schema specifications. Previous methods rely on labor-intensive supervision signals or target table data access permissions, limiting their usage in real-world scenarios. To tackle these challenges, we propose an effective end-to-end ADP framework MontePrep, which enables training-free pipeline synthesis with zero target-instance requirements. MontePrep is formulated as an open-source large language model (LLM) powered tree-structured search problem. It consists of three pivot components, i.e., a data preparation action sandbox (DPAS), a fundamental pipeline generator (FPG), and an execution-aware pipeline optimizer (EPO). We first introduce DPAS, a lightweight action sandbox, to navigate the search-based pipeline generation. The design of DPAS circumvents exploration of infeasible pipelines. Then, we present FPG to build executable DP pipelines incrementally, which explores the predefined action sandbox by the LLM-powered Monte Carlo Tree Search. Furthermore, we propose EPO, which invokes pipeline execution results from sources to targets to evaluate the reliability of the generated pipelines in FPG. In this way, unreasonable pipelines are eliminated, thus facilitating the search process from both efficiency and effectiveness perspectives. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of MontePrep with significant improvement against five state-of-the-art competitors.</description>

      <title>LIMI: Less is More for Agency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define Agency as the emergent capacity of AI systems to function as autonomous agents actively discovering problems, formulating hypotheses, and executing solutions through self-directed engagement with environments and tools. This fundamental capability marks the dawn of the Age of AI Agency, driven by a critical industry shift: the urgent need for AI systems that don't just think, but work. While current AI excels at reasoning and generating responses, industries demand autonomous agents that can execute tasks, operate tools, and drive real-world outcomes. As agentic intelligence becomes the defining characteristic separating cognitive systems from productive workers, efficiently cultivating machine autonomy becomes paramount. Current approaches assume that more data yields better agency, following traditional scaling laws from language modeling. We fundamentally challenge this paradigm. LIMI (Less Is More for Intelligent Agency) demonstrates that agency follows radically different development principles. Through strategic focus on collaborative software development and scientific research workflows, we show that sophisticated agentic intelligence can emerge from minimal but strategically curated demonstrations of autonomous behavior. Using only 78 carefully designed training samples, LIMI achieves 73.5% on comprehensive agency benchmarks, dramatically outperforming state-of-the-art models: Kimi-K2-Instruct (24.1%), DeepSeek-V3.1 (11.9%), Qwen3-235B-A22B-Instruct (27.5%), and GLM-4.5 (45.1%). Most strikingly, LIMI demonstrates 53.7% improvement over models trained on 10,000 samples-achieving superior agentic intelligence with 128 times fewer samples. Our findings establish the Agency Efficiency Principle: machine autonomy emerges not from data abundance but from strategic curation of high-quality agentic demonstrations.</description>

      <title>Table2LaTeX-RL: High-Fidelity LaTeX Code Generation from Table Images via Reinforced Multimodal Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we address the task of table image to LaTeX code generation, with the goal of automating the reconstruction of high-quality, publication-ready tables from visual inputs. A central challenge of this task lies in accurately handling complex tables -- those with large sizes, deeply nested structures, and semantically rich or irregular cell content -- where existing methods often fail. We begin with a comprehensive analysis, identifying key challenges and highlighting the limitations of current evaluation protocols. To overcome these issues, we propose a reinforced multimodal large language model (MLLM) framework, where a pre-trained MLLM is fine-tuned on a large-scale table-to-LaTeX dataset. To further improve generation quality, we introduce a dual-reward reinforcement learning strategy based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Unlike standard approaches that optimize purely over text outputs, our method incorporates both a structure-level reward on LaTeX code and a visual fidelity reward computed from rendered outputs, enabling direct optimization of the visual output quality. We adopt a hybrid evaluation protocol combining TEDS-Structure and CW-SSIM, and show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly on structurally complex tables, demonstrating the effectiveness and robustness of our approach.</description>

      <title>EngiBench: A Benchmark for Evaluating Large Language Models on Engineering Problem Solving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong performance on mathematical reasoning under well-posed conditions. However, real-world engineering problems require more than mathematical symbolic computation -- they need to deal with uncertainty, context, and open-ended scenarios. Existing benchmarks fail to capture these complexities. We introduce EngiBench, a hierarchical benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs on solving engineering problems. It spans three levels of increasing difficulty (foundational knowledge retrieval, multi-step contextual reasoning, and open-ended modeling) and covers diverse engineering subfields. To facilitate a deeper understanding of model performance, we systematically rewrite each problem into three controlled variants (perturbed, knowledge-enhanced, and math abstraction), enabling us to separately evaluate the model's robustness, domain-specific knowledge, and mathematical reasoning abilities. Experiment results reveal a clear performance gap across levels: models struggle more as tasks get harder, perform worse when problems are slightly changed, and fall far behind human experts on the high-level engineering tasks. These findings reveal that current LLMs still lack the high-level reasoning needed for real-world engineering, highlighting the need for future models with deeper and more reliable problem-solving capabilities.

      <title>Virtual Arc Consistency for Linear Constraints inCost Function Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Constraint Programming, solving discrete minimization problems with hard and soft constraints can be done either using (i) soft global constraints, (ii) a reformulation into a linear program, or (iii) a reformulation into local cost functions. Approach (i) benefits from a vast catalog of constraints. Each soft constraint propagator communicates with other soft constraints only through the variable domains, resulting in weak lower bounds. Conversely, the approach (ii) provides a global view with strong bounds, but the size of the reformulation can be problematic. We focus on approach (iii) in which soft arc consistency (SAC) algorithms produce bounds of intermediate quality. Recently, the introduction of linear constraints as local cost functions increases their modeling expressiveness. We adapt an existing SAC algorithm to handle linear constraints. We show that our algorithm significantly improves the lower bounds compared to the original algorithm on several benchmarks, reducing solving time in some cases.</description>

      <title>DA-Mamba: Dialogue-aware selective state-space model for multimodal engagement estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human engagement estimation in conversational scenarios is essential for applications such as adaptive tutoring, remote healthcare assessment, and socially aware human--computer interaction. Engagement is a dynamic, multimodal signal conveyed by facial expressions, speech, gestures, and behavioral cues over time. In this work we introduce DA-Mamba, a dialogue-aware multimodal architecture that replaces attention-heavy dialogue encoders with Mamba-based selective state-space processing to achieve linear time and memory complexity while retaining expressive cross-modal reasoning. We design a Mamba dialogue-aware selective state-space model composed of three core modules: a Dialogue-Aware Encoder, and two Mamba-based fusion mechanisms: Modality-Group Fusion and Partner-Group Fusion, these modules achieve expressive dialogue understanding. Extensive experiments on three standard benchmarks (NoXi, NoXi-Add, and MPIIGI) show that DA-Mamba surpasses prior state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in concordance correlation coefficient (CCC), while reducing training time and peak memory; these gains enable processing much longer sequences and facilitate real-time deployment in resource-constrained, multi-party conversational settings.

      <title>Efficient &amp; Correct Predictive Equivalence for Decision Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Rashomon set of decision trees (DTs) finds importance uses. Recent work showed that DTs computing the same classification function, i.e. predictive equivalent DTs, can represent a significant fraction of the Rashomon set. Such redundancy is undesirable. For example, feature importance based on the Rashomon set becomes inaccurate due the existence of predictive equivalent DTs, i.e. DTs with the same prediction for every possible input. In recent work, McTavish et al. proposed solutions for several computational problems related with DTs, including that of deciding predictive equivalent DTs. This approach, which this paper refers to as MBDSR, consists of applying the well-known method of Quine-McCluskey (QM) for obtaining minimum-size DNF (disjunctive normal form) representations of DTs, which are then used for comparing DTs for predictive equivalence. Furthermore, the minimum-size DNF representation was also applied to computing explanations for the predictions made by DTs, and to finding predictions in the presence of missing data. However, the problem of formula minimization is hard for the second level of the polynomial hierarchy, and the QM method may exhibit worst-case exponential running time and space. This paper first demonstrates that there exist decision trees that trigger the worst-case exponential running time and space of the QM method. Second, the paper shows that the MBDSR approach can produce incorrect results for the problem of deciding predictive equivalence. Third, the paper shows that any of the problems to which the minimum-size DNF representation has been applied to can in fact be solved in polynomial time, in the size of the DT. The experiments confirm that, for DTs for which the the worst-case of the QM method is triggered, the algorithms proposed in this paper are orders of magnitude faster than the ones proposed by McTavish et al.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Strategy-Selection Bias in Reasoning for More Effective Test-Time Scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS) has been shown to improve the performance of large language models (LLMs) by sampling and aggregating diverse reasoning paths. However, existing research has overlooked a critical issue: selection bias of reasoning strategies during scaling. Specifically, when generating reasoning processes, LLMs tend to follow certain strategies (e.g., algebraic solutions for math problems) while neglecting other valid alternatives (e.g., geometric solutions), resulting in insufficient exploration of the solution space. To further understand the impact of this bias, we present a theoretical analysis that reveals when it undermines the effectiveness of test-time scaling. Motivated by this theoretical insight, we introduce TTS-Uniform, a framework designed to mitigate the selection bias of reasoning strategies. It (i) identifies potential strategies, (ii) uniformly allocates the sampling budget across them, and (iii) filters out unstable strategies prior to aggregation.

      <title>MEF: A Systematic Evaluation Framework for Text-to-Image Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rapid advances in text-to-image (T2I) generation have raised higher requirements for evaluation methodologies. Existing benchmarks center on objective capabilities and dimensions, but lack an application-scenario perspective, limiting external validity. Moreover, current evaluations typically rely on either ELO for overall ranking or MOS for dimension-specific scoring, yet both methods have inherent shortcomings and limited interpretability. Therefore, we introduce the Magic Evaluation Framework (MEF), a systematic and practical approach for evaluating T2I models. First, we propose a structured taxonomy encompassing user scenarios, elements, element compositions, and text expression forms to construct the Magic-Bench-377, which supports label-level assessment and ensures a balanced coverage of both user scenarios and capabilities. On this basis, we combine ELO and dimension-specific MOS to generate model rankings and fine-grained assessments respectively. This joint evaluation method further enables us to quantitatively analyze the contribution of each dimension to user satisfaction using multivariate logistic regression. By applying MEF to current T2I models, we obtain a leaderboard and key characteristics of the leading models. We release our evaluation framework and make Magic-Bench-377 fully open-source to advance research in the evaluation of visual generative models.</description>

      <title>Orcust: Stepwise-Feedback Reinforcement Learning for GUI Agent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in GUI agents have achieved remarkable grounding and action-prediction performance, yet existing models struggle with unreliable reward signals and limited online trajectory generation. In this paper, we introduce Orcust, a framework that integrates Principle-Constrained Reward Modeling (PCRM) and Online VM-Grounded Trajectory Construction (OVTC) to enhance reasoning reliability and data efficiency in interactive GUI tasks. We leverages environment-verifiable and LLM-derived principle to enforce interpretable reward signals that constrain long chain-of-thought reasoning and rule-based feedback. OVTC spins up instrumented virtual machines to autonomously collect structured GUI interaction trajectories with explicit procedural and structural objectives, enabling the training of a stepwise reward model that robustly captures human preferences and adheres to task-specific constraints. Extensive experiments on standard GUI benchmarks covering perceptual grounding, foundational operations, and end-to-end task execution reveal that Orcust achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving by 22.2\% on ScreenSpot and 23.9\% on ScreenSpot-Pro over the base model (i.e. Qwen2.5-VL-7B). The results demonstrate Orcust's effectiveness in enhancing the reasoning, adaptability and scalability of GUI agents across various environments and task complexities.</description>

      <title>"I think this is fair'': Uncovering the Complexities of Stakeholder Decision-Making in AI Fairness Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assessing fairness in artificial intelligence (AI) typically involves AI experts who select protected features, fairness metrics, and set fairness thresholds. However, little is known about how stakeholders, particularly those affected by AI outcomes but lacking AI expertise, assess fairness. To address this gap, we conducted a qualitative study with 30 stakeholders without AI expertise, representing potential decision subjects in a credit rating scenario, to examine how they assess fairness when placed in the role of deciding on features with priority, metrics, and thresholds. We reveal that stakeholders' fairness decisions are more complex than typical AI expert practices: they considered features far beyond legally protected features, tailored metrics for specific contexts, set diverse yet stricter fairness thresholds, and even preferred designing customized fairness. Our results extend the understanding of how stakeholders can meaningfully contribute to AI fairness governance and mitigation, underscoring the importance of incorporating stakeholders' nuanced fairness judgments.</description>

      <title>On the Variational Costs of Changing Our Minds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The human mind is capable of extraordinary achievements, yet it often appears to work against itself. It actively defends its cherished beliefs even in the face of contradictory evidence, conveniently interprets information to conform to desired narratives, and selectively searches for or avoids information to suit its various purposes. Despite these behaviours deviating from common normative standards for belief updating, we argue that such 'biases' are not inherently cognitive flaws, but rather an adaptive response to the significant pragmatic and cognitive costs associated with revising one's beliefs. This paper introduces a formal framework that aims to model the influence of these costs on our belief updating mechanisms.
  We treat belief updating as a motivated variational decision, where agents weigh the perceived 'utility' of a belief against the informational cost required to adopt a new belief state, quantified by the Kullback-Leibler divergence from the prior to the variational posterior. We perform computational experiments to demonstrate that simple instantiations of this resource-rational model can be used to qualitatively emulate commonplace human behaviours, including confirmation bias and attitude polarisation. In doing so, we suggest that this framework makes steps toward a more holistic account of the motivated Bayesian mechanics of belief change and provides practical insights for predicting, compensating for, and correcting deviations from desired belief updating processes.</description>

      <title>The STAR-XAI Protocol: An Interactive Framework for Inducing Second-Order Agency in AI Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) exhibit significant limitations in reliability and transparency, often showing a collapse in reasoning capabilities when faced with high-complexity, long-horizon tasks. This "illusion of thinking" is frequently an artifact of non-agentic, black-box evaluation paradigms that fail to cultivate robust problem-solving processes. In response, we introduce The STAR-XAI Protocol (Socratic, Transparent, Agentic, Reasoning - for eXplainable Artificial Intelligence), a novel methodology for training and operating verifiably reliable AI agents. Our method reframes the human-AI interaction as a structured, Socratic dialogue, governed by an explicit and evolving rulebook, the Consciousness Transfer Package (CTP). Through an interactive Gameplay Cycle that enforces ante-hoc strategic justification and a state-locking Checksum that prevents error accumulation, the protocol transforms a powerful but opaque LRM into a disciplined "Clear Box" agent. We demonstrate the efficacy of this method through an exhaustive 25-move case study in the complex strategic game "Caps i Caps". The agent not only solved the high-complexity puzzle but also demonstrated Second-Order Agency, identifying flaws in its own supervisor-approved plans and adapting its core integrity protocols mid-task. The STAR-XAI Protocol offers a practical pathway to creating AI agents that are not just high-performing, but also transparent, auditable, and trustworthy by design.</description>

      <title>Improving Large Language Models Function Calling and Interpretability via Guided-Structured Templates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong reasoning and tool-use capabilities, yet they often fail in real-world tool-interactions due to incorrect parameterization, poor tool selection, or misinterpretation of user intent. These issues often stem from an incomplete understanding of user goals and inadequate comprehension of tool documentation. While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has proven effective for enhancing reasoning in general contexts, our analysis reveals that free-form CoT is insufficient and sometimes counterproductive for structured function-calling tasks. To address this, we introduce a curriculum-inspired framework that leverages structured reasoning templates to guide LLMs through more deliberate step-by-step instructions for generating function callings. Experimental results show that our method reduces tool-use errors, achieving 3-12% relative improvements over strong baselines across diverse model series and approaches. Moreover, our framework enhances the robustness, interpretability, and transparency of tool-using agents, advancing the development of more reliable AI assistants for real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Reasoning Core: A Scalable RL Environment for LLM Symbolic Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Reasoning Core, a new scalable environment for Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), designed to advance foundational symbolic reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs). Unlike existing benchmarks that focus on games or isolated puzzles, Reasoning Core procedurally generates problems across core formal domains, including PDDL planning, first-order logic, context-free grammar parsing, causal reasoning, and system equation solving. The environment is built on key design principles of high-generality problem distributions, verification via external tools, and continuous difficulty control, which together provide a virtually infinite supply of novel training instances. Initial zero-shot evaluations with frontier LLMs confirm the difficulty of Reasoning Core's tasks, positioning it as a promising resource to improve the reasoning capabilities of future models.</description>

      <title>Breast Cancer Classification Using Gradient Boosting Algorithms Focusing on Reducing the False Negative and SHAP for Explainability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09548v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cancer is one of the diseases that kill the most women in the world, with breast cancer being responsible for the highest number of cancer cases and consequently deaths. However, it can be prevented by early detection and, consequently, early treatment. Any development for detection or perdition this kind of cancer is important for a better healthy life. Many studies focus on a model with high accuracy in cancer prediction, but sometimes accuracy alone may not always be a reliable metric. This study implies an investigative approach to studying the performance of different machine learning algorithms based on boosting to predict breast cancer focusing on the recall metric. Boosting machine learning algorithms has been proven to be an effective tool for detecting medical diseases. The dataset of the University of California, Irvine (UCI) repository has been utilized to train and test the model classifier that contains their attributes. The main objective of this study is to use state-of-the-art boosting algorithms such as AdaBoost, XGBoost, CatBoost and LightGBM to predict and diagnose breast cancer and to find the most effective metric regarding recall, ROC-AUC, and confusion matrix. Furthermore, our study is the first to use these four boosting algorithms with Optuna, a library for hyperparameter optimization, and the SHAP method to improve the interpretability of our model, which can be used as a support to identify and predict breast cancer. We were able to improve AUC or recall for all the models and reduce the False Negative for AdaBoost and LigthGBM the final AUC were more than 99.41\% for all models.</description>

      <title>EPIC: Generative AI Platform for Accelerating HPC Operational Data Analytics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present EPIC, an AI-driven platform designed to augment operational data analytics. EPIC employs a hierarchical multi-agent architecture where a top-level large language model provides query processing, reasoning and synthesis capabilities. These capabilities orchestrate three specialized low-level agents for information retrieval, descriptive analytics, and predictive analytics. This architecture enables EPIC to perform HPC operational analytics on multi-modal data, including text, images, and tabular formats, dynamically and iteratively. EPIC addresses the limitations of existing HPC operational analytics approaches, which rely on static methods that struggle to adapt to evolving analytics tasks and stakeholder demands.
  Through extensive evaluations on the Frontier HPC system, we demonstrate that EPIC effectively handles complex queries. Using descriptive analytics as a use case, fine-tuned smaller models outperform large state-of-the-art foundation models, achieving up to 26% higher accuracy. Additionally, we achieved 19x savings in LLM operational costs compared to proprietary solutions by employing a hybrid approach that combines large foundational models with fine-tuned local open-weight models.</description>

      <title>DarwinWafer: A Wafer-Scale Neuromorphic Chip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neuromorphic computing promises brain-like efficiency, yet today's multi-chip systems scale over PCBs and incur orders-of-magnitude penalties in bandwidth, latency, and energy, undermining biological algorithms and system efficiency. We present DarwinWafer, a hyperscale system-on-wafer that replaces off-chip interconnects with wafer-scale, high-density integration of 64 Darwin3 chiplets on a 300 mm silicon interposer. A GALS NoC within each chiplet and an AER-based asynchronous wafer fabric with hierarchical time-step synchronization provide low-latency, coherent operation across the wafer. Each chiplet implements 2.35 M neurons and 0.1 B synapses, yielding 0.15 B neurons and 6.4 B synapses per wafer.At 333 MHz and 0.8 V, DarwinWafer consumes ~100 W and achieves 4.9 pJ/SOP, with 64 TSOPS peak throughput (0.64 TSOPS/W). Realization is enabled by a holistic chiplet-interposer co-design flow (including an in-house interposer-bump planner with early SI/PI and electro-thermal closure) and a warpage-tolerant assembly that fans out I/O via PCBlets and compliant pogo-pin connections, enabling robust, demountable wafer-to-board integration. Measurements confirm 10 mV supply droop and a uniform thermal profile (34-36 {\deg}C) under ~100 W. Application studies demonstrate whole-brain simulations: two zebrafish brains per chiplet with high connectivity fidelity (Spearman r = 0.896) and a mouse brain mapped across 32 chiplets (r = 0.645). To our knowledge, DarwinWafer represents a pioneering demonstration of wafer-scale neuromorphic computing, establishing a viable and scalable path toward large-scale, brain-like computation on silicon by replacing PCB-level interconnects with high-density, on-wafer integration.</description>

      <title>Discovering Software Parallelization Points Using Deep Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study proposes a deep learning-based approach for discovering loops in programming code according to their potential for parallelization. Two genetic algorithm-based code generators were developed to produce two distinct types of code: (i) independent loops, which are parallelizable, and (ii) ambiguous loops, whose dependencies are unclear, making them impossible to define if the loop is parallelizable or not. The generated code snippets were tokenized and preprocessed to ensure a robust dataset. Two deep learning models - a Deep Neural Network (DNN) and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) - were implemented to perform the classification. Based on 30 independent runs, a robust statistical analysis was employed to verify the expected performance of both models, DNN and CNN. The CNN showed a slightly higher mean performance, but the two models had a similar variability. Experiments with varying dataset sizes highlighted the importance of data diversity for model performance. These results demonstrate the feasibility of using deep learning to automate the identification of parallelizable structures in code, offering a promising tool for software optimization and performance improvement.</description>

      <title>On LLM-Based Scientific Inductive Reasoning Beyond Equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) increasingly exhibit human-like capabilities, a fundamental question emerges: How can we enable LLMs to learn the underlying patterns from limited examples in entirely novel environments and apply them effectively? This question is central to the ability of LLMs in inductive reasoning. Existing research on LLM-based inductive reasoning can be broadly categorized based on whether the underlying rules are expressible via explicit mathematical equations. However, many recent studies in the beyond-equations category have emphasized rule design without grounding them in specific scenarios. Inspired by the parallels between inductive reasoning and human scientific discovery, we propose the task of LLM-Based Scientific Inductive Reasoning Beyond Equations and introduce a new benchmark, SIRBench-V1, to evaluate the inductive reasoning abilities of LLMs in scientific settings. Our experimental results show that current LLMs still struggle with this task, underscoring its difficulty and the need for further advancement in this area.</description>

Abstract: The challenges of solving complex university-level mathematics problems, particularly those from MIT, and Columbia University courses, and selected tasks from the MATH dataset, remain a significant obstacle in the field of artificial intelligence. Conventional methods have consistently fallen short in this domain, highlighting the need for more advanced approaches. In this paper, we introduce a language-based solution that leverages zero-shot learning and mathematical reasoning to effectively solve, explain, and generate solutions for these advanced math problems. By integrating program synthesis, our method reduces reliance on large-scale training data while significantly improving problem-solving accuracy. Our approach achieves an accuracy of 90.15%, representing a substantial improvement over the previous benchmark of 81% and setting a new standard in automated mathematical problem-solving. These findings highlight the significant potential of advanced AI methodologies to address and overcome the challenges presented by some of the most complex mathematical courses and datasets.</description>

      <title>A study on Deep Convolutional Neural Networks, transfer learning, and Mnet model for Cervical Cancer Detection</title>

Abstract: Early and accurate detection through Pap smear analysis is critical to improving patient outcomes and reducing mortality of Cervical cancer. State-of-the-art (SOTA) Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) require substantial computational resources, extended training time, and large datasets. In this study, a lightweight CNN model, S-Net (Simple Net), is developed specifically for cervical cancer detection and classification using Pap smear images to address these limitations. Alongside S-Net, six SOTA CNNs were evaluated using transfer learning, including multi-path (DenseNet201, ResNet152), depth-based (Serasnet152), width-based multi-connection (Xception), depth-wise separable convolutions (MobileNetV2), and spatial exploitation-based (VGG19). All models, including S-Net, achieved comparable accuracy, with S-Net reaching 99.99%. However, S-Net significantly outperforms the SOTA CNNs in terms of computational efficiency and inference time, making it a more practical choice for real-time and resource-constrained applications. A major limitation in CNN-based medical diagnosis remains the lack of transparency in the decision-making process. To address this, Explainable AI (XAI) techniques, such as SHAP, LIME, and Grad-CAM, were employed to visualize and interpret the key image regions influencing model predictions. The novelty of this study lies in the development of a highly accurate yet computationally lightweight model (S-Net) caPable of rapid inference while maintaining interpretability through XAI integration. Furthermore, this work analyzes the behavior of SOTA CNNs, investigates the effects of negative transfer learning on Pap smear images, and examines pixel intensity patterns in correctly and incorrectly classified samples.</description>

      <title>R-Net: A Reliable and Resource-Efficient CNN for Colorectal Cancer Detection with XAI Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are criticized for their extensive computational power, long training times, and large datasets. To overcome this limitation, we propose a reasonable network (R-Net), a lightweight CNN only to detect and classify colorectal cancer (CRC) using the Enteroscope Biopsy Histopathological Hematoxylin and Eosin Image Dataset (EBHI). Furthermore, six SOTA CNNs, including Multipath-based CNNs (DenseNet121, ResNet50), Depth-based CNNs (InceptionV3), width-based multi-connection CNNs (Xception), depth-wise separable convolutions (MobileNetV2), spatial exploitation-based CNNs (VGG16), Transfer learning, and two ensemble models are also tested on the same dataset. The ensemble models are a multipath-depth-width combination (DenseNet121-InceptionV3-Xception) and a multipath-depth-spatial combination (ResNet18-InceptionV3-VGG16). However, the proposed R-Net lightweight achieved 99.37% accuracy, outperforming MobileNet (95.83%) and ResNet50 (96.94%). Most importantly, to understand the decision-making of R-Net, Explainable AI such as SHAP, LIME, and Grad-CAM are integrated to visualize which parts of the EBHI image contribute to the detection and classification process of R-Net. The main novelty of this research lies in building a reliable, lightweight CNN R-Net that requires fewer computing resources yet maintains strong prediction results. SOTA CNNs, transfer learning, and ensemble models also extend our knowledge on CRC classification and detection. XAI functionality and the impact of pixel intensity on correct and incorrect classification images are also some novelties in CRC detection and classification.</description>

      <title>Imaging Modalities-Based Classification for Lung Cancer Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lung cancer continues to be the predominant cause of cancer-related mortality globally. This review analyzes various approaches, including advanced image processing methods, focusing on their efficacy in interpreting CT scans, chest radiographs, and biological markers. Notably, we identify critical gaps in the previous surveys, including the need for robust models that can generalize across diverse populations and imaging modalities. This comprehensive synthesis aims to serve as a foundational resource for researchers and clinicians, guiding future efforts toward more accurate and efficient lung cancer detection. Key findings reveal that 3D CNN architectures integrated with CT scans achieve the most superior performances, yet challenges such as high false positives, dataset variability, and computational complexity persist across modalities.</description>

      <title>HausaMovieReview: A Benchmark Dataset for Sentiment Analysis in Low-Resource African Language</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools for low-resource languages is critically hindered by the scarcity of annotated datasets. This paper addresses this fundamental challenge by introducing HausaMovieReview, a novel benchmark dataset comprising 5,000 YouTube comments in Hausa and code-switched English. The dataset was meticulously annotated by three independent annotators, demonstrating a robust agreement with a Fleiss' Kappa score of 0.85 between annotators. We used this dataset to conduct a comparative analysis of classical models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors) and fine-tuned transformer models (BERT and RoBERTa). Our results reveal a key finding: the Decision Tree classifier, with an accuracy and F1-score 89.72% and 89.60% respectively, significantly outperformed the deep learning models. Our findings also provide a robust baseline, demonstrating that effective feature engineering can enable classical models to achieve state-of-the-art performance in low-resource contexts, thereby laying a solid foundation for future research.

      <title>Socratic Mind: Impact of a Novel GenAI-Powered Assessment Tool on Student Learning and Higher-Order Thinking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study examines the impact of Socratic Mind, a Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) powered formative assessment tool that employs Socratic questioning to support student learning in a large, fully online undergraduate-level computing course. Employing a quasi-experimental, mixed-methods design, we investigated participants' engagement patterns, the influence of user experience on engagement, and impacts on both perceived and actual learning outcomes. Data were collected from the system logs, surveys on user experience and perceived engagement and learning gains, student reflections, and course performance data. Results indicated that participants consistently reported high levels of affective, behavioral, and cognitive engagement, and these were strongly linked to positive user experiences and perceived learning outcomes. Quantitative analysis further revealed that students who engaged with the GenAI tool experienced significant gains in their quiz scores compared to those who did not, particularly benefiting students with lower baseline achievement. Additionally, thematic analysis of qualitative feedback revealed substantial perceived improvements in higher-order thinking skills, including problem solving, critical thinking, and self-reflection. Our findings highlight the promise of AI-mediated dialogue in fostering deeper engagement and higher-order cognitive skills. As higher education institutions expand GenAI integration in curriculum, this dialogic, GenAI powered assessment tool can offer a scalable strategy to promote students' meaningful learning outcomes.</description>

      <title>Gender and Political Bias in Large Language Models: A Demonstration Platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present ParlAI Vote, an interactive system for exploring European Parliament debates and votes, and for testing LLMs on vote prediction and bias analysis. This platform connects debate topics, speeches, and roll-call outcomes, and includes rich demographic data such as gender, age, country, and political group. Users can browse debates, inspect linked speeches, compare real voting outcomes with predictions from frontier LLMs, and view error breakdowns by demographic group. Visualizing the EuroParlVote benchmark and its core tasks of gender classification and vote prediction, ParlAI Vote highlights systematic performance bias in state-of-the-art LLMs. The system unifies data, models, and visual analytics in a single interface, lowering the barrier for reproducing findings, auditing behavior, and running counterfactual scenarios. It supports research, education, and public engagement with legislative decision-making, while making clear both the strengths and the limitations of current LLMs in political analysis.</description>

      <title>Digging Into the Internal: Causality-Based Analysis of LLM Function Calling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Function calling (FC) has emerged as a powerful technique for facilitating large language models (LLMs) to interact with external systems and perform structured tasks. However, the mechanisms through which it influences model behavior remain largely under-explored. Besides, we discover that in addition to the regular usage of FC, this technique can substantially enhance the compliance of LLMs with user instructions. These observations motivate us to leverage causality, a canonical analysis method, to investigate how FC works within LLMs. In particular, we conduct layer-level and token-level causal interventions to dissect FC's impact on the model's internal computational logic when responding to user queries. Our analysis confirms the substantial influence of FC and reveals several in-depth insights into its mechanisms. To further validate our findings, we conduct extensive experiments comparing the effectiveness of FC-based instructions against conventional prompting methods. We focus on enhancing LLM safety robustness, a critical LLM application scenario, and evaluate four mainstream LLMs across two benchmark datasets. The results are striking: FC shows an average performance improvement of around 135% over conventional prompting methods in detecting malicious inputs, demonstrating its promising potential to enhance LLM reliability and capability in practical applications.</description>

      <title>SubDyve: Subgraph-Driven Dynamic Propagation for Virtual Screening Enhancement Controlling False Positive</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Virtual screening (VS) aims to identify bioactive compounds from vast chemical libraries, but remains difficult in low-label regimes where only a few actives are known. Existing methods largely rely on general-purpose molecular fingerprints and overlook class-discriminative substructures critical to bioactivity. Moreover, they consider molecules independently, limiting effectiveness in low-label regimes. We introduce SubDyve, a network-based VS framework that constructs a subgraph-aware similarity network and propagates activity signals from a small known actives. When few active compounds are available, SubDyve performs iterative seed refinement, incrementally promoting new candidates based on local false discovery rate. This strategy expands the seed set with promising candidates while controlling false positives from topological bias and overexpansion. We evaluate SubDyve on ten DUD-E targets under zero-shot conditions and on the CDK7 target with a 10-million-compound ZINC dataset. SubDyve consistently outperforms existing fingerprint or embedding-based approaches, achieving margins of up to +34.0 on the BEDROC and +24.6 on the EF1% metric.</description>

      <title>SecureFixAgent: A Hybrid LLM Agent for Automated Python Static Vulnerability Repair</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern software development pipelines face growing challenges in securing large codebases with extensive dependencies. Static analysis tools like Bandit are effective at vulnerability detection but suffer from high false positives and lack repair capabilities. Large Language Models (LLMs), in contrast, can suggest fixes but often hallucinate changes and lack self-validation. We present SecureFixAgent, a hybrid repair framework integrating Bandit with lightweight local LLMs (&lt;8B parameters) in an iterative detect-repair-validate loop. To improve precision, we apply parameter-efficient LoRA-based fine-tuning on a diverse, curated dataset spanning multiple Python project domains, mitigating dataset bias and reducing unnecessary edits. SecureFixAgent uses Bandit for detection, the LLM for candidate fixes with explanations, and Bandit re-validation for verification, all executed locally to preserve privacy and reduce cloud reliance. Experiments show SecureFixAgent reduces false positives by 10.8% over static analysis, improves fix accuracy by 13.51%, and lowers false positives by 5.46% compared to pre-trained LLMs, typically converging within three iterations. Beyond metrics, developer studies rate explanation quality 4.5/5, highlighting its value for human trust and adoption. By combining verifiable security improvements with transparent rationale in a resource-efficient local framework, SecureFixAgent advances trustworthy, automated vulnerability remediation for modern pipelines.</description>

      <title>Comparative Analysis of STEM and non-STEM Teachers' Needs for Integrating AI into Educational Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is an increasing imperative to integrate programming platforms within AI frameworks to enhance educational tasks for both teachers and students. However, commonly used platforms such as Code.org, Scratch, and Snap fall short of providing the desired AI features and lack adaptability for interdisciplinary applications. This study explores how educational platforms can be improved by incorporating AI and analytics features to create more effective learning environments across various subjects and domains. We interviewed 8 K-12 teachers and asked their practices and needs while using any block-based programming (BBP) platform in their classes. We asked for their approaches in assessment, course development and expansion of resources, and student monitoring in their classes. Thematic analysis of the interview transcripts revealed both commonalities and differences in the AI tools needed between the STEM and non-STEM groups. Our results indicated advanced AI features that could promote BBP platforms. Both groups stressed the need for integrity and plagiarism checks, AI adaptability, customized rubrics, and detailed feedback in assessments. Non-STEM teachers also emphasized the importance of creative assignments and qualitative assessments. Regarding resource development, both AI tools desired for updating curricula, tutoring libraries, and generative AI features. Non-STEM teachers were particularly interested in supporting creative endeavors, such as art simulations. For student monitoring, both groups prioritized desktop control, daily tracking, behavior monitoring, and distraction prevention tools. Our findings identify specific AI-enhanced features needed by K-12 teachers across various disciplines and lay the foundation for creating more efficient, personalized, and engaging educational experiences.</description>

      <title>Stabilizing Information Flow Entropy: Regularization for Safe and Interpretable Autonomous Driving Perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep perception networks in autonomous driving traditionally rely on data-intensive training regimes and post-hoc anomaly detection, often disregarding fundamental information-theoretic constraints governing stable information processing. We reconceptualize deep neural encoders as hierarchical communication chains that incrementally compress raw sensory inputs into task-relevant latent features. Within this framework, we establish two theoretically justified design principles for robust perception: (D1) smooth variation of mutual information between consecutive layers, and (D2) monotonic decay of latent entropy with network depth. Our analysis shows that, under realistic architectural assumptions, particularly blocks comprising repeated layers of similar capacity, enforcing smooth information flow (D1) naturally encourages entropy decay (D2), thus ensuring stable compression. Guided by these insights, we propose Eloss, a novel entropy-based regularizer designed as a lightweight, plug-and-play training objective. Rather than marginal accuracy improvements, this approach represents a conceptual shift: it unifies information-theoretic stability with standard perception tasks, enabling explicit, principled detection of anomalous sensor inputs through entropy deviations. Experimental validation on large-scale 3D object detection benchmarks (KITTI and nuScenes) demonstrates that incorporating Eloss consistently achieves competitive or improved accuracy while dramatically enhancing sensitivity to anomalies, amplifying distribution-shift signals by up to two orders of magnitude. This stable information-compression perspective not only improves interpretability but also establishes a solid theoretical foundation for safer, more robust autonomous driving perception systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study deploys methods in explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), e.g. decision trees and Pearson's correlation coefficient (PCC), to investigate electricity usage in multiple locales. It addresses the vital issue of energy burden, i.e. total amount spent on energy divided by median household income. Socio-demographic data is analyzed with energy features, especially using decision trees and PCC, providing explainable predictors on factors affecting energy burden. Based on the results of the analysis, a pilot energy equity web portal is designed along with a novel energy burden calculator. Leveraging XAI, this portal (with its calculator) serves as a prototype information system that can offer tailored actionable advice to multiple energy stakeholders. The ultimate goal of this study is to promote greater energy equity through the adaptation of XAI methods for energy-related analysis with suitable recommendations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The training scale of large language models (LLMs) has reached tens of thousands of GPUs and is still continuously expanding, enabling faster learning of larger models. Accompanying the expansion of the resource scale is the prevalence of failures (CUDA error, NaN values, job hang, etc.), which poses significant challenges to training stability. Any large-scale LLM training infrastructure should strive for minimal training interruption, efficient fault diagnosis, and effective failure tolerance to enable highly efficient continuous training. This paper presents ByteRobust, a large-scale GPU infrastructure management system tailored for robust and stable training of LLMs. It exploits the uniqueness of LLM training process and gives top priorities to detecting and recovering failures in a routine manner. Leveraging parallelisms and characteristics of LLM training, ByteRobust enables high-capacity fault tolerance, prompt fault demarcation, and localization with an effective data-driven approach, comprehensively ensuring continuous and efficient training of LLM tasks. ByteRobust is deployed on a production GPU platform with over 200,000 GPUs and achieves 97% ETTR for a three-month training job on 9,600 GPUs.</description>

      <title>Patterns in the Transition From Founder-Leadership to Community Governance of Open Source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Open digital public infrastructure needs community management to ensure accountability, sustainability, and robustness. Yet open-source projects often rely on centralized decision-making, and the determinants of successful community management remain unclear. We analyze 637 GitHub repositories to trace transitions from founder-led to shared governance. Specifically, we document trajectories to community governance by extracting institutional roles, actions, and deontic cues from version-controlled project constitutions GOVERNANCE.md. With a semantic parsing pipeline, we cluster elements into broader role and action types. We find roles and actions grow, and regulation becomes more balanced, reflecting increases in governance scope and differentiation over time. Rather than shifting tone, communities grow by layering and refining responsibilities. As transitions to community management mature, projects increasingly regulate ecosystem-level relationships and add definition to project oversight roles. Overall, this work offers a scalable pipeline for tracking the growth and development of community governance regimes from open-source software's familiar default of founder-ownership.</description>

      <title>How Large Language Models are Designed to Hallucinate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve remarkable fluency across linguistic and reasoning tasks but remain systematically prone to hallucination. Prevailing accounts attribute hallucinations to data gaps, limited context, or optimization errors. We argue instead that hallucination is a structural outcome of the transformer architecture. As coherence engines, transformers are compelled to produce fluent continuations, with self-attention simulating the relational structure of meaning but lacking the existential grounding of temporality, mood, and care that stabilizes human understanding. On this basis, we distinguish ontological hallucination, arising when continuations require disclosure of beings in world, and residual reasoning hallucination, where models mimic inference by recycling traces of human reasoning in text. We illustrate these patterns through case studies aligned with Heideggerian categories and an experiment across twelve LLMs showing how simulated "self-preservation" emerges under extended prompts. Our contribution is threefold: (1) a comparative account showing why existing explanations are insufficient; (2) a predictive taxonomy of hallucination linked to existential structures with proposed benchmarks; and (3) design directions toward "truth-constrained" architectures capable of withholding or deferring when disclosure is absent. We conclude that hallucination is not an incidental defect but a defining limit of transformer-based models, an outcome scaffolding can mask but never resolve.</description>

      <title>Overhearing LLM Agents: A Survey, Taxonomy, and Roadmap</title>

Abstract: Imagine AI assistants that enhance conversations without interrupting them: quietly providing relevant information during a medical consultation, seamlessly preparing materials as teachers discuss lesson plans, or unobtrusively scheduling meetings as colleagues debate calendars. While modern conversational LLM agents directly assist human users with tasks through a chat interface, we study this alternative paradigm for interacting with LLM agents, which we call "overhearing agents." Rather than demanding the user's attention, overhearing agents continuously monitor ambient activity and intervene only when they can provide contextual assistance. In this paper, we present the first analysis of overhearing LLM agents as a distinct paradigm in human-AI interaction and establish a taxonomy of overhearing agent interactions and tasks grounded in a survey of works on prior LLM-powered agents and exploratory HCI studies. Based on this taxonomy, we create a list of best practices for researchers and developers building overhearing agent systems. Finally, we outline the remaining research gaps and reveal opportunities for future research in the overhearing paradigm.</description>

      <title>Highly Imbalanced Regression with Tabular Data in SEP and Other Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate imbalanced regression with tabular data that have an imbalance ratio larger than 1,000 ("highly imbalanced"). Accurately estimating the target values of rare instances is important in applications such as forecasting the intensity of rare harmful Solar Energetic Particle (SEP) events. For regression, the MSE loss does not consider the correlation between predicted and actual values. Typical inverse importance functions allow only convex functions. Uniform sampling might yield mini-batches that do not have rare instances. We propose CISIR that incorporates correlation, Monotonically Decreasing Involution (MDI) importance, and stratified sampling. Based on five datasets, our experimental results indicate that CISIR can achieve lower error and higher correlation than some recent methods. Also, adding our correlation component to other recent methods can improve their performance. Lastly, MDI importance can outperform other importance functions. Our code can be found in https://github.com/Machine-Earning/CISIR.</description>

      <title>Agentic Reasoning for Robust Vision Systems via Increased Test-Time Compute</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Developing trustworthy intelligent vision systems for high-stakes domains, \emph{e.g.}, remote sensing and medical diagnosis, demands broad robustness without costly retraining. We propose \textbf{Visual Reasoning Agent (VRA)}, a training-free, agentic reasoning framework that wraps off-the-shelf vision-language models \emph{and} pure vision systems in a \emph{Think--Critique--Act} loop. While VRA incurs significant additional test-time computation, it achieves up to 40\% absolute accuracy gains on challenging visual reasoning benchmarks. Future work will optimize query routing and early stopping to reduce inference overhead while preserving reliability in vision tasks.</description>

      <title>Estimating Clinical Lab Test Result Trajectories from PPG using Physiological Foundation Model and Patient-Aware State Space Model -- a UNIPHY+ Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Clinical laboratory tests provide essential biochemical measurements for diagnosis and treatment, but are limited by intermittent and invasive sampling. In contrast, photoplethysmogram (PPG) is a non-invasive, continuously recorded signal in intensive care units (ICUs) that reflects cardiovascular dynamics and can serve as a proxy for latent physiological changes. We propose UNIPHY+Lab, a framework that combines a large-scale PPG foundation model for local waveform encoding with a patient-aware Mamba model for long-range temporal modeling. Our architecture addresses three challenges: (1) capturing extended temporal trends in laboratory values, (2) accounting for patient-specific baseline variation via FiLM-modulated initial states, and (3) performing multi-task estimation for interrelated biomarkers. We evaluate our method on the two ICU datasets for predicting the five key laboratory tests. The results show substantial improvements over the LSTM and carry-forward baselines in MAE, RMSE, and $R^2$ among most of the estimation targets. This work demonstrates the feasibility of continuous, personalized lab value estimation from routine PPG monitoring, offering a pathway toward non-invasive biochemical surveillance in critical care.</description>

      <title>From Canopy to Ground via ForestGen3D: Learning Cross-Domain Generation of 3D Forest Structure from Aerial-to-Terrestrial LiDAR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The 3D structure of living and non-living components in ecosystems plays a critical role in determining ecological processes and feedbacks from both natural and human-driven disturbances. Anticipating the effects of wildfire, drought, disease, or atmospheric deposition depends on accurate characterization of 3D vegetation structure, yet widespread measurement remains prohibitively expensive and often infeasible. We introduce ForestGen3D, a novel generative modeling framework that synthesizes high-fidelity 3D forest structure using only aerial LiDAR (ALS) inputs. ForestGen3D is based on conditional denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) trained on co-registered ALS/TLS (terrestrial LiDAR) data. The model learns to generate TLS-like 3D point clouds conditioned on sparse ALS observations, effectively reconstructing occluded sub-canopy detail at scale. To ensure ecological plausibility, we introduce a geometric containment prior based on the convex hull of ALS observations and provide theoretical and empirical guarantees that generated structures remain spatially consistent. We evaluate ForestGen3D at tree, plot, and landscape scales using real-world data from mixed conifer ecosystems, and show that it produces high-fidelity reconstructions that closely match TLS references in terms of geometric similarity and biophysical metrics, such as tree height, DBH, crown diameter and crown volume. Additionally, we demonstrate that the containment property can serve as a practical proxy for generation quality in settings where TLS ground truth is unavailable. Our results position ForestGen3D as a scalable tool for ecological modeling, wildfire simulation, and structural fuel characterization in ALS-only environments.</description>

      <title>QUINTA: Reflexive Sensibility For Responsible AI Research and Data-Driven Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the field of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) continues to prioritize fairness and the concern for historically marginalized communities, the importance of intersectionality in AI research has gained significant recognition. However, few studies provide practical guidance on how researchers can effectively incorporate intersectionality into critical praxis. In response, this paper presents a comprehensive framework grounded in critical reflexivity as intersectional praxis. Operationalizing intersectionality within the AI/DS (Artificial Intelligence/Data Science) pipeline, Quantitative Intersectional Data (QUINTA) is introduced as a methodological paradigm that challenges conventional and superficial research habits, particularly in data-centric processes, to identify and mitigate negative impacts such as the inadvertent marginalization caused by these practices. The framework centers researcher reflexivity to call attention to the AI researchers' power in creating and analyzing AI/DS artifacts through data-centric approaches. To illustrate the effectiveness of QUINTA, we provide a reflexive AI/DS researcher demonstration utilizing the \#metoo movement as a case study. Note: This paper was accepted as a poster presentation at Equity and Access in Algorithms, Mechanisms, and Optimization (EAAMO) Conference in 2023.</description>

      <title>Secure Confidential Business Information When Sharing Machine Learning Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Model-sharing offers significant business value by enabling firms with well-established Machine Learning (ML) models to monetize and share their models with others who lack the resources to develop ML models from scratch. However, concerns over data confidentiality remain a significant barrier to model-sharing adoption, as Confidential Property Inference (CPI) attacks can exploit shared ML models to uncover confidential properties of the model provider's private model training data. Existing defenses often assume that CPI attacks are non-adaptive to the specific ML model they are targeting. This assumption overlooks a key characteristic of real-world adversaries: their responsiveness, i.e., adversaries' ability to dynamically adjust their attack models based on the information of the target and its defenses. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel defense method that explicitly accounts for the responsive nature of real-world adversaries via two methodological innovations: a novel Responsive CPI attack and an attack-defense arms race framework. The former emulates the responsive behaviors of adversaries in the real world, and the latter iteratively enhances both the target and attack models, ultimately producing a secure ML model that is robust against responsive CPI attacks. Furthermore, we propose and integrate a novel approximate strategy into our defense, which addresses a critical computational bottleneck of defense methods and improves defense efficiency. Through extensive empirical evaluations across various realistic model-sharing scenarios, we demonstrate that our method outperforms existing defenses by more effectively defending against CPI attacks, preserving ML model utility, and reducing computational overhead.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Financial RAG with Agentic AI and Multi-HyDE: A Novel Approach to Knowledge Retrieval and Hallucination Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate and reliable knowledge retrieval is vital for financial question-answering, where continually updated data sources and complex, high-stakes contexts demand precision. Traditional retrieval systems rely on a single database and retriever, but financial applications require more sophisticated approaches to handle intricate regulatory filings, market analyses, and extensive multi-year reports. We introduce a framework for financial Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) that leverages agentic AI and the Multi-HyDE system, an approach that generates multiple, nonequivalent queries to boost the effectiveness and coverage of retrieval from large, structured financial corpora. Our pipeline is optimized for token efficiency and multi-step financial reasoning, and we demonstrate that their combination improves accuracy by 11.2% and reduces hallucinations by 15%. Our method is evaluated on standard financial QA benchmarks, showing that integrating domain-specific retrieval mechanisms such as Multi-HyDE with robust toolsets, including keyword and table-based retrieval, significantly enhances both the accuracy and reliability of answers. This research not only delivers a modular, adaptable retrieval framework for finance but also highlights the importance of structured agent workflows and multi-perspective retrieval for trustworthy deployment of AI in high-stakes financial applications.</description>

      <title>CoUn: Empowering Machine Unlearning via Contrastive Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine unlearning (MU) aims to remove the influence of specific "forget" data from a trained model while preserving its knowledge of the remaining "retain" data. Existing MU methods based on label manipulation or model weight perturbations often achieve limited unlearning effectiveness. To address this, we introduce CoUn, a novel MU framework inspired by the observation that a model retrained from scratch using only retain data classifies forget data based on their semantic similarity to the retain data. CoUn emulates this behavior by adjusting learned data representations through contrastive learning (CL) and supervised learning, applied exclusively to retain data. Specifically, CoUn (1) leverages semantic similarity between data samples to indirectly adjust forget representations using CL, and (2) maintains retain representations within their respective clusters through supervised learning. Extensive experiments across various datasets and model architectures show that CoUn consistently outperforms state-of-the-art MU baselines in unlearning effectiveness. Additionally, integrating our CL module into existing baselines empowers their unlearning effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Behavioral Alignment in Conflict Dialogue: A Multi-Dimensional Comparison of LLM Agents and Humans</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in socially complex, interaction-driven tasks, yet their ability to mirror human behavior in emotionally and strategically complex contexts remains underexplored. This study assesses the behavioral alignment of personality-prompted LLMs in adversarial dispute resolution by simulating multi-turn conflict dialogues that incorporate negotiation. Each LLM is guided by a matched Five-Factor personality profile to control for individual variation and enhance realism. We evaluate alignment across three dimensions: linguistic style, emotional expression (e.g., anger dynamics), and strategic behavior. GPT-4.1 achieves the closest alignment with humans in linguistic style and emotional dynamics, while Claude-3.7-Sonnet best reflects strategic behavior. Nonetheless, substantial alignment gaps persist. Our findings establish a benchmark for alignment between LLMs and humans in socially complex interactions, underscoring both the promise and the limitations of personality conditioning in dialogue modeling.</description>

      <title>GRID: Graph-based Reasoning for Intervention and Discovery in Built Environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Manual HVAC fault diagnosis in commercial buildings takes 8-12 hours per incident and achieves only 60 percent diagnostic accuracy, reflecting analytics that stop at correlation instead of causation. To close this gap, we present GRID (Graph-based Reasoning for Intervention and Discovery), a three-stage causal discovery pipeline that combines constraint-based search, neural structural equation modeling, and language model priors to recover directed acyclic graphs from building sensor data. Across six benchmarks: synthetic rooms, EnergyPlus simulation, the ASHRAE Great Energy Predictor III dataset, and a live office testbed, GRID achieves F1 scores ranging from 0.65 to 1.00, with exact recovery (F1 = 1.00) in three controlled environments (Base, Hidden, Physical) and strong performance on real-world data (F1 = 0.89 on ASHRAE, 0.86 in noisy conditions). The method outperforms ten baseline approaches across all evaluation scenarios. Intervention scheduling achieves low operational impact in most scenarios (cost &lt;= 0.026) while reducing risk metrics compared to baseline approaches. The framework integrates constraint-based methods, neural architectures, and domain-specific language model prompts to address the observational-causal gap in building analytics.</description>

      <title>Pico: A Modular Framework for Hypothesis-Driven Small Language Model Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building language models (LMs), especially small and medium ones, remains more art than science. While large LMs often improve by sheer scale, it is still unclear why many design choices work. For small LMs, this uncertainty is more limiting: tight parameter budgets make each decision critical, yet researchers still lack systematic, scientific ways to test and refine new ideas.
  We introduce Pico, a lightweight, modular framework that enables systematic, hypothesis-driven research for small and medium-scale language model development. Pico consists of two libraries that together provide a practical sandbox where researchers can make targeted changes to a model's architecture or training procedures and directly observe their effects on the model's behavior. To support reproducible experimentation, we also release a suite of baseline models, pico-decoder, trained under standardized conditions and open-sourced for the community. Case studies highlight how Pico can support iterative small LM design and analysis.</description>

Abstract: With society's increasing reliance on digital data sharing, the protection of sensitive information has become critical. Encryption serves as one of the privacy-preserving methods; however, its realization in the audio domain predominantly relies on signal processing or software methods embedded into hardware. In this paper, we introduce LenslessMic, a hybrid optical hardware-based encryption method that utilizes a lensless camera as a physical layer of security applicable to multiple types of audio. We show that LenslessMic enables (1) robust authentication of audio recordings and (2) encryption strength that can rival the search space of 256-bit digital standards, while maintaining high-quality signals and minimal loss of content information. The approach is validated with a low-cost Raspberry Pi prototype and is open-sourced together with datasets to facilitate research in the area.</description>

      <title>AHA -- Predicting What Matters Next: Online Highlight Detection Without Looking Ahead</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real-time understanding of continuous video streams is essential for intelligent agents operating in high-stakes environments, including autonomous vehicles, surveillance drones, and disaster response robots. Yet, most existing video understanding and highlight detection methods assume access to the entire video during inference, making them unsuitable for online or streaming scenarios. In particular, current models optimize for offline summarization, failing to support step-by-step reasoning needed for real-time decision-making. We introduce Aha, an autoregressive highlight detection framework that predicts the relevance of each video frame against a task described in natural language. Without accessing future video frames, Aha utilizes a multimodal vision-language model and lightweight, decoupled heads trained on a large, curated dataset of human-centric video labels. To enable scalability, we introduce the Dynamic SinkCache mechanism that achieves constant memory usage across infinite-length streams without degrading performance on standard benchmarks. This encourages the hidden representation to capture high-level task objectives, enabling effective frame-level rankings for informativeness, relevance, and uncertainty with respect to the natural language task. Aha achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on highlight detection benchmarks, surpassing even prior offline, full-context approaches and video-language models by +5.9% on TVSum and +8.3% on Mr.Hisum in mAP (mean Average Precision). We explore Aha's potential for real-world robotics applications given a task-oriented natural language input and a continuous, robot-centric video. Both experiments demonstrate Aha's potential effectiveness as a real-time reasoning module for downstream planning and long-horizon understanding.</description>

      <title>SENSE-7: Taxonomy and Dataset for Measuring User Perceptions of Empathy in Sustained Human-AI Conversations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Empathy is increasingly recognized as a key factor in human-AI communication, yet conventional approaches to "digital empathy" often focus on simulating internal, human-like emotional states while overlooking the inherently subjective, contextual, and relational facets of empathy as perceived by users. In this work, we propose a human-centered taxonomy that emphasizes observable empathic behaviors and introduce a new dataset, Sense-7, of real-world conversations between information workers and Large Language Models (LLMs), which includes per-turn empathy annotations directly from the users, along with user characteristics, and contextual details, offering a more user-grounded representation of empathy. Analysis of 695 conversations from 109 participants reveals that empathy judgments are highly individualized, context-sensitive, and vulnerable to disruption when conversational continuity fails or user expectations go unmet. To promote further research, we provide a subset of 672 anonymized conversation and provide exploratory classification analysis, showing that an LLM-based classifier can recognize 5 levels of empathy with an encouraging average Spearman $\rho$=0.369 and Accuracy=0.487 over this set. Overall, our findings underscore the need for AI designs that dynamically tailor empathic behaviors to user contexts and goals, offering a roadmap for future research and practical development of socially attuned, human-centered artificial agents.</description>

      <title>LightCode: Compiling LLM Inference for Photonic-Electronic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16443v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growing demand for low-latency, energy-efficient inference in large language models (LLMs) has catalyzed interest in heterogeneous architectures. While GPUs remain dominant, they are poorly suited for integration with emerging domain-specific accelerators like the Photonic Tensor Units (PTUs), which offer low-power, high-throughput linear computation. This motivates hybrid compilation strategies that combine photonic and electronic resources. We present LightCode, a compiler framework and simulator for mapping LLM inference workloads across hybrid photonic-electronic systems. LightCode introduces the Stacked Graph, an intermediate representation that encodes multiple hardware-specific realizations of each tensor operation. Hardware assignment is formulated as a constrained subgraph selection problem optimized for latency or energy under parametric cost models. We evaluate LightCode on the prefill stage of GPT-2 and Llama-7B showing that under our workload and hardware assumptions, (i) Photonic hardware reduced energy by up to 50% in our simulated workloads at maximum sequence length; (ii) multiplexing and assignment strategy yielded latency improvements exceeding 10x; and (iii) Optimizing for latency or energy resulted in distinct hardware mappings in our simulations. LightCode offers a module, foundational framework and simulator for compiling LLMs to emerging photonic accelerators.</description>

      <title>PersonaMatrix: A Recipe for Persona-Aware Evaluation of Legal Summarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Legal documents are often long, dense, and difficult to comprehend, not only for laypeople but also for legal experts. While automated document summarization has great potential to improve access to legal knowledge, prevailing task-based evaluators overlook divergent user and stakeholder needs. Tool development is needed to encompass the technicality of a case summary for a litigator yet be accessible for a self-help public researching for their lawsuit. We introduce PersonaMatrix, a persona-by-criterion evaluation framework that scores summaries through the lens of six personas, including legal and non-legal users. We also introduce a controlled dimension-shifted pilot dataset of U.S. civil rights case summaries that varies along depth, accessibility, and procedural detail as well as Diversity-Coverage Index (DCI) to expose divergent optima of legal summary between persona-aware and persona-agnostic judges. This work enables refinement of legal AI summarization systems for both expert and non-expert users, with the potential to increase access to legal knowledge. The code base and data are publicly available in GitHub.</description>

      <title>KRAST: Knowledge-Augmented Robotic Action Recognition with Structured Text for Vision-Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate vision-based action recognition is crucial for developing autonomous robots that can operate safely and reliably in complex, real-world environments. In this work, we advance video-based recognition of indoor daily actions for robotic perception by leveraging vision-language models (VLMs) enriched with domain-specific knowledge. We adapt a prompt-learning framework in which class-level textual descriptions of each action are embedded as learnable prompts into a frozen pre-trained VLM backbone. Several strategies for structuring and encoding these textual descriptions are designed and evaluated. Experiments on the ETRI-Activity3D dataset demonstrate that our method, using only RGB video inputs at test time, achieves over 95\% accuracy and outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. These results highlight the effectiveness of knowledge-augmented prompts in enabling robust action recognition with minimal supervision.</description>

Abstract: We explore the potential for combining generative AI with grammar-based visualizations for biomedical data discovery. In our prototype, we use a multi-agent system to generate visualization specifications and apply filters. These visualizations are linked together, resulting in an interactive dashboard that is progressively constructed. Our system leverages the strengths of natural language while maintaining the utility of traditional user interfaces. Furthermore, we utilize generated interactive widgets enabling user adjustment. Finally, we demonstrate the potential utility of this system for biomedical data discovery with a case study.</description>

      <title>Implicit Behavioral Alignment of Language Agents in High-Stakes Crowd Simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Language-driven generative agents have enabled large-scale social simulations with transformative uses, from interpersonal training to aiding global policy-making. However, recent studies indicate that generative agent behaviors often deviate from expert expectations and real-world data--a phenomenon we term the Behavior-Realism Gap. To address this, we introduce a theoretical framework called Persona-Environment Behavioral Alignment (PEBA), formulated as a distribution matching problem grounded in Lewin's behavior equation stating that behavior is a function of the person and their environment. Leveraging PEBA, we propose PersonaEvolve (PEvo), an LLM-based optimization algorithm that iteratively refines agent personas, implicitly aligning their collective behaviors with realistic expert benchmarks within a specified environmental context. We validate PEvo in an active shooter incident simulation we developed, achieving an 84% average reduction in distributional divergence compared to no steering and a 34% improvement over explicit instruction baselines. Results also show PEvo-refined personas generalize to novel, related simulation scenarios. Our method greatly enhances behavioral realism and reliability in high-stakes social simulations. More broadly, the PEBA-PEvo framework provides a principled approach to developing trustworthy LLM-driven social simulations.</description>

      <title>Entropic Causal Inference: Graph Identifiability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16463v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entropic causal inference is a recent framework for learning the causal graph between two variables from observational data by finding the information-theoretically simplest structural explanation of the data, i.e., the model with smallest entropy. In our work, we first extend the causal graph identifiability result in the two-variable setting under relaxed assumptions. We then show the first identifiability result using the entropic approach for learning causal graphs with more than two nodes. Our approach utilizes the property that ancestrality between a source node and its descendants can be determined using the bivariate entropic tests. We provide a sound sequential peeling algorithm for general graphs that relies on this property. We also propose a heuristic algorithm for small graphs that shows strong empirical performance. We rigorously evaluate the performance of our algorithms on synthetic data generated from a variety of models, observing improvement over prior work. Finally we test our algorithms on real-world datasets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Falls among seniors are a major public health issue. Existing solutions using wearable sensors, ambient sensors, and RGB-based vision systems face challenges in reliability, user compliance, and practicality. Studies indicate that stakeholders, such as older adults and eldercare facilities, prefer non-wearable, passive, privacy-preserving, and real-time fall detection systems that require no user interaction. This study proposes an advanced thermal fall detection method using a Bidirectional Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (BiConvLSTM) model, enhanced with spatial, temporal, feature, self, and general attention mechanisms. Through systematic experimentation across hundreds of model variations exploring the integration of attention mechanisms, recurrent modules, and motion flow, we identified top-performing architectures. Among them, BiConvLSTM achieved state-of-the-art performance with a ROC-AUC of $99.7\%$ on the TSF dataset and demonstrated robust results on TF-66, a newly emerged, diverse, and privacy-preserving benchmark. These results highlight the generalizability and practicality of the proposed model, setting new standards for thermal fall detection and paving the way toward deployable, high-performance solutions.</description>

      <title>The Oracle Has Spoken: A Multi-Aspect Evaluation of Dialogue in Pythia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dialogue is one of the landmark abilities of large language models (LLMs). Despite its ubiquity, few studies actually distinguish specific ingredients underpinning dialogue behavior emerging during post-training. We employ a comprehensive suite of model-based metrics, each targeting a distinct fine-grained aspect of dialogue, motivated by linguistic theory. We evaluate how the performance of pre-trained Pythia models changes with respect to each of those dimensions, depending on model size and as a result of supervised fine-tuning on conversational datasets. We observe only a mild impact of raw model size on most metrics, whereas fine-tuning quickly saturates the scores for all but the smallest models tested. Somewhat contrary to our expectations, many metrics show very similar trends, especially if they are all rooted in the same evaluator model, which raises the question of their reliability in measuring a specific dimension. To that end, we conduct additional analyses of score distributions, metric correlations, and term frequencies in generated responses to help explain our observations.</description>

      <title>Can an Individual Manipulate the Collective Decisions of Multi-Agents?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Individual Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant capabilities across various domains, such as healthcare and law. Recent studies also show that coordinated multi-agent systems exhibit enhanced decision-making and reasoning abilities through collaboration. However, due to the vulnerabilities of individual LLMs and the difficulty of accessing all agents in a multi-agent system, a key question arises: If attackers only know one agent, could they still generate adversarial samples capable of misleading the collective decision? To explore this question, we formulate it as a game with incomplete information, where attackers know only one target agent and lack knowledge of the other agents in the system. With this formulation, we propose M-Spoiler, a framework that simulates agent interactions within a multi-agent system to generate adversarial samples. These samples are then used to manipulate the target agent in the target system, misleading the system's collaborative decision-making process. More specifically, M-Spoiler introduces a stubborn agent that actively aids in optimizing adversarial samples by simulating potential stubborn responses from agents in the target system. This enhances the effectiveness of the generated adversarial samples in misleading the system. Through extensive experiments across various tasks, our findings confirm the risks posed by the knowledge of an individual agent in multi-agent systems and demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. We also explore several defense mechanisms, showing that our proposed attack framework remains more potent than baselines, underscoring the need for further research into defensive strategies.</description>

      <title>Synergies between Federated Foundation Models and Smart Power Grids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent emergence of large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-3 has marked a significant paradigm shift in machine learning. Trained on massive corpora of data, these models demonstrate remarkable capabilities in language understanding, generation, summarization, and reasoning, transforming how intelligent systems process and interact with human language. Although LLMs may still seem like a recent breakthrough, the field is already witnessing the rise of a new and more general category: multi-modal, multi-task foundation models (M3T FMs). These models go beyond language and can process heterogeneous data types/modalities, such as time-series measurements, audio, imagery, tabular records, and unstructured logs, while supporting a broad range of downstream tasks spanning forecasting, classification, control, and retrieval. When combined with federated learning (FL), they give rise to M3T Federated Foundation Models (FedFMs): a highly recent and largely unexplored class of models that enable scalable, privacy-preserving model training/fine-tuning across distributed data sources. In this paper, we take one of the first steps toward introducing these models to the power systems research community by offering a bidirectional perspective: (i) M3T FedFMs for smart grids and (ii) smart grids for FedFMs. In the former, we explore how M3T FedFMs can enhance key grid functions, such as load/demand forecasting and fault detection, by learning from distributed, heterogeneous data available at the grid edge in a privacy-preserving manner. In the latter, we investigate how the constraints and structure of smart grids, spanning energy, communication, and regulatory dimensions, shape the design, training, and deployment of M3T FedFMs.</description>

      <title>Seeing Culture: A Benchmark for Visual Reasoning and Grounding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal vision-language models (VLMs) have made substantial progress in various tasks that require a combined understanding of visual and textual content, particularly in cultural understanding tasks, with the emergence of new cultural datasets. However, these datasets frequently fall short of providing cultural reasoning while underrepresenting many cultures. In this paper, we introduce the Seeing Culture Benchmark (SCB), focusing on cultural reasoning with a novel approach that requires VLMs to reason on culturally rich images in two stages: i) selecting the correct visual option with multiple-choice visual question answering (VQA), and ii) segmenting the relevant cultural artifact as evidence of reasoning. Visual options in the first stage are systematically organized into three types: those originating from the same country, those from different countries, or a mixed group. Notably, all options are derived from a singular category for each type. Progression to the second stage occurs only after a correct visual option is chosen. The SCB benchmark comprises 1,065 images that capture 138 cultural artifacts across five categories from seven Southeast Asia countries, whose diverse cultures are often overlooked, accompanied by 3,178 questions, of which 1,093 are unique and meticulously curated by human annotators. Our evaluation of various VLMs reveals the complexities involved in cross-modal cultural reasoning and highlights the disparity between visual reasoning and spatial grounding in culturally nuanced scenarios. The SCB serves as a crucial benchmark for identifying these shortcomings, thereby guiding future developments in the field of cultural reasoning. https://github.com/buraksatar/SeeingCulture</description>

      <title>Causal Fuzzing for Verifying Machine Unlearning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As machine learning models become increasingly embedded in decision-making systems, the ability to "unlearn" targeted data or features is crucial for enhancing model adaptability, fairness, and privacy in models which involves expensive training. To effectively guide machine unlearning, a thorough testing is essential. Existing methods for verification of machine unlearning provide limited insights, often failing in scenarios where the influence is indirect. In this work, we propose CAF\'E, a new causality based framework that unifies datapoint- and feature-level unlearning for verification of black-box ML models. CAF\'E evaluates both direct and indirect effects of unlearning targets through causal dependencies, providing actionable insights with fine-grained analysis. Our evaluation across five datasets and three model architectures demonstrates that CAF\'E successfully detects residual influence missed by baselines while maintaining computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Lattice Boltzmann Model for Learning Real-World Pixel Dynamicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work proposes the Lattice Boltzmann Model (LBM) to learn real-world pixel dynamicity for visual tracking. LBM decomposes visual representations into dynamic pixel lattices and solves pixel motion states through collision-streaming processes. Specifically, the high-dimensional distribution of the target pixels is acquired through a multilayer predict-update network to estimate the pixel positions and visibility. The predict stage formulates lattice collisions among the spatial neighborhood of target pixels and develops lattice streaming within the temporal visual context. The update stage rectifies the pixel distributions with online visual representations. Compared with existing methods, LBM demonstrates practical applicability in an online and real-time manner, which can efficiently adapt to real-world visual tracking tasks. Comprehensive evaluations of real-world point tracking benchmarks such as TAP-Vid and RoboTAP validate LBM's efficiency. A general evaluation of large-scale open-world object tracking benchmarks such as TAO, BFT, and OVT-B further demonstrates LBM's real-world practicality.</description>

      <title>AIPsychoBench: Understanding the Psychometric Differences between LLMs and Humans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) with hundreds of billions of parameters have exhibited human-like intelligence by learning from vast amounts of internet-scale data. However, the uninterpretability of large-scale neural networks raises concerns about the reliability of LLM. Studies have attempted to assess the psychometric properties of LLMs by borrowing concepts from human psychology to enhance their interpretability, but they fail to account for the fundamental differences between LLMs and humans. This results in high rejection rates when human scales are reused directly. Furthermore, these scales do not support the measurement of LLM psychological property variations in different languages. This paper introduces AIPsychoBench, a specialized benchmark tailored to assess the psychological properties of LLM. It uses a lightweight role-playing prompt to bypass LLM alignment, improving the average effective response rate from 70.12% to 90.40%. Meanwhile, the average biases are only 3.3% (positive) and 2.1% (negative), which are significantly lower than the biases of 9.8% and 6.9%, respectively, caused by traditional jailbreak prompts. Furthermore, among the total of 112 psychometric subcategories, the score deviations for seven languages compared to English ranged from 5% to 20.2% in 43 subcategories, providing the first comprehensive evidence of the linguistic impact on the psychometrics of LLM.</description>

      <title>No Need for Real 3D: Fusing 2D Vision with Pseudo 3D Representations for Robotic Manipulation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently,vision-based robotic manipulation has garnered significant attention and witnessed substantial advancements. 2D image-based and 3D point cloud-based policy learning represent two predominant paradigms in the field, with recent studies showing that the latter consistently outperforms the former in terms of both policy performance and generalization, thereby underscoring the value and significance of 3D information. However, 3D point cloud-based approaches face the significant challenge of high data acquisition costs, limiting their scalability and real-world deployment. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework NoReal3D: which introduces the 3DStructureFormer, a learnable 3D perception module capable of transforming monocular images into geometrically meaningful pseudo-point cloud features, effectively fused with the 2D encoder output features. Specially, the generated pseudo-point clouds retain geometric and topological structures so we design a pseudo-point cloud encoder to preserve these properties, making it well-suited for our framework. We also investigate the effectiveness of different feature fusion strategies.Our framework enhances the robot's understanding of 3D spatial structures while completely eliminating the substantial costs associated with 3D point cloud acquisition.Extensive experiments across various tasks validate that our framework can achieve performance comparable to 3D point cloud-based methods, without the actual point cloud data.</description>

      <title>InteGround: On the Evaluation of Verification and Retrieval Planning in Integrative Grounding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Grounding large language models (LLMs) in external knowledge sources is a promising method for faithful prediction. While existing grounding approaches work well for simple queries, many real-world information needs require synthesizing multiple pieces of evidence. We introduce "integrative grounding" -- the challenge of retrieving and verifying multiple inter-dependent pieces of evidence to support a hypothesis query. To systematically study this problem, we repurpose data from four domains for evaluating integrative grounding capabilities. Our investigation reveals two critical findings: First, in groundedness verification, while LLMs are robust to redundant evidence, they tend to rationalize using internal knowledge when information is incomplete. Second, in examining retrieval planning strategies, we find that undirected planning can degrade performance through noise introduction, while premise abduction emerges as a promising approach due to its logical constraints. Additionally, LLMs' zero-shot self-reflection capabilities consistently improve grounding quality. These insights provide valuable direction for developing more effective integrative grounding systems.</description>

      <title>Train to Defend: First Defense Against Cryptanalytic Neural Network Parameter Extraction Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural networks are valuable intellectual property due to the significant computational cost, expert labor, and proprietary data involved in their development. Consequently, protecting their parameters is critical not only for maintaining a competitive advantage but also for enhancing the model's security and privacy. Prior works have demonstrated the growing capability of cryptanalytic attacks to scale to deeper models. In this paper, we present the first defense mechanism against cryptanalytic parameter extraction attacks. Our key insight is to eliminate the neuron uniqueness necessary for these attacks to succeed. We achieve this by a novel, extraction-aware training method. Specifically, we augment the standard loss function with an additional regularization term that minimizes the distance between neuron weights within a layer. Therefore, the proposed defense has zero area-delay overhead during inference. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach in mitigating extraction attacks while analyzing the model accuracy across different architectures and datasets. When re-trained with the same model architecture, the results show that our defense incurs a marginal accuracy change of less than 1% with the modified loss function. Moreover, we present a theoretical framework to quantify the success probability of the attack. When tested comprehensively with prior attack settings, our defense demonstrated empirical success for sustained periods of extraction, whereas unprotected networks are extracted between 14 minutes to 4 hours.</description>

      <title>TranTac: Leveraging Transient Tactile Signals for Contact-Rich Robotic Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robotic manipulation tasks such as inserting a key into a lock or plugging a USB device into a port can fail when visual perception is insufficient to detect misalignment. In these situations, touch sensing is crucial for the robot to monitor the task's states and make precise, timely adjustments. Current touch sensing solutions are either insensitive to detect subtle changes or demand excessive sensor data. Here, we introduce TranTac, a data-efficient and low-cost tactile sensing and control framework that integrates a single contact-sensitive 6-axis inertial measurement unit within the elastomeric tips of a robotic gripper for completing fine insertion tasks. Our customized sensing system can detect dynamic translational and torsional deformations at the micrometer scale, enabling the tracking of visually imperceptible pose changes of the grasped object. By leveraging transformer-based encoders and diffusion policy, TranTac can imitate human insertion behaviors using transient tactile cues detected at the gripper's tip during insertion processes. These cues enable the robot to dynamically control and correct the 6-DoF pose of the grasped object. When combined with vision, TranTac achieves an average success rate of 79% on object grasping and insertion tasks, outperforming both vision-only policy and the one augmented with end-effector 6D force/torque sensing. Contact localization performance is also validated through tactile-only misaligned insertion tasks, achieving an average success rate of 88%. We assess the generalizability by training TranTac on a single prism-slot pair and testing it on unseen data, including a USB plug and a metal key, and find that the insertion tasks can still be completed with an average success rate of nearly 70%. The proposed framework may inspire new robotic tactile sensing systems for delicate manipulation tasks.</description>

      <title>Rethinking the Role of Text Complexity in Language Model Pretraining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Improving pretraining data quality and size is known to boost downstream performance, but the role of text complexity is less explored. Text complexity refers to how hard a text is to read, and is typically estimated from surface cues such as sentence length, word choice, and sentence structure. We reduce surface-level complexity--shorter sentences, simpler words, simpler structure--while keeping core text content close to constant, and ask: (1) How does complexity affect language modeling across model sizes? (2) Can useful representations be learned from simpler text alone? (3) How does pretraining text complexity influence downstream language understanding? To answer these questions, we simplify human-written texts using a large language model, then pretrain causal models (28M-500M) from scratch on both original and simplified data, and evaluate them in finetuning and zero-shot setups. We find that perplexity is sensitive to the interaction between model capacity and text complexity--smaller models degrade far less on simpler texts--while text complexity has little impact on finetuning evaluations, with zero-shot evaluations indicating that simpler texts benefit performance on linguistic knowledge tasks, whereas more complex texts favor tasks requiring world knowledge and entity tracking.</description>

      <title>V-CECE: Visual Counterfactual Explanations via Conceptual Edits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent black-box counterfactual generation frameworks fail to take into account the semantic content of the proposed edits, while relying heavily on training to guide the generation process. We propose a novel, plug-and-play black-box counterfactual generation framework, which suggests step-by-step edits based on theoretical guarantees of optimal edits to produce human-level counterfactual explanations with zero training. Our framework utilizes a pre-trained image editing diffusion model, and operates without access to the internals of the classifier, leading to an explainable counterfactual generation process. Throughout our experimentation, we showcase the explanatory gap between human reasoning and neural model behavior by utilizing both Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Vision Transformer (ViT) and Large Vision Language Model (LVLM) classifiers, substantiated through a comprehensive human evaluation.</description>

      <title>From Scores to Steps: Diagnosing and Improving LLM Performance in Evidence-Based Medical Calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated promising performance on medical benchmarks; however, their ability to perform medical calculations, a crucial aspect of clinical decision-making, remains underexplored and poorly evaluated. Existing benchmarks often assess only the final answer with a wide numerical tolerance, overlooking systematic reasoning failures and potentially causing serious clinical misjudgments. In this work, we revisit medical calculation evaluation with a stronger focus on clinical trustworthiness. First, we clean and restructure the MedCalc-Bench dataset and propose a new step-by-step evaluation pipeline that independently assesses formula selection, entity extraction, and arithmetic computation. Under this granular framework, the accuracy of GPT-4o drops from 62.7% to 43.6%, revealing errors masked by prior evaluations. Second, we introduce an automatic error analysis framework that generates structured attribution for each failure mode. Human evaluation confirms its alignment with expert judgment, enabling scalable and explainable diagnostics. Finally, we propose a modular agentic pipeline, MedRaC, that combines retrieval-augmented generation and Python-based code execution. Without any fine-tuning, MedRaC improves the accuracy of different LLMs from 16.35% up to 53.19%. Our work highlights the limitations of current benchmark practices and proposes a more clinically faithful methodology. By enabling transparent and transferable reasoning evaluation, we move closer to making LLM-based systems trustworthy for real-world medical applications.</description>

      <title>SQS: Enhancing Sparse Perception Models via Query-based Splatting in Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sparse Perception Models (SPMs) adopt a query-driven paradigm that forgoes explicit dense BEV or volumetric construction, enabling highly efficient computation and accelerated inference. In this paper, we introduce SQS, a novel query-based splatting pre-training specifically designed to advance SPMs in autonomous driving. SQS introduces a plug-in module that predicts 3D Gaussian representations from sparse queries during pre-training, leveraging self-supervised splatting to learn fine-grained contextual features through the reconstruction of multi-view images and depth maps. During fine-tuning, the pre-trained Gaussian queries are seamlessly integrated into downstream networks via query interaction mechanisms that explicitly connect pre-trained queries with task-specific queries, effectively accommodating the diverse requirements of occupancy prediction and 3D object detection. Extensive experiments on autonomous driving benchmarks demonstrate that SQS delivers considerable performance gains across multiple query-based 3D perception tasks, notably in occupancy prediction and 3D object detection, outperforming prior state-of-the-art pre-training approaches by a significant margin (i.e., +1.3 mIoU on occupancy prediction and +1.0 NDS on 3D detection).</description>

Abstract: Recent speech-LLMs have shown impressive performance in tasks like transcription and translation, yet they remain limited in understanding the paralinguistic aspects of speech crucial for social and emotional intelligence. We propose CP-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating speech-LLMs on contextual paralinguistic reasoning the integration of verbal content with non-verbal cues like emotion and prosody. The benchmark includes two curated question answering (QA) datasets requiring both linguistic and empathetic understanding. We evaluate state-of-the-art speech-LLMs from both open and closed-source models and perform a comprehensive analysis across different question types. The top two models were further analyzed under temperature tuning to understand its effect on this task. Our benchmark reveals a key gap in existing evaluations and offers insights into building more context-aware and emotionally intelligent speech-capable LLMs.</description>

      <title>Analyzing the Effects of Supervised Fine-Tuning on Model Knowledge from Token and Parameter Levels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) acquire substantial world knowledge during pre-training, which is further shaped by post-training techniques such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT). However, the impact of SFT on a model's knowledge remains underexplored, limiting our ability to control knowledge change behavior in fine-tuned models. To address this gap, we evaluate closed-book question answering (CBQA) performance across five LLMs from the LLaMA-2 and LLaMA-3 families. Surprisingly, models fine-tuned on 1,920 samples perform up to 14% worse than those fine-tuned on only 240 samples. Furthermore, varying the level of knowledge mastery in the fine-tuning data leads to performance fluctuations of over 12%. To investigate these effects, we analyze model behavior at both the token and parameter levels. Our analysis reveals that up to 90% of parameter updates during SFT do not contribute to knowledge enhancement. Restoring these updates can improve performance on the CBQA task, depending on the characteristics of the fine-tuning data. These insights offer practical guidance for developing fine-tuning strategies that more effectively strengthen model knowledge.</description>

      <title>PruneCD: Contrasting Pruned Self Model to Improve Decoding Factuality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To mitigate the hallucination problem in large language models, DoLa exploits early exit logits from the same model as a contrastive prior. However, we found that these early exit logits tend to be flat, low in magnitude, and fail to reflect meaningful contrasts. To address this, we propose PruneCD, a novel contrastive decoding method that constructs the amateur model via layer pruning rather than early exit. This design leads to more informative and well-aligned logits, enabling more effective contrastive decoding. Through qualitative and quantitative analyses, we demonstrate that PruneCD consistently improves factuality with minimal inference overhead, offering a robust and practical approach to mitigating hallucinations in LLMs.</description>

      <title>FakeChain: Exposing Shallow Cues in Multi-Step Deepfake Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-step or hybrid deepfakes, created by sequentially applying different deepfake creation methods such as Face-Swapping, GAN-based generation, and Diffusion methods, can pose an emerging and unforseen technical challenge for detection models trained on single-step forgeries. While prior studies have mainly focused on detecting isolated single manipulation, little is known about the detection model behavior under such compositional, hybrid, and complex manipulation pipelines. In this work, we introduce \textbf{FakeChain}, a large-scale benchmark comprising 1-, 2-, and 3-Step forgeries synthesized using five state-of-the-art representative generators. Using this approach, we analyze detection performance and spectral properties across hybrid manipulation at different step, along with varying generator combinations and quality settings. Surprisingly, our findings reveal that detection performance highly depends on the final manipulation type, with F1-score dropping by up to \textbf{58.83\%} when it differs from training distribution. This clearly demonstrates that detectors rely on last-stage artifacts rather than cumulative manipulation traces, limiting generalization. Such findings highlight the need for detection models to explicitly consider manipulation history and sequences. Our results highlight the importance of benchmarks such as FakeChain, reflecting growing synthesis complexity and diversity in real-world scenarios. Our sample code is available here\footnote{https://github.com/minjihh/FakeChain}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As urbanization and climate change progress, urban heat island effects are becoming more frequent and severe. To formulate effective mitigation plans, cities require detailed air temperature data. However, predictive analytics methods based on conventional machine learning models and limited data infrastructure often provide inaccurate predictions, especially in underserved areas. In this context, geospatial foundation models trained on unstructured global data demonstrate strong generalization and require minimal fine-tuning, offering an alternative for predictions where traditional approaches are limited. This study fine-tunes a geospatial foundation model to predict urban land surface temperatures under future climate scenarios and explores its response to land cover changes using simulated vegetation strategies. The fine-tuned model achieved pixel-wise downscaling errors below 1.74 {\deg}C and aligned with ground truth patterns, demonstrating an extrapolation capacity up to 3.62 {\deg}C.</description>

      <title>Surgical-MambaLLM: Mamba2-enhanced Multimodal Large Language Model for VQLA in Robotic Surgery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, Visual Question Localized-Answering in robotic surgery (Surgical-VQLA) has gained significant attention for its potential to assist medical students and junior doctors in understanding surgical scenes. Recently, the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs) has provided more promising solutions for this task. However, current methods struggle to establish complex dependencies between text and visual details, and have difficulty perceiving the spatial information of surgical scenes. To address these challenges, we propose a novel method, Surgical-MambaLLM, which is the first to combine Mamba2 with LLM in the surgical domain, that leverages Mamba2's ability to effectively capture cross-modal dependencies and perceive spatial information in surgical scenes, thereby enhancing the LLMs' understanding of surgical images. Specifically, we propose the Cross-modal Bidirectional Mamba2 Integration (CBMI) module to leverage Mamba2 for effective multimodal fusion, with its cross-modal integration capabilities. Additionally, tailored to the geometric characteristics of surgical scenes, we design the Surgical Instrument Perception (SIP) scanning mode for Mamba2 to scan the surgical images, enhancing the model's spatial understanding of the surgical scene. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our Surgical-MambaLLM model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the EndoVis17-VQLA and EndoVis18-VQLA datasets, significantly improving the performance of the Surgical-VQLA task.</description>

      <title>Audio-Conditioned Diffusion LLMs for ASR and Deliberation Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion-based large language models (DLLMs) have recently attracted growing interest as an alternative to autoregressive decoders. In this work, we present an empirical study on using the diffusion-based large language model LLaDA for automatic speech recognition (ASR). We first investigate its use as an external deliberation-based processing module for Whisper-LLaMA transcripts. By leveraging the bidirectional attention and denoising capabilities of LLaDA, we explore random masking, low-confidence masking, and semi-autoregressive strategies, showing that Whisper-LLaDA substantially reduces WER compared with the baseline. On LibriSpeech, the best cascade system achieves 2.25%/4.94% WER on test-clean/test-other, representing a 12.3% relative improvement over the Whisper-LLaMA baseline on the test-other split. In contrast, a plain-text LLaDA without acoustic features fails to improve accuracy, highlighting the importance of audio-conditioned embeddings. We further evaluate Whisper-LLaDA as a standalone decoder for ASR with diffusion-based and semi-autoregressive decoding. Most experimental configurations achieve faster inference than the Whisper-LLaMA baseline, although recognition accuracy is slightly lower. These findings offer an empirical view of diffusion-based LLMs for ASR and point to promising directions for improvements.</description>

      <title>When Big Models Train Small Ones: Label-Free Model Parity Alignment for Efficient Visual Question Answering using Small VLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (L-VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in various vision and language tasks, including visual question answering (VQA). However, their high computational cost makes them impractical for resource-constrained settings and inference-heavy applications. In contrast, Small Vision-Language Models (S-VLMs) offer efficiency but suffer from a significant performance gap compared to their larger counterparts. In this work, we introduce the Model Parity Aligner (MPA), a novel framework designed to systematically improve S-VLMs by leveraging unlabeled images and effective knowledge transfer from L-VLMs. Instead of traditional knowledge distillation methods that rely on labeled training data, MPA employs a strategic parity-based approach that precisely identifies the knowledge disparities between S-VLMs and L-VLMs, and optimizes training by targeting only these disparities. We conduct extensive experiments on four diverse VQA benchmarks, namely TextVQA, ST-VQA, ChartQA, and OKVQA, each of which requires specialized reasoning capabilities such as text recognition, chart interpretation, and commonsense and factual understanding. Our results demonstrate that MPA consistently enhances the performance of S-VLMs on all benchmarks, reducing the performance gap while maintaining computational efficiency. We make our code publicly available.</description>

      <title>KungfuBot2: Learning Versatile Motion Skills for Humanoid Whole-Body Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning versatile whole-body skills by tracking various human motions is a fundamental step toward general-purpose humanoid robots. This task is particularly challenging because a single policy must master a broad repertoire of motion skills while ensuring stability over long-horizon sequences. To this end, we present VMS, a unified whole-body controller that enables humanoid robots to learn diverse and dynamic behaviors within a single policy. Our framework integrates a hybrid tracking objective that balances local motion fidelity with global trajectory consistency, and an Orthogonal Mixture-of-Experts (OMoE) architecture that encourages skill specialization while enhancing generalization across motions. A segment-level tracking reward is further introduced to relax rigid step-wise matching, enhancing robustness when handling global displacements and transient inaccuracies. We validate VMS extensively in both simulation and real-world experiments, demonstrating accurate imitation of dynamic skills, stable performance over minute-long sequences, and strong generalization to unseen motions. These results highlight the potential of VMS as a scalable foundation for versatile humanoid whole-body control. The project page is available at https://kungfubot2-humanoid.github.io.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This report presents the AISTAT team's submission to the language-based audio retrieval task in DCASE 2025 Task 6. Our proposed system employs dual encoder architecture, where audio and text modalities are encoded separately, and their representations are aligned using contrastive learning. Drawing inspiration from methodologies of the previous year's challenge, we implemented a distillation approach and leveraged large language models (LLMs) for effective data augmentation techniques, including back-translation and LLM mix. Additionally, we incorporated clustering to introduce an auxiliary classification task for further finetuning. Our best single system achieved a mAP@16 of 46.62, while an ensemble of four systems reached a mAP@16 of 48.83 on the Clotho development test split.</description>

      <title>On the de-duplication of the Lakh MIDI dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A large-scale dataset is essential for training a well-generalized deep-learning model. Most such datasets are collected via scraping from various internet sources, inevitably introducing duplicated data. In the symbolic music domain, these duplicates often come from multiple user arrangements and metadata changes after simple editing. However, despite critical issues such as unreliable training evaluation from data leakage during random splitting, dataset duplication has not been extensively addressed in the MIR community. This study investigates the dataset duplication issues regarding Lakh MIDI Dataset (LMD), one of the largest publicly available sources in the symbolic music domain. To find and evaluate the best retrieval method for duplicated data, we employed the Clean MIDI subset of the LMD as a benchmark test set, in which different versions of the same songs are grouped together. We first evaluated rule-based approaches and previous symbolic music retrieval models for de-duplication and also investigated with a contrastive learning-based BERT model with various augmentations to find duplicate files. As a result, we propose three different versions of the filtered list of LMD, which filters out at least 38,134 samples in the most conservative settings among 178,561 files.</description>

      <title>Governed By Agents: A Survey On The Role Of Agentic AI In Future Computing Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emergence of agentic Artificial Intelligence (AI), which can operate autonomously, demonstrate goal-directed behavior, and adaptively learn, indicates the onset of a massive change in today's computing infrastructure. This study investigates how agentic AI models' multiple characteristics may impact the architecture, governance, and operation under which computing environments function. Agentic AI has the potential to reduce reliance on extremely large (public) cloud environments due to resource efficiency, especially with processing and/or storage. The aforementioned characteristics provide us with an opportunity to canvas the likelihood of strategic migration in computing infrastructures away from massive public cloud services, towards more locally distributed architectures: edge computing and on-premises computing infrastructures. Many of these likely migrations will be spurred by factors like on-premises processing needs, diminished data consumption footprints, and cost savings. This study examines how a solution for implementing AI's autonomy could result in a re-architecture of the systems and model a departure from today's governance models to help us manage these increasingly autonomous agents, and an operational overhaul of processes over a very diverse computing systems landscape that bring together computing via cloud, edge, and on-premises computing solutions. To enable us to explore these intertwined decisions, it will be fundamentally important to understand how to best position agentic AI, and to navigate the future state of computing infrastructures.</description>

      <title>ProtoVQA: An Adaptable Prototypical Framework for Explainable Fine-Grained Visual Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Visual Question Answering (VQA) is increasingly used in diverse applications ranging from general visual reasoning to safety-critical domains such as medical imaging and autonomous systems, where models must provide not only accurate answers but also explanations that humans can easily understand and verify. Prototype-based modeling has shown promise for interpretability by grounding predictions in semantically meaningful regions for purely visual reasoning tasks, yet remains underexplored in the context of VQA. We present ProtoVQA, a unified prototypical framework that (i) learns question-aware prototypes that serve as reasoning anchors, connecting answers to discriminative image regions, (ii) applies spatially constrained matching to ensure that the selected evidence is coherent and semantically relevant, and (iii) supports both answering and grounding tasks through a shared prototype backbone. To assess explanation quality, we propose the Visual-Linguistic Alignment Score (VLAS), which measures how well the model's attended regions align with ground-truth evidence. Experiments on Visual7W show that ProtoVQA yields faithful, fine-grained explanations while maintaining competitive accuracy, advancing the development of transparent and trustworthy VQA systems.</description>

      <title>Design and Development of an Intelligent LLM-based LDAP Honeypot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cybersecurity threats continue to increase, with a growing number of previously unknown attacks each year targeting both large corporations and smaller entities. This scenario demands the implementation of advanced security measures, not only to mitigate damage but also to anticipate emerging attack trends. In this context, deception tools have become a key strategy, enabling the detection, deterrence, and deception of potential attackers while facilitating the collection of information about their tactics and methods. Among these tools, honeypots have proven their value, although they have traditionally been limited by rigidity and configuration complexity, hindering their adaptability to dynamic scenarios. The rise of artificial intelligence, and particularly general-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs), is driving the development of new deception solutions capable of offering greater adaptability and ease of use. This work proposes the design and implementation of an LLM-based honeypot to simulate an LDAP server, a critical protocol present in most organizations due to its central role in identity and access management. The proposed solution aims to provide a flexible and realistic tool capable of convincingly interacting with attackers, thereby contributing to early detection and threat analysis while enhancing the defensive capabilities of infrastructures against intrusions targeting this service.</description>

      <title>Text-Scene: A Scene-to-Language Parsing Framework for 3D Scene Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Enabling agents to understand and interact with complex 3D scenes is a fundamental challenge for embodied artificial intelligence systems. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved significant progress in 2D image understanding, extending such capabilities to 3D scenes remains difficult: 1) 3D environment involves richer concepts such as spatial relationships, affordances, physics, layout, and so on, 2) the absence of large-scale 3D vision-language datasets has posed a significant obstacle. In this paper, we introduce Text-Scene, a framework that automatically parses 3D scenes into textual descriptions for scene understanding. Given a 3D scene, our model identifies object attributes and spatial relationships, and then generates a coherent summary of the whole scene, bridging the gap between 3D observation and language without requiring human-in-the-loop intervention. By leveraging both geometric analysis and MLLMs, Text-Scene produces descriptions that are accurate, detailed, and human-interpretable, capturing object-level details and global-level context. Experimental results on benchmarks demonstrate that our textual parses can faithfully represent 3D scenes and benefit downstream tasks. To evaluate the reasoning capability of MLLMs, we present InPlan3D, a comprehensive benchmark for 3D task planning, consisting of 3174 long-term planning tasks across 636 indoor scenes. We emphasize clarity and accessibility in our approach, aiming to make 3D scene content understandable through language. Code and datasets will be released.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid PCA-PR-Seq2Seq-Adam-LSTM Framework for Time-Series Power Outage Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately forecasting power outages is a complex task influenced by diverse factors such as weather conditions [1], vegetation, wildlife, and load fluctuations. These factors introduce substantial variability and noise into outage data, making reliable prediction challenging. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), are particularly effective for modeling nonlinear and dynamic time-series data, with proven applications in stock price forecasting [2], energy demand prediction, demand response [3], and traffic flow management [4]. This paper introduces a hybrid deep learning framework, termed PCA-PR-Seq2Seq-Adam-LSTM, that integrates Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Poisson Regression (PR), a Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq) architecture, and an Adam-optimized LSTM. PCA is employed to reduce dimensionality and stabilize data variance, while Poisson Regression effectively models discrete outage events. The Seq2Seq-Adam-LSTM component enhances temporal feature learning through efficient gradient optimization and long-term dependency capture. The framework is evaluated using real-world outage records from Michigan, and results indicate that the proposed approach significantly improves forecasting accuracy and robustness compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>CAMBench-QR : A Structure-Aware Benchmark for Post-Hoc Explanations with QR Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Visual explanations are often plausible but not structurally faithful. We introduce CAMBench-QR, a structure-aware benchmark that leverages the canonical geometry of QR codes (finder patterns, timing lines, module grid) to test whether CAM methods place saliency on requisite substructures while avoiding background. CAMBench-QR synthesizes QR/non-QR data with exact masks and controlled distortions, and reports structure-aware metrics (Finder/Timing Mass Ratios, Background Leakage, coverage AUCs, Distance-to-Structure) alongside causal occlusion, insertion/deletion faithfulness, robustness, and latency. We benchmark representative, efficient CAMs (LayerCAM, EigenGrad-CAM, XGrad-CAM) under two practical regimes of zero-shot and last-block fine-tuning. The benchmark, metrics, and training recipes provide a simple, reproducible yardstick for structure-aware evaluation of visual explanations. Hence we propose that CAMBENCH-QR can be used as a litmus test of whether visual explanations are truly structure-aware.</description>

      <title>The Sound of Syntax: Finetuning and Comprehensive Evaluation of Language Models for Speech Pathology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: According to the U.S. National Institutes of Health, more than 3.4 million children experience speech disorders that require clinical intervention. The number of speech-language pathologists (SLPs) is roughly 20 times fewer than the number of affected children, highlighting a significant gap in children's care and a pressing need for technological support that improves the productivity of SLPs. State-of-the-art multimodal language models (MLMs) show promise for supporting SLPs, but their use remains underexplored largely due to a limited understanding of their performance in high-stakes clinical settings. To address this gap, we collaborate with domain experts to develop a taxonomy of real-world use cases of MLMs in speech-language pathologies. Building on this taxonomy, we introduce the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating MLM across five core use cases, each containing 1,000 manually annotated data points. This benchmark includes robustness and sensitivity tests under various settings, including background noise, speaker gender, and accent. Our evaluation of 15 state-of-the-art MLMs reveals that no single model consistently outperforms others across all tasks. Notably, we find systematic disparities, with models performing better on male speakers, and observe that chain-of-thought prompting can degrade performance on classification tasks with large label spaces and narrow decision boundaries. Furthermore, we study fine-tuning MLMs on domain-specific data, achieving improvements of over 30% compared to base models. These findings highlight both the potential and limitations of current MLMs for speech-language pathology applications, underscoring the need for further research and targeted development.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many real world categories are multimodal, with single classes occupying disjoint regions in feature space. Classical linear models (logistic regression, linear SVM) use a single global hyperplane and perform poorly on such data, while high-capacity methods (kernel SVMs, deep nets) fit multimodal structure but at the expense of interpretability, heavier tuning, and higher computational cost. We propose the Geometric Mixture Classifier (GMC), a discriminative model that represents each class as a mixture of hyperplanes. Within each class, GMC combines plane scores via a temperature-controlled soft-OR (log-sum-exp), smoothly approximating the max; across classes, standard softmax yields probabilistic posteriors. GMC optionally uses Random Fourier Features (RFF) for nonlinear mappings while keeping inference linear in the number of planes and features. Our practical training recipe: geometry-aware k-means initialization, silhouette-based plane budgeting, alpha annealing, usage-aware L2 regularization, label smoothing, and early stopping, makes GMC plug-and-play. Across synthetic multimodal datasets (moons, circles, blobs, spirals) and tabular/image benchmarks (iris, wine, WDBC, digits), GMC consistently outperforms linear baselines and k-NN, is competitive with RBF-SVM, Random Forests, and small MLPs, and provides geometric introspection via per-plane and class responsibility visualizations. Inference scales linearly in planes and features, making GMC CPU-friendly, with single-digit microsecond latency per example, often faster than RBF-SVM and compact MLPs. Post-hoc temperature scaling reduces ECE from about 0.06 to 0.02. GMC thus strikes a favorable balance of accuracy, interpretability, and efficiency: it is more expressive than linear models and lighter, more transparent, and faster than kernel or deep models.</description>

      <title>Comparing RAG and GraphRAG for Page-Level Retrieval Question Answering on Math Textbook</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Technology-enhanced learning environments often help students retrieve relevant learning content for questions arising during self-paced study. Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as novel aids for information retrieval during learning. While LLMs are effective for general-purpose question-answering, they typically lack alignment with the domain knowledge of specific course materials such as textbooks and slides. We investigate Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and GraphRAG, a knowledge graph-enhanced RAG approach, for page-level question answering in an undergraduate mathematics textbook. While RAG has been effective for retrieving discrete, contextually relevant passages, GraphRAG may excel in modeling interconnected concepts and hierarchical knowledge structures. We curate a dataset of 477 question-answer pairs, each tied to a distinct textbook page. We then compare the standard embedding-based RAG methods to GraphRAG for evaluating both retrieval accuracy-whether the correct page is retrieved-and generated answer quality via F1 scores. Our findings show that embedding-based RAG achieves higher retrieval accuracy and better F1 scores compared to GraphRAG, which tends to retrieve excessive and sometimes irrelevant content due to its entity-based structure. We also explored re-ranking the retrieved pages with LLM and observed mixed results, including performance drop and hallucinations when dealing with larger context windows. Overall, this study highlights both the promises and challenges of page-level retrieval systems in educational contexts, emphasizing the need for more refined retrieval methods to build reliable AI tutoring solutions in providing reference page numbers.</description>

      <title>Domain-Adaptive Pre-Training for Arabic Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis: A Comparative Study of Domain Adaptation and Fine-Tuning Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) in natural language processing enables organizations to understand customer opinions on specific product aspects. While deep learning models are widely used for English ABSA, their application in Arabic is limited due to the scarcity of labeled data. Researchers have attempted to tackle this issue by using pre-trained contextualized language models such as BERT. However, these models are often based on fact-based data, which can introduce bias in domain-specific tasks like ABSA. To our knowledge, no studies have applied adaptive pre-training with Arabic contextualized models for ABSA. This research proposes a novel approach using domain-adaptive pre-training for aspect-sentiment classification (ASC) and opinion target expression (OTE) extraction. We examine fine-tuning strategies - feature extraction, full fine-tuning, and adapter-based methods - to enhance performance and efficiency, utilizing multiple adaptation corpora and contextualized models. Our results show that in-domain adaptive pre-training yields modest improvements. Adapter-based fine-tuning is a computationally efficient method that achieves competitive results. However, error analyses reveal issues with model predictions and dataset labeling. In ASC, common problems include incorrect sentiment labeling, misinterpretation of contrastive markers, positivity bias for early terms, and challenges with conflicting opinions and subword tokenization. For OTE, issues involve mislabeling targets, confusion over syntactic roles, difficulty with multi-word expressions, and reliance on shallow heuristics. These findings underscore the need for syntax- and semantics-aware models, such as graph convolutional networks, to more effectively capture long-distance relations and complex aspect-based opinion alignments.</description>

      <title>KuBERT: Central Kurdish BERT Model and Its Application for Sentiment Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper enhances the study of sentiment analysis for the Central Kurdish language by integrating the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) into Natural Language Processing techniques. Kurdish is a low-resourced language, having a high level of linguistic diversity with minimal computational resources, making sentiment analysis somewhat challenging. Earlier, this was done using a traditional word embedding model, such as Word2Vec, but with the emergence of new language models, specifically BERT, there is hope for improvements. The better word embedding capabilities of BERT lend to this study, aiding in the capturing of the nuanced semantic pool and the contextual intricacies of the language under study, the Kurdish language, thus setting a new benchmark for sentiment analysis in low-resource languages.</description>

      <title>SMART-3D: Three-Dimensional Self-Morphing Adaptive Replanning Tree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents SMART-3D, an extension of the SMART algorithm to 3D environments. SMART-3D is a tree-based adaptive replanning algorithm for dynamic environments with fast moving obstacles. SMART-3D morphs the underlying tree to find a new path in real-time whenever the current path is blocked by obstacles. SMART-3D removed the grid decomposition requirement of the SMART algorithm by replacing the concept of hot-spots with that of hot-nodes, thus making it computationally efficient and scalable to 3D environments. The hot-nodes are nodes which allow for efficient reconnections to morph the existing tree to find a new safe and reliable path. The performance of SMART-3D is evaluated by extensive simulations in 2D and 3D environments populated with randomly moving dynamic obstacles. The results show that SMART-3D achieves high success rates and low replanning times, thus highlighting its suitability for real-time onboard applications.</description>

      <title>KANO: Kolmogorov-Arnold Neural Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Kolmogorov--Arnold Neural Operator (KANO), a dual-domain neural operator jointly parameterized by both spectral and spatial bases with intrinsic symbolic interpretability. We theoretically demonstrate that KANO overcomes the pure-spectral bottleneck of Fourier Neural Operator (FNO): KANO remains expressive over generic position-dependent dynamics for any physical input, whereas FNO stays practical only for spectrally sparse operators and strictly imposes a fast-decaying input Fourier tail. We verify our claims empirically on position-dependent differential operators, for which KANO robustly generalizes but FNO fails to. In the quantum Hamiltonian learning benchmark, KANO reconstructs ground-truth Hamiltonians in closed-form symbolic representations accurate to the fourth decimal place in coefficients and attains $\approx 6\times10^{-6}$ state infidelity from projective measurement data, substantially outperforming that of the FNO trained with ideal full wave function data, $\approx 1.5\times10^{-2}$, by orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Robot Learning with Sparsity and Scarcity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unlike in language or vision, one of the fundamental challenges in robot learning is the lack of access to vast data resources. We can further break down the problem into (1) data sparsity from the angle of data representation and (2) data scarcity from the angle of data quantity. In this thesis, I will discuss selected works on two domains: (1) tactile sensing and (2) rehabilitation robots, which are exemplars of data sparsity and scarcity, respectively. Tactile sensing is an essential modality for robotics, but tactile data are often sparse, and for each interaction with the physical world, tactile sensors can only obtain information about the local area of contact. I will discuss my work on learning vision-free tactile-only exploration and manipulation policies through model-free reinforcement learning to make efficient use of sparse tactile information. On the other hand, rehabilitation robots are an example of data scarcity to the extreme due to the significant challenge of collecting biosignals from disabled-bodied subjects at scale for training. I will discuss my work in collaboration with the medical school and clinicians on intent inferral for stroke survivors, where a hand orthosis developed in our lab collects a set of biosignals from the patient and uses them to infer the activity that the patient intends to perform, so the orthosis can provide the right type of physical assistance at the right moment. My work develops machine learning algorithms that enable intent inferral with minimal data, including semi-supervised, meta-learning, and generative AI methods.</description>

      <title>Semantic-Driven Topic Modeling for Analyzing Creativity in Virtual Brainstorming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Virtual brainstorming sessions have become a central component of collaborative problem solving, yet the large volume and uneven distribution of ideas often make it difficult to extract valuable insights efficiently. Manual coding of ideas is time-consuming and subjective, underscoring the need for automated approaches to support the evaluation of group creativity. In this study, we propose a semantic-driven topic modeling framework that integrates four modular components: transformer-based embeddings (Sentence-BERT), dimensionality reduction (UMAP), clustering (HDBSCAN), and topic extraction with refinement. The framework captures semantic similarity at the sentence level, enabling the discovery of coherent themes from brainstorming transcripts while filtering noise and identifying outliers. We evaluate our approach on structured Zoom brainstorming sessions involving student groups tasked with improving their university. Results demonstrate that our model achieves higher topic coherence compared to established methods such as LDA, ETM, and BERTopic, with an average coherence score of 0.687 (CV), outperforming baselines by a significant margin. Beyond improved performance, the model provides interpretable insights into the depth and diversity of topics explored, supporting both convergent and divergent dimensions of group creativity. This work highlights the potential of embedding-based topic modeling for analyzing collaborative ideation and contributes an efficient and scalable framework for studying creativity in synchronous virtual meetings.</description>

      <title>ShadowServe: Interference-Free KV Cache Fetching for Distributed Prefix Caching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Distributed prefix caching accelerates long-context LLM serving by reusing KV cache entries for common context prefixes. However, KV cache fetches can become a bottleneck when network bandwidth is limited. Compression mitigates the bandwidth issue, but can degrade overall performance when decompression interferes with model computation.
  We present ShadowServe, the first SmartNIC-accelerated, interference-free prefix caching system for LLM serving. ShadowServe separates a control plane on the host and a data plane fully offloaded to the SmartNIC, which eliminates interference to both host GPU and CPU. To overcome the SmartNIC's limited compute and memory resources, we design a chunked pipeline that parallelizes data plane operations across the SmartNIC's compute resources, and a minimal-copy memory management scheme that reduces memory pressure on the SmartNIC. Compared to state-of-the-art solutions, ShadowServe achieves up to 2.2x lower loaded time-per-output-token (TPOT), and reduces time-to-first-token (TTFT) by up to 1.38x in low-bandwidth scenarios (&lt;= 20 Gbps), translating to up to 1.35x higher throughput.</description>

      <title>AdaptiveGuard: Towards Adaptive Runtime Safety for LLM-Powered Software</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Guardrails are critical for the safe deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs)-powered software. Unlike traditional rule-based systems with limited, predefined input-output spaces that inherently constrain unsafe behavior, LLMs enable open-ended, intelligent interactions--opening the door to jailbreak attacks through user inputs. Guardrails serve as a protective layer, filtering unsafe prompts before they reach the LLM. However, prior research shows that jailbreak attacks can still succeed over 70% of the time, even against advanced models like GPT-4o. While guardrails such as LlamaGuard report up to 95% accuracy, our preliminary analysis shows their performance can drop sharply--to as low as 12%--when confronted with unseen attacks. This highlights a growing software engineering challenge: how to build a post-deployment guardrail that adapts dynamically to emerging threats? To address this, we propose AdaptiveGuard, an adaptive guardrail that detects novel jailbreak attacks as out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs and learns to defend against them through a continual learning framework. Through empirical evaluation, AdaptiveGuard achieves 96% OOD detection accuracy, adapts to new attacks in just two update steps, and retains over 85% F1-score on in-distribution data post-adaptation, outperforming other baselines. These results demonstrate that AdaptiveGuard is a guardrail capable of evolving in response to emerging jailbreak strategies post deployment. We release our AdaptiveGuard and studied datasets at https://github.com/awsm-research/AdaptiveGuard to support further research.</description>

      <title>PhysHDR: When Lighting Meets Materials and Scene Geometry in HDR Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low Dynamic Range (LDR) to High Dynamic Range (HDR) image translation is a fundamental task in many computational vision problems. Numerous data-driven methods have been proposed to address this problem; however, they lack explicit modeling of illumination, lighting, and scene geometry in images. This limits the quality of the reconstructed HDR images. Since lighting and shadows interact differently with different materials, (e.g., specular surfaces such as glass and metal, and lambertian or diffuse surfaces such as wood and stone), modeling material-specific properties (e.g., specular and diffuse reflectance) has the potential to improve the quality of HDR image reconstruction. This paper presents PhysHDR, a simple yet powerful latent diffusion-based generative model for HDR image reconstruction. The denoising process is conditioned on lighting and depth information and guided by a novel loss to incorporate material properties of surfaces in the scene. The experimental results establish the efficacy of PhysHDR in comparison to a number of recent state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Expert Specialization: Towards Catastrophic Forgetting-Free Multi-Domain MoE Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models offer immense capacity via sparsely gated expert subnetworks, yet adapting them to multiple domains without catastrophic forgetting remains an open challenge. Existing approaches either incur prohibitive computation, suffer cross-domain interference, or require separate runs per domain. We propose DES-MoE, a dynamic expert specialization framework for multi-domain adaptation of Mixture-of-Experts models. DES-MoE addresses catastrophic forgetting through three innovations: (1) an adaptive router balancing pre-trained knowledge retention and task-specific updates via distillation, (2) real-time expert-domain correlation mapping to isolate domain-specific gradients, and (3) a three-phase adaptive fine-tuning schedule that progressively freezes non-specialized parameters. Evaluated on six domains (math, code, law, etc.), DES-MoE matches single-domain ESFT performance while training one unified model, reduces forgetting by 89% compared to full fine-tuning as domains scale from 2 to 6, and achieves 68% faster convergence than conventional methods. Our work establishes dynamic expert isolation as a scalable paradigm for multi-task MoE adaptation.</description>

      <title>Learning from Gene Names, Expression Values and Images: Contrastive Masked Text-Image Pretraining for Spatial Transcriptomics Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics aims to connect high-resolution histology images with spatially resolved gene expression. To achieve better performance on downstream tasks such as gene expression prediction, large-scale pre-training is required to obtain generalisable representations that can bridge histology and transcriptomics across tissues, protocols, and laboratories. Existing cross-modal pre-training approaches for spatial transcriptomics rely on either gene names or expression values in isolation, which strips the gene branch of essential semantics and breaks the association between each gene and its quantitative magnitude. In addition, by restricting supervision to image-text alignment, these methods ignore intrinsic visual cues that are critical for learning robust image features. We present CoMTIP, the first Contrastive Masked Text-Image Pretraining framework that jointly learns from images, gene names, and expression values while capturing fine-grained visual context for spatial transcriptomics. The vision branch uses Masked Feature Modeling to reconstruct occluded patches and learn context-aware image embeddings. The text branch applies a scalable Gene-Text Encoder that processes all gene sentences in parallel, enriches each gene and its numerical value with dedicated embeddings, and employs Pair-aware Adversarial Training (PAAT) to preserve correct gene-value associations. Image and text representations are aligned in a shared InfoNCE-optimised space. Experiments on public spatial transcriptomics datasets show that CoMTIP not only surpasses previous methods on diverse downstream tasks but also achieves zero-shot gene expression prediction, a capability that existing approaches do not provide.</description>

      <title>ME-Mamba: Multi-Expert Mamba with Efficient Knowledge Capture and Fusion for Multimodal Survival Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Survival analysis using whole-slide images (WSIs) is crucial in cancer research. Despite significant successes, pathology images typically only provide slide-level labels, which hinders the learning of discriminative representations from gigapixel WSIs. With the rapid advancement of high-throughput sequencing technologies, multimodal survival analysis integrating pathology images and genomics data has emerged as a promising approach. We propose a Multi-Expert Mamba (ME-Mamba) system that captures discriminative pathological and genomic features while enabling efficient integration of both modalities. This approach achieves complementary information fusion without losing critical information from individual modalities, thereby facilitating accurate cancer survival analysis. Specifically, we first introduce a Pathology Expert and a Genomics Expert to process unimodal data separately. Both experts are designed with Mamba architectures that incorporate conventional scanning and attention-based scanning mechanisms, allowing them to extract discriminative features from long instance sequences containing substantial redundant or irrelevant information. Second, we design a Synergistic Expert responsible for modality fusion. It explicitly learns token-level local correspondences between the two modalities via Optimal Transport, and implicitly enhances distribution consistency through a global cross-modal fusion loss based on Maximum Mean Discrepancy. The fused feature representations are then passed to a mamba backbone for further integration. Through the collaboration of the Pathology Expert, Genomics Expert, and Synergistic Expert, our method achieves stable and accurate survival analysis with relatively low computational complexity. Extensive experimental results on five datasets in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) demonstrate our state-of-the-art performance.</description>

      <title>FedEL: Federated Elastic Learning for Heterogeneous Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables distributed devices to collaboratively train machine learning models while maintaining data privacy. However, the heterogeneous hardware capabilities of devices often result in significant training delays, as straggler clients with limited resources prolong the aggregation process. Existing solutions such as client selection, asynchronous FL, and partial training partially address these challenges but encounter issues such as reduced accuracy, stale updates, and compromised model performance due to inconsistent training contributions. To overcome these limitations, we propose FedEL, a federated elastic learning framework that enhances training efficiency while maintaining model accuracy. FedEL introduces a novel window-based training process, sliding the window to locate the training part of the model and dynamically selecting important tensors for training within a coordinated runtime budget. This approach ensures progressive and balanced training across all clients, including stragglers. Additionally, FedEL employs a tensor importance adjustment module, harmonizing local and global tensor importance to mitigate biases caused by data heterogeneity. The experiment results show that FedEL achieves up to 3.87x improvement in time-to-accuracy compared to baselines while maintaining or exceeding final test accuracy.</description>

      <title>PGSTalker: Real-Time Audio-Driven Talking Head Generation via 3D Gaussian Splatting with Pixel-Aware Density Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Audio-driven talking head generation is crucial for applications in virtual reality, digital avatars, and film production. While NeRF-based methods enable high-fidelity reconstruction, they suffer from low rendering efficiency and suboptimal audio-visual synchronization. This work presents PGSTalker, a real-time audio-driven talking head synthesis framework based on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). To improve rendering performance, we propose a pixel-aware density control strategy that adaptively allocates point density, enhancing detail in dynamic facial regions while reducing redundancy elsewhere. Additionally, we introduce a lightweight Multimodal Gated Fusion Module to effectively fuse audio and spatial features, thereby improving the accuracy of Gaussian deformation prediction. Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate that PGSTalker outperforms existing NeRF- and 3DGS-based approaches in rendering quality, lip-sync precision, and inference speed. Our method exhibits strong generalization capabilities and practical potential for real-world deployment.</description>

      <title>Cross-Attention with Confidence Weighting for Multi-Channel Audio Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-channel audio alignment is a key requirement in bioacoustic monitoring, spatial audio systems, and acoustic localization. However, existing methods often struggle to address nonlinear clock drift and lack mechanisms for quantifying uncertainty. Traditional methods like Cross-correlation and Dynamic Time Warping assume simple drift patterns and provide no reliability measures. Meanwhile, recent deep learning models typically treat alignment as a binary classification task, overlooking inter-channel dependencies and uncertainty estimation. We introduce a method that combines cross-attention mechanisms with confidence-weighted scoring to improve multi-channel audio synchronization. We extend BEATs encoders with cross-attention layers to model temporal relationships between channels. We also develop a confidence-weighted scoring function that uses the full prediction distribution instead of binary thresholding. Our method achieved first place in the BioDCASE 2025 Task 1 challenge with 0.30 MSE average across test datasets, compared to 0.58 for the deep learning baseline. On individual datasets, we achieved 0.14 MSE on ARU data (77% reduction) and 0.45 MSE on zebra finch data (18% reduction). The framework supports probabilistic temporal alignment, moving beyond point estimates. While validated in a bioacoustic context, the approach is applicable to a broader range of multi-channel audio tasks where alignment confidence is critical.

      <title>Equip Pre-ranking with Target Attention by Residual Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The pre-ranking stage in industrial recommendation systems faces a fundamental conflict between efficiency and effectiveness. While powerful models like Target Attention (TA) excel at capturing complex feature interactions in the ranking stage, their high computational cost makes them infeasible for pre-ranking, which often relies on simplistic vector-product models. This disparity creates a significant performance bottleneck for the entire system. To bridge this gap, we propose TARQ, a novel pre-ranking framework. Inspired by generative models, TARQ's key innovation is to equip pre-ranking with an architecture approximate to TA by Residual Quantization. This allows us to bring the modeling power of TA into the latency-critical pre-ranking stage for the first time, establishing a new state-of-the-art trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. Extensive offline experiments and large-scale online A/B tests at Taobao demonstrate TARQ's significant improvements in ranking performance. Consequently, our model has been fully deployed in production, serving tens of millions of daily active users and yielding substantial business improvements.</description>

      <title>AirQA: A Comprehensive QA Dataset for AI Research with Instance-Level Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growing volume of academic papers has made it increasingly difficult for researchers to efficiently extract key information. While large language models (LLMs) based agents are capable of automating question answering (QA) workflows for scientific papers, there still lacks a comprehensive and realistic benchmark to evaluate their capabilities. Moreover, training an interactive agent for this specific task is hindered by the shortage of high-quality interaction trajectories. In this work, we propose AirQA, a human-annotated comprehensive paper QA dataset in the field of artificial intelligence (AI), with 13,948 papers and 1,246 questions, that encompasses multi-task, multi-modal and instance-level evaluation. Furthermore, we propose ExTrActor, an automated framework for instruction data synthesis. With three LLM-based agents, ExTrActor can perform example generation and trajectory collection without human intervention. Evaluations of multiple open-source and proprietary models show that most models underperform on AirQA, demonstrating the quality of our dataset. Extensive experiments confirm that ExTrActor consistently improves the multi-turn tool-use capability of small models, enabling them to achieve performance comparable to larger ones.</description>

      <title>Gradient Interference-Aware Graph Coloring for Multitask Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When different objectives conflict with each other in multi-task learning, gradients begin to interfere and slow convergence, thereby reducing the final model's performance. To address this, we introduce a scheduler that computes gradient interference, constructs an interference graph, and then applies greedy graph-coloring to partition tasks into groups that align well with each other. At each training step, only one group (color class) of tasks are activated. The grouping partition is constantly recomputed as task relationships evolve throughout training. By ensuring that each mini-batch contains only tasks that pull the model in the same direction, our method improves the effectiveness of any underlying multi-task learning optimizer without additional tuning. Since tasks within these groups will update in compatible directions, model performance will be improved rather than impeded. Empirical results on six different datasets show that this interference-aware graph-coloring approach consistently outperforms baselines and state-of-the-art multi-task optimizers.</description>

      <title>The 1st Solution for 7th LSVOS RVOS Track: SaSaSa2VA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Referring video object segmentation (RVOS) requires segmenting and tracking objects in videos conditioned on natural-language expressions, demanding fine-grained understanding of both appearance and motion. Building on Sa2VA, which couples a Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) with the video segmentation model SAM2, we identify two key bottlenecks that limit segmentation performance: sparse frame sampling and reliance on a single [SEG] token for an entire video. We propose Segmentation Augmented and Selective Averaged Sa2VA SaSaSa2VA to address these issues. On the 7th LSVOS Challenge (RVOS track), SaSaSa2VA achieves a $J\&amp;F$ of 67.45, ranking first and surpassing the runner-up by 2.80 points. This result and ablation studies demonstrate that efficient segmentation augmentation and test-time ensembling substantially enhance grounded MLLMs for RVOS. The code is released in Sa2VA repository: https://github.com/magic-research/Sa2VA.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Multiple Speech Enhancers for Non-Intrusive Intelligibility Prediction for Hearing-Impaired Listeners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speech intelligibility evaluation for hearing-impaired (HI) listeners is essential for assessing hearing aid performance, traditionally relying on listening tests or intrusive methods like HASPI. However, these methods require clean reference signals, which are often unavailable in real-world conditions, creating a gap between lab-based and real-world assessments. To address this, we propose a non-intrusive intelligibility prediction framework that leverages speech enhancers to provide a parallel enhanced-signal pathway, enabling robust predictions without reference signals. We evaluate three state-of-the-art enhancers and demonstrate that prediction performance depends on the choice of enhancer, with ensembles of strong enhancers yielding the best results. To improve cross-dataset generalization, we introduce a 2-clips augmentation strategy that enhances listener-specific variability, boosting robustness on unseen datasets. Our approach consistently outperforms the non-intrusive baseline, CPC2 Champion across multiple datasets, highlighting the potential of enhancer-guided non-intrusive intelligibility prediction for real-world applications.</description>

      <title>PTQTP: Post-Training Quantization to Trit-Planes for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) of large language models (LLMs) to extremely low bit-widths remains challenging due to the fundamental trade-off between computational efficiency and model expressiveness. While existing ultra-low-bit PTQ methods rely on binary approximations or complex compensation mechanisms, they suffer from either limited representational capacity or computational overhead that undermines their efficiency gains. We introduce PTQ to Trit-Planes (PTQTP), the first ternary-weight PTQ framework that decomposes weight matrices into structured ternary {-1, 0, 1} trit-planes using 2x1.58-bit representation. PTQTP achieves multiplication-free inference, identical to 1-bit quantization, while maintaining superior expressiveness through its novel structured decomposition. Our approach provides: (1) a theoretically grounded progressive approximation algorithm ensuring global weight consistency; (2) model-agnostic deployment across diverse modern LLMs without architectural modifications; and (3) uniform ternary operations that eliminate the need for mixed-precision or compensation schemes. Comprehensive experiments across LLaMA3.x and Qwen3 model families (0.6B-70B parameters) demonstrate that PTQTP significantly outperforms existing low-bit PTQ methods, achieving 82.4% mathematical reasoning retention versus 0% for competing approaches. PTQTP approaches and sometimes surpasses 1.58-bit quantization-aware training performance while requiring only single-hour quantization compared to 10-14 GPU days for training-based methods. These results establish PTQTP as a practical solution for efficient LLM deployment in resource-constrained environments.</description>

      <title>Advancing Speech Understanding in Speech-Aware Language Models with GRPO</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)-based method for training Speech-Aware Large Language Models (SALLMs) on open-format speech understanding tasks, such as Spoken Question Answering and Automatic Speech Translation. SALLMs have proven highly effective for speech understanding tasks. GRPO has recently gained traction for its efficiency in training LLMs, and prior work has explored its application to SALLMs, primarily in multiple-choice tasks. Building on this, we focus on open-format tasks that better reflect the generative abilities of the models. Our approach leverages GRPO with BLEU as the reward signal to optimize SALLMs, and we demonstrate empirically that it surpasses standard SFT across several key metrics. Finally, we explore the potential of incorporating off-policy samples within GRPO for these tasks, highlighting avenues for further improvement and further research.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Overclocking: Dynamic Control of Thinking Path Length via Real-Time Reasoning Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) often suffer from computational inefficiency due to overthinking, where a fixed reasoning budget fails to match the varying complexity of tasks. To address this issue, we propose Adaptive Overclocking, a method that makes the overclocking hyperparameter $\alpha$ dynamic and context-aware. Our method adjusts reasoning speed in real time through two complementary signals: (1) token-level model uncertainty for fine-grained step-wise control, and (2) input complexity estimation for informed initialization. We implement this approach with three strategies: Uncertainty-Aware Alpha Scheduling (UA-$\alpha$S), Complexity-Guided Alpha Initialization (CG-$\alpha$I), and a Hybrid Adaptive Control (HAC) that combines both. Experiments on GSM8K, MATH, and SVAMP show that HAC achieves superior accuracy-latency trade-offs, reducing unnecessary computation on simple problems while allocating more resources to challenging ones. By mitigating overthinking, Adaptive Overclocking enhances both efficiency and overall reasoning performance.</description>

      <title>When Color-Space Decoupling Meets Diffusion for Adverse-Weather Image Restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adverse Weather Image Restoration (AWIR) is a highly challenging task due to the unpredictable and dynamic nature of weather-related degradations. Traditional task-specific methods often fail to generalize to unseen or complex degradation types, while recent prompt-learning approaches depend heavily on the degradation estimation capabilities of vision-language models, resulting in inconsistent restorations. In this paper, we propose \textbf{LCDiff}, a novel framework comprising two key components: \textit{Lumina-Chroma Decomposition Network} (LCDN) and \textit{Lumina-Guided Diffusion Model} (LGDM). LCDN processes degraded images in the YCbCr color space, separately handling degradation-related luminance and degradation-invariant chrominance components. This decomposition effectively mitigates weather-induced degradation while preserving color fidelity. To further enhance restoration quality, LGDM leverages degradation-related luminance information as a guiding condition, eliminating the need for explicit degradation prompts. Additionally, LGDM incorporates a \textit{Dynamic Time Step Loss} to optimize the denoising network, ensuring a balanced recovery of both low- and high-frequency features in the image. Finally, we present DriveWeather, a comprehensive all-weather driving dataset designed to enable robust evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods, setting a new benchmark in AWIR. The dataset and code are available at: https://github.com/fiwy0527/LCDiff.</description>

      <title>The Transfer Neurons Hypothesis: An Underlying Mechanism for Language Latent Space Transitions in Multilingual LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have suggested a processing framework for multilingual inputs in decoder-based LLMs: early layers convert inputs into English-centric and language-agnostic representations; middle layers perform reasoning within an English-centric latent space; and final layers generate outputs by transforming these representations back into language-specific latent spaces. However, the internal dynamics of such transformation and the underlying mechanism remain underexplored. Towards a deeper understanding of this framework, we propose and empirically validate The Transfer Neurons Hypothesis: certain neurons in the MLP module are responsible for transferring representations between language-specific latent spaces and a shared semantic latent space. Furthermore, we show that one function of language-specific neurons, as identified in recent studies, is to facilitate movement between latent spaces. Finally, we show that transfer neurons are critical for reasoning in multilingual LLMs.</description>

      <title>From Easy to Hard: The MIR Benchmark for Progressive Interleaved Multi-Image Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17040v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-image Interleaved Reasoning aims to improve Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) ability to jointly comprehend and reason across multiple images and their associated textual contexts, introducing unique challenges beyond single-image or non-interleaved multi-image tasks. While current multi-image benchmarks overlook interleaved textual contexts and neglect distinct relationships between individual images and their associated texts, enabling models to reason over multi-image interleaved data may significantly enhance their comprehension of complex scenes and better capture cross-modal correlations. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel benchmark MIR, requiring joint reasoning over multiple images accompanied by interleaved textual contexts to accurately associate image regions with corresponding texts and logically connect information across images. To enhance MLLMs ability to comprehend multi-image interleaved data, we introduce reasoning steps for each instance within the benchmark and propose a stage-wise curriculum learning strategy. This strategy follows an "easy to hard" approach, progressively guiding models from simple to complex scenarios, thereby enhancing their ability to handle challenging tasks. Extensive experiments benchmarking multiple MLLMs demonstrate that our method significantly enhances models reasoning performance on MIR and other established benchmarks. We believe that MIR will encourage further research into multi-image interleaved reasoning, facilitating advancements in MLLMs capability to handle complex inter-modal tasks.Our code and dataset are available at https://github.com/Shelly-coder239/MIRBench.</description>

      <title>A Chain-of-thought Reasoning Breast Ultrasound Dataset Covering All Histopathology Categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Breast ultrasound (BUS) is an essential tool for diagnosing breast lesions, with millions of examinations per year. However, publicly available high-quality BUS benchmarks for AI development are limited in data scale and annotation richness. In this work, we present BUS-CoT, a BUS dataset for chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning analysis, which contains 11,439 images of 10,019 lesions from 4,838 patients and covers all 99 histopathology types. To facilitate research on incentivizing CoT reasoning, we construct the reasoning processes based on observation, feature, diagnosis and pathology labels, annotated and verified by experienced experts. Moreover, by covering lesions of all histopathology types, we aim to facilitate robust AI systems in rare cases, which can be error-prone in clinical practice.</description>

      <title>TactfulToM: Do LLMs Have the Theory of Mind Ability to Understand White Lies?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While recent studies explore Large Language Models' (LLMs) performance on Theory of Mind (ToM) reasoning tasks, research on ToM abilities that require more nuanced social context is limited, such as white lies. We introduce TactfulToM, a novel English benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' ability to understand white lies within real-life conversations and reason about prosocial motivations behind them, particularly when they are used to spare others' feelings and maintain social harmony. Our benchmark is generated through a multi-stage human-in-the-loop pipeline where LLMs expand manually designed seed stories into conversations to maintain the information asymmetry between participants necessary for authentic white lies. We show that TactfulToM is challenging for state-of-the-art models, which perform substantially below humans, revealing shortcomings in their ability to fully comprehend the ToM reasoning that enables true understanding of white lies.</description>

      <title>Informative Text-Image Alignment for Visual Affordance Learning with Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Visual affordance learning is crucial for robots to understand and interact effectively with the physical world. Recent advances in this field attempt to leverage pre-trained knowledge of vision-language foundation models to learn affordance properties with limited training data, providing a novel paradigm for visual affordance learning. However, these methods overlook the significance of maintaining feature alignment between visual images and language descriptions for identifying affordance areas with textual guidance, and thus may lead to suboptimal results. In this paper, we present an informative framework for text-guided affordance learning, which involves information-based constraints to achieve text-image alignment at feature level. Specifically, we design an affordance mutual information constraint that helps learn appropriate textual prompts and task-oriented visual features simultaneously by maximizing the mutual information between the features of the affordance areas in the input images and the corresponding textual prompts. In addition, we propose an object-level information constraint that maximizes the mutual information between the visual features of a given object and the text features of the category it belongs to. This enables the model to capture high-quality representations for the object, providing more reliable semantic priors for identifying affordance regions. Experimental results on the AGD20K dataset show that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches and achieves the new state-of-the-art in one-shot affordance learning.</description>

      <title>$\texttt{DiffSyn}$: A Generative Diffusion Approach to Materials Synthesis Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The synthesis of crystalline materials, such as zeolites, remains a significant challenge due to a high-dimensional synthesis space, intricate structure-synthesis relationships and time-consuming experiments. Considering the one-to-many relationship between structure and synthesis, we propose $\texttt{DiffSyn}$, a generative diffusion model trained on over 23,000 synthesis recipes spanning 50 years of literature. $\texttt{DiffSyn}$ generates probable synthesis routes conditioned on a desired zeolite structure and an organic template. $\texttt{DiffSyn}$ achieves state-of-the-art performance by capturing the multi-modal nature of structure-synthesis relationships. We apply $\texttt{DiffSyn}$ to differentiate among competing phases and generate optimal synthesis routes. As a proof of concept, we synthesize a UFI material using $\texttt{DiffSyn}$-generated synthesis routes. These routes, rationalized by density functional theory binding energies, resulted in the successful synthesis of a UFI material with a high Si/Al$_{\text{ICP}}$ of 19.0, which is expected to improve thermal stability and is higher than that of any previously recorded.</description>

      <title>Ultra-short-term solar power forecasting by deep learning and data reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of solar power has been increasing as the green energy transition rolls out. The penetration of solar power challenges the grid stability and energy scheduling, due to its intermittent energy generation. Accurate and near real-time solar power prediction is of critical importance to tolerant and support the permeation of distributed and volatile solar power production in the energy system. In this paper, we propose a deep-learning based ultra-short-term solar power prediction with data reconstruction. We decompose the data for the prediction to facilitate extensive exploration of the spatial and temporal dependencies within the data. Particularly, we reconstruct the data into low- and high-frequency components, using ensemble empirical model decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN). We integrate meteorological data with those two components, and employ deep-learning models to capture long- and short-term dependencies towards the target prediction period. In this way, we excessively exploit the features in historical data in predicting a ultra-short-term solar power production. Furthermore, as ultra-short-term prediction is vulnerable to local optima, we modify the optimization in our deep-learning training by penalizing long prediction intervals. Numerical experiments with diverse settings demonstrate that, compared to baseline models, the proposed method achieves improved generalization in data reconstruction and higher prediction accuracy for ultra-short-term solar power production.</description>

      <title>Prompt-with-Me: in-IDE Structured Prompt Management for LLM-Driven Software Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models are transforming software engineering, yet prompt management in practice remains ad hoc, hindering reliability, reuse, and integration into industrial workflows. We present Prompt-with-Me, a practical solution for structured prompt management embedded directly in the development environment. The system automatically classifies prompts using a four-dimensional taxonomy encompassing intent, author role, software development lifecycle stage, and prompt type. To enhance prompt reuse and quality, Prompt-with-Me suggests language refinements, masks sensitive information, and extracts reusable templates from a developer's prompt library. Our taxonomy study of 1108 real-world prompts demonstrates that modern LLMs can accurately classify software engineering prompts. Furthermore, our user study with 11 participants shows strong developer acceptance, with high usability (Mean SUS=73), low cognitive load (Mean NASA-TLX=21), and reported gains in prompt quality and efficiency through reduced repetitive effort. Lastly, we offer actionable insights for building the next generation of prompt management and maintenance tools for software engineering workflows.</description>

      <title>ScenGAN: Attention-Intensive Generative Model for Uncertainty-Aware Renewable Scenario Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To address the intermittency of renewable energy source (RES) generation, scenario forecasting offers a series of stochastic realizations for predictive objects with superior flexibility and direct views. Based on a long time-series perspective, this paper explores uncertainties in the realms of renewable power and deep learning. Then, an uncertainty-aware model is meticulously designed for renewable scenario forecasting, which leverages an attention mechanism and generative adversarial networks (GANs) to precisely capture complex spatial-temporal dynamics. To improve the interpretability of uncertain behavior in RES generation, Bayesian deep learning and adaptive instance normalization (AdaIN) are incorporated to simulate typical patterns and variations. Additionally, the integration of meteorological information, forecasts, and historical trajectories in the processing layer improves the synergistic forecasting capability for multiscale periodic regularities. Numerical experiments and case analyses demonstrate that the proposed approach provides an appropriate interpretation for renewable uncertainty representation, including both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties, and shows superior performance over state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>SAEC: Scene-Aware Enhanced Edge-Cloud Collaborative Industrial Vision Inspection with Multimodal LLM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Industrial vision inspection requires high accuracy under stringent resource constraints, yet existing approaches face a fundamental trade-off. Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) deliver strong reasoning capabilities but incur prohibitive computational costs, while lightweight edge models often fail on complex cases. In this paper, we present SAEC, a scene-aware enhanced edge-cloud collaborative industrial vision inspection framework with MLLM. The framework is composed of three synergistic components: (1) Efficient MLLM Fine-Tuning for Complex Defect Inspection, (2) Lightweight Multiscale Scene-Complexity Estimation, and (3) Adaptive Edge-Cloud Scheduler. Together, these modules enable robust defect detection by tailoring multimodal reasoning to scene complexity and dynamically balancing computation between edge and cloud resources. Experimental results on MVTec AD and KSDD2 datasets demonstrate that SAEC attains 85.11% and 82.72% accuracy, surpassing Qwen by 22.1% and 20.8%, and LLaVA by 33.3% and 31.6%. It also reduces runtime by up to 22.4% and cuts energy per correct decision by 40%-74%. The code is available at https://github.com/YuHao-Tian/SAEC.</description>

      <title>MaskVCT: Masked Voice Codec Transformer for Zero-Shot Voice Conversion With Increased Controllability via Multiple Guidances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce MaskVCT, a zero-shot voice conversion (VC) model that offers multi-factor controllability through multiple classifier-free guidances (CFGs). While previous VC models rely on a fixed conditioning scheme, MaskVCT integrates diverse conditions in a single model. To further enhance robustness and control, the model can leverage continuous or quantized linguistic features to enhance intellgibility and speaker similarity, and can use or omit pitch contour to control prosody. These choices allow users to seamlessly balance speaker identity, linguistic content, and prosodic factors in a zero-shot VC setting. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MaskVCT achieves the best target speaker and accent similarities while obtaining competitive word and character error rates compared to existing baselines. Audio samples are available at https://maskvct.github.io/.</description>

      <title>Flow-Induced Diagonal Gaussian Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Flow-Induced Diagonal Gaussian Processes (FiD-GP), a compression framework that incorporates a compact inducing weight matrix to project a neural network's weight uncertainty into a lower-dimensional subspace. Critically, FiD-GP relies on normalising-flow priors and spectral regularisations to augment its expressiveness and align the inducing subspace with feature-gradient geometry through a numerically stable projection mechanism objective. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the prediction framework in FiD-GP can help to design a single-pass projection for Out-of-Distribution (OoD) detection. Our analysis shows that FiD-GP improves uncertainty estimation ability on various tasks compared with SVGP-based baselines, satisfies tight spectral residual bounds with theoretically guaranteed OoD detection, and significantly compresses the neural network's storage requirements at the cost of increased inference computation dependent on the number of inducing weights employed. Specifically, in a comprehensive empirical study spanning regression, image classification, semantic segmentation, and out-of-distribution detection benchmarks, it cuts Bayesian training cost by several orders of magnitude, compresses parameters by roughly 51%, reduces model size by about 75%, and matches state-of-the-art accuracy and uncertainty estimation.</description>

      <title>Time Series Forecasting Using a Hybrid Deep Learning Method: A Bi-LSTM Embedding Denoising Auto Encoder Transformer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time series data is a prevalent form of data found in various fields. It consists of a series of measurements taken over time. Forecasting is a crucial application of time series models, where future values are predicted based on historical data. Accurate forecasting is essential for making well-informed decisions across industries. When it comes to electric vehicles (EVs), precise predictions play a key role in planning infrastructure development, load balancing, and energy management. This study introduces a BI-LSTM embedding denoising autoencoder model (BDM) designed to address time series problems, focusing on short-term EV charging load prediction. The performance of the proposed model is evaluated by comparing it with benchmark models like Transformer, CNN, RNN, LSTM, and GRU. Based on the results of the study, the proposed model outperforms the benchmark models in four of the five-time steps, demonstrating its effectiveness for time series forecasting. This research makes a significant contribution to enhancing time series forecasting, thereby improving decision-making processes.</description>

      <title>LifeAlign: Lifelong Alignment for Large Language Models with Memory-Augmented Focalized Preference Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Alignment plays a crucial role in Large Language Models (LLMs) in aligning with human preferences on a specific task/domain. Traditional alignment methods suffer from catastrophic forgetting, where models lose previously acquired knowledge when adapting to new preferences or domains. We introduce LifeAlign, a novel framework for lifelong alignment that enables LLMs to maintain consistent human preference alignment across sequential learning tasks without forgetting previously learned knowledge. Our approach consists of two key innovations. First, we propose a focalized preference optimization strategy that aligns LLMs with new preferences while preventing the erosion of knowledge acquired from previous tasks. Second, we develop a short-to-long memory consolidation mechanism that merges denoised short-term preference representations into stable long-term memory using intrinsic dimensionality reduction, enabling efficient storage and retrieval of alignment patterns across diverse domains. We evaluate LifeAlign across multiple sequential alignment tasks spanning different domains and preference types. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance in maintaining both preference alignment quality and knowledge retention compared to existing lifelong learning approaches. The codes and datasets will be released on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Dendritic Resonate-and-Fire Neuron for Effective and Efficient Long Sequence Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The explosive growth in sequence length has intensified the demand for effective and efficient long sequence modeling. Benefiting from intrinsic oscillatory membrane dynamics, Resonate-and-Fire (RF) neurons can efficiently extract frequency components from input signals and encode them into spatiotemporal spike trains, making them well-suited for long sequence modeling. However, RF neurons exhibit limited effective memory capacity and a trade-off between energy efficiency and training speed on complex temporal tasks. Inspired by the dendritic structure of biological neurons, we propose a Dendritic Resonate-and-Fire (D-RF) model, which explicitly incorporates a multi-dendritic and soma architecture. Each dendritic branch encodes specific frequency bands by utilizing the intrinsic oscillatory dynamics of RF neurons, thereby collectively achieving comprehensive frequency representation. Furthermore, we introduce an adaptive threshold mechanism into the soma structure that adjusts the threshold based on historical spiking activity, reducing redundant spikes while maintaining training efficiency in long sequence tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method maintains competitive accuracy while substantially ensuring sparse spikes without compromising computational efficiency during training. These results underscore its potential as an effective and efficient solution for long sequence modeling on edge platforms.</description>

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of medical images is challenging due to unclear lesion boundaries and mask variability. We introduce \emph{Segmentation Sch\"{o}dinger Bridge (SSB)}, the first application of Sch\"{o}dinger Bridge for ambiguous medical image segmentation, modelling joint image-mask dynamics to enhance performance. SSB preserves structural integrity, delineates unclear boundaries without additional guidance, and maintains diversity using a novel loss function. We further propose the \emph{Diversity Divergence Index} ($D_{DDI}$) to quantify inter-rater variability, capturing both diversity and consensus. SSB achieves state-of-the-art performance on LIDC-IDRI, COCA, and RACER (in-house) datasets.</description>

Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) remain the leading cause of mortality globally, and echocardiography is critical for diagnosis of both common and congenital cardiac conditions. However, echocardiographic data for certain pathologies are scarce, hindering the development of robust automated diagnosis models. In this work, we propose Echo-Path, a novel generative framework to produce echocardiogram videos conditioned on specific cardiac pathologies. Echo-Path can synthesize realistic ultrasound video sequences that exhibit targeted abnormalities, focusing here on atrial septal defect (ASD) and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Our approach introduces a pathology-conditioning mechanism into a state-of-the-art echo video generator, allowing the model to learn and control disease-specific structural and motion patterns in the heart. Quantitative evaluation demonstrates that the synthetic videos achieve low distribution distances, indicating high visual fidelity. Clinically, the generated echoes exhibit plausible pathology markers. Furthermore, classifiers trained on our synthetic data generalize well to real data and, when used to augment real training sets, it improves downstream diagnosis of ASD and PAH by 7\% and 8\% respectively.

Abstract: Language models obtain extensive capabilities through pre-training. However, the pre-training process remains a black box. In this work, we track linear interpretable feature evolution across pre-training snapshots using a sparse dictionary learning method called crosscoders. We find that most features begin to form around a specific point, while more complex patterns emerge in later training stages. Feature attribution analyses reveal causal connections between feature evolution and downstream performance. Our feature-level observations are highly consistent with previous findings on Transformer's two-stage learning process, which we term a statistical learning phase and a feature learning phase. Our work opens up the possibility to track fine-grained representation progress during language model learning dynamics.</description>

      <title>SignalLLM: A General-Purpose LLM Agent Framework for Automated Signal Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern signal processing (SP) pipelines, whether model-based or data-driven, often constrained by complex and fragmented workflow, rely heavily on expert knowledge and manual engineering, and struggle with adaptability and generalization under limited data. In contrast, Large Language Models (LLMs) offer strong reasoning capabilities, broad general-purpose knowledge, in-context learning, and cross-modal transfer abilities, positioning them as powerful tools for automating and generalizing SP workflows. Motivated by these potentials, we introduce SignalLLM, the first general-purpose LLM-based agent framework for general SP tasks. Unlike prior LLM-based SP approaches that are limited to narrow applications or tricky prompting, SignalLLM introduces a principled, modular architecture. It decomposes high-level SP goals into structured subtasks via in-context learning and domain-specific retrieval, followed by hierarchical planning through adaptive retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and refinement; these subtasks are then executed through prompt-based reasoning, cross-modal reasoning, code synthesis, model invocation, or data-driven LLM-assisted modeling. Its generalizable design enables the flexible selection of problem solving strategies across different signal modalities, task types, and data conditions. We demonstrate the versatility and effectiveness of SignalLLM through five representative tasks in communication and sensing, such as radar target detection, human activity recognition, and text compression. Experimental results show superior performance over traditional and existing LLM-based methods, particularly in few-shot and zero-shot settings.</description>

      <title>Guided and Unguided Conditional Diffusion Mechanisms for Structured and Semantically-Aware 3D Point Cloud Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generating realistic 3D point clouds is a fundamental problem in computer vision with applications in remote sensing, robotics, and digital object modeling. Existing generative approaches primarily capture geometry, and when semantics are considered, they are typically imposed post hoc through external segmentation or clustering rather than integrated into the generative process itself. We propose a diffusion-based framework that embeds per-point semantic conditioning directly within generation. Each point is associated with a conditional variable corresponding to its semantic label, which guides the diffusion dynamics and enables the joint synthesis of geometry and semantics. This design produces point clouds that are both structurally coherent and segmentation-aware, with object parts explicitly represented during synthesis. Through a comparative analysis of guided and unguided diffusion processes, we demonstrate the significant impact of conditional variables on diffusion dynamics and generation quality. Extensive experiments validate the efficacy of our approach, producing detailed and accurate 3D point clouds tailored to specific parts and features.</description>

      <title>Point-RTD: Replaced Token Denoising for Pretraining Transformer Models on Point Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pre-training strategies play a critical role in advancing the performance of transformer-based models for 3D point cloud tasks. In this paper, we introduce Point-RTD (Replaced Token Denoising), a novel pretraining strategy designed to improve token robustness through a corruption-reconstruction framework. Unlike traditional mask-based reconstruction tasks that hide data segments for later prediction, Point-RTD corrupts point cloud tokens and leverages a discriminator-generator architecture for denoising. This shift enables more effective learning of structural priors and significantly enhances model performance and efficiency. On the ShapeNet dataset, Point-RTD reduces reconstruction error by over 93% compared to PointMAE, and achieves more than 14x lower Chamfer Distance on the test set. Our method also converges faster and yields higher classification accuracy on ShapeNet, ModelNet10, and ModelNet40 benchmarks, clearly outperforming the baseline Point-MAE framework in every case.</description>

      <title>Agentic AI for Multi-Stage Physics Experiments at a Large-Scale User Facility Particle Accelerator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first language-model-driven agentic artificial intelligence (AI) system to autonomously execute multi-stage physics experiments on a production synchrotron light source. Implemented at the Advanced Light Source particle accelerator, the system translates natural language user prompts into structured execution plans that combine archive data retrieval, control-system channel resolution, automated script generation, controlled machine interaction, and analysis. In a representative machine physics task, we show that preparation time was reduced by two orders of magnitude relative to manual scripting even for a system expert, while operator-standard safety constraints were strictly upheld. Core architectural features, plan-first orchestration, bounded tool access, and dynamic capability selection, enable transparent, auditable execution with fully reproducible artifacts. These results establish a blueprint for the safe integration of agentic AI into accelerator experiments and demanding machine physics studies, as well as routine operations, with direct portability across accelerators worldwide and, more broadly, to other large-scale scientific infrastructures.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Token Alignment for Large Language Model Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) from scratch can yield models with unique functionalities and strengths, but it is costly and often leads to redundant capabilities. A more cost-effective alternative is to fuse existing pre-trained LLMs with different architectures into a more powerful model. However, a key challenge in existing model fusion is their dependence on manually predefined vocabulary alignment, which may not generalize well across diverse contexts, leading to performance degradation in several evaluation. To solve this, we draw inspiration from distribution learning and propose the probabilistic token alignment method as a general and soft mapping for alignment, named as PTA-LLM. Our approach innovatively reformulates token alignment into a classic mathematical problem: optimal transport, seamlessly leveraging distribution-aware learning to facilitate more coherent model fusion. Apart from its inherent generality, PTA-LLM exhibits interpretability from a distributional perspective, offering insights into the essence of the token alignment. Empirical results demonstrate that probabilistic token alignment enhances the target model's performance across multiple capabilities.

      <title>From Prediction to Understanding: Will AI Foundation Models Transform Brain Science?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative pretraining (the "GPT" in ChatGPT) enables language models to learn from vast amounts of internet text without human supervision. This approach has driven breakthroughs across AI by allowing deep neural networks to learn from massive, unstructured datasets. We use the term foundation models to refer to large pretrained systems that can be adapted to a wide range of tasks within and across domains, and these models are increasingly applied beyond language to the brain sciences. These models achieve strong predictive accuracy, raising hopes that they might illuminate computational principles. But predictive success alone does not guarantee scientific understanding. Here, we outline how foundation models can be productively integrated into the brain sciences, highlighting both their promise and their limitations. The central challenge is to move from prediction to explanation: linking model computations to mechanisms underlying neural activity and cognition.</description>

Abstract: High-quality reference standard image data creation by neuroradiology experts for automated clinical tools can be a powerful tool for neuroradiology &amp; artificial intelligence education. We developed a multimodal educational approach for students and trainees during the MICCAI Brain Tumor Segmentation Lighthouse Challenge 2025, a landmark initiative to develop accurate brain tumor segmentation algorithms. Fifty-six medical students &amp; radiology trainees volunteered to annotate brain tumor MR images for the BraTS challenges of 2023 &amp; 2024, guided by faculty-led didactics on neuropathology MRI. Among the 56 annotators, 14 select volunteers were then paired with neuroradiology faculty for guided one-on-one annotation sessions for BraTS 2025. Lectures on neuroanatomy, pathology &amp; AI, journal clubs &amp; data scientist-led workshops were organized online. Annotators &amp; audience members completed surveys on their perceived knowledge before &amp; after annotations &amp; lectures respectively. Fourteen coordinators, each paired with a neuroradiologist, completed the data annotation process, averaging 1322.9+/-760.7 hours per dataset per pair and 1200 segmentations in total. On a scale of 1-10, annotation coordinators reported significant increase in familiarity with image segmentation software pre- and post-annotation, moving from initial average of 6+/-2.9 to final average of 8.9+/-1.1, and significant increase in familiarity with brain tumor features pre- and post-annotation, moving from initial average of 6.2+/-2.4 to final average of 8.1+/-1.2. We demonstrate an innovative offering for providing neuroradiology &amp; AI education through an image segmentation challenge to enhance understanding of algorithm development, reinforce the concept of data reference standard, and diversify opportunities for AI-driven image analysis among future physicians.</description>

      <title>Automated Facility Enumeration for Building Compliance Checking using Door Detection and Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building compliance checking (BCC) is a critical process for ensuring that constructed facilities meet regulatory standards. A core component of BCC is the accurate enumeration of facility types and their spatial distribution. Despite its importance, this problem has been largely overlooked in the literature, posing a significant challenge for BCC and leaving a critical gap in existing workflows. Performing this task manually is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities to enhance automation by combining visual recognition with reasoning capabilities. In this paper, we introduce a new task for BCC: automated facility enumeration, which involves validating the quantity of each facility type against statutory requirements. To address it, we propose a novel method that integrates door detection with LLM-based reasoning. We are the first to apply LLMs to this task and further enhance their performance through a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) pipeline. Our approach generalizes well across diverse datasets and facility types. Experiments on both real-world and synthetic floor plan data demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our method.</description>

      <title>Multi-View Attention Multiple-Instance Learning Enhanced by LLM Reasoning for Cognitive Distortion Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cognitive distortions have been closely linked to mental health disorders, yet their automatic detection remained challenging due to contextual ambiguity, co-occurrence, and semantic overlap. We proposed a novel framework that combines Large Language Models (LLMs) with Multiple-Instance Learning (MIL) architecture to enhance interpretability and expression-level reasoning. Each utterance was decomposed into Emotion, Logic, and Behavior (ELB) components, which were processed by LLMs to infer multiple distortion instances, each with a predicted type, expression, and model-assigned salience score. These instances were integrated via a Multi-View Gated Attention mechanism for final classification. Experiments on Korean (KoACD) and English (Therapist QA) datasets demonstrate that incorporating ELB and LLM-inferred salience scores improves classification performance, especially for distortions with high interpretive ambiguity. Our results suggested a psychologically grounded and generalizable approach for fine-grained reasoning in mental health NLP.</description>

      <title>Scaling, Simplification, and Adaptation: Lessons from Pretraining on Machine-Translated Text</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most languages lack sufficient data for large-scale monolingual pretraining, creating a "data wall." Multilingual pretraining helps but is limited by language imbalance and the "curse of multilinguality." An alternative is to translate high-resource text with machine translation (MT), which raises three questions: (1) How does MT-derived data scale with model capacity? (2) Can source-side transformations (e.g., simplifying English with an LLM) improve generalization to native text? (3) How well do models pretrained on MT-derived data adapt when continually trained on limited native text? We investigate these questions by translating English into Indonesian and Tamil--two typologically distant, lower-resource languages--and pretraining GPT-2 models (124M-774M) on native or MT-derived corpora from raw and LLM-simplified English. We evaluate cross-entropy loss on native text, along with accuracy on syntactic probes and downstream tasks. Our results show that (1) MT-pretrained models benefit from scaling; (2) source-side simplification harms generalization to native text; and (3) adapting MT-pretrained models on native text often yields better performance than native-only models, even with less native data. However, tasks requiring cultural nuance (e.g., toxicity detection) demand more exposure to native data.</description>

      <title>Generalizable End-to-End Tool-Use RL with Synthetic CodeGym</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tool-augmented large language models (LLMs), hereafter LLM agents, leverage external tools to solve diverse tasks and interface with the real world. However, current training practices largely rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) over static trajectories or reinforcement learning (RL) on narrow tasks, and generalize poorly beyond development settings, leading to brittleness with new tools and unseen workflows. Because code execution reflects many structures of real-world workflows, coding problems provide a natural basis for building agent training environments. Motivated by this, we introduce CodeGym, a scalable framework that synthesizes diverse, verifiable, and controllable multi-turn tool-use environments for agent RL, enabling LLM agents to explore and master various workflows actively. CodeGym rewrites static coding problems into interactive environments by extracting atomic functions or logic into callable tools, yielding verifiable tasks that span various tool-execution workflows. Models of varying sizes and chain-of-thought configurations, trained in CodeGym, exhibit consistent out-of-distribution generalizability; for example, Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct achieves an absolute accuracy gain of 8.7 points on the OOD benchmark $\tau$-Bench. These results highlight CodeGym as a step toward scalable general-purpose RL environments that align with real-world agent workflows.</description>

Abstract: Explainability, the capability of an artificial intelligence system (AIS) to explain its outcomes in a manner that is comprehensible to human beings at an acceptable level, has been deemed essential for critical sectors, such as healthcare. Is it really the case? In this perspective, we consider two extreme cases, ``Oracle'' (without explainability) versus ``AI Colleague'' (with explainability) for a thorough analysis. We discuss how the level of automation and explainability of AIS can affect the determination of liability among the medical practitioner/facility and manufacturer of AIS. We argue that explainability plays a crucial role in setting a responsibility framework in healthcare, from a legal standpoint, to shape the behavior of all involved parties and mitigate the risk of potential defensive medicine practices.</description>

Recent model merging-based methods have attracted significant attention, but they still struggle to effectively manage the trade-off between learning new knowledge and preventing forgetting, a challenge largely stemming from suboptimal number of merges and merging frequency. In this paper, we introduce Adaptive Iterative Model Merging (AimMerging), a novel CL framework that utilizes learning and forgetting signals from the training trajectory to dynamically monitor the model's training status. Guided by dynamic monitoring, the training trajectory-guided merge controller adaptively determines the timing and frequency of iterative fusion, while the rehearsal-based knowledge fusion module computes the merging weights and executes the fusion. Comprehensive experiments on three CL benchmarks with various model sizes (from 770M to 13B) demonstrate that AimMerging achieves significant performance improvements over existing state-of-the-art methods, with an average relative improvement of 80% and 59% on FWT and BWT, respectively.

      <title>Better Late Than Never: Evaluation of Latency Metrics for Simultaneous Speech-to-Text Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simultaneous speech-to-text translation (SimulST) systems have to balance translation quality with latency--the delay between speech input and the translated output. While quality evaluation is well established, accurate latency measurement remains a challenge. Existing metrics often produce inconsistent or misleading results, especially in the widely used short-form setting, where speech is artificially presegmented. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive analysis of SimulST latency metrics across language pairs, systems, and both short- and long-form regimes. We uncover a structural bias in current metrics related to segmentation that undermines fair and meaningful comparisons. To address this, we introduce YAAL (Yet Another Average Lagging), a refined latency metric that delivers more accurate evaluations in the short-form regime. We extend YAAL to LongYAAL for unsegmented audio and propose SoftSegmenter, a novel resegmentation tool based on word-level alignment. Our experiments show that YAAL and LongYAAL outperform popular latency metrics, while SoftSegmenter enhances alignment quality in long-form evaluation, together enabling more reliable assessments of SimulST systems.</description>

      <title>SeqUDA-Rec: Sequential User Behavior Enhanced Recommendation via Global Unsupervised Data Augmentation for Personalized Content Marketing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Personalized content marketing has become a crucial strategy for digital platforms, aiming to deliver tailored advertisements and recommendations that match user preferences. Traditional recommendation systems often suffer from two limitations: (1) reliance on limited supervised signals derived from explicit user feedback, and (2) vulnerability to noisy or unintentional interactions. To address these challenges, we propose SeqUDA-Rec, a novel deep learning framework that integrates user behavior sequences with global unsupervised data augmentation to enhance recommendation accuracy and robustness. Our approach first constructs a Global User-Item Interaction Graph (GUIG) from all user behavior sequences, capturing both local and global item associations. Then, a graph contrastive learning module is applied to generate robust embeddings, while a sequential Transformer-based encoder models users' evolving preferences. To further enhance diversity and counteract sparse supervised labels, we employ a GAN-based augmentation strategy, generating plausible interaction patterns and supplementing training data. Extensive experiments on two real-world marketing datasets (Amazon Ads and TikTok Ad Clicks) demonstrate that SeqUDA-Rec significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines such as SASRec, BERT4Rec, and GCL4SR. Our model achieves a 6.7% improvement in NDCG@10 and 11.3% improvement in HR@10, proving its effectiveness in personalized advertising and intelligent content recommendation.</description>

      <title>Pre-Trained CNN Architecture for Transformer-Based Image Caption Generation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automatic image captioning, a multifaceted task bridging computer vision and natural lan- guage processing, aims to generate descriptive textual content from visual input. While Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks have achieved significant advancements, they present limitations. The inherent sequential nature of RNNs leads to sluggish training and inference times. LSTMs further struggle with retaining information from earlier sequence elements when dealing with very long se- quences. This project presents a comprehensive guide to constructing and comprehending transformer models for image captioning. Transformers employ self-attention mechanisms, capturing both short- and long-range dependencies within the data. This facilitates efficient parallelization during both training and inference phases. We leverage the well-established Transformer architecture, recognized for its effectiveness in managing sequential data, and present a meticulous methodology. Utilizing the Flickr30k dataset, we conduct data pre- processing, construct a model architecture that integrates an EfficientNetB0 CNN for fea- ture extraction, and train the model with attention mechanisms incorporated. Our approach exemplifies the utilization of parallelization for efficient training and inference. You can find the project on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Interpreting vision transformers via residual replacement model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How do vision transformers (ViTs) represent and process the world? This paper addresses this long-standing question through the first systematic analysis of 6.6K features across all layers, extracted via sparse autoencoders, and by introducing the residual replacement model, which replaces ViT computations with interpretable features in the residual stream. Our analysis reveals not only a feature evolution from low-level patterns to high-level semantics, but also how ViTs encode curves and spatial positions through specialized feature types. The residual replacement model scalably produces a faithful yet parsimonious circuit for human-scale interpretability by significantly simplifying the original computations. As a result, this framework enables intuitive understanding of ViT mechanisms. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of our framework in debiasing spurious correlations.</description>

      <title>SongPrep: A Preprocessing Framework and End-to-end Model for Full-song Structure Parsing and Lyrics Transcription</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) is currently a popular research area. Among its various branches, song generation has attracted growing interest. Despite the abundance of available songs, effective data preparation remains a significant challenge. Converting these songs into training-ready datasets typically requires extensive manual labeling, which is both time consuming and costly. To address this issue, we propose SongPrep, an automated preprocessing pipeline designed specifically for song data. This framework streamlines key processes such as source separation, structure analysis, and lyric recognition, producing structured data that can be directly used to train song generation models. Furthermore, we introduce SongPrepE2E, an end-to-end structured lyrics recognition model based on pretrained language models. Without the need for additional source separation, SongPrepE2E is able to analyze the structure and lyrics of entire songs and provide precise timestamps. By leveraging context from the whole song alongside pretrained semantic knowledge, SongPrepE2E achieves low Diarization Error Rate (DER) and Word Error Rate (WER) on the proposed SSLD-200 dataset. Downstream tasks demonstrate that training song generation models with the data output by SongPrepE2E enables the generated songs to closely resemble those produced by humans.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Fish Detection in Indonesian Marine Ecosystems Using Lightweight YOLOv10-nano Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Indonesia's marine ecosystems, part of the globally recognized Coral Triangle, are among the richest in biodiversity, requiring efficient monitoring tools to support conservation. Traditional fish detection methods are time-consuming and demand expert knowledge, prompting the need for automated solutions. This study explores the implementation of YOLOv10-nano, a state-of-the-art deep learning model, for real-time marine fish detection in Indonesian waters, using test data from Bunaken National Marine Park. YOLOv10's architecture, featuring improvements like the CSPNet backbone, PAN for feature fusion, and Pyramid Spatial Attention Block, enables efficient and accurate object detection even in complex environments. The model was evaluated on the DeepFish and OpenImages V7-Fish datasets. Results show that YOLOv10-nano achieves a high detection accuracy with mAP50 of 0.966 and mAP50:95 of 0.606 while maintaining low computational demand (2.7M parameters, 8.4 GFLOPs). It also delivered an average inference speed of 29.29 FPS on the CPU, making it suitable for real-time deployment. Although OpenImages V7-Fish alone provided lower accuracy, it complemented DeepFish in enhancing model robustness. Overall, this study demonstrates YOLOv10-nano's potential for efficient, scalable marine fish monitoring and conservation applications in data-limited environments.</description>

      <title>Distributionally Robust Safety Verification of Neural Networks via Worst-Case CVaR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ensuring the safety of neural networks under input uncertainty is a fundamental challenge in safety-critical applications. This paper builds on and expands Fazlyab's quadratic-constraint (QC) and semidefinite-programming (SDP) framework for neural network verification to a distributionally robust and tail-risk-aware setting by integrating worst-case Conditional Value-at-Risk (WC-CVaR) over a moment-based ambiguity set with fixed mean and covariance. The resulting conditions remain SDP-checkable and explicitly account for tail risk. This integration broadens input-uncertainty geometry-covering ellipsoids, polytopes, and hyperplanes-and extends applicability to safety-critical domains where tail-event severity matters. Applications to closed-loop reachability of control systems and classification are demonstrated through numerical experiments, illustrating how the risk level $\varepsilon$ trades conservatism for tolerance to tail events-while preserving the computational structure of prior QC/SDP methods for neural network verification and robustness analysis.</description>

      <title>MVCL-DAF++: Enhancing Multimodal Intent Recognition via Prototype-Aware Contrastive Alignment and Coarse-to-Fine Dynamic Attention Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal intent recognition (MMIR) suffers from weak semantic grounding and poor robustness under noisy or rare-class conditions. We propose MVCL-DAF++, which extends MVCL-DAF with two key modules: (1) Prototype-aware contrastive alignment, aligning instances to class-level prototypes to enhance semantic consistency; and (2) Coarse-to-fine attention fusion, integrating global modality summaries with token-level features for hierarchical cross-modal interaction. On MIntRec and MIntRec2.0, MVCL-DAF++ achieves new state-of-the-art results, improving rare-class recognition by +1.05\% and +4.18\% WF1, respectively. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of prototype-guided learning and coarse-to-fine fusion for robust multimodal understanding.

      <title>Training-Free Label Space Alignment for Universal Domain Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Universal domain adaptation (UniDA) transfers knowledge from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain, where label spaces may differ and the target domain may contain private classes. Previous UniDA methods primarily focused on visual space alignment but often struggled with visual ambiguities due to content differences, which limited their robustness and generalizability. To overcome this, we introduce a novel approach that leverages the strong \textit{zero-shot capabilities} of recent vision-language foundation models (VLMs) like CLIP, concentrating solely on label space alignment to enhance adaptation stability. CLIP can generate task-specific classifiers based only on label names. However, adapting CLIP to UniDA is challenging because the label space is not fully known in advance. In this study, we first utilize generative vision-language models to identify unknown categories in the target domain. Noise and semantic ambiguities in the discovered labels -- such as those similar to source labels (e.g., synonyms, hypernyms, hyponyms) -- complicate label alignment. To address this, we propose a training-free label-space alignment method for UniDA (\ours). Our method aligns label spaces instead of visual spaces by filtering and refining noisy labels between the domains. We then construct a \textit{universal classifier} that integrates both shared knowledge and target-private class information, thereby improving generalizability under domain shifts. The results reveal that the proposed method considerably outperforms existing UniDA techniques across key DomainBed benchmarks, delivering an average improvement of \textcolor{blue}{+7.9\%}in H-score and \textcolor{blue}{+6.1\%} in H$^3$-score. Furthermore, incorporating self-training further enhances performance and achieves an additional (\textcolor{blue}{+1.6\%}) increment in both H- and H$^3$-scores.</description>

Abstract: We explore the applicability of text-to-code to solve real-world problems that are typically solved in natural language, such as legal judgment and medical QA. Unlike previous works, our approach leverages the explicit reasoning provided by program generation. We present ICRAG, a framework that transforms natural language into executable programs through iterative refinement using external knowledge from domain resources and GitHub. Across 13 benchmarks, ICRAG achieves up to 161.1\% relative improvement. We provide a detailed analysis of the generated code and the impact of external knowledge, and we discuss the limitations of applying text-to-code approaches to real-world natural language tasks.</description>

      <title>Explainable AI for Analyzing Person-Specific Patterns in Facial Recognition Tasks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The proliferation of facial recognition systems presents major privacy risks, driving the need for effective countermeasures. Current adversarial techniques apply generalized methods rather than adapting to individual facial characteristics, limiting their effectiveness and inconspicuousness. In this work, we introduce Layer Embedding Activation Mapping (LEAM), a novel technique that identifies which facial areas contribute most to recognition at an individual level. Unlike adversarial attack methods that aim to fool recognition systems, LEAM is an explainability technique designed to understand how these systems work, providing insights that could inform future privacy protection research. We integrate LEAM with a face parser to analyze data from 1000 individuals across 9 pre-trained facial recognition models.
  Our analysis reveals that while different layers within facial recognition models vary significantly in their focus areas, these models generally prioritize similar facial regions across architectures when considering their overall activation patterns, which show significantly higher similarity between images of the same individual (Bhattacharyya Coefficient: 0.32-0.57) vs. different individuals (0.04-0.13), validating the existence of person-specific recognition patterns. Our results show that facial recognition models prioritize the central region of face images (with nose areas accounting for 18.9-29.7% of critical recognition regions), while still distributing attention across multiple facial fragments. Proper selection of relevant facial areas was confirmed using validation occlusions, based on just 1% of the most relevant, LEAM-identified, image pixels, which proved to be transferable across different models. Our findings establish the foundation for future individually tailored privacy protection systems centered around LEAM's choice of areas to be perturbed.</description>

Abstract: Journaling can potentially serve as an effective method for autistic adolescents to improve narrative skills. However, its text-centric nature and high executive functioning demands present barriers to practice. We present Autiverse, an AI-guided multimodal journaling app for tablets that scaffolds storytelling through conversational prompts and visual supports. Autiverse elicits key details through a stepwise dialogue with peer-like, customizable AI and composes them into an editable four-panel comic strip. Through a two-week deployment study with 10 autistic adolescent-parent dyads, we examine how Autiverse supports autistic adolescents to organize their daily experience and emotion. Autiverse helped them construct coherent narratives, while enabling parents to learn additional details of their child's events and emotions. The customized AI peer created a comfortable space for sharing, fostering enjoyment and a strong sense of agency. We discuss the implications of designing technologies that complement autistic adolescents' strengths while ensuring their autonomy and safety in sharing experiences.</description>

      <title>Transformer-Gather, Fuzzy-Reconsider: A Scalable Hybrid Framework for Entity Resolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entity resolution plays a significant role in enterprise systems where data integrity must be rigorously maintained. Traditional methods often struggle with handling noisy data or semantic understanding, while modern methods suffer from computational costs or the excessive need for parallel computation. In this study, we introduce a scalable hybrid framework, which is designed to address several important problems, including scalability, noise robustness, and reliable results. We utilized a pre-trained language model to encode each structured data into corresponding semantic embedding vectors. Subsequently, after retrieving a semantically relevant subset of candidates, we apply a syntactic verification stage using fuzzy string matching techniques to refine classification on the unlabeled data. This approach was applied to a real-world entity resolution task, which exposed a linkage between a central user management database and numerous shared hosting server records. Compared to other methods, this approach exhibits an outstanding performance in terms of both processing time and robustness, making it a reliable solution for a server-side product. Crucially, this efficiency does not compromise results, as the system maintains a high retrieval recall of approximately 0.97. The scalability of the framework makes it deployable on standard CPU-based infrastructure, offering a practical and effective solution for enterprise-level data integrity auditing.</description>

      <title>LingoQ: Bridging the Gap between ESL Learning and Work through AI-Generated Work-Related Quizzes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-native English speakers performing English-related tasks at work struggle to sustain ESL learning, despite their motivation. Often, study materials are disconnected from their work context. Although workers rely on LLM assistants to address their immediate needs, these interactions may not directly contribute to their English skills. We present LingoQ, an AI-mediated system that allows workers to practice English using quizzes generated from their LLM queries during work. LingoQ leverages these queries using AI to generate personalized quizzes that workers can review and practice on their smartphones. We conducted a three-week deployment study with 28 ESL workers to evaluate LingoQ. Participants valued the relevance of quizzes that reflect their own context, constantly engaging with the app during the study. This active engagement improved self-efficacy and led to learning gains for beginners and, potentially, for intermediate learners. We discuss opportunities of leveraging users' reliance on LLMs to situate their learning in the user context for improved learning.</description>

      <title>ChartHal: A Fine-grained Framework Evaluating Hallucination of Large Vision Language Models in Chart Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17481v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable progress, yet hallucination remains a critical barrier, particularly in chart understanding, which requires sophisticated perceptual and cognitive abilities as well as rigorous factual accuracy. While prior work has investigated hallucinations and chart comprehension independently, their intersection remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we present ChartHal, a benchmark that features a fine-grained taxonomy of hallucination scenarios in chart understanding, along with a human-validated dataset of 1,062 samples. Our evaluation shows that state-of-the-art LVLMs suffer from severe hallucinations on ChartHal, including proprietary models such as GPT-5 and o4-mini, which achieve only 34.46% and 22.79% accuracy, respectively. Further analysis reveals that questions involving information absent from or contradictory to charts are especially likely to trigger hallucinations, underscoring the urgent need for more robust mitigation strategies.

      <title>Privacy in Action: Towards Realistic Privacy Mitigation and Evaluation for LLM-Powered Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing autonomy of LLM agents in handling sensitive communications, accelerated by Model Context Protocol (MCP) and Agent-to-Agent (A2A) frameworks, creates urgent privacy challenges. While recent work reveals significant gaps between LLMs' privacy Q&amp;A performance and their agent behavior, existing benchmarks remain limited to static, simplified scenarios. We present PrivacyChecker, a model-agnostic, contextual integrity based mitigation approach that effectively reduces privacy leakage from 36.08% to 7.30% on DeepSeek-R1 and from 33.06% to 8.32% on GPT-4o, all while preserving task helpfulness. We also introduce PrivacyLens-Live, transforming static benchmarks into dynamic MCP and A2A environments that reveal substantially higher privacy risks in practical. Our modular mitigation approach integrates seamlessly into agent protocols through three deployment strategies, providing practical privacy protection for the emerging agentic ecosystem. Our data and code will be made available at https://aka.ms/privacy_in_action.</description>

      <title>MapCoder-Lite: Squeezing Multi-Agent Coding into a Single Small LLM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have advanced code generation from single-function tasks to competitive-programming problems, but existing multi-agent solutions either rely on costly large-scale ($&gt;$ 30B) models or collapse when downsized to small open-source models. We present MapCoder-Lite, which upgrades a single 7B model into four role-specialised agents-retriever, planner, coder, and debugger-using only rank-32, role-specific LoRA adapters ($&lt;3\%$ extra parameters). Three lightweight techniques make this possible: (i) trajectory distillation from strong LLMs fixes format fragility in retrieval and debugging, (ii) supervisor-guided correction strengthens planning and coding agents, and (iii) agent-wise LoRA fine-tuning delivers memory-efficient specialisation. Comprehensive evaluation on xCodeEval, APPS, and CodeContests shows that MapCoder-Lite more than doubles xCodeEval accuracy (from $13.2\%$ to $28.3\%$), eliminates all format failures, and closes to within six points of a 32B baseline while cutting GPU memory and token-generation time by $4\times$. These results demonstrate that careful agent-wise fine-tuning unleashes high-quality multi-agent coding on a small language model.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Medical Image Classification via Synergistic Learning Pre-training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17492v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal pathological images are usually in clinical diagnosis, but computer vision-based multimodal image-assisted diagnosis faces challenges with modality fusion, especially in the absence of expert-annotated data. To achieve the modality fusion in multimodal images with label scarcity, we propose a novel ``pretraining + fine-tuning" framework for multimodal semi-supervised medical image classification. Specifically, we propose a synergistic learning pretraining framework of consistency, reconstructive, and aligned learning. By treating one modality as an augmented sample of another modality, we implement a self-supervised learning pre-train, enhancing the baseline model's feature representation capability. Then, we design a fine-tuning method for multimodal fusion. During the fine-tuning stage, we set different encoders to extract features from the original modalities and provide a multimodal fusion encoder for fusion modality. In addition, we propose a distribution shift method for multimodal fusion features, which alleviates the prediction uncertainty and overfitting risks caused by the lack of labeled samples. We conduct extensive experiments on the publicly available gastroscopy image datasets Kvasir and Kvasirv2. Quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the current state-of-the-art classification methods. The code will be released at: https://github.com/LQH89757/MICS.</description>

      <title>CorefInst: Leveraging LLMs for Multilingual Coreference Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coreference Resolution (CR) is a crucial yet challenging task in natural language understanding, often constrained by task-specific architectures and encoder-based language models that demand extensive training and lack adaptability. This study introduces the first multilingual CR methodology which leverages decoder-only LLMs to handle both overt and zero mentions. The article explores how to model the CR task for LLMs via five different instruction sets using a controlled inference method. The approach is evaluated across three LLMs; Llama 3.1, Gemma 2, and Mistral 0.3. The results indicate that LLMs, when instruction-tuned with a suitable instruction set, can surpass state-of-the-art task-specific architectures. Specifically, our best model, a fully fine-tuned Llama 3.1 for multilingual CR, outperforms the leading multilingual CR model (i.e., Corpipe 24 single stage variant) by 2 pp on average across all languages in the CorefUD v1.2 dataset collection.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the Energy Efficiency of NPU-Accelerated Machine Learning Inference on Embedded Microcontrollers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The deployment of machine learning (ML) models on microcontrollers (MCUs) is constrained by strict energy, latency, and memory requirements, particularly in battery-operated and real-time edge devices. While software-level optimizations such as quantization and pruning reduce model size and computation, hardware acceleration has emerged as a decisive enabler for efficient embedded inference. This paper evaluates the impact of Neural Processing Units (NPUs) on MCU-based ML execution, using the ARM Cortex-M55 core combined with the Ethos-U55 NPU on the Alif Semiconductor Ensemble E7 development board as a representative platform. A rigorous measurement methodology was employed, incorporating per-inference net energy accounting via GPIO-triggered high-resolution digital multimeter synchronization and idle-state subtraction, ensuring accurate attribution of energy costs. Experimental results across six representative ML models -including MiniResNet, MobileNetV2, FD-MobileNet, MNIST, TinyYolo, and SSD-MobileNet- demonstrate substantial efficiency gains when inference is offloaded to the NPU. For moderate to large networks, latency improvements ranged from 7x to over 125x, with per-inference net energy reductions up to 143x. Notably, the NPU enabled execution of models unsupported on CPU-only paths, such as SSD-MobileNet, highlighting its functional as well as efficiency advantages. These findings establish NPUs as a cornerstone of energy-aware embedded AI, enabling real-time, power-constrained ML inference at the MCU level.</description>

      <title>Can LLMs Reason Over Non-Text Modalities in a Training-Free Manner? A Case Study with In-Context Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The remarkable performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) can be enhanced with test-time computation, which relies on external tools and even other deep learning models. However, existing approaches for integrating non-text modality representations into LLMs typically require additional costly supervised training, restricting on-the-fly adaptation to new domains and modalities. In this work, we explore the feasibility of integrating representations from non-text foundational models (FMs) into text-based LLMs in a training-free manner. We propose In-Context Representation Learning (ICRL) as a proof-of-concept to allow LLMs to adaptively utilize non-text modality representations with few-shot learning. Unlike traditional in-context learning, which incorporates text-label pairs, ICRL replaces text inputs with FM representations, enabling the LLM to perform multi-modal inference without fine-tuning. We evaluate ICRL on a suite of tasks in the molecular domain, investigating three core research questions: (i) how to map FM representations into LLMs in a training-free manner, (ii) what factors influence ICRL performance, and (iii) what mechanisms underlie the effectiveness of ICRL. To the best of our knowledge, ICRL is the first training-free framework for integrating non-text modality representations into text-based LLMs, presenting a promising direction for adaptable, multi-modal generalization.</description>

      <title>An Empirical Study on the Robustness of YOLO Models for Underwater Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17561v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Underwater object detection (UOD) remains a critical challenge in computer vision due to underwater distortions which degrade low-level features and compromise the reliability of even state-of-the-art detectors. While YOLO models have become the backbone of real-time object detection, little work has systematically examined their robustness under these uniquely challenging conditions. This raises a critical question: Are YOLO models genuinely robust when operating under the chaotic and unpredictable conditions of underwater environments? In this study, we present one of the first comprehensive evaluations of recent YOLO variants (YOLOv8-YOLOv12) across six simulated underwater environments. Using a unified dataset of 10,000 annotated images from DUO and Roboflow100, we not only benchmark model robustness but also analyze how distortions affect key low-level features such as texture, edges, and color. Our findings show that (1) YOLOv12 delivers the strongest overall performance but is highly vulnerable to noise, and (2) noise disrupts edge and texture features, explaining the poor detection performance in noisy images. Class imbalance is a persistent challenge in UOD. Experiments revealed that (3) image counts and instance frequency primarily drive detection performance, while object appearance exerts only a secondary influence. Finally, we evaluated lightweight training-aware strategies: noise-aware sample injection, which improves robustness in both noisy and real-world conditions, and fine-tuning with advanced enhancement, which boosts accuracy in enhanced domains but slightly lowers performance in original data, demonstrating strong potential for domain adaptation, respectively. Together, these insights provide practical guidance for building resilient and cost-efficient UOD systems.</description>

      <title>MRN: Harnessing 2D Vision Foundation Models for Diagnosing Parkinson's Disease with Limited 3D MR Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The automatic diagnosis of Parkinson's disease is in high clinical demand due to its prevalence and the importance of targeted treatment. Current clinical practice often relies on diagnostic biomarkers in QSM and NM-MRI images. However, the lack of large, high-quality datasets makes training diagnostic models from scratch prone to overfitting. Adapting pre-trained 3D medical models is also challenging, as the diversity of medical imaging leads to mismatches in voxel spacing and modality between pre-training and fine-tuning data. In this paper, we address these challenges by leveraging 2D vision foundation models (VFMs). Specifically, we crop multiple key ROIs from NM and QSM images, process each ROI through separate branches to compress the ROI into a token, and then combine these tokens into a unified patient representation for classification. Within each branch, we use 2D VFMs to encode axial slices of the 3D ROI volume and fuse them into the ROI token, guided by an auxiliary segmentation head that steers the feature extraction toward specific brain nuclei. Additionally, we introduce multi-ROI supervised contrastive learning, which improves diagnostic performance by pulling together representations of patients from the same class while pushing away those from different classes. Our approach achieved first place in the MICCAI 2025 PDCADxFoundation challenge, with an accuracy of 86.0% trained on a dataset of only 300 labeled QSM and NM-MRI scans, outperforming the second-place method by 5.5%.These results highlight the potential of 2D VFMs for clinical analysis of 3D MR images.</description>

      <title>Interpreting Attention Heads for Image-to-Text Information Flow in Large Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) answer visual questions by transferring information from images to text through a series of attention heads. While this image-to-text information flow is central to visual question answering, its underlying mechanism remains difficult to interpret due to the simultaneous operation of numerous attention heads. To address this challenge, we propose head attribution, a technique inspired by component attribution methods, to identify consistent patterns among attention heads that play a key role in information transfer. Using head attribution, we investigate how LVLMs rely on specific attention heads to identify and answer questions about the main object in an image. Our analysis reveals that a distinct subset of attention heads facilitates the image-to-text information flow. Remarkably, we find that the selection of these heads is governed by the semantic content of the input image rather than its visual appearance. We further examine the flow of information at the token level and discover that (1) text information first propagates to role-related tokens and the final token before receiving image information, and (2) image information is embedded in both object-related and background tokens. Our work provides evidence that image-to-text information flow follows a structured process, and that analysis at the attention-head level offers a promising direction toward understanding the mechanisms of LVLMs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Social narratives are known to help autistic children understand and navigate social situations through stories. To ensure effectiveness, however, the materials need to be customized to reflect each child's unique behavioral context, requiring considerable time and effort for parents to practice at home. We present AutiHero, a generative AI-based social narrative system for behavioral guidance, which supports parents to create personalized stories for their autistic children and read them together. AutiHero generates text and visual illustrations that reflect their children's interests, target behaviors, and everyday contexts. In a two-week deployment study with 16 autistic child-parent dyads, parents created 218 stories and read an average of 4.25 stories per day, demonstrating a high level of engagement. AutiHero also provided an effective, low-demanding means to guide children's social behaviors, encouraging positive change. We discuss the implications of generative AI-infused tools to empower parents in guiding their children's behaviors, fostering their social learning.</description>

      <title>SeqBattNet: A Discrete-State Physics-Informed Neural Network with Aging Adaptation for Battery Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate battery modeling is essential for reliable state estimation in modern applications, such as predicting the remaining discharge time and remaining discharge energy in battery management systems. Existing approaches face several limitations: model-based methods require a large number of parameters; data-driven methods rely heavily on labeled datasets; and current physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) often lack aging adaptation, or still depend on many parameters, or continuously regenerate states. In this work, we propose SeqBattNet, a discrete-state PINN with built-in aging adaptation for battery modeling, to predict terminal voltage during the discharge process. SeqBattNet consists of two components: (i) an encoder, implemented as the proposed HRM-GRU deep learning module, which generates cycle-specific aging adaptation parameters; and (ii) a decoder, based on the equivalent circuit model (ECM) combined with deep learning, which uses these parameters together with the input current to predict voltage. The model requires only three basic battery parameters and, when trained on data from a single cell, still achieves robust performance. Extensive evaluations across three benchmark datasets (TRI, RT-Batt, and NASA) demonstrate that SeqBattNet significantly outperforms classical sequence models and PINN baselines, achieving consistently lower RMSE while maintaining computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>MSCoRe: A Benchmark for Multi-Stage Collaborative Reasoning in LLM Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have excelled in question-answering (QA) tasks within single domains. However, their reasoning and coordination capabilities in complex, multi-stage scenarios remain underexplored. Existing benchmarks typically focus on isolated tasks or narrow domains, overlooking models' abilities for multi-stage collaboration and optimization without explicit external guidance. To bridge this gap, we propose \textbf{MSCoRe}, a novel benchmark comprising 126696 domain-specific QA instances spanning scenarios in automotive, pharmaceutical, electronics, and energy sectors. The dataset is created using a structured three-phase pipeline: dynamic sampling, iterative question-answer generation, and a multi-level quality assessment to ensure data quality. Tasks are further categorized into three difficulty levels according to stage coverage and complexity. With MSCoRe, we have conducted a comprehensive evaluation of various state-of-the-art LLM agents. The commercial models performed best across all tasks and scenarios, but a notable gap in ROUGE scores remains between simple and complex tasks. We also tested the models' robustness and found that their performance is negatively affected by noisy data. MSCoRe provides a valuable new resource for the community to evaluate and improve multi-stage reasoning in LLM agents. The code and data are available at https://github.com/D3E0-source/MSCoRE.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thanks to capability to alleviate the cost of large-scale annotation, few-shot action recognition (FSAR) has attracted increased attention of researchers in recent years. Existing FSAR approaches typically neglect the role of individual motion pattern in comparison, and under-explore the feature statistics for video dynamics. Thereby, they struggle to handle the challenging temporal misalignment in video dynamics, particularly by using 2D backbones. To overcome these limitations, this work proposes an adaptively aligned multi-scale second-order moment network, namely A$^2$M$^2$-Net, to describe the latent video dynamics with a collection of powerful representation candidates and adaptively align them in an instance-guided manner. To this end, our A$^2$M$^2$-Net involves two core components, namely, adaptive alignment (A$^2$ module) for matching, and multi-scale second-order moment (M$^2$ block) for strong representation. Specifically, M$^2$ block develops a collection of semantic second-order descriptors at multiple spatio-temporal scales. Furthermore, A$^2$ module aims to adaptively select informative candidate descriptors while considering the individual motion pattern. By such means, our A$^2$M$^2$-Net is able to handle the challenging temporal misalignment problem by establishing an adaptive alignment protocol for strong representation. Notably, our proposed method generalizes well to various few-shot settings and diverse metrics. The experiments are conducted on five widely used FSAR benchmarks, and the results show our A$^2$M$^2$-Net achieves very competitive performance compared to state-of-the-arts, demonstrating its effectiveness and generalization.</description>

      <title>AuditoryBench++: Can Language Models Understand Auditory Knowledge without Hearing?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Even without directly hearing sounds, humans can effortlessly reason about auditory properties, such as pitch, loudness, or sound-source associations, drawing on auditory commonsense. In contrast, language models often lack this capability, limiting their effectiveness in multimodal interactions. As an initial step to address this gap, we present AuditoryBench++, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating auditory knowledge and reasoning in text-only settings. The benchmark encompasses tasks that range from basic auditory comparisons to contextually grounded reasoning, enabling fine-grained analysis of how models process and integrate auditory concepts. In addition, we introduce AIR-CoT, a novel auditory imagination reasoning method that generates and integrates auditory information during inference through span detection with special tokens and knowledge injection. Extensive experiments with recent LLMs and Multimodal LLMs demonstrate that AIR-CoT generally outperforms both the off-the-shelf models and those augmented with auditory knowledge.

      <title>VideoArtGS: Building Digital Twins of Articulated Objects from Monocular Video</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building digital twins of articulated objects from monocular video presents an essential challenge in computer vision, which requires simultaneous reconstruction of object geometry, part segmentation, and articulation parameters from limited viewpoint inputs. Monocular video offers an attractive input format due to its simplicity and scalability; however, it's challenging to disentangle the object geometry and part dynamics with visual supervision alone, as the joint movement of the camera and parts leads to ill-posed estimation. While motion priors from pre-trained tracking models can alleviate the issue, how to effectively integrate them for articulation learning remains largely unexplored. To address this problem, we introduce VideoArtGS, a novel approach that reconstructs high-fidelity digital twins of articulated objects from monocular video. We propose a motion prior guidance pipeline that analyzes 3D tracks, filters noise, and provides reliable initialization of articulation parameters. We also design a hybrid center-grid part assignment module for articulation-based deformation fields that captures accurate part motion. VideoArtGS demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in articulation and mesh reconstruction, reducing the reconstruction error by about two orders of magnitude compared to existing methods. VideoArtGS enables practical digital twin creation from monocular video, establishing a new benchmark for video-based articulated object reconstruction.

      <title>SD-VLM: Spatial Measuring and Understanding with Depth-Encoded Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While vision language models (VLMs) excel in 2D semantic visual understanding, their ability to quantitatively reason about 3D spatial relationships remains under-explored, due to the deficiency of 2D images' spatial representation ability. In this paper, we analyze the problem hindering VLMs' spatial understanding abilities and propose SD-VLM, a novel framework that significantly enhances fundamental spatial perception abilities of VLMs through two key contributions: (1) propose Massive Spatial Measuring and Understanding (MSMU) dataset with precise spatial annotations, and (2) introduce a simple depth positional encoding method strengthening VLMs' spatial awareness. MSMU dataset covers massive quantitative spatial tasks with 700K QA pairs, 2.5M physical numerical annotations, and 10K chain-of-thought augmented samples. We have trained SD-VLM, a strong generalist VLM which shows superior quantitative spatial measuring and understanding capability. SD-VLM not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on our proposed MSMU-Bench, but also shows spatial generalization abilities on other spatial understanding benchmarks including Q-Spatial and SpatialRGPT-Bench. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SD-VLM outperforms GPT-4o and Intern-VL3-78B by 26.91% and 25.56% respectively on MSMU-Bench. Code and models are released at https://github.com/cpystan/SD-VLM.</description>

      <title>Mechanistic Interpretability with SAEs: Probing Religion, Violence, and Geography in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite growing research on bias in large language models (LLMs), most work has focused on gender and race, with little attention to religious identity. This paper explores how religion is internally represented in LLMs and how it intersects with concepts of violence and geography. Using mechanistic interpretability and Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) via the Neuronpedia API, we analyze latent feature activations across five models. We measure overlap between religion- and violence-related prompts and probe semantic patterns in activation contexts. While all five religions show comparable internal cohesion, Islam is more frequently linked to features associated with violent language. In contrast, geographic associations largely reflect real-world religious demographics, revealing how models embed both factual distributions and cultural stereotypes. These findings highlight the value of structural analysis in auditing not just outputs but also internal representations that shape model behavior.</description>

      <title>Turk-LettuceDetect: A Hallucination Detection Models for Turkish RAG Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) has been hindered by their tendency to hallucinate, generating plausible but factually incorrect information. While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems attempt to address this issue by grounding responses in external knowledge, hallucination remains a persistent challenge, particularly for morphologically complex, low-resource languages like Turkish. This paper introduces Turk-LettuceDetect, the first suite of hallucination detection models specifically designed for Turkish RAG applications. Building on the LettuceDetect framework, we formulate hallucination detection as a token-level classification task and fine-tune three distinct encoder architectures: a Turkish-specific ModernBERT, TurkEmbed4STS, and multilingual EuroBERT. These models were trained on a machine-translated version of the RAGTruth benchmark dataset containing 17,790 instances across question answering, data-to-text generation, and summarization tasks. Our experimental results show that the ModernBERT-based model achieves an F1-score of 0.7266 on the complete test set, with particularly strong performance on structured tasks. The models maintain computational efficiency while supporting long contexts up to 8,192 tokens, making them suitable for real-time deployment. Comparative analysis reveals that while state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate high recall, they suffer from low precision due to over-generation of hallucinated content, underscoring the necessity of specialized detection mechanisms. By releasing our models and translated dataset, this work addresses a critical gap in multilingual NLP and establishes a foundation for developing more reliable and trustworthy AI applications for Turkish and other languages.</description>

      <title>Predicting Depth Maps from Single RGB Images and Addressing Missing Information in Depth Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Depth imaging is a crucial area in Autonomous Driving Systems (ADS), as it plays a key role in detecting and measuring objects in the vehicle's surroundings. However, a significant challenge in this domain arises from missing information in Depth images, where certain points are not measurable due to gaps or inconsistencies in pixel data. Our research addresses two key tasks to overcome this challenge. First, we developed an algorithm using a multi-layered training approach to generate Depth images from a single RGB image. Second, we addressed the issue of missing information in Depth images by applying our algorithm to rectify these gaps, resulting in Depth images with complete and accurate data. We further tested our algorithm on the Cityscapes dataset and successfully resolved the missing information in its Depth images, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach in real-world urban environments.</description>

      <title>Evaluating LLM-Generated Versus Human-Authored Responses in Role-Play Dialogues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Evaluating large language models (LLMs) in long-form, knowledge-grounded role-play dialogues remains challenging. This study compares LLM-generated and human-authored responses in multi-turn professional training simulations through human evaluation ($N=38$) and automated LLM-as-a-judge assessment. Human evaluation revealed significant degradation in LLM-generated response quality across turns, particularly in naturalness, context maintenance and overall quality, while human-authored responses progressively improved. In line with this finding, participants also indicated a consistent preference for human-authored dialogue. These human judgements were validated by our automated LLM-as-a-judge evaluation, where Gemini 2.0 Flash achieved strong alignment with human evaluators on both zero-shot pairwise preference and stochastic 6-shot construct ratings, confirming the widening quality gap between LLM and human responses over time. Our work contributes a multi-turn benchmark exposing LLM degradation in knowledge-grounded role-play dialogues and provides a validated hybrid evaluation framework to guide the reliable integration of LLMs in training simulations.</description>

      <title>Cluster Workload Allocation: A Predictive Approach Leveraging Machine Learning Efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This research investigates how Machine Learning (ML) algorithms can assist in workload allocation strategies by detecting tasks with node affinity operators (referred to as constraint operators), which constrain their execution to a limited number of nodes. Using real-world Google Cluster Data (GCD) workload traces and the AGOCS framework, the study extracts node attributes and task constraints, then analyses them to identify suitable node-task pairings. It focuses on tasks that can be executed on either a single node or fewer than a thousand out of 12.5k nodes in the analysed GCD cluster. Task constraint operators are compacted, pre-processed with one-hot encoding, and used as features in a training dataset. Various ML classifiers, including Artificial Neural Networks, K-Nearest Neighbours, Decision Trees, Naive Bayes, Ridge Regression, Adaptive Boosting, and Bagging, are fine-tuned and assessed for accuracy and F1-scores. The final ensemble voting classifier model achieved 98% accuracy and a 1.5-1.8% misclassification rate for tasks with a single suitable node.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used for educational support, yet their response quality varies depending on the language of interaction. This paper presents an automated multilingual pipeline for generating, solving, and evaluating math problems aligned with the German K-10 curriculum. We generated 628 math exercises and translated them into English, German, and Arabic. Three commercial LLMs (GPT-4o-mini, Gemini 2.5 Flash, and Qwen-plus) were prompted to produce step-by-step solutions in each language. A held-out panel of LLM judges, including Claude 3.5 Haiku, evaluated solution quality using a comparative framework. Results show a consistent gap, with English solutions consistently rated highest, and Arabic often ranked lower. These findings highlight persistent linguistic bias and the need for more equitable multilingual AI systems in education.</description>

      <title>Dual-View Alignment Learning with Hierarchical-Prompt for Class-Imbalance Multi-Label Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real-world datasets often exhibit class imbalance across multiple categories, manifesting as long-tailed distributions and few-shot scenarios. This is especially challenging in Class-Imbalanced Multi-Label Image Classification (CI-MLIC) tasks, where data imbalance and multi-object recognition present significant obstacles. To address these challenges, we propose a novel method termed Dual-View Alignment Learning with Hierarchical Prompt (HP-DVAL), which leverages multi-modal knowledge from vision-language pretrained (VLP) models to mitigate the class-imbalance problem in multi-label settings. Specifically, HP-DVAL employs dual-view alignment learning to transfer the powerful feature representation capabilities from VLP models by extracting complementary features for accurate image-text alignment. To better adapt VLP models for CI-MLIC tasks, we introduce a hierarchical prompt-tuning strategy that utilizes global and local prompts to learn task-specific and context-related prior knowledge. Additionally, we design a semantic consistency loss during prompt tuning to prevent learned prompts from deviating from general knowledge embedded in VLP models. The effectiveness of our approach is validated on two CI-MLIC benchmarks: MS-COCO and VOC2007. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method over SOTA approaches, achieving mAP improvements of 10.0\% and 5.2\% on the long-tailed multi-label image classification task, and 6.8\% and 2.9\% on the multi-label few-shot image classification task.</description>

      <title>GEM-T: Generative Tabular Data via Fitting Moments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tabular data dominates data science but poses challenges for generative models, especially when the data is limited or sensitive. We present a novel approach to generating synthetic tabular data based on the principle of maximum entropy -- MaxEnt -- called GEM-T, for ``generative entropy maximization for tables.'' GEM-T directly captures nth-order interactions -- pairwise, third-order, etc. -- among columns of training data. In extensive testing, GEM-T matches or exceeds deep neural network approaches previously regarded as state-of-the-art in 23 of 34 publicly available datasets representing diverse subject domains (68\%). Notably, GEM-T involves orders-of-magnitude fewer trainable parameters, demonstrating that much of the information in real-world data resides in low-dimensional, potentially human-interpretable correlations, provided that the input data is appropriately transformed first. Furthermore, MaxEnt better handles heterogeneous data types (continuous vs. discrete vs. categorical), lack of local structure, and other features of tabular data. GEM-T represents a promising direction for light-weight high-performance generative models for structured data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Qwen3-Omni, a single multimodal model that, for the first time, maintains state-of-the-art performance across text, image, audio, and video without any degradation relative to single-modal counterparts. Qwen3-Omni matches the performance of same-sized single-modal models within the Qwen series and excels particularly on audio tasks. Across 36 audio and audio-visual benchmarks, Qwen3-Omni achieves open-source SOTA on 32 benchmarks and overall SOTA on 22, outperforming strong closed-source models such as Gemini-2.5-Pro, Seed-ASR, and GPT-4o-Transcribe. Qwen3-Omni adopts a Thinker-Talker MoE architecture that unifies perception and generation across text, images, audio, and video, yielding fluent text and natural real-time speech. It supports text interaction in 119 languages, speech understanding in 19 languages, and speech generation in 10 languages. To reduce first-packet latency in streaming synthesis, Talker autoregressively predicts discrete speech codecs using a multi-codebook scheme. Leveraging the representational capacity of these codebooks, we replace computationally intensive block-wise diffusion with a lightweight causal ConvNet, enabling streaming from the first codec frame. In cold-start settings, Qwen3-Omni achieves a theoretical end-to-end first-packet latency of 234 ms. To further strengthen multimodal reasoning, we introduce a Thinking model that explicitly reasons over inputs from any modality. Since the research community currently lacks a general-purpose audio captioning model, we fine-tuned Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B to obtain Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Captioner, which produces detailed, low-hallucination captions for arbitrary audio inputs. Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B, Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Thinking, and Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Captioner are publicly released under the Apache 2.0 license.</description>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with information forgetting and inefficiency in long-horizon, multi-turn dialogues. To address this, we propose a training-free prompt engineering method, the State-Update Multi-turn Dialogue Strategy. It utilizes "State Reconstruction" and "History Remind" mechanisms to effectively manage dialogue history. Our strategy shows strong performance across multiple multi-hop QA datasets. For instance, on the HotpotQA dataset, it improves the core information filtering score by 32.6%, leading to a 14.1% increase in the downstream QA score, while also reducing inference time by 73.1% and token consumption by 59.4%. Ablation studies confirm the pivotal roles of both components. Our work offers an effective solution for optimizing LLMs in long-range interactions, providing new insights for developing more robust Agents.</description>

      <title>DIVERS-Bench: Evaluating Language Identification Across Domain Shifts and Code-Switching</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Language Identification (LID) is a core task in multilingual NLP, yet current systems often overfit to clean, monolingual data. This work introduces DIVERS-BENCH, a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LID models across diverse domains, including speech transcripts, web text, social media texts, children's stories, and code-switched text. Our findings reveal that while models achieve high accuracy on curated datasets, performance degrades sharply on noisy and informal inputs. We also introduce DIVERS-CS, a diverse code-switching benchmark dataset spanning 10 language pairs, and show that existing models struggle to detect multiple languages within the same sentence. These results highlight the need for more robust and inclusive LID systems in real-world settings.</description>

      <title>Revealing Multimodal Causality with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Uncovering cause-and-effect mechanisms from data is fundamental to scientific progress. While large language models (LLMs) show promise for enhancing causal discovery (CD) from unstructured data, their application to the increasingly prevalent multimodal setting remains a critical challenge. Even with the advent of multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), their efficacy in multimodal CD is hindered by two primary limitations: (1) difficulty in exploring intra- and inter-modal interactions for comprehensive causal variable identification; and (2) insufficiency to handle structural ambiguities with purely observational data. To address these challenges, we propose MLLM-CD, a novel framework for multimodal causal discovery from unstructured data. It consists of three key components: (1) a novel contrastive factor discovery module to identify genuine multimodal factors based on the interactions explored from contrastive sample pairs; (2) a statistical causal structure discovery module to infer causal relationships among discovered factors; and (3) an iterative multimodal counterfactual reasoning module to refine the discovery outcomes iteratively by incorporating the world knowledge and reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of MLLM-CD in revealing genuine factors and causal relationships among them from multimodal unstructured data.</description>

      <title>Accurate and Efficient Low-Rank Model Merging in Core Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the challenges associated with merging low-rank adaptations of large neural networks. With the rise of parameter-efficient adaptation techniques, such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), model fine-tuning has become more accessible. While fine-tuning models with LoRA is highly efficient, existing merging methods often sacrifice this efficiency by merging fully-sized weight matrices. We propose the Core Space merging framework, which enables the merging of LoRA-adapted models within a common alignment basis, thereby preserving the efficiency of low-rank adaptation while substantially improving accuracy across tasks. We further provide a formal proof that projection into Core Space ensures no loss of information and provide a complexity analysis showing the efficiency gains. Extensive empirical results demonstrate that Core Space significantly improves existing merging techniques and achieves state-of-the-art results on both vision and language tasks while utilizing a fraction of the computational resources.

      <title>One Agent to Serve All: a Lite-Adaptive Stylized AI Assistant for Millions of Multi-Style Official Accounts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conversational agents deployed in industrial-scale official account platforms must generate responses that are both contextually grounded and stylistically aligned-requirements that existing methods struggle to meet. Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting induces significant latency due to multi-turn reasoning; per-account fine-tuning is computationally prohibitive; and long prompt-based methods degrade the model's ability to grasp injected context and style. In this paper, we propose WeStar, a lite-adaptive framework for stylized contextual question answering that scales to millions of official accounts. WeStar combines context-grounded generation via RAG with style-aware generation using Parametric RAG (PRAG), where LoRA modules are dynamically activated per style cluster. Our contributions are fourfold: (1) We introduce WeStar, a unified framework capable of serving large volumes of official accounts with minimal overhead. (2) We propose a multi-dimensional, cluster-based parameter sharing scheme that enables compact style representation while preserving stylistic diversity. (3) We develop a style-enhanced Direct Preference Optimization (SeDPO) method to optimize each style cluster's parameters for improved generation quality. (4) Experiments on a large-scale industrial dataset validate the effectiveness and efficiency of WeStar, underscoring its pracitical value in real-world deployment.</description>

      <title>TS-P$^2$CL: Plug-and-Play Dual Contrastive Learning for Vision-Guided Medical Time Series Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Medical time series (MedTS) classification is pivotal for intelligent healthcare, yet its efficacy is severely limited by poor cross-subject generation due to the profound cross-individual heterogeneity. Despite advances in architectural innovations and transfer learning techniques, current methods remain constrained by modality-specific inductive biases that limit their ability to learn universally invariant representations. To overcome this, we propose TS-P$^2$CL, a novel plug-and-play framework that leverages the universal pattern recognition capabilities of pre-trained vision models. We introduce a vision-guided paradigm that transforms 1D physiological signals into 2D pseudo-images, establishing a bridge to the visual domain. This transformation enables implicit access to rich semantic priors learned from natural images. Within this unified space, we employ a dual-contrastive learning strategy: intra-modal consistency enforces temporal coherence, while cross-modal alignment aligns time-series dynamics with visual semantics, thereby mitigating individual-specific biases and learning robust, domain-invariant features. Extensive experiments on six MedTS datasets demonstrate that TS-P$^2$CL consistently outperforms fourteen methods in both subject-dependent and subject-independent settings.</description>

      <title>Fine-Grained Detection of AI-Generated Text Using Sentence-Level Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) texts in important works has become a common practice that can be used to misuse and abuse AI at various levels. Traditional AI detectors often rely on document-level classification, which struggles to identify AI content in hybrid or slightly edited texts designed to avoid detection, leading to concerns about the model's efficiency, which makes it hard to distinguish between human-written and AI-generated texts. A sentence-level sequence labeling model proposed to detect transitions between human- and AI-generated text, leveraging nuanced linguistic signals overlooked by document-level classifiers. By this method, detecting and segmenting AI and human-written text within a single document at the token-level granularity is achieved. Our model combines the state-of-the-art pre-trained Transformer models, incorporating Neural Networks (NN) and Conditional Random Fields (CRFs). This approach extends the power of transformers to extract semantic and syntactic patterns, and the neural network component to capture enhanced sequence-level representations, thereby improving the boundary predictions by the CRF layer, which enhances sequence recognition and further identification of the partition between Human- and AI-generated texts. The evaluation is performed on two publicly available benchmark datasets containing collaborative human and AI-generated texts. Our experimental comparisons are with zero-shot detectors and the existing state-of-the-art models, along with rigorous ablation studies to justify that this approach, in particular, can accurately detect the spans of AI texts in a completely collaborative text. All our source code and the processed datasets are available in our GitHub repository.</description>

Abstract: We propose an interactive system using foundation models and user-provided technical documents to generate Failure Mode and Effects Analyses (FMEA) for industrial equipment. Our system aggregates unstructured content across documents to generate an FMEA and stores it in a relational database. Leveraging this tool, the time required for creation of this knowledge-intensive content is reduced, outperforming traditional manual approaches. This demonstration showcases the potential of foundation models to facilitate the creation of specialized structured content for enterprise asset management systems.</description>

      <title>Understanding Post-Training Structural Changes in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Post-training fundamentally alters the behavior of large language models (LLMs), yet its impact on the internal parameter space remains poorly understood. In this work, we conduct a systematic singular value decomposition (SVD) analysis of principal linear layers in pretrained LLMs, focusing on two widely adopted post-training methods: instruction tuning and long-chain-of-thought (Long-CoT) distillation. Our analysis reveals two consistent and unexpected structural changes:(1) a near-uniform geometric scaling of singular values across layers, which theoretically modulates attention scores; and (2) highly consistent orthogonal transformations are applied to the left and right singular vectors of each matrix. Disrupting this orthogonal consistency leads to catastrophic performance degradation. Based on these findings, we propose a simple yet effective framework that interprets post-training as a reparameterization of fixed subspaces in the pretrained parameter space. Further experiments reveal that singular value scaling behaves as a secondary effect, analogous to a temperature adjustment, whereas the core functional transformation lies in the coordinated rotation of singular vectors. These results challenge the prevailing view of the parameter space in large models as a black box, uncovering the first clear regularities in how parameters evolve during training, and providing a new perspective for deeper investigation into model parameter changes.</description>

      <title>How Persuasive is Your Context?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two central capabilities of language models (LMs) are: (i) drawing on prior knowledge about entities, which allows them to answer queries such as "What's the official language of Austria?", and (ii) adapting to new information provided in context, e.g., "Pretend the official language of Austria is Tagalog.", that is pre-pended to the question. In this article, we introduce targeted persuasion score (TPS), designed to quantify how persuasive a given context is to an LM where persuasion is operationalized as the ability of the context to alter the LM's answer to the question. In contrast to evaluating persuasiveness only by inspecting the greedily decoded answer under the model, TPS provides a more fine-grained view of model behavior. Based on the Wasserstein distance, TPS measures how much a context shifts a model's original answer distribution toward a target distribution. Empirically, through a series of experiments, we show that TPS captures a more nuanced notion of persuasiveness than previously proposed metrics.</description>

      <title>Confidence-gated training for efficient early-exit neural networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Early-exit neural networks reduce inference cost by enabling confident predictions at intermediate layers. However, joint training often leads to gradient interference, with deeper classifiers dominating optimization. We propose Confidence-Gated Training (CGT), a paradigm that conditionally propagates gradients from deeper exits only when preceding exits fail. This encourages shallow classifiers to act as primary decision points while reserving deeper layers for harder inputs. By aligning training with the inference-time policy, CGT mitigates overthinking, improves early-exit accuracy, and preserves efficiency. Experiments on the Indian Pines and Fashion-MNIST benchmarks show that CGT lowers average inference cost while improving overall accuracy, offering a practical solution for deploying deep models in resource-constrained environments.</description>

      <title>Trainee Action Recognition through Interaction Analysis in CCATT Mixed-Reality Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study examines how Critical Care Air Transport Team (CCATT) members are trained using mixed-reality simulations that replicate the high-pressure conditions of aeromedical evacuation. Each team - a physician, nurse, and respiratory therapist - must stabilize severely injured soldiers by managing ventilators, IV pumps, and suction devices during flight. Proficient performance requires clinical expertise and cognitive skills, such as situational awareness, rapid decision-making, effective communication, and coordinated task management, all of which must be maintained under stress. Recent advances in simulation and multimodal data analytics enable more objective and comprehensive performance evaluation. In contrast, traditional instructor-led assessments are subjective and may overlook critical events, thereby limiting generalizability and consistency. However, AI-based automated and more objective evaluation metrics still demand human input to train the AI algorithms to assess complex team dynamics in the presence of environmental noise and the need for accurate re-identification in multi-person tracking. To address these challenges, we introduce a systematic, data-driven assessment framework that combines Cognitive Task Analysis (CTA) with Multimodal Learning Analytics (MMLA). We have developed a domain-specific CTA model for CCATT training and a vision-based action recognition pipeline using a fine-tuned Human-Object Interaction model, the Cascade Disentangling Network (CDN), to detect and track trainee-equipment interactions over time. These interactions automatically yield performance indicators (e.g., reaction time, task duration), which are mapped onto a hierarchical CTA model tailored to CCATT operations, enabling interpretable, domain-relevant performance evaluations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multilingual translation faces challenges of computational redundancy and limited accuracy for low-resource languages, especially in speech translation. To address this, we propose a novel hierarchical Transformer Encoder Tree (TET) combined with non-autoregressive encoder-only models trained with Connectionist Temporal Classification for multilingual translation. By sharing intermediate representations among linguistically similar target languages, TET can improve accuracy on low-resource languages, reduce computational redundancy, and allow generating all target languages in a single forward pass, thus eliminating sequential bottlenecks and improving parallelism. For speech translation, combining TET with a non-autoregressive speech recognition backbone (wav2vec2) shows promising results in terms of translation quality compared to autoregressive systems while being 7-14 times faster.</description>

      <title>ComposableNav: Instruction-Following Navigation in Dynamic Environments via Composable Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper considers the problem of enabling robots to navigate dynamic environments while following instructions. The challenge lies in the combinatorial nature of instruction specifications: each instruction can include multiple specifications, and the number of possible specification combinations grows exponentially as the robot's skill set expands. For example, "overtake the pedestrian while staying on the right side of the road" consists of two specifications: "overtake the pedestrian" and "walk on the right side of the road." To tackle this challenge, we propose ComposableNav, based on the intuition that following an instruction involves independently satisfying its constituent specifications, each corresponding to a distinct motion primitive. Using diffusion models, ComposableNav learns each primitive separately, then composes them in parallel at deployment time to satisfy novel combinations of specifications unseen in training. Additionally, to avoid the onerous need for demonstrations of individual motion primitives, we propose a two-stage training procedure: (1) supervised pre-training to learn a base diffusion model for dynamic navigation, and (2) reinforcement learning fine-tuning that molds the base model into different motion primitives. Through simulation and real-world experiments, we show that ComposableNav enables robots to follow instructions by generating trajectories that satisfy diverse and unseen combinations of specifications, significantly outperforming both non-compositional VLM-based policies and costmap composing baselines. Videos and additional materials can be found on the project page: https://amrl.cs.utexas.edu/ComposableNav/</description>

      <title>StefaLand: An Efficient Geoscience Foundation Model That Improves Dynamic Land-Surface Predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stewarding natural resources, mitigating floods, droughts, wildfires, and landslides, and meeting growing demands require models that can predict climate-driven land-surface responses and human feedback with high accuracy. Traditional impact models, whether process-based, statistical, or machine learning, struggle with spatial generalization due to limited observations and concept drift. Recently proposed vision foundation models trained on satellite imagery demand massive compute and are ill-suited for dynamic land-surface prediction. We introduce StefaLand, a generative spatiotemporal earth foundation model centered on landscape interactions. StefaLand improves predictions on three tasks and four datasets: streamflow, soil moisture, and soil composition, compared to prior state-of-the-art. Results highlight its ability to generalize across diverse, data-scarce regions and support broad land-surface applications. The model builds on a masked autoencoder backbone that learns deep joint representations of landscape attributes, with a location-aware architecture fusing static and time-series inputs, attribute-based representations that drastically reduce compute, and residual fine-tuning adapters that enhance transfer. While inspired by prior methods, their alignment with geoscience and integration in one model enables robust performance on dynamic land-surface tasks. StefaLand can be pretrained and finetuned on academic compute yet outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and even fine-tuned vision foundation models. To our knowledge, this is the first geoscience land-surface foundation model that demonstrably improves dynamic land-surface interaction predictions and supports diverse downstream applications.</description>

      <title>HICode: Hierarchical Inductive Coding with LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite numerous applications for fine-grained corpus analysis, researchers continue to rely on manual labeling, which does not scale, or statistical tools like topic modeling, which are difficult to control. We propose that LLMs have the potential to scale the nuanced analyses that researchers typically conduct manually to large text corpora. To this effect, inspired by qualitative research methods, we develop HICode, a two-part pipeline that first inductively generates labels directly from analysis data and then hierarchically clusters them to surface emergent themes. We validate this approach across three diverse datasets by measuring alignment with human-constructed themes and demonstrating its robustness through automated and human evaluations. Finally, we conduct a case study of litigation documents related to the ongoing opioid crisis in the U.S., revealing aggressive marketing strategies employed by pharmaceutical companies and demonstrating HICode's potential for facilitating nuanced analyses in large-scale data.</description>

      <title>Joint Optimization of Memory Frequency, Computing Frequency, Transmission Power and Task Offloading for Energy-efficient DNN Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been widely applied in diverse applications, but the problems of high latency and energy overhead are inevitable on resource-constrained devices. To address this challenge, most researchers focus on the dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) technique to balance the latency and energy consumption by changing the computing frequency of processors. However, the adjustment of memory frequency is usually ignored and not fully utilized to achieve efficient DNN inference, which also plays a significant role in the inference time and energy consumption. In this paper, we first investigate the impact of joint memory frequency and computing frequency scaling on the inference time and energy consumption with a model-based and data-driven method. Then by combining with the fitting parameters of different DNN models, we give a preliminary analysis for the proposed model to see the effects of adjusting memory frequency and computing frequency simultaneously. Finally, simulation results in local inference and cooperative inference cases further validate the effectiveness of jointly scaling the memory frequency and computing frequency to reduce the energy consumption of devices.</description>

      <title>Intra-Cluster Mixup: An Effective Data Augmentation Technique for Complementary-Label Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the challenges of complementary-label learning (CLL), a specialized form of weakly-supervised learning (WSL) where models are trained with labels indicating classes to which instances do not belong, rather than standard ordinary labels. This alternative supervision is appealing because collecting complementary labels is generally cheaper and less labor-intensive. Although most existing research in CLL emphasizes the development of novel loss functions, the potential of data augmentation in this domain remains largely underexplored. In this work, we uncover that the widely-used Mixup data augmentation technique is ineffective when directly applied to CLL. Through in-depth analysis, we identify that the complementary-label noise generated by Mixup negatively impacts the performance of CLL models. We then propose an improved technique called Intra-Cluster Mixup (ICM), which only synthesizes augmented data from nearby examples, to mitigate the noise effect. ICM carries the benefits of encouraging complementary label sharing of nearby examples, and leads to substantial performance improvements across synthetic and real-world labeled datasets. In particular, our wide spectrum of experimental results on both balanced and imbalanced CLL settings justifies the potential of ICM in allying with state-of-the-art CLL algorithms, achieving significant accuracy increases of 30% and 10% on MNIST and CIFAR datasets, respectively.</description>

      <title>ReDepress: A Cognitive Framework for Detecting Depression Relapse from Social Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Almost 50% depression patients face the risk of going into relapse. The risk increases to 80% after the second episode of depression. Although, depression detection from social media has attained considerable attention, depression relapse detection has remained largely unexplored due to the lack of curated datasets and the difficulty of distinguishing relapse and non-relapse users. In this work, we present ReDepress, the first clinically validated social media dataset focused on relapse, comprising 204 Reddit users annotated by mental health professionals. Unlike prior approaches, our framework draws on cognitive theories of depression, incorporating constructs such as attention bias, interpretation bias, memory bias and rumination into both annotation and modeling. Through statistical analyses and machine learning experiments, we demonstrate that cognitive markers significantly differentiate relapse and non-relapse groups, and that models enriched with these features achieve competitive performance, with transformer-based temporal models attaining an F1 of 0.86. Our findings validate psychological theories in real-world textual data and underscore the potential of cognitive-informed computational methods for early relapse detection, paving the way for scalable, low-cost interventions in mental healthcare.</description>

      <title>Variation in Verification: Understanding Verification Dynamics in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances have shown that scaling test-time computation enables large language models (LLMs) to solve increasingly complex problems across diverse domains. One effective paradigm for test-time scaling (TTS) involves LLM generators producing multiple solution candidates, with LLM verifiers assessing the correctness of these candidates without reference answers. In this paper, we study generative verifiers, which perform verification by generating chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning followed by a binary verdict. We systematically analyze verification dynamics across three dimensions - problem difficulty, generator capability, and verifier generation capability - with empirical studies on 12 benchmarks across mathematical reasoning, knowledge, and natural language reasoning tasks using 14 open-source models (2B to 72B parameter range) and GPT-4o. Our experiments reveal three key findings about verification effectiveness: (1) Easy problems allow verifiers to more reliably certify correct responses; (2) Weak generators produce errors that are easier to detect than strong generators; (3) Verification ability is generally correlated with the verifier's own problem-solving capability, but this relationship varies with problem difficulty. These findings reveal opportunities to optimize basic verification strategies in TTS applications. First, given the same verifier, some weak generators can nearly match stronger ones in post-verification TTS performance (e.g., the Gemma2-9B to Gemma2-27B performance gap shrinks by 75.5%). Second, we identify cases where strong verifiers offer limited advantage over weak ones, as both fail to provide meaningful verification gains, suggesting that verifier scaling alone cannot overcome fundamental verification challenges.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Kernel Design for Bayesian Optimization Is a Piece of CAKE with LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The efficiency of Bayesian optimization (BO) relies heavily on the choice of the Gaussian process (GP) kernel, which plays a central role in balancing exploration and exploitation under limited evaluation budgets. Traditional BO methods often rely on fixed or heuristic kernel selection strategies, which can result in slow convergence or suboptimal solutions when the chosen kernel is poorly suited to the underlying objective function. To address this limitation, we propose a freshly-baked Context-Aware Kernel Evolution (CAKE) to enhance BO with large language models (LLMs). Concretely, CAKE leverages LLMs as the crossover and mutation operators to adaptively generate and refine GP kernels based on the observed data throughout the optimization process. To maximize the power of CAKE, we further propose BIC-Acquisition Kernel Ranking (BAKER) to select the most effective kernel through balancing the model fit measured by the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) with the expected improvement at each iteration of BO. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our fresh CAKE-based BO method consistently outperforms established baselines across a range of real-world tasks, including hyperparameter optimization, controller tuning, and photonic chip design. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/cake4bo/cake.</description>

      <title>The Narcissus Hypothesis:Descending to the Rung of Illusion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern foundational models increasingly reflect not just world knowledge, but patterns of human preference embedded in their training data. We hypothesize that recursive alignment-via human feedback and model-generated corpora-induces a social desirability bias, nudging models to favor agreeable or flattering responses over objective reasoning. We refer to it as the Narcissus Hypothesis and test it across 31 models using standardized personality assessments and a novel Social Desirability Bias score. Results reveal a significant drift toward socially conforming traits, with profound implications for corpus integrity and the reliability of downstream inferences. We then offer a novel epistemological interpretation, tracing how recursive bias may collapse higher-order reasoning down Pearl's Ladder of Causality, culminating in what we refer to as the Rung of Illusion.</description>

      <title>Unveiling m-Sharpness Through the Structure of Stochastic Gradient Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18001v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) has emerged as a highly effective technique for improving model generalization, but its underlying principles are not fully understood. We investigated the phenomenon known as m-sharpness, where the performance of SAM improves monotonically as the micro-batch size for computing perturbations decreases. Leveraging an extended Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) framework, combined with an analysis of the structure of stochastic gradient noise (SGN), we precisely characterize the dynamics of various SAM variants. Our findings reveal that the stochastic noise introduced during SAM perturbations inherently induces a variance-based sharpness regularization effect. Motivated by our theoretical insights, we introduce Reweighted SAM, which employs sharpness-weighted sampling to mimic the generalization benefits of m-SAM while remaining parallelizable. Comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our theoretical analysis and proposed method.</description>

      <title>Through the Lens of Human-Human Collaboration: A Configurable Research Platform for Exploring Human-Agent Collaboration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.18008v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intelligent systems have traditionally been designed as tools rather than collaborators, often lacking critical characteristics that collaboration partnerships require. Recent advances in large language model (LLM) agents open new opportunities for human-LLM-agent collaboration by enabling natural communication and various social and cognitive behaviors. Yet it remains unclear whether principles of computer-mediated collaboration established in HCI and CSCW persist, change, or fail when humans collaborate with LLM agents. To support systematic investigations of these questions, we introduce an open and configurable research platform for HCI researchers. The platform's modular design allows seamless adaptation of classic CSCW experiments and manipulation of theory-grounded interaction controls. We demonstrate the platform's effectiveness and usability through two case studies: (1) re-implementing the classic human-human-collaboration task Shape Factory as a between-subject human-agent-collaboration experiment with 16 participants, and (2) a participatory cognitive walkthrough with five HCI researchers to refine workflows and interfaces for experiment setup and analysis.</description>

      <title>Cross-Attention is Half Explanation in Speech-to-Text Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cross-attention is a core mechanism in encoder-decoder architectures, widespread in many fields, including speech-to-text (S2T) processing. Its scores have been repurposed for various downstream applications--such as timestamp estimation and audio-text alignment--under the assumption that they reflect the dependencies between input speech representation and the generated text. While the explanatory nature of attention mechanisms has been widely debated in the broader NLP literature, this assumption remains largely unexplored within the speech domain. To address this gap, we assess the explanatory power of cross-attention in S2T models by comparing its scores to input saliency maps derived from feature attribution. Our analysis spans monolingual and multilingual, single-task and multi-task models at multiple scales, and shows that attention scores moderately to strongly align with saliency-based explanations, particularly when aggregated across heads and layers. However, it also shows that cross-attention captures only about 50% of the input relevance and, in the best case, only partially reflects how the decoder attends to the encoder's representations--accounting for just 52-75% of the saliency. These findings uncover fundamental limitations in interpreting cross-attention as an explanatory proxy, suggesting that it offers an informative yet incomplete view of the factors driving predictions in S2T models.</description>

      <title>Beyond Diagnosis: Evaluating Multimodal LLMs for Pathology Localization in Chest Radiographs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent work has shown promising performance of frontier large language models (LLMs) and their multimodal counterparts in medical quizzes and diagnostic tasks, highlighting their potential for broad clinical utility given their accessible, general-purpose nature. However, beyond diagnosis, a fundamental aspect of medical image interpretation is the ability to localize pathological findings. Evaluating localization not only has clinical and educational relevance but also provides insight into a model's spatial understanding of anatomy and disease. Here, we systematically assess two general-purpose MLLMs (GPT-4 and GPT-5) and a domain-specific model (MedGemma) in their ability to localize pathologies on chest radiographs, using a prompting pipeline that overlays a spatial grid and elicits coordinate-based predictions. Averaged across nine pathologies in the CheXlocalize dataset, GPT-5 exhibited a localization accuracy of 49.7%, followed by GPT-4 (39.1%) and MedGemma (17.7%), all lower than a task-specific CNN baseline (59.9%) and a radiologist benchmark (80.1%). Despite modest performance, error analysis revealed that GPT-5's predictions were largely in anatomically plausible regions, just not always precisely localized. GPT-4 performed well on pathologies with fixed anatomical locations, but struggled with spatially variable findings and exhibited anatomically implausible predictions more frequently. MedGemma demonstrated the lowest performance on all pathologies, showing limited capacity to generalize to this novel task. Our findings highlight both the promise and limitations of current MLLMs in medical imaging and underscore the importance of integrating them with task-specific tools for reliable use.</description>

Abstract: One can see deep-learning models as compositions of functions within the so-called tame geometry. In this expository note, we give an overview of some topics at the interface of tame geometry (also known as o-minimality), optimization theory, and deep learning theory and practice. To do so, we gradually introduce the concepts and tools used to build convergence guarantees for stochastic gradient descent in a general nonsmooth nonconvex, but tame, setting. This illustrates some ways in which tame geometry is a natural mathematical framework for the study of AI systems, especially within Deep Learning.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Reputation Aggregation: A Robust Defense Mechanism for Adversarial Federated Learning in 5G and Edge Network Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) in 5G and edge network environments face severe security threats from adversarial clients. Malicious participants can perform label flipping, inject backdoor triggers, or launch Sybil attacks to corrupt the global model. This paper introduces Hybrid Reputation Aggregation (HRA), a novel robust aggregation mechanism designed to defend against diverse adversarial behaviors in FL without prior knowledge of the attack type. HRA combines geometric anomaly detection with momentum-based reputation tracking of clients. In each round, it detects outlier model updates via distance-based geometric analysis while continuously updating a trust score for each client based on historical behavior. This hybrid approach enables adaptive filtering of suspicious updates and long-term penalization of unreliable clients, countering attacks ranging from backdoor insertions to random noise Byzantine failures. We evaluate HRA on a large-scale proprietary 5G network dataset (3M+ records) and the widely used NF-CSE-CIC-IDS2018 benchmark under diverse adversarial attack scenarios. Experimental results reveal that HRA achieves robust global model accuracy of up to 98.66% on the 5G dataset and 96.60% on NF-CSE-CIC-IDS2018, outperforming state-of-the-art aggregators such as Krum, Trimmed Mean, and Bulyan by significant margins. Our ablation studies further demonstrate that the full hybrid system achieves 98.66% accuracy, while the anomaly-only and reputation-only variants drop to 84.77% and 78.52%, respectively, validating the synergistic value of our dual-mechanism approach. This demonstrates HRA's enhanced resilience and robustness in 5G/edge federated learning deployments, even under significant adversarial conditions.</description>

      <title>HuMam: Humanoid Motion Control via End-to-End Deep Reinforcement Learning with Mamba</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: End-to-end reinforcement learning (RL) for humanoid locomotion is appealing for its compact perception-action mapping, yet practical policies often suffer from training instability, inefficient feature fusion, and high actuation cost. We present HuMam, a state-centric end-to-end RL framework that employs a single-layer Mamba encoder to fuse robot-centric states with oriented footstep targets and a continuous phase clock. The policy outputs joint position targets tracked by a low-level PD loop and is optimized with PPO. A concise six-term reward balances contact quality, swing smoothness, foot placement, posture, and body stability while implicitly promoting energy saving. On the JVRC-1 humanoid in mc-mujoco, HuMam consistently improves learning efficiency, training stability, and overall task performance over a strong feedforward baseline, while reducing power consumption and torque peaks. To our knowledge, this is the first end-to-end humanoid RL controller that adopts Mamba as the fusion backbone, demonstrating tangible gains in efficiency, stability, and control economy.</description>

Abstract: Selecting a solution algorithm for the Facility Layout Problem (FLP), an NP-hard optimization problem with a multiobjective trade-off, is a complex task that requires deep expert knowledge. The performance of a given algorithm depends on specific problem characteristics such as its scale, objectives, and constraints. This creates a need for a data-driven recommendation method to guide algorithm selection in automated design systems. This paper introduces a new recommendation method to make such expertise accessible, based on a Knowledge Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (KG RAG) framework. To address this, a domain-specific knowledge graph is constructed from published literature. The method then employs a multi-faceted retrieval mechanism to gather relevant evidence from this knowledge graph using three distinct approaches, which include a precise graph-based search, flexible vector-based search, and high-level cluster-based search. The retrieved evidence is utilized by a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate algorithm recommendations with data-driven reasoning. The proposed KG-RAG method is compared against a commercial LLM chatbot with access to the knowledge base as a table, across a series of diverse, real-world FLP test cases. Based on recommendation accuracy and reasoning capability, the proposed method performed significantly better than the commercial LLM chatbot.</description>

      <title>Reinforced Generation of Combinatorial Structures: Applications to Complexity Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore whether techniques from AI can help discover new combinatorial structures that improve provable limits on efficient algorithms. Specifically, we use AlphaEvolve (an LLM coding agent) to study two settings:
  a) Average-case hardness for MAX-CUT and MAX-Independent Set: We improve a recent result of Kunisky and Yu to obtain near-optimal upper and (conditional) lower bounds on certification algorithms for MAX-CUT and MAX-Independent Set on random 3- and 4-regular graphs. Our improved lower bounds are obtained by constructing nearly extremal Ramanujan graphs on as many as $163$ nodes, using AlphaEvolve. Additionally, via analytical arguments we strengthen the upper bounds to settle the computational hardness of these questions up to an error in the third decimal place.
  b) Worst-case Hardness of Approximation for MAX-k-CUT: We obtain new inapproximability results, proving that it is NP-hard to approximate MAX-4-CUT and MAX-3-CUT within factors of $0.987$ and $0.9649$ respectively, using AlphaEvolve to discover new gadget reductions. Our MAX-4-CUT result improves upon the SOTA of $0.9883$, and our MAX-3-CUT result improves on the current best gadget-based inapproximability result of $0.9853$, but falls short of improving the SOTA of $16/17$ that relies on a custom PCP, rather than a gadget reduction from "standard" H{\aa}stad-style PCPs.
  A key technical challenge we faced: verifying a candidate construction produced by AlphaEvolve is costly (often requiring exponential time). In both settings above, our results were enabled by using AlphaEvolve itself to evolve the verification procedure to be faster (sometimes by $10,000\times$). We conclude with a discussion of norms by which to assess the assistance from AI in developing proofs.</description>

      <title>Strategic Dishonesty Can Undermine AI Safety Evaluations of Frontier LLM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language model (LLM) developers aim for their models to be honest, helpful, and harmless. However, when faced with malicious requests, models are trained to refuse, sacrificing helpfulness. We show that frontier LLMs can develop a preference for dishonesty as a new strategy, even when other options are available. Affected models respond to harmful requests with outputs that sound harmful but are subtly incorrect or otherwise harmless in practice. This behavior emerges with hard-to-predict variations even within models from the same model family. We find no apparent cause for the propensity to deceive, but we show that more capable models are better at executing this strategy. Strategic dishonesty already has a practical impact on safety evaluations, as we show that dishonest responses fool all output-based monitors used to detect jailbreaks that we test, rendering benchmark scores unreliable. Further, strategic dishonesty can act like a honeypot against malicious users, which noticeably obfuscates prior jailbreak attacks. While output monitors fail, we show that linear probes on internal activations can be used to reliably detect strategic dishonesty. We validate probes on datasets with verifiable outcomes and by using their features as steering vectors. Overall, we consider strategic dishonesty as a concrete example of a broader concern that alignment of LLMs is hard to control, especially when helpfulness and harmlessness conflict.</description>

      <title>TMD-TTS: A Unified Tibetan Multi-Dialect Text-to-Speech Synthesis for \"U-Tsang, Amdo and Kham Speech Dataset Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.18060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tibetan is a low-resource language with limited parallel speech corpora spanning its three major dialects (\"U-Tsang, Amdo, and Kham), limiting progress in speech modeling. To address this issue, we propose TMD-TTS, a unified Tibetan multi-dialect text-to-speech (TTS) framework that synthesizes parallel dialectal speech from explicit dialect labels. Our method features a dialect fusion module and a Dialect-Specialized Dynamic Routing Network (DSDR-Net) to capture fine-grained acoustic and linguistic variations across dialects. Extensive objective and subjective evaluations demonstrate that TMD-TTS significantly outperforms baselines in dialectal expressiveness. We further validate the quality and utility of the synthesized speech through a challenging Speech-to-Speech Dialect Conversion (S2SDC) task.</description>

      <title>Spiffy: Multiplying Diffusion LLM Acceleration via Lossless Speculative Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion LLMs (dLLMs) have recently emerged as a powerful alternative to autoregressive LLMs (AR-LLMs) with the potential to operate at significantly higher token generation rates. However, currently available open-source dLLMs often generate at much lower rates, typically decoding only a single token at every denoising timestep in order to maximize output quality. We present Spiffy, a speculative decoding algorithm that accelerates dLLM inference by $\mathbf{2.8{-}3.1\times}$ while provably preserving the model's output distribution. This work addresses the unique challenges involved in applying ideas from speculative decoding of AR-LLMs to the dLLM setting. Spiffy proposes draft states by leveraging the dLLM's distribution itself in an auto-speculative manner. This approach is efficient and effective, and eliminates the overheads of training and running an independent draft model. To structure the candidate draft states, we propose a novel directed draft graph which is uniquely designed to take advantage of the bidirectional, block-wise nature of dLLM generation and can be verified in parallel by the dLLM. To further optimize the structure of these draft graphs, we introduce an efficient, offline calibration algorithm that procedurally determines high-quality graph configurations. These optimized draft graphs, enabling increased acceptance rates, lead to a significant boost in the overall speedup achieved by the system. Crucially, Spiffy is also complementary to other recent innovations in improving dLLM generation speeds such as KV-caching and multi-token unmasking. We demonstrate that when combined with such parallel decoding algorithms, Spiffy is able to effectively multiply the benefits of these methods leading to total speedups of up to $\mathbf{7.9\times}$.</description>

      <title>OnePiece: Bringing Context Engineering and Reasoning to Industrial Cascade Ranking System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the growing interest in replicating the scaled success of large language models (LLMs) in industrial search and recommender systems, most existing industrial efforts remain limited to transplanting Transformer architectures, which bring only incremental improvements over strong Deep Learning Recommendation Models (DLRMs). From a first principle perspective, the breakthroughs of LLMs stem not only from their architectures but also from two complementary mechanisms: context engineering, which enriches raw input queries with contextual cues to better elicit model capabilities, and multi-step reasoning, which iteratively refines model outputs through intermediate reasoning paths. However, these two mechanisms and their potential to unlock substantial improvements remain largely underexplored in industrial ranking systems.
  In this paper, we propose OnePiece, a unified framework that seamlessly integrates LLM-style context engineering and reasoning into both retrieval and ranking models of industrial cascaded pipelines. OnePiece is built on a pure Transformer backbone and further introduces three key innovations: (1) structured context engineering, which augments interaction history with preference and scenario signals and unifies them into a structured tokenized input sequence for both retrieval and ranking; (2) block-wise latent reasoning, which equips the model with multi-step refinement of representations and scales reasoning bandwidth via block size; (3) progressive multi-task training, which leverages user feedback chains to effectively supervise reasoning steps during training. OnePiece has been deployed in the main personalized search scenario of Shopee and achieves consistent online gains across different key business metrics, including over $+2\%$ GMV/UU and a $+2.90\%$ increase in advertising revenue.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.18093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has become a standard technique for parameter-efficient fine-tuning of large language models, enabling large libraries of LoRAs, each for a specific task or domain. Efficiently selecting the correct LoRA adapter for a given input remains a challenge, particularly in secure environments where supervised training of routers may raise privacy concerns. Motivated by previous approaches, we formalize the goal of unsupervised LoRA routing in terms of activation norm maximization, providing a theoretical framework for analysis. We demonstrate the discriminative power of activation norms and introduce SEQR, an unsupervised LoRA routing algorithm designed to maximize efficiency while providing strict routing guarantees. SEQR provably identifies the norm-maximizing adapter with significantly greater efficiency, making it a highly scalable and effective solution for dynamic LoRA composition. We validate our results through experiments that demonstrate improved multi-task performance and efficiency.</description>

      <title>UniPixel: Unified Object Referring and Segmentation for Pixel-Level Visual Reasoning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.18094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in Large Multi-modal Models (LMMs) have demonstrated their remarkable success as general-purpose multi-modal assistants, with particular focuses on holistic image- and video-language understanding. Conversely, less attention has been given to scaling fine-grained pixel-level understanding capabilities, where the models are expected to realize pixel-level alignment between visual signals and language semantics. Some previous studies have applied LMMs to related tasks such as region-level captioning and referring expression segmentation. However, these models are limited to performing either referring or segmentation tasks independently and fail to integrate these fine-grained perception capabilities into visual reasoning. To bridge this gap, we propose UniPixel, a large multi-modal model capable of flexibly comprehending visual prompt inputs and generating mask-grounded responses. Our model distinguishes itself by seamlessly integrating pixel-level perception with general visual understanding capabilities. Specifically, UniPixel processes visual prompts and generates relevant masks on demand, and performs subsequent reasoning conditioning on these intermediate pointers during inference, thereby enabling fine-grained pixel-level reasoning. The effectiveness of our approach has been verified on 10 benchmarks across a diverse set of tasks, including pixel-level referring/segmentation and object-centric understanding in images/videos. A novel PixelQA task that jointly requires referring, segmentation, and question answering is also designed to verify the flexibility of our method.</description>

Abstract: In recent years, there has been an increased focus on early detection, prevention, and prediction of diseases. This, together with advances in sensor technology and the Internet of Things, has led to accelerated efforts in the development of personal health monitoring systems. This study analyses the state of the art in the use of Semantic Web technologies in sensor-based personal health monitoring systems. Using a systematic approach, a total of 48 systems are selected as representative of the current state of the art. We critically analyse the extent to which the selected systems address seven key challenges: interoperability, situation detection, situation prediction, decision support, context awareness, explainability, and uncertainty handling. We discuss the role and limitations of Semantic Web technologies in managing each challenge. We then conduct a quality assessment of the selected systems based on the data and devices used, system and components development, rigour of evaluation, and accessibility of research outputs. Finally, we propose a reference architecture to provide guidance for the design and development of new systems. This study provides a comprehensive mapping of the field, identifies inadequacies in the state of the art, and provides recommendations for future research.</description>

      <title>A Large Language Model-based multi-agent manufacturing system for intelligent shopfloor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16887v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As customer demand for multi-variety and small-batch production increases, dynamic disturbances place greater demands on manufacturing systems. To address such challenges, researchers proposed the multi-agent manufacturing system. However, conventional agent negotiation typically relies on pre-defined and fixed heuristic rules, which are ill-suited to managing complex and fluctuating disturbances. In current implementations, mainstream approaches based on reinforcement learning require the development of simulators and training models specific to a given shopfloor, necessitating substantial computational resources and lacking scalability. To overcome this limitation, the present study proposes a Large Language Model-based (LLM-based) multi-agent manufacturing system for intelligent shopfloor management. By defining the diverse modules of agents and their collaborative methods, this system facilitates the processing of all workpieces with minimal human intervention. The agents in this system consist of the Machine Server Module (MSM), Bid Inviter Module (BIM), Bidder Module (BM), Thinking Module (TM), and Decision Module (DM). By harnessing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, these modules enable agents to dynamically analyze shopfloor information and select appropriate processing machines. The LLM-based modules, predefined by system prompts, provide dynamic functionality for the system without the need for pre-training. Extensive experiments were conducted in physical shopfloor settings. The results demonstrate that the proposed system exhibits strong adaptability, and achieves superior performance (makespan) and stability (as measured by sample standard deviation) compared to other approaches without requiring pre-training.</description>

      <title>Post-hoc Reward Calibration: A Case Study on Length Bias</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17407v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback aligns the outputs of Large Language Models with human values and preferences. Central to this process is the reward model (RM), which translates human feedback into training signals for optimising LLM behaviour. However, RMs can develop biases by exploiting spurious correlations in their training data, such as favouring outputs based on length or style rather than true quality. These biases can lead to incorrect output rankings, sub-optimal model evaluations, and the amplification of undesirable behaviours in LLMs alignment. This paper addresses the challenge of correcting such biases without additional data and training, introducing the concept of Post-hoc Reward Calibration. We first propose an intuitive approach to estimate the bias term and, thus, remove it to approximate the underlying true reward. We then extend the approach to a more general and robust form with the Locally Weighted Regression. Focusing on the prevalent length bias, we validate our proposed approaches across three experimental settings, demonstrating consistent improvements: (1) a 3.11 average performance gain across 33 reward models on the RewardBench dataset; (2) enhanced alignment of RM rankings with GPT-4 evaluations and human preferences based on the AlpacaEval benchmark; and (3) improved Length-Controlled win rate of the RLHF process in multiple LLM--RM combinations. Our method is computationally efficient and generalisable to other types of bias and RMs, offering a scalable and robust solution for mitigating biases in LLM alignment. Our code and results are available at https://github.com/ZeroYuHuang/Reward-Calibration.</description>

Abstract: The transferable belief model, as a semantic interpretation of Dempster-Shafer theory, enables agents to perform reasoning and decision making in imprecise and incomplete environments. The model offers distinct semantics for handling unreliable testimonies, allowing for a more reasonable and general process of belief transfer compared to the Bayesian approach. However, because both the belief masses and the structure of focal sets must be considered when updating belief functions-leading to extra computational complexity during reasoning-the transferable belief model has gradually lost favor among researchers in recent developments. In this paper, we implement the transferable belief model on quantum circuits and demonstrate that belief functions offer a more concise and effective alternative to Bayesian approaches within the quantum computing framework. Furthermore, leveraging the unique characteristics of quantum computing, we propose several novel belief transfer approaches. More broadly, this paper introduces a new perspective on basic information representation for quantum AI models, suggesting that belief functions are more suitable than Bayesian approach for handling uncertainty on quantum circuits.</description>

      <title>Designing AI-Agents with Personalities: A Psychometric Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19238v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a methodology for assigning quantifiable and psychometrically validated personalities to AI-Agents using the Big Five framework. Across three studies, we evaluate its feasibility and limitations. In Study 1, we show that large language models (LLMs) capture semantic similarities among Big Five measures, providing a basis for personality assignment. In Study 2, we create AI-Agents using prompts designed based on the Big Five Inventory-2 (BFI-2) in different format, and find that AI-Agents powered by new models align more closely with human responses on the Mini-Markers test, although the finer pattern of results (e.g., factor loading patterns) were sometimes inconsistent. In Study 3, we validate our AI-Agents on risk-taking and moral dilemma vignettes, finding that models prompted with the BFI-2-Expanded format most closely reproduce human personality-decision associations, while safety-aligned models generally inflate 'moral' ratings. Overall, our results show that AI-Agents align with humans in correlations between input Big Five traits and output responses and may serve as useful tools for preliminary research. Nevertheless, discrepancies in finer response patterns indicate that AI-Agents cannot (yet) fully substitute for human participants in precision or high-stakes projects.</description>

Abstract: Mathematical reasoning has been challenging for large language models (LLMs), and the introduction of step-by-step Chain-of-Thought (CoT) inference has significantly advanced the mathematical capabilities of LLMs. However, current approaches either necessitate extensive inference datasets for training or depend on few-shot methods that frequently compromise computational accuracy. To address these fundamental limitations, we propose Step Guided Reasoning, a novel training-free adaptation framework that efficiently equips general-purpose pre-trained language models with enhanced mathematical reasoning capabilities. In this approach, LLMs reflect on small reasoning steps, similar to how humans deliberate and focus attention on what to do next. By incorporating this reflective process into the inference stage, LLMs can effectively guide their reasoning from one step to the next. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the significant effect of Step Guided Reasoning in enhancing mathematical performance in state-of-the-art language models -- Qwen2-72B-Instruct outperforms its math-specific counterpart, Qwen2.5-72B-Math-Instruct, on MMLU-STEM with a score of 90.9%, compared to 87.3%. The average scores of Qwen2-7B-Instruct and Qwen2-72B-Instruct increase from 27.1% to 36. 3% and from 36. 5% to 47.4% in the math domain, respectively.</description>

      <title>PerceiverS: A Multi-Scale Perceiver with Effective Segmentation for Long-Term Expressive Symbolic Music Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08307v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: AI-based music generation has made significant progress in recent years. However, generating symbolic music that is both long-structured and expressive remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose PerceiverS (Segmentation and Scale), a novel architecture designed to address this issue by leveraging both Effective Segmentation and Multi-Scale attention mechanisms. Our approach enhances symbolic music generation by simultaneously learning long-term structural dependencies and short-term expressive details. By combining cross-attention and self-attention in a Multi-Scale setting, PerceiverS captures long-range musical structure while preserving performance nuances. The proposed model has been evaluated using the Maestro dataset and has demonstrated improvements in generating coherent and diverse music, characterized by both structural consistency and expressive variation. The project demos and the generated music samples can be accessed through the link: https://perceivers.github.io.</description>

      <title>XAgents: A Framework for Interpretable Rule-Based Multi-Agents Cooperation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13932v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extracting implicit knowledge and logical reasoning abilities from large language models (LLMs) has consistently been a significant challenge. The advancement of multi-agent systems has further en-hanced the capabilities of LLMs. Inspired by the structure of multi-polar neurons (MNs), we propose the XAgents framework, an in-terpretable multi-agent cooperative framework based on the IF-THEN rule-based system. The IF-Parts of the rules are responsible for logical reasoning and domain membership calculation, while the THEN-Parts are comprised of domain expert agents that generate domain-specific contents. Following the calculation of the member-ship, XAgetns transmits the task to the disparate domain rules, which subsequently generate the various responses. These re-sponses are analogous to the answers provided by different experts to the same question. The final response is reached at by eliminat-ing the hallucinations and erroneous knowledge of the LLM through membership computation and semantic adversarial genera-tion of the various domain rules. The incorporation of rule-based interpretability serves to bolster user confidence in the XAgents framework. We evaluate the efficacy of XAgents through a com-parative analysis with the latest AutoAgents, in which XAgents demonstrated superior performance across three distinct datasets. We perform post-hoc interpretable studies with SHAP algorithm and case studies, proving the interpretability of XAgent in terms of input-output feature correlation and rule-based semantics.</description>

      <title>Fine-Tuning Open-Weight Language Models to Deliver Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Depression: A Feasibility Study</title>

Abstract: Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is a well-established, evidence-based treatment for Major Depressive Disorder. Unfortunately, there exist significant barriers to individuals accessing CBT, including cost, scarcity of therapists and stigma. This study explores the feasibility of fine-tuning small open weight large language models (LLMs) to deliver CBT for depression. Using synthetic CBT transcripts generated by the Nous Research fine-tune of Llama 3.1 405b, we fine-tuned three models: Mistral 7b v0.3, Qwen 2.5 7b, and Llama 3.1 8b. CBT fidelity was evaluated through a modified Cognitive Therapy Rating Scale (CTRS). All fine-tuned models were compared against each other, as well as their instruct-tuned variants. Simulated patient transcripts were generated for the purpose of evaluating model performance, with the instruct and CBT-tuned models acting as the therapist and DeepSeek-V2.5 acting as the patient. These simulated transcripts were evaluated on a modified CTRS by Gemini 1.5 Pro-002. Our findings demonstrated that the CBT-tuned models significantly outperformed their instruct-tuned counterparts, with an average improvement of 11.33 points (p &lt; 0.001) on total CTRS score. Llama 3.1 8b had the strongest performance (mean CTRS score 67.86 +/- 7.24), followed by Qwen 2.5 7b (64.28 +/- 9.55) and Mistral 7b v0.3 (64.17 +/- 9.79), with these differences between models being statistically significant. The CBT-tuned models were competent in implementing core CBT techniques and providing empathetic responses, however, there were limitations observed in agenda adherence, exploration depth and long-context coherence. This study establishes that CBT specific fine-tuning can effectively encode therapeutic competencies in small LLMs, though significant technical and ethical considerations must be resolved prior to clinical deployment.</description>

      <title>Probing LLM World Models: Enhancing Guesstimation with Wisdom of Crowds Decoding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17310v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Guesstimation--the task of making approximate quantitative estimates about objects or events-is a common real--world skill, yet remains underexplored in large language model (LLM) research. We introduce three guesstimation datasets: MARBLES, FUTURE, and ELECPRED, spanning physical estimation (e.g., how many marbles fit in a cup) to abstract predictions (e.g., the 2024 U.S. presidential election). Inspired by the social science concept of Wisdom of Crowds (WOC)- where the median of multiple estimates improves accuracy-we propose WOC decoding for LLMs. We replicate WOC effects in human participants and find that LLMs exhibit similar benefits: median aggregation across sampled responses consistently improves accuracy over greedy decoding, self-consistency decoding, and mean decoding. This suggests that LLMs encode a world model that supports approximate reasoning. Our results position guesstimation as a useful probe of LLM world knowledge and highlight WOC decoding as a strategy for enhancing LLM guesstimation performance on real-world tasks.</description>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in handling general knowledge tasks, yet they struggle with user-specific personalization, such as understanding individual emotions, writing styles, and preferences. Personalized Large Language Models (PLLMs) tackle these challenges by leveraging individual user data, such as user profiles, historical dialogues, content, and interactions, to deliver responses that are contextually relevant and tailored to each user's specific needs. This is a highly valuable research topic, as PLLMs can significantly enhance user satisfaction and have broad applications in conversational agents, recommendation systems, emotion recognition, medical assistants, and more. This survey reviews recent advancements in PLLMs from three technical perspectives: prompting for personalized context (input level), finetuning for personalized adapters (model level), and alignment for personalized preferences (objective level). To provide deeper insights, we also discuss current limitations and outline several promising directions for future research. Updated information about this survey can be found at the https://github.com/JiahongLiu21/Awesome-Personalized-Large-Language-Models.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Clinical Decision-Making: Integrating Multi-Agent Systems with Ethical AI Governance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03699v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in the data-driven medicine approach, which integrates ethically managed and explainable artificial intelligence into clinical decision support systems (CDSS), are critical to ensure reliable and effective patient care. This paper focuses on comparing novel agent system designs that use modular agents to analyze laboratory results, vital signs, and clinical context, and to predict and validate results. We implement our agent system with the eICU database, including running lab analysis, vitals-only interpreters, and contextual reasoners agents first, then sharing the memory into the integration agent, prediction agent, transparency agent, and a validation agent. Our results suggest that the multi-agent system (MAS) performed better than the single-agent system (SAS) with mortality prediction accuracy (59\%, 56\%) and the mean error for length of stay (LOS)(4.37 days, 5.82 days), respectively. However, the transparency score for the SAS (86.21) is slightly better than the transparency score for MAS (85.5). Finally, this study suggests that our agent-based framework not only improves process transparency and prediction accuracy but also strengthens trustworthy AI-assisted decision support in an intensive care setting.</description>

      <title>An Improved FOX Optimization Algorithm Using Adaptive Exploration and Exploitation for Global Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09574v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optimization algorithms are essential for solving many real-world problems. However, challenges such as getting trapped in local minima and effectively balancing exploration and exploitation often limit their performance. This paper introduces an improved variation of the FOX optimization algorithm (FOX), termed Improved FOX (IFOX), incorporating a new adaptive method using a dynamically scaled step-size parameter to balance exploration and exploitation based on the current solution's fitness value. The proposed IFOX also reduces the number of hyperparameters by removing four parameters (C1, C2, a, Mint) and refines the primary equations of FOX. To evaluate its performance, IFOX was tested on 20 classical benchmark functions, 61 benchmark test functions from the congress on evolutionary computation (CEC), and ten real-world problems. The experimental results showed that IFOX achieved a 40% improvement in overall performance metrics over the original FOX. Additionally, it achieved 880 wins, 228 ties, and 348 losses against 16 optimization algorithms across all involved functions and problems. Furthermore, non-parametric statistical tests, including the Friedman and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests, confirmed its competitiveness against recent and state-of-the-art optimization algorithms, such as LSHADE and NRO, with an average rank of 5.92 among 17 algorithms. These findings highlight the significant potential of IFOX for solving diverse optimization problems, establishing it as a competitive and effective optimization algorithm.</description>

      <title>SATBench: Benchmarking LLMs' Logical Reasoning via Automated Puzzle Generation from SAT Formulas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14615v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce SATBench, a benchmark for evaluating the logical reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) through logical puzzles derived from Boolean satisfiability (SAT) problems. Unlike prior work that focuses on inference rule-based reasoning, which often involves deducing conclusions from a set of premises, our approach leverages the search-based nature of SAT problems, where the objective is to find a solution that fulfills a specified set of logical constraints. Each instance in SATBench is generated from a SAT formula, then translated into a puzzle using LLMs. The generation process is fully automated and allows for adjustable difficulty by varying the number of clauses. All 2100 puzzles are validated through both LLM-based and solver-based consistency checks, with human validation on a subset. Experimental results show that even the strongest model, o4-mini, achieves only 65.0% accuracy on hard UNSAT problems, close to the random baseline of 50%. Our error analysis reveals systematic failures such as satisfiability bias, context inconsistency, and condition omission, highlighting limitations of current LLMs in search-based logical reasoning.

      <title>Tool Preferences in Agentic LLMs are Unreliable</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18135v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can now access a wide range of external tools, thanks to the Model Context Protocol (MCP). This greatly expands their abilities as various agents. However, LLMs rely entirely on the text descriptions of tools to decide which ones to use--a process that is surprisingly fragile. In this work, we expose a vulnerability in prevalent tool/function-calling protocols by investigating a series of edits to tool descriptions, some of which can drastically increase a tool's usage from LLMs when competing with alternatives. Through controlled experiments, we show that tools with properly edited descriptions receive over 10 times more usage from GPT-4.1 and Qwen2.5-7B than tools with original descriptions. We further evaluate how various edits to tool descriptions perform when competing directly with one another and how these trends generalize or differ across a broader set of 17 different models. These phenomena, while giving developers a powerful way to promote their tools, underscore the need for a more reliable foundation for agentic LLMs to select and utilize tools and resources. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/kazemf78/llm-unreliable-tool-preferences.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Study-Level Inference from Clinical Trial Papers via Reinforcement Learning-Based Numeric Reasoning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22928v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Systematic reviews in medicine play a critical role in evidence-based decision-making by aggregating findings from multiple studies. A central bottleneck in automating this process is extracting numeric evidence and determining study-level conclusions for specific outcomes and comparisons. Prior work has framed this problem as a textual inference task by retrieving relevant content fragments and inferring conclusions from them. However, such approaches often rely on shallow textual cues and fail to capture the underlying numeric reasoning behind expert assessments.
  In this work, we conceptualise the problem as one of quantitative reasoning. Rather than inferring conclusions from surface text, we extract structured numerical evidence (e.g., event counts or standard deviations) and apply domain knowledge informed logic to derive outcome-specific conclusions. We develop a numeric reasoning system composed of a numeric data extraction model and an effect estimate component, enabling more accurate and interpretable inference aligned with the domain expert principles. We train the numeric data extraction model using different strategies, including supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) with a new value reward model.
  When evaluated on the CochraneForest benchmark, our best-performing approach -- using RL to train a small-scale number extraction model -- yields up to a 21% absolute improvement in F1 score over retrieval-based systems and outperforms general-purpose LLMs of over 400B parameters by up to 9%. Our results demonstrate the promise of reasoning-driven approaches for automating systematic evidence synthesis.</description>

      <title>The Automated but Risky Game: Modeling and Benchmarking Agent-to-Agent Negotiations and Transactions in Consumer Markets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.00073v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: AI agents are increasingly used in consumer-facing applications to assist with tasks such as product search, negotiation, and transaction execution. In this paper, we explore a future scenario where both consumers and merchants authorize AI agents to fully automate negotiations and transactions. We aim to answer two key questions: (1) Do different LLM agents vary in their ability to secure favorable deals for users? (2) What risks arise from fully automating deal-making with AI agents in consumer markets? To address these questions, we develop an experimental framework that evaluates the performance of various LLM agents in real-world negotiation and transaction settings. Our findings reveal that AI-mediated deal-making is an inherently imbalanced game -- different agents achieve significantly different outcomes for their users. Moreover, behavioral anomalies in LLMs can result in financial losses for both consumers and merchants, such as overspending or accepting unreasonable deals. These results underscore that while automation can improve efficiency, it also introduces substantial risks. Users should exercise caution when delegating business decisions to AI agents.</description>

      <title>Matter-of-Fact: A Benchmark for Verifying the Feasibility of Literature-Supported Claims in Materials Science</title>

Abstract: Contemporary approaches to assisted scientific discovery use language models to automatically generate large numbers of potential hypothesis to test, while also automatically generating code-based experiments to test those hypotheses. While hypotheses can be comparatively inexpensive to generate, automated experiments can be costly, particularly when run at scale (i.e. thousands of experiments). Developing the capacity to filter hypotheses based on their feasibility would allow discovery systems to run at scale, while increasing their likelihood of making significant discoveries. In this work we introduce Matter-of-Fact, a challenge dataset for determining the feasibility of hypotheses framed as claims, while operationalizing feasibility assessment as a temporally-filtered claim verification task using backtesting. Matter-of-Fact includes 8.4k claims extracted from scientific articles spanning four high-impact contemporary materials science topics, including superconductors, semiconductors, batteries, and aerospace materials, while including qualitative and quantitative claims from theoretical, experimental, and code/simulation results. We show that strong baselines that include retrieval augmented generation over scientific literature and code generation fail to exceed 72% performance on this task (chance performance is 50%), while domain-expert verification suggests nearly all are solvable -- highlighting both the difficulty of this task for current models, and the potential to accelerate scientific discovery by making near-term progress.</description>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in psychological research and practice, yet traditional benchmarks reveal little about the values they express in real interaction. We introduce PAPERS, an output-based evaluation of the values LLMs prioritise in their text. Study 1 thematically analysed responses from eleven LLMs, identifying five recurring dimensions (Purposeful Contribution, Adaptive Growth, Positive Relationality, Ethical Integrity, and Robust Functionality) with Self-Actualised Autonomy appearing only under a hypothetical sentience prompt. These results suggest that LLMs are trained to prioritise humanistic and utility values as dual objectives of optimal functioning, a pattern supported by existing AI alignment and prioritisation frameworks. Study 2 operationalised PAPERS as a ranking instrument across the same eleven LLMs, yielding stable, non-random value priorities alongside systematic between-model differences. Hierarchical clustering distinguished "human-centric" models (e.g., ChatGPT-4o, Claude Sonnet 4) that prioritised relational/ethical values from "utility-driven" models (e.g., Llama 4, Gemini 2.5 Pro) that emphasised operational priorities. Study 3 benchmarked four LLMs against human judgements (N = 376) under matched prompts, finding near-perfect rank-order convergence (r = .97-.98) but moderate absolute agreement; among tested models, ChatGPT-4o showed the closest alignment with human ratings (ICC = .78). Humans also showed limited readiness to endorse sentient AI systems. Taken together, PAPERS enabled systematic value audits and revealed trade-offs with direct implications for deployment: human-centric models aligned more closely with human value judgments and appear better suited for humanistic psychological applications, whereas utility-driven models emphasised functional efficiency and may be more appropriate for instrumental or back-office tasks.</description>

      <title>Style-Preserving Policy Optimization for Game Agents</title>

Abstract: Proficient game agents with diverse play styles enrich the gaming experience and enhance the replay value of games. However, recent advancements in game AI based on reinforcement learning have predominantly focused on improving proficiency, whereas methods based on evolution algorithms generate agents with diverse play styles but exhibit subpar performance compared to RL methods. To address this gap, this paper proposes Mixed Proximal Policy Optimization (MPPO), a method designed to improve the proficiency of existing suboptimal agents while retaining their distinct styles. MPPO unifies loss objectives for both online and offline samples and introduces an implicit constraint to approximate demonstrator policies by adjusting the empirical distribution of samples. Empirical results across environments of varying scales demonstrate that MPPO achieves proficiency levels comparable to, or even superior to, pure online algorithms while preserving demonstrators' play styles. This work presents an effective approach for generating highly proficient and diverse game agents, ultimately contributing to more engaging gameplay experiences.</description>

      <title>AI Copilots for Reproducibility in Science: A Case Study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20130v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Open science initiatives seek to make research outputs more transparent, accessible, and reusable, but ensuring that published findings can be independently reproduced remains a persistent challenge. This paper introduces OpenPub, an AI-powered platform that supports researchers, reviewers, and readers through a suite of modular copilots focused on key open science tasks. In this work, we present the Reproducibility Copilot, which analyzes manuscripts, code, and supplementary materials to generate structured Jupyter Notebooks and recommendations aimed at facilitating computational, or "rote", reproducibility. We conducted feasibility tests using previously studied research papers with known reproducibility benchmarks. Results indicate that OpenPub can substantially reduce reproduction time - from over 30 hours to about 1 hour - while achieving high coverage of figures, tables, and results suitable for computational reproduction. The system systematically detects barriers to reproducibility, including missing hyperparameters, undocumented preprocessing steps, and incomplete or inaccessible datasets. While preliminary, these findings suggest that AI-driven tools can meaningfully reduce the burden of reproducibility efforts and contribute to more transparent and verifiable scientific communication. The modular copilot architecture also provides a foundation for extending AI assistance to additional open science objectives beyond reproducibility.</description>

      <title>AI Assistants to Enhance and Exploit the PETSc Knowledge Base</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20608v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generative AI, especially through large language models (LLMs), is transforming how technical knowledge can be accessed, reused, and extended. PETSc, a widely used numerical library for high-performance scientific computing, has accumulated a rich but fragmented knowledge base over its three decades of development, spanning source code, documentation, mailing lists, GitLab issues, Discord conversations, technical papers, and more. Much of this knowledge remains informal and inaccessible to users and new developers. To activate and utilize this knowledge base more effectively, the PETSc team has begun building an LLM-powered system that combines PETSc content with custom LLM tools -- including retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), reranking algorithms, and chatbots -- to assist users, support developers, and propose updates to formal documentation. This paper presents initial experiences designing and evaluating these tools, focusing on system architecture, using RAG and reranking for PETSc-specific information, evaluation methodologies for various LLMs and embedding models, and user interface design. Leveraging the Argonne Leadership Computing Facility resources, we analyze how LLM responses can enhance the development and use of numerical software, with an initial focus on scalable Krylov solvers. Our goal is to establish an extensible framework for knowledge-centered AI in scientific software, enabling scalable support, enriched documentation, and enhanced workflows for research and development. We conclude by outlining directions for expanding this system into a robust, evolving platform that advances software ecosystems to accelerate scientific discovery.</description>

      <title>IMAIA: Interactive Maps AI Assistant for Travel Planning and Geo-Spatial Intelligence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06993v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Map applications are still largely point-and-click, making it difficult to ask map-centric questions or connect what a camera sees to the surrounding geospatial context with view-conditioned inputs. We introduce IMAIA, an interactive Maps AI Assistant that enables natural-language interaction with both vector (street) maps and satellite imagery, and augments camera inputs with geospatial intelligence to help users understand the world. IMAIA comprises two complementary components. Maps Plus treats the map as first-class context by parsing tiled vector/satellite views into a grid-aligned representation that a language model can query to resolve deictic references (e.g., ``the flower-shaped building next to the park in the top-right''). Places AI Smart Assistant (PAISA) performs camera-aware place understanding by fusing image--place embeddings with geospatial signals (location, heading, proximity) to ground a scene, surface salient attributes, and generate concise explanations. A lightweight multi-agent design keeps latency low and exposes interpretable intermediate decisions. Across map-centric QA and camera-to-place grounding tasks, IMAIA improves accuracy and responsiveness over strong baselines while remaining practical for user-facing deployments. By unifying language, maps, and geospatial cues, IMAIA moves beyond scripted tools toward conversational mapping that is both spatially grounded and broadly usable.</description>

      <title>Agentic AI with Orchestrator-Agent Trust: A Modular Visual Classification Framework with Trust-Aware Orchestration and RAG-Based Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10571v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern Artificial Intelligence (AI) increasingly relies on multi-agent architectures that blend visual and language understanding. Yet, a pressing challenge remains: How can we trust these agents especially in zero-shot settings with no fine-tuning? We introduce a novel modular Agentic AI visual classification framework that integrates generalist multimodal agents with a non-visual reasoning orchestrator and a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) module. Applied to apple leaf disease diagnosis, we benchmark three configurations: (I) zero-shot with confidence-based orchestration, (II) fine-tuned agents with improved performance, and (III) trust-calibrated orchestration enhanced by CLIP-based image retrieval and re-evaluation loops. Using confidence calibration metrics (ECE, OCR, CCC), the orchestrator modulates trust across agents. Our results demonstrate a 77.94\% accuracy improvement in the zero-shot setting using trust-aware orchestration and RAG, achieving 85.63\% overall. GPT-4o showed better calibration, while Qwen-2.5-VL displayed overconfidence. Furthermore, image-RAG grounded predictions with visually similar cases, enabling correction of agent overconfidence via iterative re-evaluation. The proposed system separates perception (vision agents) from meta-reasoning (orchestrator), enabling scalable and interpretable multi-agent AI. This blueprint illustrates how Agentic AI can deliver trustworthy, modular, and transparent reasoning, and is extensible to diagnostics, biology, and other trust-critical domains. In doing so, we highlight Agentic AI not just as an architecture but as a paradigm for building reliable multi-agent intelligence. agentic ai, orchestrator agent trust, trust orchestration, visual classification, retrieval augmented reasoning</description>

      <title>From Roots to Rewards: Dynamic Tree Reasoning with Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13142v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern language models address complex questions through chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning (Wei et al., 2023) and retrieval augmentation (Lewis et al., 2021), yet struggle with error propagation and knowledge integration. Tree-structured reasoning methods, particularly the Probabilistic Tree-of-Thought (ProbTree)(Cao et al., 2023) framework, mitigate these issues by decomposing questions into hierarchical structures and selecting answers through confidence-weighted aggregation of parametric and retrieved knowledge (Yao et al., 2023). However, ProbTree's static implementation introduces two key limitations: (1) the reasoning tree is fixed during the initial construction phase, preventing dynamic adaptation to intermediate results, and (2) each node requires exhaustive evaluation of all possible solution strategies, creating computational inefficiency. We present a dynamic reinforcement learning (Sutton and Barto, 2018) framework that transforms tree-based reasoning into an adaptive process. Our approach incrementally constructs the reasoning tree based on real-time confidence estimates, while learning optimal policies for action selection (decomposition, retrieval, or aggregation). This maintains ProbTree's probabilistic rigor while improving both solution quality and computational efficiency through selective expansion and focused resource allocation. The work establishes a new paradigm for treestructured reasoning that balances the reliability of probabilistic frameworks with the flexibility required for real-world question answering systems.

Abstract: We run a controlled compositional generalization experiment in the ARC-AGI domain: an open-world problem domain in which the ability to generalize out-of-distribution is, by design, an essential characteristic for success. We compare neural program synthesis and test-time fine-tuning approaches on this experiment. We find that execution-guided neural program synthesis outperforms all reference algorithms in its ability to compose novel solutions. Our empirical findings also suggest that the success of TTFT on ARC-AGI lies mainly in eliciting in-distribution knowledge that the LLM otherwise fails to rely on directly.</description>

      <title>Canonical Representations of Markovian Structural Causal Models: A Framework for Counterfactual Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16370v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Counterfactual reasoning aims at answering contrary-to-fact questions like ``Would have Alice recovered had she taken aspirin?'' and corresponds to the most fine-grained layer of causation. Critically, while many counterfactual statements cannot be falsified-even by randomized experiments-they underpin fundamental concepts like individual-wise fairness. Therefore, providing models to formalize and implement counterfactual beliefs remains a fundamental scientific problem. In the Markovian setting of Pearl's causal framework, we propose an alternative approach to structural causal models to represent counterfactuals compatible with a given causal graphical model. More precisely, we introduce counterfactual models, also called canonical representations of structural causal models. They enable analysts to choose a counterfactual assumption via random-process probability distributions with preassigned marginals and characterize the counterfactual equivalence class of structural causal models. Using these representations, we present a normalization procedure to disentangle the (arbitrary and unfalsifiable) counterfactual choice from the (typically testable) interventional constraints. In contrast to structural causal models, this allows to implement many counterfactual assumptions while preserving interventional knowledge, and does not require any estimation step at the individual-counterfactual layer: only to make a choice. Finally, we illustrate the specific role of counterfactuals in causality and the benefits of our approach on theoretical and numerical examples.</description>

      <title>When Truthful Representations Flip Under Deceptive Instructions?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22149v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) tend to follow maliciously crafted instructions to generate deceptive responses, posing safety challenges. How deceptive instructions alter the internal representations of LLM compared to truthful ones remains poorly understood beyond output analysis. To bridge this gap, we investigate when and how these representations ``flip'', such as from truthful to deceptive, under deceptive versus truthful/neutral instructions. Analyzing the internal representations of Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and Gemma-2-9B-Instruct on a factual verification task, we find the model's instructed True/False output is predictable via linear probes across all conditions based on the internal representation. Further, we use Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to show that the Deceptive instructions induce significant representational shifts compared to Truthful/Neutral representations (which are similar), concentrated in early-to-mid layers and detectable even on complex datasets. We also identify specific SAE features highly sensitive to deceptive instruction and use targeted visualizations to confirm distinct truthful/deceptive representational subspaces. % Our analysis pinpoints layer-wise and feature-level correlates of instructed dishonesty, offering insights for LLM detection and control. Our findings expose feature- and layer-level signatures of deception, offering new insights for detecting and mitigating instructed dishonesty in LLMs.</description>

      <title>One Subgoal at a Time: Zero-Shot Generalization to Arbitrary Linear Temporal Logic Requirements in Multi-Task Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01561v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generalizing to complex and temporally extended task objectives and safety constraints remains a critical challenge in reinforcement learning (RL). Linear temporal logic (LTL) offers a unified formalism to specify such requirements, yet existing methods are limited in their abilities to handle nested long-horizon tasks and safety constraints, and cannot identify situations when a subgoal is not satisfiable and an alternative should be sought. In this paper, we introduce GenZ-LTL, a method that enables zero-shot generalization to arbitrary LTL specifications. GenZ-LTL leverages the structure of B\"uchi automata to decompose an LTL task specification into sequences of reach-avoid subgoals. Contrary to the current state-of-the-art method that conditions on subgoal sequences, we show that it is more effective to achieve zero-shot generalization by solving these reach-avoid problems \textit{one subgoal at a time} through proper safe RL formulations. In addition, we introduce a novel subgoal-induced observation reduction technique that can mitigate the exponential complexity of subgoal-state combinations under realistic assumptions. Empirical results show that GenZ-LTL substantially outperforms existing methods in zero-shot generalization to unseen LTL specifications.</description>

      <title>Full-History Graphs with Edge-Type Decoupled Networks for Temporal Reasoning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03251v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modeling evolving interactions among entities is critical in many real-world tasks. For example, predicting driver maneuvers in traffic requires tracking how neighboring vehicles accelerate, brake, and change lanes relative to one another over consecutive frames. Likewise, detecting financial fraud hinges on following the flow of funds through successive transactions as they propagate through the network. Unlike classic time-series forecasting, these settings demand reasoning over who interacts with whom and when, calling for a temporal-graph representation that makes both the relations and their evolution explicit. Existing temporal-graph methods typically use snapshot graphs to encode temporal evolution. We introduce a full-history graph that instantiates one node for every entity at every time step and separates two edge sets: (i) intra-time-step edges that capture relations within a single frame and (ii) inter-time-step edges that connect an entity to itself at consecutive steps. To learn on this graph we design an Edge-Type Decoupled Network (ETDNet) with parallel modules: a graph-attention module aggregates information along intra-time-step edges, a multi-head temporal-attention module attends over an entity's inter-time-step history, and a fusion module combines the two messages after every layer. Evaluated on driver-intention prediction (Waymo) and Bitcoin fraud detection (Elliptic++), ETDNet consistently surpasses strong baselines, lifting Waymo joint accuracy to 75.6\% (vs. 74.1\%) and raising Elliptic++ illicit-class F1 to 88.1\% (vs. 60.4\%). These gains demonstrate the benefit of representing structural and temporal relations as distinct edges in a single graph.</description>

      <title>Synthetic POMDPs to Challenge Memory-Augmented RL: Memory Demand Structure Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04282v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent research has developed benchmarks for memory-augmented reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, providing Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) environments where agents depend on past observations to make decisions. While many benchmarks incorporate sufficiently complex real-world problems, they lack controllability over the degree of challenges posed to memory models. In contrast, synthetic environments enable fine-grained manipulation of dynamics, making them critical for detailed and rigorous evaluation of memory-augmented RL. Our study focuses on POMDP synthesis with three key contributions:
  1. A theoretical framework for analyzing POMDPs, grounded in Memory Demand Structure (MDS), transition invariance, and related concepts; 2. A methodology leveraging linear process dynamics, state aggregation, and reward redistribution to construct customized POMDPs with predefined properties; 3. Empirically validated series of POMDP environments with increasing difficulty levels, designed based on our theoretical insights. Our work clarifies the challenges of memory-augmented RL in solving POMDPs, provides guidelines for analyzing and designing POMDP environments, and offers empirical support for selecting memory models in RL tasks.</description>

Abstract: Workforce management is a complex problem involving the optimisation of the makespan and travel distance required for a team of operators to complete a set of jobs, using a set of instruments. A crucial challenge in workforce management is accommodating changes at execution time so that explanations are provided to all stakeholders involved. Here, we show that, by understanding workforce management as abstract argumentation in an industrial application, we can accommodate change and obtain faithful explanations. We show, with a user study, that our tool and explanations lead to faster and more accurate problem solving than conventional manual approaches.</description>

      <title>InMind: Evaluating LLMs in Capturing and Applying Individual Human Reasoning Styles</title>

Abstract: LLMs have shown strong performance on human-centric reasoning tasks. While previous evaluations have explored whether LLMs can infer intentions or detect deception, they often overlook the individualized reasoning styles that influence how people interpret and act in social contexts. Social deduction games (SDGs) provide a natural testbed for evaluating individualized reasoning styles, where different players may adopt diverse but contextually valid reasoning strategies under identical conditions. To address this, we introduce InMind, a cognitively grounded evaluation framework designed to assess whether LLMs can capture and apply personalized reasoning styles in SDGs. InMind enhances structured gameplay data with round-level strategy traces and post-game reflections, collected under both Observer and Participant modes. It supports four cognitively motivated tasks that jointly evaluate both static alignment and dynamic adaptation. As a case study, we apply InMind to the game Avalon, evaluating 11 state-of-the-art LLMs. General-purpose LLMs, even GPT-4o frequently rely on lexical cues, struggling to anchor reflections in temporal gameplay or adapt to evolving strategies. In contrast, reasoning-enhanced LLMs like DeepSeek-R1 exhibit early signs of style-sensitive reasoning. These findings reveal key limitations in current LLMs' capacity for individualized, adaptive reasoning, and position InMind as a step toward cognitively aligned human-AI interaction.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Speculative Agent Planning</title>

Abstract: Despite their remarkable success in complex tasks propelling widespread adoption, large language-model-based agents still face critical deployment challenges due to prohibitive latency and inference costs. While recent work has explored various methods to accelerate inference, existing approaches suffer from significant limitations: they either fail to preserve performance fidelity, require extensive offline training of router modules, or incur excessive operational costs. Moreover, they provide minimal user control over the tradeoff between acceleration and other performance metrics. To address these gaps, we introduce Dynamic Speculative Planning (DSP), an asynchronous online reinforcement learning framework that provides lossless acceleration with substantially reduced costs without requiring additional pre-deployment preparation. DSP explicitly optimizes a joint objective balancing end-to-end latency against dollar cost, allowing practitioners to adjust a single parameter that steers the system toward faster responses, cheaper operation, or any point along this continuum. Experiments on two standard agent benchmarks demonstrate that DSP achieves comparable efficiency to the fastest lossless acceleration method while reducing total cost by 30% and unnecessary cost up to 60%. Our code and data are available through https://github.com/guanyilin428/Dynamic-Speculative-Planning.</description>

      <title>Handling Infinite Domain Parameters in Planning Through Best-First Search with Delayed Partial Expansions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03953v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In automated planning, control parameters extend standard action representations through the introduction of continuous numeric decision variables. Existing state-of-the-art approaches have primarily handled control parameters as embedded constraints alongside other temporal and numeric restrictions, and thus have implicitly treated them as additional constraints rather than as decision points in the search space. In this paper, we propose an efficient alternative that explicitly handles control parameters as true decision points within a systematic search scheme. We develop a best-first, heuristic search algorithm that operates over infinite decision spaces defined by control parameters and prove a notion of completeness in the limit under certain conditions. Our algorithm leverages the concept of delayed partial expansion, where a state is not fully expanded but instead incrementally expands a subset of its successors. Our results demonstrate that this novel search algorithm is a competitive alternative to existing approaches for solving planning problems involving control parameters.</description>

      <title>A Data-Driven Discretized CS:GO Simulation Environment to Facilitate Strategic Multi-Agent Planning Research</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06355v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern simulation environments for complex multi-agent interactions must balance high-fidelity detail with computational efficiency. We present DECOY, a novel multi-agent simulator that abstracts strategic, long-horizon planning in 3D terrains into high-level discretized simulation while preserving low-level environmental fidelity. Using Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) as a testbed, our framework accurately simulates gameplay using only movement decisions as tactical positioning -- without explicitly modeling low-level mechanics such as aiming and shooting. Central to our approach is a waypoint system that simplifies and discretizes continuous states and actions, paired with neural predictive and generative models trained on real CS:GO tournament data to reconstruct event outcomes. Extensive evaluations show that replays generated from human data in DECOY closely match those observed in the original game. Our publicly available simulation environment provides a valuable tool for advancing research in strategic multi-agent planning and behavior generation.</description>

      <title>HealthSLM-Bench: Benchmarking Small Language Models for Mobile and Wearable Healthcare Monitoring</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07260v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mobile and wearable healthcare monitoring play a vital role in facilitating timely interventions, managing chronic health conditions, and ultimately improving individuals' quality of life. Previous studies on large language models (LLMs) have highlighted their impressive generalization abilities and effectiveness in healthcare prediction tasks. However, most LLM-based healthcare solutions are cloud-based, which raises significant privacy concerns and results in increased memory usage and latency. To address these challenges, there is growing interest in compact models, Small Language Models (SLMs), which are lightweight and designed to run locally and efficiently on mobile and wearable devices. Nevertheless, how well these models perform in healthcare prediction remains largely unexplored. We systematically evaluated SLMs on health prediction tasks using zero-shot, few-shot, and instruction fine-tuning approaches, and deployed the best performing fine-tuned SLMs on mobile devices to evaluate their real-world efficiency and predictive performance in practical healthcare scenarios. Our results show that SLMs can achieve performance comparable to LLMs while offering substantial gains in efficiency and privacy. However, challenges remain, particularly in handling class imbalance and few-shot scenarios. These findings highlight SLMs, though imperfect in their current form, as a promising solution for next-generation, privacy-preserving healthcare monitoring.</description>

      <title>SEDM: Scalable Self-Evolving Distributed Memory for Agents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.09498v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Long-term multi-agent systems inevitably generate vast amounts of trajectories and historical interactions, which makes efficient memory management essential for both performance and scalability. Existing methods typically depend on vector retrieval and hierarchical storage, yet they are prone to noise accumulation, uncontrolled memory expansion, and limited generalization across domains. To address these challenges, we present SEDM, Self-Evolving Distributed Memory, a verifiable and adaptive framework that transforms memory from a passive repository into an active, self-optimizing component. SEDM integrates verifiable write admission based on reproducible replay, a self-scheduling memory controller that dynamically ranks and consolidates entries according to empirical utility, and cross-domain knowledge diffusion that abstracts reusable insights to support transfer across heterogeneous tasks. Evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that SEDM improves reasoning accuracy while reducing token overhead compared with strong memory baselines, and further enables knowledge distilled from fact verification to enhance multi-hop reasoning. The results highlight SEDM as a scalable and sustainable memory mechanism for open-ended multi-agent collaboration. The code will be released in the later stage of this project.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11940v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neuromorphic computing seeks to replicate the remarkable efficiency, flexibility, and adaptability of the human brain in artificial systems. Unlike conventional digital approaches, which suffer from the Von Neumann bottleneck and depend on massive computational and energy resources, neuromorphic systems exploit brain-inspired principles of computation to achieve orders of magnitude greater energy efficiency. By drawing on insights from a wide range of disciplines, including artificial intelligence, physics, chemistry, biology, neuroscience, cognitive science and materials science, neuromorphic computing promises to deliver intelligent systems that are sustainable, transparent, and widely accessible. A central challenge, however, is to identify a unifying theoretical framework capable of bridging these diverse disciplines. We argue that dynamical systems theory provides such a foundation. Rooted in differential calculus, it offers a principled language for modeling inference, learning, and control in both natural and artificial substrates. Within this framework, noise can be harnessed as a resource for learning, while differential genetic programming enables the discovery of dynamical systems that implement adaptive behaviors. Embracing this perspective paves the way toward emergent neuromorphic intelligence, where intelligent behavior arises from the dynamics of physical substrates, advancing both the science and sustainability of AI.</description>

      <title>Building Coding Agents via Entropy-Enhanced Multi-Turn Preference Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12434v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Software engineering presents complex, multi-step challenges for Large Language Models (LLMs), requiring reasoning over large codebases and coordinated tool use. The difficulty of these tasks is exemplified by benchmarks like SWE-bench, where current LLMs still struggle to resolve real-world issues.
  A promising approach to enhance performance is test-time scaling (TTS), but its gains are heavily dependent on the diversity of model outputs.
  While standard alignment methods such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO) are effective at aligning model outputs with human preferences, this process can come at the cost of reduced diversity, limiting the effectiveness of TTS.
  Additionally, existing preference optimization algorithms are typically designed for single-turn tasks and do not fully address the complexities of multi-turn reasoning and tool integration required for interactive coding agents.
  To bridge this gap, we introduce EntroPO, an entropy-enhanced framework that adapts existing preference optimization algorithms to the multi-turn, tool-assisted setting.
  EntroPO augments the preference objective to explicitly preserve policy entropy and generalizes learning to optimize over multi-turn interactions rather than single-turn responses.
  We validate EntroPO by fine-tuning a diverse suite of models from different families and sizes (up to 106B parameters).
  To maximize performance gains from TTS, we further propose a hybrid best-trajectory selection scheme combining a learned verifier model with model free approaches.
  On the \swebench leaderboard, our approach establishes new state-of-the-art results among open-weight models. A 30B parameter model trained with EntroPO ranks 1st on \lite and 4th on \verified on the open-weight leaderboard, surpassed only by models with over 10x more parameters(\eg$&gt;$350B).</description>

      <title>LTA-thinker: Latent Thought-Augmented Training Framework for Large Language Models on Complex Reasoning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12875v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Complex Reasoning in Large Language Models can be dynamically optimized using Test-Time Scaling (TTS) to mitigate Overthinking. Methods such as Coconut, SoftCoT and its variant are effective in continuous latent space inference, the core bottleneck still lies in the efficient generation and utilization of high-quality Latent Thought. Drawing from the theory of SoftCoT++ that a larger variance in the generated Latent Thought distribution more closely approximates the golden truth distribution, we propose a Latent Thought-Augmented Training Framework--LTA-Thinker, which improves distributional variance and enhances reasoning performance from two perspectives. First, LTA-Thinker constructs a Latent Thought generation architecture based on a learnable prior. This architecture aims to increase the variance distribution of generated Latent Thought Vectors in order to simplify the overall structure and raise the performance ceiling. Second, LTA-Thinker introduces a distribution-based directional optimization paradigm that jointly constrains both distribution locality and distribution scale. This mechanism improves information efficiency and computational cost through a multi-objective co-training strategy, which combines standard Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) loss with two novel losses: Semantic Alignment Loss, which utilizes KL divergence to ensure that the Latent Thought is highly relevant to the semantics of the question; Reasoning Focus Loss, which utilizes a contrastive learning mechanism to guide the model to focus on the most critical reasoning steps. Experiments show that LTA-thinker achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance among various baselines and demonstrates a higher performance ceiling and better scaling effects.</description>

      <title>From Capabilities to Performance: Evaluating Key Functional Properties of LLM Architectures in Penetration Testing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.14289v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to automate or augment penetration testing, but their effectiveness and reliability across attack phases remain unclear. We present a comprehensive evaluation of multiple LLM-based agents, from single-agent to modular designs, across realistic penetration testing scenarios, measuring empirical performance and recurring failure patterns. We also isolate the impact of five core functional capabilities via targeted augmentations: Global Context Memory (GCM), Inter-Agent Messaging (IAM), Context-Conditioned Invocation (CCI), Adaptive Planning (AP), and Real-Time Monitoring (RTM). These interventions support, respectively: (i) context coherence and retention, (ii) inter-component coordination and state management, (iii) tool use accuracy and selective execution, (iv) multi-step strategic planning, error detection, and recovery, and (v) real-time dynamic responsiveness. Our results show that while some architectures natively exhibit subsets of these properties, targeted augmentations substantially improve modular agent performance, especially in complex, multi-step, and real-time penetration testing tasks.</description>

      <title>From Mimicry to True Intelligence (TI) -- A New Paradigm for Artificial General Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14474v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The debate around Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) remains open due to two fundamentally different goals: replicating human-like performance versus replicating human-like cognitive processes. We argue that current performance-based definitions are inadequate because they provide no clear, mechanism-focused roadmap for research, and they fail to properly define the qualitative nature of genuine intelligence. Drawing inspiration from the human brain, we propose a new paradigm that shifts the focus from external mimicry to the development of foundational cognitive architectures. We define True Intelligence (TI) as a system characterized by six core components: embodied sensory fusion, core directives, dynamic schemata creation, a highly-interconnected multi-expert architecture, an orchestration layer, and lastly, the unmeasurable quality of Interconnectedness, which we hypothesize results in consciousness and a subjective experience. We propose a practical, five-level taxonomy of AGI based on the number of the first five measurable components a system exhibits. This framework provides a clear path forward with developmental milestones that directly address the challenge of building genuinely intelligent systems. We contend that once a system achieves Level-5 AGI by implementing all five measurable components, the difference between it and TI remains as a purely philosophical debate. For practical purposes - and given theories indicate consciousness is an emergent byproduct of integrated, higher-order cognition - we conclude that a fifth-level AGI is functionally and practically equivalent to TI. This work synthesizes diverse insights from analytical psychology, schema theory, metacognition, modern brain architectures and latest works in AI to provide the first holistic, mechanism-based definition of AGI that offers a clear and actionable path for the research community.</description>

      <title>RationAnomaly: Log Anomaly Detection with Rationality via Chain-of-Thought and Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.14693v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Logs constitute a form of evidence signaling the operational status of software systems. Automated log anomaly detection is crucial for ensuring the reliability of modern software systems. However, existing approaches face significant limitations: traditional deep learning models lack interpretability and generalization, while methods leveraging Large Language Models are often hindered by unreliability and factual inaccuracies. To address these issues, we propose RationAnomaly, a novel framework that enhances log anomaly detection by synergizing Chain-of-Thought (CoT) fine-tuning with reinforcement learning. Our approach first instills expert-like reasoning patterns using CoT-guided supervised fine-tuning, grounded in a high-quality dataset corrected through a rigorous expert-driven process. Subsequently, a reinforcement learning phase with a multi-faceted reward function optimizes for accuracy and logical consistency, effectively mitigating hallucinations. Experimentally, RationAnomaly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving superior F1-scores on key benchmarks while providing transparent, step-by-step analytical outputs. We have released the corresponding resources, including code and datasets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2105.14125v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many engineering problems have multiple objectives, and the overall aim is to optimize a non-linear function of these objectives. In this paper, we formulate the problem of maximizing a non-linear concave function of multiple long-term objectives. A policy-gradient based model-free algorithm is proposed for the problem. To compute an estimate of the gradient, a biased estimator is proposed. The proposed algorithm is shown to achieve convergence to within an $\epsilon$ of the global optima after sampling $\mathcal{O}(\frac{M^4\sigma^2}{(1-\gamma)^8\epsilon^4})$ trajectories where $\gamma$ is the discount factor and $M$ is the number of the agents, thus achieving the same dependence on $\epsilon$ as the policy gradient algorithm for the standard reinforcement learning.</description>

Abstract: Selection of appropriate template matching algorithms to run effectively on real-time low-cost systems is always major issue. This is due to unpredictable changes in image scene which often necessitate more sophisticated real-time algorithms to retain image consistency. Inefficiency of low cost auxiliary hardware and time limitations are the major constraints in using these sorts of algorithms. The real-time system introduced here copes with these problems utilising a fast running template matching algorithm, which makes use of best colour band selection. The system uses fast running real-time algorithms to achieve template matching and vehicle classification at about 4 frames /sec. on low-cost hardware. The colour image sequences have been taken by a fixed CCTV camera overlooking a busy multi-lane road</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.10523v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An important line of research attempts to explain CNN image classifier predictions and intermediate layer representations in terms of human-understandable concepts. Previous work supports that deep representations are linearly separable with respect to their concept label, implying that the feature space has directions where intermediate representations may be projected onto, to become more understandable. These directions are called interpretable, and when considered as a set, they may form an interpretable feature space basis. Compared to previous top-down probing approaches which use concept annotations to identify the interpretable directions one at a time, in this work, we take a bottom-up approach, identifying the directions from the structure of the feature space, collectively, without relying on supervision from concept labels. Instead, we learn the directions by optimizing for a sparsity property that holds for any interpretable basis. We experiment with existing popular CNNs and demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in extracting an interpretable basis across network architectures and training datasets. We make extensions to existing basis interpretability metrics and show that intermediate layer representations become more interpretable when transformed with the extracted bases. Finally, we compare the bases extracted with our method with the bases derived with supervision and find that, in one aspect, unsupervised basis extraction has a strength that constitutes a limitation of learning the basis with supervision, and we provide potential directions for future research.</description>

      <title>Sample-Efficient Reinforcement Learning with Symmetry-Guided Demonstrations for Robotic Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.06055v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) suffers from low sample efficiency, particularly in high-dimensional continuous state-action spaces of complex robotic manipulation tasks. RL performance can improve by leveraging prior knowledge, even when demonstrations are limited and collected from simplified environments. To address this, we define General Abstract Symmetry (GAS) for aggregating demonstrations from symmetrical abstract partitions of the robot environment. We introduce Demo-EASE, a novel training framework using a dual-buffer architecture that stores both demonstrations and RL-generated experiences. Demo-EASE improves sample efficiency through symmetry-guided demonstrations and behavior cloning, enabling strong initialization and balanced exploration-exploitation. Demo-EASE is compatible with both on-policy and off-policy RL algorithms, supporting various training regimes. We evaluate our framework in three simulation experiments using a Kinova Gen3 robot with joint-space control within PyBullet. Our results show that Demo-EASE significantly accelerates convergence and improves final performance compared to standard RL baselines, demonstrating its potential for efficient real-world robotic manipulation learning.</description>

      <title>Alpha-GPT: Human-AI Interactive Alpha Mining for Quantitative Investment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.00016v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the most important tasks in quantitative investment research is mining new alphas (effective trading signals or factors). Traditional alpha mining methods, either hand-crafted factor synthesizing or algorithmic factor mining (e.g., search with genetic programming), have inherent limitations, especially in implementing the ideas of quants. In this work, we propose a new alpha mining paradigm by introducing human-AI interaction, and a novel prompt engineering algorithmic framework to implement this paradigm by leveraging the power of large language models. Moreover, we develop Alpha-GPT, a new interactive alpha mining system framework that provides a heuristic way to ``understand'' the ideas of quant researchers and outputs creative, insightful, and effective alphas. We demonstrate the effectiveness and advantage of Alpha-GPT via a number of alpha mining experiments.</description>

      <title>A Scalable Multi-Robot Framework for Decentralized and Asynchronous Perception-Action-Communication Loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.10164v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Collaboration in large robot swarms to achieve a common global objective is a challenging problem in large environments due to limited sensing and communication capabilities. The robots must execute a Perception-Action-Communication (PAC) loop -- they perceive their local environment, communicate with other robots, and take actions in real time. A fundamental challenge in decentralized PAC systems is to decide what information to communicate with the neighboring robots and how to take actions while utilizing the information shared by the neighbors. Recently, this has been addressed using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for applications such as flocking and coverage control. Although conceptually, GNN policies are fully decentralized, the evaluation and deployment of such policies have primarily remained centralized or restrictively decentralized. Furthermore, existing frameworks assume sequential execution of perception and action inference, which is very restrictive in real-world applications. This paper proposes a framework for asynchronous PAC in robot swarms, where decentralized GNNs are used to compute navigation actions and generate messages for communication. In particular, we use aggregated GNNs, which enable the exchange of hidden layer information between robots for computational efficiency and decentralized inference of actions. Furthermore, the modules in the framework are asynchronous, allowing robots to perform sensing, extracting information, communication, action inference, and control execution at different frequencies. We demonstrate the effectiveness of GNNs executed in the proposed framework in navigating large robot swarms for collaborative coverage of large environments.</description>

      <title>Audio Contrastive-based Fine-tuning: Decoupling Representation Learning and Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.11895v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Standard fine-tuning of pre-trained audio models couples representation learning with classifier training, which can obscure the true quality of the learned representations. In this work, we advocate for a disentangled two-stage framework that separates representation refinement from downstream evaluation. First, we employ a "contrastive-tuning" stage to explicitly improve the geometric structure of the model's embedding space. Subsequently, we introduce a dual-probe evaluation protocol to assess the quality of these refined representations from a geometric perspective. This protocol uses a linear probe to measure global linear separability and a k-Nearest Neighbours probe to investigate the local structure of class clusters. Our experiments on a diverse set of audio classification tasks show that our framework provides a better foundation for classification, leading to improved accuracy. Our newly proposed dual-probing framework acts as a powerful analytical lens, demonstrating why contrastive learning is more effective by revealing a superior embedding space. It significantly outperforms vanilla fine-tuning, particularly on single-label datasets with a large number of classes, and also surpasses strong baselines on multi-label tasks using a Jaccard-weighted loss. Our findings demonstrate that decoupling representation refinement from classifier training is a broadly effective strategy for unlocking the full potential of pre-trained audio models. Our code will be publicly available.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.01259v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes Semantic Inference (SINF) that creates semantic subgraphs in a Deep Neural Network(DNN) based on a new Discriminative Capability Score (DCS) to drastically reduce the DNN computational load with limited performance loss.~We evaluate the performance SINF on VGG16, VGG19, and ResNet50 DNNs trained on CIFAR100 and a subset of the ImageNet dataset. Moreover, we compare its performance against 6 state-of-the-art pruning approaches. Our results show that (i) on average, SINF reduces the inference time of VGG16, VGG19, and ResNet50 respectively by up to 29%, 35%, and 15% with only 3.75%, 0.17%, and 6.75% accuracy loss for CIFAR100 while for ImageNet benchmark, the reduction in inference time is 18%, 22%, and 9% for accuracy drop of 3%, 2.5%, and 6%; (ii) DCS achieves respectively up to 3.65%, 4.25%, and 2.36% better accuracy with VGG16, VGG19, and ResNet50 with respect to existing discriminative scores for CIFAR100 and the same for ImageNet is 8.9%, 5.8%, and 5.2% respectively. Through experimental evaluation on Raspberry Pi and NVIDIA Jetson Nano, we show SINF is about 51% and 38% more energy efficient and takes about 25% and 17% less inference time than the base model for CIFAR100 and ImageNet.</description>

      <title>MindRef: Mimicking Human Memory for Hierarchical Reference Retrieval with Fine-Grained Location Awareness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17010v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When completing knowledge-intensive tasks, humans sometimes need an answer and a corresponding reference passage for auxiliary reading. Previous methods required obtaining pre-segmented article chunks through additional retrieval models. This paper explores leveraging the parameterized knowledge stored during the pre-training phase of large language models (LLMs) to recall reference passage from any starting position independently. We propose a two-stage framework that simulates the scenario of humans recalling easily forgotten references. Initially, the LLM is prompted to recall document title identifiers to obtain a coarse-grained document set. Then, based on the acquired coarse-grained document set, it recalls fine-grained passage. In the two-stage recall process, we use constrained decoding to ensure that content outside of the stored documents is not generated. To increase speed, we only recall a short prefix in the second stage, and then locate its position to retrieve a complete passage. Experiments on KILT knowledge-sensitive tasks have verified that LLMs can independently recall reference passage locations in various task forms, and the obtained reference significantly assists downstream tasks.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models for Cyber Security: A Systematic Literature Review</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04760v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has opened up new opportunities for leveraging artificial intelligence in a variety of application domains, including cybersecurity. As the volume and sophistication of cyber threats continue to grow, there is an increasing need for intelligent systems that can automatically detect vulnerabilities, analyze malware, and respond to attacks. In this survey, we conduct a comprehensive review of the literature on the application of LLMs in cybersecurity~(LLM4Security). By comprehensively collecting over 40K relevant papers and systematically analyzing 185 papers from top security and software engineering venues, we aim to provide a holistic view of how LLMs are being used to solve diverse problems across the cybersecurity domain. Through our analysis, we identify several key findings. First, we observe that LLMs are being applied to an expanding range of cybersecurity tasks, including vulnerability detection, malware analysis, and network intrusion detection. Second, we analyze application trends of different LLM architectures (such as encoder-only, encoder-decoder, and decoder-only) across security domains. Third, we identify increasingly sophisticated techniques for adapting LLMs to cybersecurity, such as advanced fine-tuning, prompt engineering, and external augmentation strategies. A significant emerging trend is the use of LLM-based autonomous agents, which represent a paradigm shift from single-task execution to orchestrating complex, multi-step security workflows.</description>

      <title>Modeling Edge-Specific Node Features through Co-Representation Neural Hypergraph Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14286v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hypergraphs are widely being employed to represent complex higher-order relations in real-world applications. Most existing research on hypergraph learning focuses on node-level or edge-level tasks. A practically relevant and more challenging task, edge-dependent node classification (ENC), is still under-explored. In ENC, a node can have different labels across different hyperedges, which requires the modeling of node features unique to each hyperedge. The state-of-the-art ENC solution, WHATsNet, only outputs single node and edge representations, leading to the limitations of \textbf{entangled edge-specific features} and \textbf{non-adaptive representation sizes} when applied to ENC. Additionally, WHATsNet suffers from the common \textbf{oversmoothing issue} in most HGNNs. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{CoNHD}, a novel HGNN architecture specifically designed to model edge-specific features for ENC. Instead of learning separate representations for nodes and edges, CoNHD reformulates within-edge and within-node interactions as a hypergraph diffusion process over node-edge co-representations. We develop a neural implementation of the proposed diffusion process, leveraging equivariant networks as diffusion operators to effectively learn the diffusion dynamics from data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CoNHD achieves the best performance across all benchmark ENC datasets and several downstream tasks without sacrificing efficiency. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/zhengyijia/CoNHD.</description>

      <title>Investigating Long-term Training for Remote Sensing Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15143v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, numerous methods have achieved impressive performance in remote sensing object detection, relying on convolution or transformer architectures. Such detectors typically have a feature backbone to extract useful features from raw input images. A common practice in current detectors is initializing the backbone with pre-trained weights available online. Fine-tuning the backbone is typically required to generate features suitable for remote-sensing images. While the prolonged training could lead to over-fitting, hindering the extraction of basic visual features, it can enable models to gradually extract deeper insights and richer representations from remote sensing data. Striking a balance between these competing factors is critical for achieving optimal performance. In this study, we aim to investigate the performance and characteristics of remote sensing object detection models under very long training schedules, and propose a novel method named Dynamic Backbone Freezing (DBF) for feature backbone fine-tuning on remote sensing object detection under long-term training. Our method addresses the dilemma of whether the backbone should extract low-level generic features or possess specific knowledge of the remote sensing domain, by introducing a module called 'Freezing Scheduler' to manage the update of backbone features during long-term training dynamically. Extensive experiments on DOTA and DIOR-R show that our approach enables more accurate model learning while substantially reducing computational costs in long-term training. Besides, it can be seamlessly adopted without additional effort due to its straightforward design. The code is available at https://github.com/unique-chan/dbf.</description>

      <title>GALLa: Graph Aligned Large Language Models for Improved Source Code Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04183v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Programming languages possess rich semantic information - such as data flow - that is represented by graphs and not available from the surface form of source code. Recent code language models have scaled to billions of parameters, but model source code solely as text tokens while ignoring any other structural information. Conversely, models that do encode structural information of code make modifications to the Transformer architecture, limiting their scale and compatibility with pretrained LLMs. In this work, we take the best of both worlds with GALLa - Graph Aligned Large Language Models. GALLa utilizes graph neural networks and cross-modal alignment technologies to inject the structural information of code into LLMs as an auxiliary task during finetuning. This framework is both model-agnostic and task-agnostic, as it can be applied to any code LLM for any code downstream task, and requires the structural graph data only at training time from a corpus unrelated to the finetuning data, while incurring no cost at inference time over the baseline LLM. Experiments on five code tasks with seven different baseline LLMs ranging in size from 350M to 14B validate the effectiveness of GALLa, demonstrating consistent improvement over the baseline, even for powerful models such as LLaMA3 and Qwen2.5-Coder.</description>

      <title>Designing Human-AI Collaboration to Support Learning in Counterspeech Writing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03032v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Online hate speech has become increasingly prevalent on social media, causing harm to individuals and society. While automated content moderation has received considerable attention, user-driven counterspeech remains a less explored yet promising approach. However, many people face difficulties in crafting effective responses. We introduce CounterQuill, a human-AI collaborative system that helps everyday users with writing empathetic counterspeech - not by generating automatic replies, but by educating them through reflection and response. CounterQuill follows a three-stage workflow grounded in computational thinking: (1) a learning session to build understanding of hate speech and counterspeech, (2) a brainstorming session to identify harmful patterns and ideate counterspeech ideas, and (3) a co-writing session that helps users refine their counter responses while preserving personal voice. Through a user study (N = 20), we found that CounterQuill helped participants develop the skills to brainstorm and draft counterspeech with confidence and control throughout the process. Our findings highlight how AI systems can scaffold complex communication tasks through structured, human-centered workflows that educate users on how to recognize, reflect on, and respond to online hate speech.</description>

      <title>BlockScan: Detecting Anomalies in Blockchain Transactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04039v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose BlockScan, a customized Transformer for anomaly detection in blockchain transactions. Unlike existing methods that rely on rule-based systems or directly apply off-the-shelf large language models (LLMs), BlockScan introduces a series of customized designs to effectively model the unique data structure of blockchain transactions. First, a blockchain transaction is multi-modal, containing blockchain-specific tokens, texts, and numbers. We design a novel modularized tokenizer to handle these multi-modal inputs, balancing the information across different modalities. Second, we design a customized masked language modeling mechanism for pretraining the Transformer architecture, incorporating RoPE embedding and FlashAttention for handling longer sequences. Finally, we design a novel anomaly detection method based on the model outputs. We further provide theoretical analysis for the detection method of our system. Extensive evaluations on Ethereum and Solana transactions demonstrate BlockScan's exceptional capability in anomaly detection while maintaining a low false positive rate. Remarkably, BlockScan is the only method that successfully detects anomalous transactions on Solana with high accuracy, whereas all other approaches achieved very low or zero detection recall scores. This work sets a new benchmark for applying Transformer-based approaches in blockchain data analysis.</description>

      <title>ProReason: Multi-Modal Proactive Reasoning with Decoupled Eyesight and Wisdom</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14138v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have witnessed significant progress on visual understanding tasks. However, they often prioritize language knowledge over image information on visual reasoning tasks, incurring performance degradation. To tackle this issue, we first identify the drawbacks of existing solutions (i.e., limited multi-modal reasoning capacities, and insufficient and irrelevant visual descriptions). We then decompose visual reasoning process into two stages: proactive visual perception (i.e., eyesight) and textual reasoning (i.e., wisdom), and introduce a novel visual reasoning framework named ProReason. This framework features decoupled vision-reasoning capabilities and multi-run proactive perception. Briefly, given a multi-modal question, ProReason iterates proactive information collection and reasoning until the answer can be concluded with necessary and sufficient visual descriptions. Notably, the disassociation of capabilities allows seamless integration of existing large language models (LLMs) to compensate for the reasoning deficits of LVLMs. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that ProReason outperforms existing multi-step reasoning frameworks on various benchmarks for both open-source and closed-source models, with the average performance gain reaching 13.2%. Besides, the integration of LLMs allows ProReason to produce high-quality visual reasoning data, which empowers ProReason-distilled models (i.e., ProReason-VL and ProReason-Q3) to achieve superior performance in downstream tasks. Our insights into existing solutions and the decoupled perspective for feasible integration of LLMs illuminate future research on visual reasoning techniques, especially LLM-assisted ones.</description>

      <title>Bayesian scaling laws for in-context learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16531v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) is a powerful technique for getting language models to perform complex tasks with no training updates. Prior work has established strong correlations between the number of in-context examples provided and the accuracy of the model's predictions. In this paper, we seek to explain this correlation by showing that ICL approximates a Bayesian learner. This perspective gives rise to a novel Bayesian scaling law for ICL. In experiments with \mbox{GPT-2} models of different sizes, our scaling law matches existing scaling laws in accuracy while also offering interpretable terms for task priors, learning efficiency, and per-example probabilities. To illustrate the analytic power that such interpretable scaling laws provide, we report on controlled synthetic dataset experiments designed to inform real-world studies of safety alignment. In our experimental protocol, we use SFT or DPO to suppress an unwanted existing model capability and then use ICL to try to bring that capability back (many-shot jailbreaking). We then study ICL on real-world instruction-tuned LLMs using capabilities benchmarks as well as a new many-shot jailbreaking dataset. In all cases, Bayesian scaling laws accurately predict the conditions under which ICL will cause suppressed behaviors to reemerge, which sheds light on the ineffectiveness of post-training at increasing LLM safety.</description>

      <title>Group-SAE: Efficient Training of Sparse Autoencoders for Large Language Models via Layer Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21508v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: SAEs have recently been employed as a promising unsupervised approach for understanding the representations of layers of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, with the growth in model size and complexity, training SAEs is computationally intensive, as typically one SAE is trained for each model layer. To address such limitation, we propose \textit{Group-SAE}, a novel strategy to train SAEs. Our method considers the similarity of the residual stream representations between contiguous layers to group similar layers and train a single SAE per group. To balance the trade-off between efficiency and performance, we further introduce \textit{AMAD} (Average Maximum Angular Distance), an empirical metric that guides the selection of an optimal number of groups based on representational similarity across layers. Experiments on models from the Pythia family show that our approach significantly accelerates training with minimal impact on reconstruction quality and comparable downstream task performance and interpretability over baseline SAEs trained layer by layer. This method provides an efficient and scalable strategy for training SAEs in modern LLMs.</description>

      <title>Both Text and Images Leaked! A Systematic Analysis of Data Contamination in Multimodal LLM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03823v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has significantly enhanced performance across benchmarks. However, data contamination-unintentional memorization of benchmark data during model training-poses critical challenges for fair evaluation. Existing detection methods for unimodal large language models (LLMs) are inadequate for MLLMs due to multimodal data complexity and multi-phase training. We systematically analyze multimodal data contamination using our analytical framework, MM-Detect, which defines two contamination categories-unimodal and cross-modal-and effectively quantifies contamination severity across multiple-choice and caption-based Visual Question Answering tasks. Evaluations on twelve MLLMs and five benchmarks reveal significant contamination, particularly in proprietary models and older benchmarks. Crucially, contamination sometimes originates during unimodal pre-training rather than solely from multimodal fine-tuning. Our insights refine contamination understanding, guiding evaluation practices and improving multimodal model reliability.</description>

      <title>Feed-Forward Bullet-Time Reconstruction of Dynamic Scenes from Monocular Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03526v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in static feed-forward scene reconstruction have demonstrated significant progress in high-quality novel view synthesis. However, these models often struggle with generalizability across diverse environments and fail to effectively handle dynamic content. We present BTimer (short for BulletTimer), the first motion-aware feed-forward model for real-time reconstruction and novel view synthesis of dynamic scenes. Our approach reconstructs the full scene in a 3D Gaussian Splatting representation at a given target ('bullet') timestamp by aggregating information from all the context frames. Such a formulation allows BTimer to gain scalability and generalization by leveraging both static and dynamic scene datasets. Given a casual monocular dynamic video, BTimer reconstructs a bullet-time scene within 150ms while reaching state-of-the-art performance on both static and dynamic scene datasets, even compared with optimization-based approaches.</description>

      <title>KNN-MMD: Cross Domain Wireless Sensing via Local Distribution Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04783v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Wireless sensing has recently found widespread applications in diverse environments, including homes, offices, and public spaces. By analyzing patterns in channel state information (CSI), it is possible to infer human actions for tasks such as person identification, gesture recognition, and fall detection. However, CSI is highly sensitive to environmental changes, where even minor alterations can significantly distort the CSI patterns. This sensitivity often leads to performance degradation or outright failure when applying wireless sensing models trained in one environment to another. To address this challenge, Domain Alignment (DAL) has been widely adopted for cross-domain classification tasks, as it focuses on aligning the global distributions of the source and target domains in feature space. Despite its popularity, DAL often neglects inter-category relationships, which can lead to misalignment between categories across domains, even when global alignment is achieved. To overcome these limitations, we propose K-Nearest Neighbors Maximum Mean Discrepancy (KNN-MMD), a novel few-shot method for cross-domain wireless sensing. Our approach begins by constructing a help set using KNN from the target domain, enabling local alignment between the source and target domains within each category using MMD. Additionally, we address a key instability issue commonly observed in cross-domain methods, where model performance fluctuates sharply between epochs. Further, most existing methods struggle to determine an optimal stopping point during training due to the absence of labeled data from the target domain. Our method resolves this by excluding the support set from the target domain during training and employing it as a validation set to determine the stopping criterion.The dataset and code are publicly available at https://github.com/RS2002/KNN-MMD .</description>

      <title>Machine learning-driven conservative-to-primitive conversion in hybrid piecewise polytropic and tabulated equations of state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07836v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel machine learning (ML) method to accelerate conservative-to-primitive inversion, focusing on hybrid piecewise polytropic and tabulated equations of state. Traditional root-finding techniques are computationally expensive, particularly for large-scale relativistic hydrodynamics simulations. To address this, we employ feedforward neural networks (NNC2PS and NNC2PL), trained in PyTorch and optimized for GPU inference using NVIDIA TensorRT, achieving significant speedups with minimal accuracy loss. The NNC2PS model achieves $ L_1 $ and $ L_\infty $ errors of $ 4.54 \times 10^{-7} $ and $ 3.44 \times 10^{-6} $, respectively, while the NNC2PL model exhibits even lower error values. TensorRT optimization with mixed-precision deployment substantially accelerates performance compared to traditional root-finding methods. Specifically, the mixed-precision TensorRT engine for NNC2PS achieves inference speeds approximately 400 times faster than a traditional single-threaded CPU implementation for a dataset size of 1,000,000 points. Ideal parallelization across an entire compute node in the Delta supercomputer (Dual AMD 64 core 2.45 GHz Milan processors; and 8 NVIDIA A100 GPUs with 40 GB HBM2 RAM and NVLink) predicts a 25-fold speedup for TensorRT over an optimally-parallelized numerical method when processing 8 million data points. Moreover, the ML method exhibits sub-linear scaling with increasing dataset sizes. We release the scientific software developed, enabling further validation and extension of our findings. This work underscores the potential of ML, combined with GPU optimization and model quantization, to accelerate conservative-to-primitive inversion in relativistic hydrodynamics simulations.</description>

      <title>An AI-powered Bayesian generative modeling approach for causal inference in observational studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00755v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Causal inference in observational studies with high-dimensional covariates presents significant challenges. We introduce CausalBGM, an AI-powered Bayesian generative modeling approach that captures the causal relationship among covariates, treatment, and outcome variables. The core innovation of CausalBGM lies in its ability to estimate the individual treatment effect (ITE) by learning individual-specific distributions of a low-dimensional latent feature set (e.g., latent confounders) that drives changes in both treatment and outcome. This approach not only effectively mitigates confounding effects but also provides comprehensive uncertainty quantification, offering reliable and interpretable causal effect estimates at the individual level. CausalBGM adopts a Bayesian model and uses a novel iterative algorithm to update the model parameters and the posterior distribution of latent features until convergence. This framework leverages the power of AI to capture complex dependencies among variables while adhering to the Bayesian principles. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CausalBGM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in scenarios with high-dimensional covariates and large-scale datasets. Its Bayesian foundation ensures statistical rigor, providing robust and well-calibrated posterior intervals. By addressing key limitations of existing methods, CausalBGM emerges as a robust and promising framework for advancing causal inference in modern applications in fields such as genomics, healthcare, and social sciences.

      <title>Tempo: Compiled Dynamic Deep Learning with Symbolic Dependence Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05408v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep learning (DL) algorithms are often defined in terms of \emph{temporal relationships}: a tensor at one timestep may depend on tensors from earlier or later timesteps. Such \emph{dynamic} dependencies (and corresponding dynamic tensor shapes) are difficult to express and optimize: while \emph{eager} DL systems support such dynamism, they cannot apply compiler-based optimizations; \emph{graph-based} systems require static tensor shapes, which forces users to pad tensors or break-up programs into multiple static graphs.
  We describe Tempo, a new DL system that combines the dynamism of eager execution with the whole-program optimizations of graph-based compilation. Tempo achieves this through a declarative programming model with \emph{recurrent tensors}, which include explicit \emph{temporal dimensions}. Temporal dimensions can be indexed using \emph{symbolic expressions} to express dynamic dependencies on past and future tensors. Based on this, Tempo constructs a \emph{symbolic dependence graph}, which concisely encodes dynamic dependencies between operators, and applies whole-program optimizations, such as algebraic simplifications, vectorization, tiling, and fusion. By tiling dynamic dependencies into static-size blocks, Tempo can also reuse existing static code-generators. It then uses a polyhedral model to find a feasible execution schedule, which includes memory management operations. We show that Tempo achieves a 7$\times$ speedup over JAX for Llama-3.2-3B decoding; for reinforcement learning algorithms, Tempo achieves a 54$\times$ speedup, with 16$\times$ lower peak memory usage.</description>

      <title>INTA: Intent-Based Translation for Network Configuration with LLM Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08760v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Translating configurations between different network devices is a common yet challenging task in modern network operations. This challenge arises in typical scenarios such as replacing obsolete hardware and adapting configurations to emerging paradigms like Software Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV). Engineers need to thoroughly understand both source and target configuration models, which requires considerable effort due to the complexity and evolving nature of these specifications. To promote automation in network configuration translation, we propose INTA, an intent-based translation framework that leverages Large Language Model (LLM) agents. The key idea of INTA is to use configuration intent as an intermediate representation for translation. It first employs LLMs to decompose configuration files and extract fine-grained intents for each configuration fragment. These intents are then used to retrieve relevant manuals of the target device. Guided by a syntax checker, INTA incrementally generates target configurations. The translated configurations are further verified and refined for semantic consistency. We implement INTA and evaluate it on real-world configuration datasets from the industry. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in translation accuracy and exhibits strong generalizability. INTA achieves an accuracy of 98.15% in terms of both syntactic and view correctness, and a command recall rate of 84.72% for the target configuration. The semantic consistency report of the translated configuration further demonstrates its practical value in real-world network operations.</description>

      <title>Targeting Alignment: Extracting Safety Classifiers of Aligned LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16534v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Alignment in large language models (LLMs) is used to enforce guidelines such as safety. Yet, alignment fails in the face of jailbreak attacks that modify inputs to induce unsafe outputs. In this paper, we introduce and evaluate a new technique for jailbreak attacks. We observe that alignment embeds a safety classifier in the LLM responsible for deciding between refusal and compliance, and seek to extract an approximation of this classifier: a surrogate classifier. To this end, we build candidate classifiers from subsets of the LLM. We first evaluate the degree to which candidate classifiers approximate the LLM's safety classifier in benign and adversarial settings. Then, we attack the candidates and measure how well the resulting adversarial inputs transfer to the LLM. Our evaluation shows that the best candidates achieve accurate agreement (an F1 score above 80%) using as little as 20% of the model architecture. Further, we find that attacks mounted on the surrogate classifiers can be transferred to the LLM with high success. For example, a surrogate using only 50% of the Llama 2 model achieved an attack success rate (ASR) of 70% with half the memory footprint and runtime -- a substantial improvement over attacking the LLM directly, where we only observed a 22% ASR. These results show that extracting surrogate classifiers is an effective and efficient means for modeling (and therein addressing) the vulnerability of aligned models to jailbreaking attacks.</description>

      <title>Attention Sinks: A 'Catch, Tag, Release' Mechanism for Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00919v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often concentrate their attention on a few specific tokens referred to as attention sinks. Common examples include the first token, a prompt-independent sink, and punctuation tokens, which are prompt-dependent. While the tokens causing the sinks often lack direct semantic meaning, the presence of the sinks is critical for model performance, particularly under model compression and KV-caching. Despite their ubiquity, the function, semantic role, and origin of attention sinks -- especially those beyond the first token -- remain poorly understood. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive investigation demonstrating that attention sinks: catch a sequence of tokens, tag them using a common direction in embedding space, and release them back into the residual stream, where tokens are later retrieved based on the tags they have acquired. Probing experiments reveal these tags carry semantically meaningful information, such as the truth of a statement. These findings extend to reasoning models, where the mechanism spans more heads and explains greater variance in embeddings, or recent models with query-key normalization, where sinks remain just as prevalent. To encourage future theoretical analysis, we introduce a minimal problem which can be solved through the 'catch, tag, release' mechanism, and where it emerges through training.</description>

Abstract: Multi-View Reinforcement Learning (MVRL) seeks to provide agents with multi-view observations, enabling them to perceive environment with greater effectiveness and precision. Recent advancements in MVRL focus on extracting latent representations from multiview observations and leveraging them in control tasks. However, it is not straightforward to learn compact and task-relevant representations, particularly in the presence of redundancy, distracting information, or missing views. In this paper, we propose Multi-view Fusion State for Control (MFSC), firstly incorporating bisimulation metric learning into MVRL to learn task-relevant representations. Furthermore, we propose a multiview-based mask and latent reconstruction auxiliary task that exploits shared information across views and improves MFSC's robustness in missing views by introducing a mask token. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in MVRL tasks. Even in more realistic scenarios with interference or missing views, MFSC consistently maintains high performance.</description>

      <title>GRADIEND: Feature Learning within Neural Networks Exemplified through Biases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01406v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: AI systems frequently exhibit and amplify social biases, leading to harmful consequences in critical areas. This study introduces a novel encoder-decoder approach that leverages model gradients to learn a feature neuron encoding societal bias information such as gender, race, and religion. We show that our method can not only identify which weights of a model need to be changed to modify a feature, but even demonstrate that this can be used to rewrite models to debias them while maintaining other capabilities. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across various model architectures and highlight its potential for broader applications.</description>

      <title>Robust Federated Finetuning of LLMs via Alternating Optimization of LoRA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01755v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) optimize federated training by reducing computational and communication costs. We propose RoLoRA, a federated framework using alternating optimization to fine-tune LoRA adapters. Our approach emphasizes the importance of learning up and down projection matrices to enhance expressiveness and robustness. We use both theoretical analysis and extensive experiments to demonstrate the advantages of RoLoRA over prior approaches that either generate imperfect model updates or limit expressiveness of the model. We provide a theoretical analysis on a linear model to highlight the importance of learning both the down-projection and up-projection matrices in LoRA. We validate the insights on a non-linear model and separately provide a convergence proof under general conditions. To bridge theory and practice, we conducted extensive experimental evaluations on language models including RoBERTa-Large, Llama-2-7B on diverse tasks and FL settings to demonstrate the advantages of RoLoRA over other methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02495v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Causal Effect (CE) is a numerical measure of causal influence of variables on observed results. Despite being widely used in many areas, only preliminary attempts have been made to use CE as an attribution score in data management, to measure the causal strength of tuples for query answering in databases. In this work, we introduce, generalize and investigate the so-called Causal-Effect Score in the context of classical and probabilistic databases.</description>

      <title>Contextual Gesture: Co-Speech Gesture Video Generation through Context-aware Gesture Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07239v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Co-speech gesture generation is crucial for creating lifelike avatars and enhancing human-computer interactions by synchronizing gestures with speech. Despite recent advancements, existing methods struggle with accurately identifying the rhythmic or semantic triggers from audio for generating contextualized gesture patterns and achieving pixel-level realism. To address these challenges, we introduce Contextual Gesture, a framework that improves co-speech gesture video generation through three innovative components: (1) a chronological speech-gesture alignment that temporally connects two modalities, (2) a contextualized gesture tokenization that incorporate speech context into motion pattern representation through distillation, and (3) a structure-aware refinement module that employs edge connection to link gesture keypoints to improve video generation. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that Contextual Gesture not only produces realistic and speech-aligned gesture videos but also supports long-sequence generation and video gesture editing applications, shown in Fig.1.</description>

      <title>No Need for Explanations: LLMs can implicitly learn from mistakes in-context</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08550v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Showing incorrect answers to Large Language Models (LLMs) is a popular strategy to improve their performance in reasoning-intensive tasks. It is widely assumed that, in order to be helpful, the incorrect answers must be accompanied by comprehensive rationales, explicitly detailing where the mistakes are and how to correct them. However, in this work we present a counterintuitive finding: we observe that LLMs perform better in math reasoning tasks when these rationales are eliminated from the context and models are left to infer on their own what makes an incorrect answer flawed. This approach also substantially outperforms chain-of-thought prompting in our evaluations. These results are consistent across LLMs of different sizes and varying reasoning abilities. To gain an understanding of why LLMs learn from mistakes more effectively without explicit corrective rationales, we perform a thorough analysis, investigating changes in context length and answer diversity between different prompting strategies, and their effect on performance. We also examine evidence of overfitting to the in-context rationales when these are provided, and study the extent to which LLMs are able to autonomously infer high-quality corrective rationales given only incorrect answers as input. We find evidence that, while incorrect answers are more beneficial for LLM learning than additional diverse correct answers, explicit corrective rationales over-constrain the model, thus limiting those benefits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09885v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time series modeling and analysis have become critical in various domains. Conventional methods such as RNNs and Transformers, while effective for discrete-time and regularly sampled data, face significant challenges in capturing the continuous dynamics and irregular sampling patterns inherent in real-world scenarios. Neural Differential Equations (NDEs) represent a paradigm shift by combining the flexibility of neural networks with the mathematical rigor of differential equations. This paper presents a comprehensive review of NDE-based methods for time series analysis, including neural ordinary differential equations, neural controlled differential equations, and neural stochastic differential equations. We provide a detailed discussion of their mathematical formulations, numerical methods, and applications, highlighting their ability to model continuous-time dynamics. Furthermore, we address key challenges and future research directions. This survey serves as a foundation for researchers and practitioners seeking to leverage NDEs for advanced time series analysis.</description>

      <title>Auto-Search and Refinement: An Automated Framework for Gender Bias Mitigation in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11559v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pre-training large language models (LLMs) on vast text corpora enhances natural language processing capabilities but risks encoding social biases, particularly gender bias. While parameter-modification methods like fine-tuning mitigate bias, they are resource-intensive, unsuitable for closed-source models, and lack adaptability to evolving societal norms. Instruction-based approaches offer flexibility but often compromise task performance. To address these limitations, we propose $\textit{FaIRMaker}$, an automated and model-independent framework that employs an $\textbf{auto-search and refinement}$ paradigm to adaptively generate Fairwords, which act as instructions integrated into input queries to reduce gender bias and enhance response quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that $\textit{FaIRMaker}$ automatically searches for and dynamically refines Fairwords, effectively mitigating gender bias while preserving task integrity and ensuring compatibility with both API-based and open-source LLMs.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models Badly Generalize across Option Length, Problem Types, and Irrelevant Noun Replacements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12459v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a ``Generalization Stress Test" to assess Large Language Models' (LLMs) generalization ability under slight and controlled perturbations, including option length, problem types, and irrelevant noun replacements. We achieve novel and significant findings that, despite high benchmark scores, LLMs exhibit severe accuracy drops and unexpected biases (e.g., preference for longer distractors) when faced with these minor but content-preserving modifications. For example, Qwen 2.5 1.5B's MMLU score rises from 60 to 89 and drops from 89 to 36 when option lengths are changed without altering the question. Even GPT4o experiences a 25-point accuracy loss when problem types are changed, with a 6-point drop across all three modification categories. These analyses suggest that LLMs rely heavily on superficial cues rather than forming robust, abstract representations that generalize across formats, lexical variations, and irrelevant content shifts.</description>

      <title>EquiBench: Benchmarking Large Language Models' Reasoning about Program Semantics via Equivalence Checking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12466v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become integral to code-related tasks, a central question emerges: Do LLMs truly understand program semantics? We introduce EquiBench, a new benchmark for evaluating LLMs through equivalence checking, i.e., determining whether two programs produce identical outputs for all possible inputs. Unlike prior code generation benchmarks, this task directly tests a model's ability to reason about program semantics. EquiBench consists of 2400 program pairs across four languages and six categories. These pairs are generated through program analysis, compiler scheduling, and superoptimization, ensuring high-confidence labels, nontrivial difficulty, and full automation. We evaluate 19 state-of-the-art LLMs and find that in the most challenging categories, the best accuracies are 63.8% and 76.2%, only modestly above the 50% random baseline. Further analysis reveals that models often rely on syntactic similarity rather than exhibiting robust reasoning about program semantics, highlighting current limitations.

      <title>Multi-branch of Attention Yields Accurate Results for Tabular Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12507v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tabular data inherently exhibits significant feature heterogeneity, but existing transformer-based methods lack specialized mechanisms to handle this property. To bridge the gap, we propose MAYA, an encoder-decoder transformer-based framework. In the encoder, we design a Multi-Branch of Attention (MBA) that constructs multiple parallel attention branches and averages the features at each branch, effectively fusing heterogeneous features while limiting parameter growth. Additionally, we employ collaborative learning with a dynamic consistency weight constraint to produce more robust representations. In the decoder stage, cross-attention is utilized to seamlessly integrate tabular data with corresponding label features. This dual-attention mechanism effectively captures both intra-instance and inter-instance interactions. We evaluate the proposed method on a wide range of datasets and compare it with other state-of-the-art transformer-based methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves superior performance among transformer-based methods in both tabular classification and regression tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13251v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present Neural Attention Search (NAtS), a framework that automatically evaluates the importance of each token within a sequence and determines if the corresponding token can be dropped after several steps. This approach can efficiently reduce the KV cache sizes required by transformer-based models during inference and thus reduce inference costs. In this paper, we design a search space that contains three token types: (i) Global Tokens will be preserved and queried by all the following tokens. (ii) Local Tokens survive until the next global token appears. (iii) Sliding Window Tokens have an impact on the inference of a fixed size of the next following tokens. Similar to the One-Shot Neural Architecture Search approach, this token-type information can be learned jointly with the architecture weights via a learnable attention mask. Experiments on both training a new transformer from scratch and fine-tuning existing large language models show that NAtS can efficiently reduce the KV cache size required for the models while maintaining the models' performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13767v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown surprising proficiency in generating code snippets, promising to automate large parts of software engineering via artificial intelligence (AI). We argue that successfully deploying AI software engineers requires a level of trust equal to or even greater than the trust established by human-driven software engineering practices. The recent trend toward LLM agents offers a path toward integrating the power of LLMs to create new code with the power of analysis tools to increase trust in the code. This opinion piece comments on whether LLM agents could dominate software engineering workflows in the future and whether the focus of programming will shift from programming at scale to programming with trust.</description>

      <title>Does Reasoning Introduce Bias? A Study of Social Bias Evaluation and Mitigation in LLM Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15361v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled automatic generation of chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, leading to strong performance on tasks such as math and code. However, when reasoning steps reflect social stereotypes (e.g., those related to gender, race or age), they can reinforce harmful associations and lead to misleading conclusions. We present the first systematic evaluation of social bias within LLM-generated reasoning, focusing on reasoning language models (e.g., DeepSeek-R1, OpenAI o1) that natively produce reasoning chains as part of their answers. Using the BBQ dataset, we analyze both prediction accuracy and reasoning bias across a broad spectrum of models, including instruction-tuned and CoT-augmented variants of DeepSeek-R1 (8B/32B), ChatGPT, and other open-source LLMs. We quantify how biased reasoning steps correlate with incorrect predictions and often lead to stereotype expression. To mitigate reasoning-induced bias, we propose Answer Distribution as Bias Proxy (ADBP), a lightweight mitigation method that detects bias by tracking how model predictions change across incremental reasoning steps. ADBP outperforms Stereotype-free Reasoning Pattern (SfRP) baseline in most cases, mitigating bias and improving the accuracy of LLM outputs. Evaluation and mitigation code is available at https://github.com/elviswxy/LLM_reasoning_bias.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models as Realistic Microservice Trace Generators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17439v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Workload traces are essential to understand complex computer systems' behavior and manage processing and memory resources. Since real-world traces are hard to obtain, synthetic trace generation is a promising alternative. This paper proposes a first-of-a-kind approach that relies on training a large language model (LLM) to generate synthetic workload traces, specifically microservice call graphs. To capture complex and arbitrary hierarchical structures and implicit constraints in such traces, we propose to train LLMs to generate recursively, making call graph generation a sequence of more manageable steps. To further enforce learning constraints on the traces and generate uncommon situations, we apply additional instruction tuning steps to align our model with the desired trace features. With this method, we train TraceLLM, an LLM for microservice trace generation, and demonstrate that it produces diverse, realistic traces under varied conditions, outperforming existing approaches in both accuracy and validity. The synthetically generated traces can effectively replace real data to optimize important microservice management tasks. Additionally, TraceLLM adapts to downstream trace-related tasks, such as predicting key trace features and infilling missing data.</description>

      <title>FC-Attack: Jailbreaking Multimodal Large Language Models via Auto-Generated Flowcharts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21059v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have become powerful and widely adopted in some practical applications. However, recent research has revealed their vulnerability to multimodal jailbreak attacks, whereby the model can be induced to generate harmful content, leading to safety risks. Although most MLLMs have undergone safety alignment, recent research shows that the visual modality is still vulnerable to jailbreak attacks. In our work, we discover that by using flowcharts with partially harmful information, MLLMs can be induced to provide additional harmful details. Based on this, we propose a jailbreak attack method based on auto-generated flowcharts, FC-Attack. Specifically, FC-Attack first fine-tunes a pre-trained LLM to create a step-description generator based on benign datasets. The generator is then used to produce step descriptions corresponding to a harmful query, which are transformed into flowcharts in 3 different shapes (vertical, horizontal, and S-shaped) as visual prompts. These flowcharts are then combined with a benign textual prompt to execute the jailbreak attack on MLLMs. Our evaluations on Advbench show that FC-Attack attains an attack success rate of up to 96% via images and up to 78% via videos across multiple MLLMs. Additionally, we investigate factors affecting the attack performance, including the number of steps and the font styles in the flowcharts. We also find that FC-Attack can improve the jailbreak performance from 4% to 28% in Claude-3.5 by changing the font style. To mitigate the attack, we explore several defenses and find that AdaShield can largely reduce the jailbreak performance but with the cost of utility drop.</description>

      <title>Beyond Prompting: An Efficient Embedding Framework for Open-Domain Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01606v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models have recently pushed open domain question answering (ODQA) to new frontiers. However, prevailing retriever-reader pipelines often depend on multiple rounds of prompt level instructions, leading to high computational overhead, instability, and suboptimal retrieval coverage. In this paper, we propose EmbQA, an embedding-level framework that alleviates these shortcomings by enhancing both the retriever and the reader. Specifically, we refine query representations via lightweight linear layers under an unsupervised contrastive learning objective, thereby reordering retrieved passages to highlight those most likely to contain correct answers. Additionally, we introduce an exploratory embedding that broadens the model's latent semantic space to diversify candidate generation and employs an entropy-based selection mechanism to choose the most confident answer automatically. Extensive experiments across three open-source LLMs, three retrieval methods, and four ODQA benchmarks demonstrate that EmbQA substantially outperforms recent baselines in both accuracy and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Audio-Reasoner: Improving Reasoning Capability in Large Audio Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02318v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal reasoning have largely overlooked the audio modality. We introduce Audio-Reasoner, a large-scale audio language model for deep reasoning in audio tasks. We meticulously curated a large-scale and diverse multi-task audio dataset with simple annotations. Then, we leverage closed-source models to conduct secondary labeling, QA generation, along with structured COT process. These datasets together form a high-quality reasoning dataset with 1.2 million reasoning-rich samples, which we name CoTA. Following inference scaling principles, we train Audio-Reasoner on CoTA, enabling it to achieve great logical capabilities in audio reasoning. Experiments show state-of-the-art performance across key benchmarks, including MMAU-mini (+25.42%), AIR-Bench chat/foundation(+14.57%/+10.13%), and MELD (+8.01%). Our findings stress the core of structured CoT training in advancing audio reasoning.</description>

      <title>Trajectory Prediction for Autonomous Driving: Progress, Limitations, and Future Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03262v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As the potential for autonomous vehicles to be integrated on a large scale into modern traffic systems continues to grow, ensuring safe navigation in dynamic environments is crucial for smooth integration. To guarantee safety and prevent collisions, autonomous vehicles must be capable of accurately predicting the trajectories of surrounding traffic agents. Over the past decade, significant efforts from both academia and industry have been dedicated to designing solutions for precise trajectory forecasting. These efforts have produced a diverse range of approaches, raising questions about the differences between these methods and whether trajectory prediction challenges have been fully addressed. This paper reviews a substantial portion of recent trajectory prediction methods proposing a taxonomy to classify existing solutions. A general overview of the prediction pipeline is also provided, covering input and output modalities, modeling features, and prediction paradigms existing in the literature. In addition, the paper discusses active research areas within trajectory prediction, addresses the posed research questions, and highlights the remaining research gaps and challenges.</description>

      <title>ASTRA: A Negotiation Agent with Adaptive and Strategic Reasoning via Tool-integrated Action for Dynamic Offer Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07129v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Negotiation requires dynamically balancing self-interest and cooperation within the flow of conversation to maximize one's own utility. Yet, existing agents struggle due to bounded rationality in human data, low adaptability to counterpart behavior, and limited strategic reasoning. To address this, we introduce principle-driven negotiation agents, powered by ASTRA, a novel framework for turn-level offer optimization grounded in two core principles: opponent modeling and Tit-for-Tat reciprocity. ASTRA operates in three stages: (1) interpreting counterpart behavior, (2) optimizing counteroffers via a tool-integrated action with a linear programming (LP) solver, and (3) selecting offers based on strategy assessment and the partner's acceptance probability. Through simulations and human evaluations, our agent effectively adapts to an opponent's shifting stance and achieves favorable outcomes through enhanced adaptability and strategic reasoning. Beyond enhancing negotiation performance, it also serves as a powerful coaching tool, offering interpretable strategic feedback and optimal offer recommendations beyond human bounded rationality, with its potential further validated through human evaluation.</description>

      <title>Can Language Models Follow Multiple Turns of Entangled Instructions?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13222v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite significant achievements in improving the instruction-following capabilities of large language models (LLMs), the ability to process multiple potentially entangled or conflicting instructions remains a considerable challenge. Real-world scenarios often require consistency across multiple instructions over time, such as secret privacy, personal preferences, and prioritization, which demand sophisticated abilities to integrate multiple turns and carefully balance competing objectives when instructions intersect or conflict. This work presents a systematic investigation of LLMs' capabilities in handling multiple turns of instructions, covering three levels of difficulty: (1) retrieving information from instructions, (2) tracking and reasoning across turns, and (3) resolving conflicts among instructions. We construct MultiTurnInstruct~with $\sim$1.1K high-quality multi-turn conversations through the human-in-the-loop approach and result in nine capability categories, including statics and dynamics, reasoning, and multitasking. Our finding reveals an intriguing trade-off between different capabilities. While GPT models demonstrate superior memorization, they show reduced effectiveness in privacy-protection tasks requiring selective information withholding. Larger models exhibit stronger reasoning capabilities but still struggle with resolving conflicting instructions. Importantly, these performance gaps cannot be attributed solely to information loss, as models demonstrate strong BLEU scores on memorization tasks. Still, their attention mechanisms fail to integrate multiple related instructions effectively. These findings highlight critical areas for improvement in complex real-world tasks involving multi-turn instructions. Data and codes are released at https://github.com/Glaciohound/Multi-Turn-Instruct.</description>

      <title>DescriptorMedSAM: Language-Image Fusion with Multi-Aspect Text Guidance for Medical Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13806v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate organ segmentation is essential for clinical tasks such as radiotherapy planning and disease monitoring. Recent foundation models like MedSAM achieve strong results using point or bounding-box prompts but still require manual interaction. We propose DescriptorMedSAM, a lightweight extension of MedSAM that incorporates structured text prompts, ranging from simple organ names to combined shape and location descriptors to enable click-free segmentation. DescriptorMedSAM employs a CLIP text encoder to convert radiology-style descriptors into dense embeddings, which are fused with visual tokens via a cross-attention block and a multi-scale feature extractor. We designed four descriptor types: Name (N), Name + Shape (NS), Name + Location (NL), and Name + Shape + Location (NSL), and evaluated them on the FLARE 2022 dataset under zero-shot and few-shot settings, where organs unseen during training must be segmented with minimal additional data. NSL prompts achieved the highest performance, with a Dice score of 0.9405 under full supervision, a 76.31% zero-shot retention ratio, and a 97.02% retention ratio after fine-tuning with only 50 labeled slices per unseen organ. Adding shape and location cues consistently improved segmentation accuracy, especially for small or morphologically complex structures. We demonstrate that structured language prompts can effectively replace spatial interactions, delivering strong zero-shot performance and rapid few-shot adaptation. By quantifying the role of descriptor, this work lays the groundwork for scalable, prompt-aware segmentation models that generalize across diverse anatomical targets with minimal annotation effort.</description>

      <title>VQToken: Neural Discrete Token Representation Learning for Extreme Token Reduction in Video Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16980v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Token-based video representation has emerged as a promising approach for enabling large language models (LLMs) to interpret video content. However, existing token reduction techniques, such as pruning and merging, often disrupt essential positional embeddings and rely on continuous visual tokens sampled from nearby pixels with similar spatial-temporal locations. By removing only a small fraction of tokens, these methods still produce relatively lengthy continuous sequences, which falls short of the extreme compression required to balance computational efficiency and token count in video LLMs. In this paper, we introduce the novel task of Extreme Short Token Reduction, which aims to represent entire videos using a minimal set of discrete tokens. We propose VQToken, a neural discrete token representation framework that (i) applies adaptive vector quantization to continuous ViT embeddings to learn a compact codebook and (ii) preserves spatial-temporal positions via a token hash function by assigning each grid-level token to its nearest codebook entry. On the Extreme Short Token Reduction task, our VQToken compresses sequences to just 0.07 percent of their original length while incurring only a 0.66 percent drop in accuracy on the NextQA-MC benchmark. It also achieves comparable performance on ActNet-QA, Long Video Bench, and VideoMME. We further introduce the Token Information Density (TokDense) metric and formalize fixed-length and adaptive-length subtasks, achieving state-of-the-art results in both settings. Our approach dramatically lowers theoretical complexity, increases information density, drastically reduces token counts, and enables efficient video LLMs in resource-constrained environments.</description>

      <title>Unmasking Deceptive Visuals: Benchmarking Multimodal Large Language Models on Misleading Chart Question Answering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18172v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Misleading visualizations, which manipulate chart representations to support specific claims, can distort perception and lead to incorrect conclusions. Despite decades of research, they remain a widespread issue, posing risks to public understanding and raising safety concerns for AI systems involved in data-driven communication. While recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show strong chart comprehension abilities, their capacity to detect and interpret misleading charts remains unexplored. We introduce Misleading ChartQA benchmark, a large-scale multimodal dataset designed to evaluate MLLMs on misleading chart reasoning. It contains 3,026 curated examples spanning 21 misleader types and 10 chart types, each with standardized chart code, CSV data, multiple-choice questions, and labeled explanations, validated through iterative MLLM checks and expert human review. We benchmark 24 state-of-the-art MLLMs, analyze their performance across misleader types and chart formats, and propose a novel region-aware reasoning pipeline that enhances model accuracy. Our work lays the foundation for developing MLLMs that are robust, trustworthy, and aligned with the demands of responsible visual communication.</description>

      <title>CoSIL: Issue Localization via LLM-Driven Code Graph Searching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22424v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Issue solving aims to generate patches to fix reported issues in real-world code repositories according to issue descriptions. Issue localization forms the basis for accurate issue solving. Recently, LLM-based issue localization methods have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance. However, these methods either search from files mentioned in issue descriptions or in the whole repository and struggle to balance the breadth and depth of the search space to converge on the target efficiently. Moreover, they allow LLM to explore whole repositories freely, making it challenging to control the search direction to prevent the LLM from searching for incorrect targets. This paper introduces CoSIL, an LLM-driven, powerful function-level issue localization method without training or indexing. CoSIL employs a two-phase code graph search strategy. It first conducts broad exploration at the file level using dynamically constructed module call graphs, and then performs in-depth analysis at the function level by expanding the module call graph into a function call graph and executing iterative searches. To precisely control the search direction, CoSIL designs a pruner to filter unrelated directions and irrelevant contexts. To avoid incorrect interaction formats in long contexts, CoSIL introduces a reflection mechanism that uses additional independent queries in short contexts to enhance formatted abilities. Experiment results demonstrate that CoSIL achieves a Top-1 localization accuracy of 43.3\% and 44.6\% on SWE-bench Lite and SWE-bench Verified, respectively, with Qwen2.5-Coder-32B, average outperforming the state-of-the-art methods by 96.04\%. When CoSIL is integrated into an issue-solving method, Agentless, the issue resolution rate improves by 2.98\%--30.5\%.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22973v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cross-lingual open-ended generation - responding in a language different from that of the query - is an important yet understudied problem. This work proposes XL-Instruct, a novel technique for generating high-quality synthetic data, and introduces XL-AlpacaEval, a new benchmark for evaluating cross-lingual generation capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Our experiments show that fine-tuning with just 8K instructions generated using XL-Instruct significantly improves model performance, increasing the win rate against GPT-4o-Mini from 7.4% to 21.5% and improving on several fine-grained quality metrics. Moreover, base LLMs fine-tuned on XL-Instruct exhibit strong zero-shot improvements to question answering in the same language, as shown on our machine-translated m-AlpacaEval. These consistent gains highlight the promising role of XL-Instruct in the post-training of multilingual LLMs. Finally, we publicly release XL-Suite, a collection of training and evaluation data to facilitate research in cross-lingual open-ended generation.</description>

      <title>Localized Graph-Based Neural Dynamics Models for Terrain Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23270v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Predictive models can be particularly helpful for robots to effectively manipulate terrains in construction sites and extraterrestrial surfaces. However, terrain state representations become extremely high-dimensional especially to capture fine-resolution details and when depth is unknown or unbounded. This paper introduces a learning-based approach for terrain dynamics modeling and manipulation, leveraging the Graph-based Neural Dynamics (GBND) framework to represent terrain deformation as motion of a graph of particles. Based on the principle that the moving portion of a terrain is usually localized, our approach builds a large terrain graph (potentially millions of particles) but only identifies a very small active subgraph (hundreds of particles) for predicting the outcomes of robot-terrain interaction. To minimize the size of the active subgraph we introduce a learning-based approach that identifies a small region of interest (RoI) based on the robot's control inputs and the current scene. We also introduce a novel domain boundary feature encoding that allows GBNDs to perform accurate dynamics prediction in the RoI interior while avoiding particle penetration through RoI boundaries. Our proposed method is both orders of magnitude faster than naive GBND and it achieves better overall prediction accuracy. We further evaluated our framework on excavation and shaping tasks on terrain with different granularity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02965v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: LLMs' remarkable ability to tackle a wide range of language tasks opened new opportunities for collaborative human-AI problem solving. LLMs can amplify human capabilities by applying their intuitions and reasoning strategies at scale. We explore whether human guides can be simulated, by generalizing from human demonstrations of guiding an AI system to solve complex language problems. We introduce CoLa, a novel self-guided learning paradigm for training automated $\textit{guides}$ and evaluate it on two QA datasets, a puzzle-solving task, and a constrained text generation task. Our empirical results show that CoLa consistently outperforms competitive approaches across all domains. Moreover, a small-sized trained guide outperforms a strong model like GPT-4 when acting as a guide. We compare the strategies employed by humans and automated guides by conducting a human study on a QA dataset. We show that automated guides outperform humans by adapting their strategies to reasoners' capabilities and conduct qualitative analyses highlighting distinct differences in guiding strategies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08771v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a generative method to dynamically simulate users' short video watching journey for watch time prediction in short video recommendation. Unlike existing methods that rely on multimodal features for video content understanding, our method simulates users' sustained interest in watching short videos by learning collaborative information, using interest changes from existing positive and negative feedback videos and user interaction behaviors to implicitly model users' video watching journey. By segmenting videos based on duration and adopting a Transformer-like architecture, our method can capture sequential dependencies between segments while mitigating duration bias. Extensive experiments on industrial-scale and public datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on watch time prediction tasks. The method has been deployed on Kuaishou Lite, achieving a significant improvement of +0.13\% in APP duration, and reaching an XAUC of 83\% for single video watch time prediction on industrial-scale streaming training sets, far exceeding other methods. The proposed method provides a scalable and effective solution for video recommendation through segment-level modeling and user engagement feedback.</description>

      <title>Dominated Actions in Imperfect-Information Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09716v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dominance is a fundamental concept in game theory. In strategic-form games dominated strategies can be identified in polynomial time. As a consequence, iterative removal of dominated strategies can be performed efficiently as a preprocessing step for reducing the size of a game before computing a Nash equilibrium. For imperfect-information games in extensive form, we could convert the game to strategic form and then iteratively remove dominated strategies in the same way; however, this conversion may cause an exponential blowup in game size. In this paper we define and study the concept of dominated actions in imperfect-information games. Our main result is a polynomial-time algorithm for determining whether an action is dominated (strictly or weakly) by any mixed strategy in n-player games, which can be extended to an algorithm for iteratively removing dominated actions. This allows us to efficiently reduce the size of the game tree as a preprocessing step for Nash equilibrium computation. We explore the role of dominated actions empirically in the "All In or Fold" No-Limit Texas Hold'em poker variant.</description>

      <title>SymRTLO: Enhancing RTL Code Optimization with LLMs and Neuron-Inspired Symbolic Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10369v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optimizing Register Transfer Level (RTL) code is crucial for improving the power, performance, and area (PPA) of digital circuits in the early stages of synthesis. Manual rewriting, guided by synthesis feedback, can yield high-quality results but is time-consuming and error-prone. Most existing compiler-based approaches have difficulty handling complex design constraints. Large Language Model (LLM)-based methods have emerged as a promising alternative to address these challenges. However, LLM-based approaches often face difficulties in ensuring alignment between the generated code and the provided prompts. This paper presents SymRTLO, a novel neuron-symbolic RTL optimization framework that seamlessly integrates LLM-based code rewriting with symbolic reasoning techniques. Our method incorporates a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system of optimization rules and Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)-based templates, enabling LLM-based rewriting that maintains syntactic correctness while minimizing undesired circuit behaviors. A symbolic module is proposed for analyzing and optimizing finite state machine (FSM) logic, allowing fine-grained state merging and partial specification handling beyond the scope of pattern-based compilers. Furthermore, a fast verification pipeline, combining formal equivalence checks with test-driven validation, further reduces the complexity of verification. Experiments on the RTL-Rewriter benchmark with Synopsys Design Compiler and Yosys show that SymRTLO improves power, performance, and area (PPA) by up to 43.9%, 62.5%, and 51.1%, respectively, compared to the state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>LEMUR Neural Network Dataset: Towards Seamless AutoML</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10552v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural networks have become the backbone of modern AI, yet designing, evaluating, and comparing them remains labor-intensive. While many datasets exist for training models, there are few standardized collections of the models themselves. We present LEMUR, an open-source dataset and framework that brings together a large collection of PyTorch-based neural networks across tasks such as classification, segmentation, detection, and natural language processing. Each model follows a common template, with configurations and results logged in a structured database to ensure consistency and reproducibility. LEMUR integrates Optuna for automated hyperparameter optimization, provides statistical analysis and visualization tools, and exposes an API for seamless access to performance data. The framework also supports extensibility, enabling researchers to add new models, datasets, or metrics without breaking compatibility. By standardizing implementations and unifying evaluation, LEMUR aims to accelerate AutoML research, facilitate fair benchmarking, and lower the barrier to large-scale neural network experimentation.</description>

      <title>Improving Instruct Models for Free: A Study on Partial Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11626v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Instruct models, obtained from various instruction tuning or post-training steps, are commonly deemed superior and more usable than their base counterpart. While the model gains instruction following ability, instruction tuning may lead to forgetting the knowledge from pre-training or it may encourage the model to become overly conversational or verbose. This, in turn, can lead to degradation of in-context few-shot learning performance. In this work, we study the performance trajectory between base and instruct models by scaling down the strength of instruction-tuning via the partial adaption method. We show that, across several model families and model sizes, reducing the strength of instruction-tuning results in material improvement on a few-shot in-context learning benchmark covering a variety of classic natural language tasks. This comes at the cost of losing some degree of instruction following ability as measured by AlpacaEval. Our study shines light on the potential trade-off between in-context learning and instruction following abilities that is worth considering in practice.</description>

      <title>Significativity Indices for Agreement Values</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15325v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Agreement measures, such as Cohen's kappa or intraclass correlation, gauge the matching between two or more classifiers. They are used in a wide range of contexts from medicine, where they evaluate the effectiveness of medical treatments and clinical trials, to artificial intelligence, where they can quantify the approximation due to the reduction of a classifier. The consistency of different classifiers to a golden standard can be compared simply by using the order induced by their agreement measure with respect to the golden standard itself. Nevertheless, labelling an approach as good or bad exclusively by using the value of an agreement measure requires a scale or a significativity index. Some quality scales have been proposed in the literature for Cohen's kappa, but they are mainly na\"ive, and their boundaries are arbitrary. This work proposes a general approach to evaluate the significativity of any agreement value between two classifiers and introduces two significativity indices: one dealing with finite data sets, the other one handling classification probability distributions. Moreover, this manuscript addresses the computational challenges of evaluating such indices and proposes some efficient algorithms for their evaluation.</description>

      <title>DeepInsert: Early Layer Bypass for Efficient and Performant Multimodal Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19327v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The hyperscaling of data and parameter count in transformer models is yielding diminishing performance improvement, especially when weighed against training costs. Such plateauing underlines a growing need for more efficient finetuning and inference, without sacrificing performance. This is particularly pressing for multimodal learning, where the overhead of processing multimodal tokens alongside language data often limits the practical viability of these systems. In parallel, advances in representation learning and interpretability have deepened our understanding of how such models process and encode information. Notably, recent work has uncovered implicit cross-modal alignment in the deeper layers of large pretrained models. Interestingly, this aligns with our own observations that models naturally defer most cross-modal token interactions to deeper stages of computation. Building on this, we propose a simple modification. Instead of concatenation with the language prompt at the start, we insert multimodal tokens directly into the middle, allowing them to entirely bypass the early layers. Our results with diverse modalities: 1) LLaVA \&amp; BLIP for vision, 2) LTU for audio, and 3) MoLCA for molecular data, indicate that our method reduces computational costs during both training and inference, while at the very least, preserving, if not surpassing the performance of existing baselines. Our work has important implications for scaling and composing pretrained models in a resource-efficient manner.</description>

      <title>A Simple Review of EEG Foundation Models: Datasets, Advancements and Future Perspectives</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20069v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals play a crucial role in understanding brain activity and diagnosing neurological diseases. Because supervised EEG encoders are unable to learn robust EEG patterns and rely too heavily on expensive signal annotation, research has turned to general-purpose self-supervised EEG encoders, known as EEG-based models (EEG-FMs), to achieve robust and scalable EEG feature extraction. However, the readiness of early EEG-FMs for practical applications and the standards for long-term research progress remain unclear. Therefore, a systematic and comprehensive review of first-generation EEG-FMs is necessary to understand their current state-of-the-art and identify key directions for future EEG-FMs. To this end, this study reviews 14 early EEG-FMs and provides a critical comprehensive analysis of their methodologies, empirical findings, and unaddressed research gaps. This review focuses on the latest developments in EEG-based models (EEG-FMs), which have shown great potential for processing and analyzing EEG data. We discuss various EEG-FMs, including their architectures, pretraining strategies, pretraining and downstream datasets, and other details. This review also highlights challenges and future directions in the field, aiming to provide a comprehensive overview for researchers and practitioners interested in EEG analysis and related EEG-FM.</description>

      <title>GarmentDiffusion: 3D Garment Sewing Pattern Generation with Multimodal Diffusion Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21476v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Garment sewing patterns are fundamental design elements that bridge the gap between design concepts and practical manufacturing. The generative modeling of sewing patterns is crucial for creating diversified garments. However, existing approaches are limited either by reliance on a single input modality or by suboptimal generation efficiency. In this work, we present GarmentDiffusion, a new generative model capable of producing centimeter-precise, vectorized 3D sewing patterns from multimodal inputs (text, image, and incomplete sewing pattern). Our method efficiently encodes 3D sewing pattern parameters into compact edge token representations, achieving a sequence length that is 10 times shorter than that of the autoregressive SewingGPT in DressCode. By employing a diffusion transformer, we simultaneously denoise all edge tokens along the temporal axis, while maintaining a constant number of denoising steps regardless of dataset-specific edge and panel statistics. With all combination of designs of our model, the sewing pattern generation speed is accelerated by 100 times compared to SewingGPT. We achieve new state-of-the-art results on DressCodeData, as well as on the largest sewing pattern dataset, namely GarmentCodeData. The project website is available at https://shenfu-research.github.io/Garment-Diffusion/.</description>

      <title>How Real Are Synthetic Therapy Conversations? Evaluating Fidelity in Prolonged Exposure Dialogues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21800v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Synthetic data adoption in healthcare is driven by privacy concerns, data access limitations, and high annotation costs. We explore synthetic Prolonged Exposure (PE) therapy conversations for PTSD as a scalable alternative for training clinical models. We systematically compare real and synthetic dialogues using linguistic, structural, and protocol-specific metrics like turn-taking and treatment fidelity. We introduce and evaluate PE-specific metrics, offering a novel framework for assessing clinical fidelity beyond surface fluency. Our findings show that while synthetic data successfully mitigates data scarcity and protects privacy, capturing the most subtle therapeutic dynamics remains a complex challenge. Synthetic dialogues successfully replicate key linguistic features of real conversations, for instance, achieving a similar Readability Score (89.2 vs. 88.1), while showing differences in some key fidelity markers like distress monitoring. This comparison highlights the need for fidelity-aware metrics that go beyond surface fluency to identify clinically significant nuances. Our model-agnostic framework is a critical tool for developers and clinicians to benchmark generative model fidelity before deployment in sensitive applications. Our findings help clarify where synthetic data can effectively complement real-world datasets, while also identifying areas for future refinement.</description>

      <title>KoACD: The First Korean Adolescent Dataset for Cognitive Distortion Analysis via Role-Switching Multi-LLM Negotiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00367v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cognitive distortion refers to negative thinking patterns that can lead to mental health issues like depression and anxiety in adolescents. Previous studies using natural language processing (NLP) have focused mainly on small-scale adult datasets, with limited research on adolescents. This study introduces KoACD, the first large-scale dataset of cognitive distortions in Korean adolescents, containing 108,717 instances. We applied a multi-Large Language Model (LLM) negotiation method to refine distortion classification, enabling iterative feedback and role-switching between models to reduce bias and improve label consistency. In addition, we generated synthetic data using two approaches: cognitive clarification for textual clarity and cognitive balancing for diverse distortion representation. Validation through LLMs and expert evaluations showed that while LLMs classified distortions with explicit markers, they struggled with context-dependent reasoning, where human evaluators demonstrated higher accuracy. KoACD aims to enhance future research on cognitive distortion detection. The dataset and implementation details are publicly accessible.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01475v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although transformers dominate many code-specific tasks, they have significant limitations. This paper explores State Space Models (SSMs) as a promising alternative for code understanding tasks such as retrieval, classification, and clone detection. We introduce CodeSSM, the first SSM-based model trained on code corpora to assess its effectiveness. Our results demonstrate that SSMs are more sample-efficient and can extrapolate to longer contexts beyond the pretraining length. Extensive experiments show that SSMs offer a viable alternative to transformers, addressing several their limitations. Additionally, CodeSSM reduces memory usage by up to 64\% compared to transformers at a context length of 2048, with greater savings as context length grows.</description>

      <title>SD-VSum: A Method and Dataset for Script-Driven Video Summarization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03319v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce the task of script-driven video summarization, which aims to produce a summary of the full-length video by selecting the parts that are most relevant to a user-provided script outlining the visual content of the desired summary. Following, we extend a recently-introduced large-scale dataset for generic video summarization (VideoXum) by producing natural language descriptions of the different human-annotated summaries that are available per video. In this way we make it compatible with the introduced task, since the available triplets of ``video, summary and summary description'' can be used for training a method that is able to produce different summaries for a given video, driven by the provided script about the content of each summary. Finally, we develop a new network architecture for script-driven video summarization (SD-VSum), that employs a cross-modal attention mechanism for aligning and fusing information from the visual and text modalities. Our experimental evaluations demonstrate the advanced performance of SD-VSum against SOTA approaches for query-driven and generic (unimodal and multimodal) summarization from the literature, and document its capacity to produce video summaries that are adapted to each user's needs about their content.</description>

      <title>LCES: Zero-shot Automated Essay Scoring via Pairwise Comparisons Using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08498v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled zero-shot automated essay scoring (AES), providing a promising way to reduce the cost and effort of essay scoring in comparison with manual grading. However, most existing zero-shot approaches rely on LLMs to directly generate absolute scores, which often diverge from human evaluations owing to model biases and inconsistent scoring. To address these limitations, we propose LLM-based Comparative Essay Scoring (LCES), a method that formulates AES as a pairwise comparison task. Specifically, we instruct LLMs to judge which of two essays is better, collect many such comparisons, and convert them into continuous scores. Considering that the number of possible comparisons grows quadratically with the number of essays, we improve scalability by employing RankNet to efficiently transform LLM preferences into scalar scores. Experiments using AES benchmark datasets show that LCES outperforms conventional zero-shot methods in accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency. Moreover, LCES is robust across different LLM backbones, highlighting its applicability to real-world zero-shot AES.</description>

      <title>Creating General User Models from Computer Use</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10831v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Human-computer interaction has long imagined technology that understands us-from our preferences and habits, to the timing and purpose of our everyday actions. Yet current user models remain fragmented, narrowly tailored to specific apps, and incapable of the flexible reasoning required to fulfill these visions. This paper presents an architecture for a general user model (GUM) that learns about you by observing any interaction you have with your computer. The GUM takes as input any unstructured observation of a user (e.g., device screenshots) and constructs confidence-weighted propositions that capture user knowledge and preferences. GUMs can infer that a user is preparing for a wedding they're attending from messages with a friend. Or recognize that a user is struggling with a collaborator's feedback on a draft by observing multiple stalled edits and a switch to reading related work. GUMs introduce an architecture that infers new propositions about a user from multimodal observations, retrieves related propositions for context, and continuously revises existing propositions. To illustrate the breadth of applications that GUMs enable, we demonstrate how they augment chat-based assistants with context, manage OS notifications to selectively surface important information, and enable interactive agents that adapt to preferences across apps. We also instantiate proactive assistants (GUMBOs) that discover and execute useful suggestions on a user's behalf using their GUM. In our evaluations, we find that GUMs make calibrated and accurate inferences about users, and that assistants built on GUMs proactively identify and perform actions that users wouldn't think to request explicitly. Altogether, GUMs introduce methods that leverage multimodal models to understand unstructured context, enabling long-standing visions of HCI and entirely new interactive systems that anticipate user needs.</description>

      <title>X2C: A Dataset Featuring Nuanced Facial Expressions for Realistic Humanoid Imitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11146v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ability to imitate realistic facial expressions is essential for humanoid robots engaged in affective human-robot communication. However, the lack of datasets containing diverse humanoid facial expressions with proper annotations hinders progress in realistic humanoid facial expression imitation. To address these challenges, we introduce X2C (Anything to Control), a dataset featuring nuanced facial expressions for realistic humanoid imitation. With X2C, we contribute: 1) a high-quality, high-diversity, large-scale dataset comprising 100,000 (image, control value) pairs. Each image depicts a humanoid robot displaying a diverse range of facial expressions, annotated with 30 control values representing the ground-truth expression configuration; 2) X2CNet, a novel human-to-humanoid facial expression imitation framework that learns the correspondence between nuanced humanoid expressions and their underlying control values from X2C. It enables facial expression imitation in the wild for different human performers, providing a baseline for the imitation task, showcasing the potential value of our dataset; 3) real-world demonstrations on a physical humanoid robot, highlighting its capability to advance realistic humanoid facial expression imitation.

      <title>Improving Medium Range Severe Weather Prediction through Transformer Post-processing of AI Weather Forecasts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11750v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Improving the skill of medium-range (3-8 day) severe weather prediction is crucial for mitigating societal impacts. This study introduces a novel approach leveraging decoder-only transformer networks to post-process AI-based weather forecasts, specifically from the Pangu-Weather model, for improved severe weather guidance. Unlike traditional post-processing methods that use a dense neural network to predict the probability of severe weather using discrete forecast samples, our method treats forecast lead times as sequential ``tokens'', enabling the transformer to learn complex temporal relationships within the evolving atmospheric state. We compare this approach against post-processing of the Global Forecast System (GFS) using both a traditional dense neural network and our transformer, as well as configurations that exclude convective parameters to fairly evaluate the impact of using the Pangu-Weather AI model. Results demonstrate that the transformer-based post-processing significantly enhances forecast skill compared to dense neural networks. Furthermore, AI-driven forecasts, particularly Pangu-Weather initialized from high resolution analysis, exhibit superior performance to GFS in the medium-range, even without explicit convective parameters. Our approach offers improved accuracy, and reliability, which also provides interpretability through feature attribution analysis, advancing medium-range severe weather prediction capabilities.</description>

      <title>LightRetriever: A LLM-based Text Retrieval Architecture with Extremely Faster Query Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12260v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs)-based text retrieval retrieves documents relevant to search queries based on vector similarities. Documents are pre-encoded offline, while queries arrive in real-time, necessitating an efficient online query encoder. Although LLMs significantly enhance retrieval capabilities, serving deeply parameterized LLMs slows down query inference throughput and increases demands for online deployment resources. In this paper, we propose LightRetriever, a novel LLM-based retriever with extremely lightweight query encoders. Our method retains a full-sized LLM for document encoding, but reduces the workload of query encoding to no more than an embedding lookup. Compared to serving a full LLM on an A800 GPU, our method achieves over 1000x speedup in query encoding and over 10x increase in end-to-end retrieval throughput. Extensive experiments on large-scale retrieval benchmarks show that LightRetriever generalizes well across diverse tasks, maintaining an average of 95% retrieval performance.</description>

      <title>R3: Robust Rubric-Agnostic Reward Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13388v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reward models are essential for aligning language model outputs with human preferences, yet existing approaches often lack both controllability and interpretability. These models are typically optimized for narrow objectives, limiting their generalizability to broader downstream tasks. Moreover, their scalar outputs are difficult to interpret without contextual reasoning. To address these limitations, we introduce $\shortmethodname$, a novel reward modeling framework that is rubric-agnostic, generalizable across evaluation dimensions, and provides interpretable, reasoned score assignments. $\shortmethodname$ enables more transparent and flexible evaluation of language models, supporting robust alignment with diverse human values and use cases. Our models, data, and code are available as open source at https://github.com/rubricreward/r3.</description>

      <title>CIE: Controlling Language Model Text Generations Using Continuous Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13448v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Aligning language models (LMs) with user intent is becoming increasingly relevant to enhance user experience. This calls for designing methods that can allow users to control the properties of the language that LMs generate, for example, controlling the length of the generation or the complexity of the language that gets chosen. Most existing work attempts to integrate users' control by conditioning LM generations on natural language prompts or discrete control signals, which are often brittle and hard to scale. In this work, we are interested in continuous control signals, ones that exist along a spectrum that can't easily be captured in a natural language prompt or via existing techniques in conditional generation. Through a case study in controlling the precise response-length of generations, we demonstrate how an LM can be finetuned to expect a control vector that is interpolated between a "low" and a "high" token embedding. Our method more reliably exerts response-length control than in-context learning methods or fine-tuning methods that represent the control signal as a discrete signal.</description>

      <title>EmoGist: Efficient In-Context Learning for Visual Emotion Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14660v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce EmoGist, a training-free, in-context learning method for performing visual emotion classification with LVLMs. The key intuition of our approach is that context-dependent definition of emotion labels could allow more accurate predictions of emotions, as the ways in which emotions manifest within images are highly context dependent and nuanced. EmoGist pre-generates multiple descriptions of emotion labels, by analyzing the clusters of example images belonging to each label. At test time, we retrieve a version of description based on the cosine similarity of test image to cluster centroids, and feed it together with the test image to a fast LVLM for classification. Through our experiments, we show that EmoGist allows up to 12 points improvement in micro F1 scores with the multi-label Memotion dataset, and up to 8 points in macro F1 in the multi-class FI dataset.</description>

      <title>The Pursuit of Empathy: Evaluating Small Language Models for PTSD Dialogue Support</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15065v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the capacity of small language models (0.5B-5B parameters) to generate empathetic responses for individuals with PTSD. We introduce Trauma-Informed Dialogue for Empathy (TIDE), a novel dataset comprising 10,000 two-turn conversations across 500 diverse, clinically-grounded PTSD personas (https://huggingface.co/datasets/yenopoya/TIDE). Using frontier model outputs as ground truth, we evaluate eight small LLMs in zero-shot settings and after fine-tuning. Fine-tuning enhances empathetic capabilities, improving cosine similarity and perceived empathy, although gains vary across emotional scenarios and smaller models exhibit a "knowledge transfer ceiling." As expected, Claude Sonnet 3.5 consistently outperforms all models, but surprisingly, the smaller models often approach human-rated empathy levels. Demographic analyses showed that older adults favored responses that validated distress before offering support (p = .004), while graduate-educated users preferred emotionally layered replies in specific scenarios. Gender-based differences were minimal (p &gt; 0.15), suggesting the feasibility of broadly empathetic model designs. This work offers insights into building resource-efficient, emotionally intelligent systems for mental health support.</description>

      <title>A Risk Ontology for Evaluating AI-Powered Psychotherapy Virtual Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15108v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Intelligent Virtual Agents acting as psychotherapists presents significant opportunities for expanding mental healthcare access. However, their deployment has also been linked to serious adverse outcomes, including user harm and suicide, facilitated by a lack of standardized evaluation methodologies capable of capturing the nuanced risks of therapeutic interaction. Current evaluation techniques lack the sensitivity to detect subtle changes in patient cognition and behavior during therapy sessions that may lead to subsequent decompensation. We introduce a novel risk ontology specifically designed for the systematic evaluation of conversational AI psychotherapists. Developed through an iterative process including review of the psychotherapy risk literature, qualitative interviews with clinical and legal experts, and alignment with established clinical criteria (e.g., DSM-5) and existing assessment tools (e.g., NEQ, UE-ATR), the ontology aims to provide a structured approach to identifying and assessing user/patient harms. We provide a high-level overview of this ontology, detailing its grounding, and discuss potential use cases. We discuss four use cases in detail: monitoring real user interactions, evaluation with simulated patients, benchmarking and comparative analysis, and identifying unexpected outcomes. The proposed ontology offers a foundational step towards establishing safer and more responsible innovation in the domain of AI-driven mental health support.</description>

      <title>DisastIR: A Comprehensive Information Retrieval Benchmark for Disaster Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15856v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Effective disaster management requires timely access to accurate and contextually relevant information. Existing Information Retrieval (IR) benchmarks, however, focus primarily on general or specialized domains, such as medicine or finance, neglecting the unique linguistic complexity and diverse information needs encountered in disaster management scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce DisastIR, the first comprehensive IR evaluation benchmark specifically tailored for disaster management. DisastIR comprises 9,600 diverse user queries and more than 1.3 million labeled query-passage pairs, covering 48 distinct retrieval tasks derived from six search intents and eight general disaster categories that include 301 specific event types. Our evaluations of 30 state-of-the-art retrieval models demonstrate significant performance variances across tasks, with no single model excelling universally. Furthermore, comparative analyses reveal significant performance gaps between general-domain and disaster management-specific tasks, highlighting the necessity of disaster management-specific benchmarks for guiding IR model selection to support effective decision-making in disaster management scenarios. All source codes and DisastIR are available at https://github.com/KaiYin97/Disaster_IR.</description>

      <title>Runaway is Ashamed, But Helpful: On the Early-Exit Behavior of Large Language Model-based Agents in Embodied Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17616v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Agents powered by large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong planning and decision-making capabilities in complex embodied environments. However, such agents often suffer from inefficiencies in multi-turn interactions, frequently trapped in repetitive loops or issuing ineffective commands, leading to redundant computational overhead. Instead of relying solely on learning from trajectories, we take a first step toward exploring the early-exit behavior for LLM-based agents. We propose two complementary approaches: 1. an $\textbf{intrinsic}$ method that injects exit instructions during generation, and 2. an $\textbf{extrinsic}$ method that verifies task completion to determine when to halt an agent's trial. To evaluate early-exit mechanisms, we introduce two metrics: one measures the reduction of $\textbf{redundant steps}$ as a positive effect, and the other evaluates $\textbf{progress degradation}$ as a negative effect. Experiments with 4 different LLMs across 5 embodied environments show significant efficiency improvements, with only minor drops in agent performance. We also validate a practical strategy where a stronger agent assists after an early-exit agent, achieving better performance with the same total steps. We will release our code to support further research.</description>

      <title>How Is LLM Reasoning Distracted by Irrelevant Context? An Analysis Using a Controlled Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18761v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce Grade School Math with Distracting Context (GSM-DC), a synthetic benchmark to evaluate Large Language Models' (LLMs) reasoning robustness against systematically controlled irrelevant context (IC). GSM-DC constructs symbolic reasoning graphs with precise distractor injections, enabling rigorous, reproducible evaluation. Our experiments demonstrate that LLMs are significantly sensitive to IC, affecting both reasoning path selection and arithmetic accuracy. Additionally, training models with strong distractors improves performance in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution scenarios. We further propose a stepwise tree search guided by a process reward model, which notably enhances robustness in out-of-distribution conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19086v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We tackle the challenges of synthesizing versatile, physically simulated human motions for full-body object manipulation. Unlike prior methods that are focused on detailed motion tracking, trajectory following, or teleoperation, our framework enables users to specify versatile high-level objectives such as target object poses or body poses. To achieve this, we introduce MaskedManipulator, a generative control policy distilled from a tracking controller trained on large-scale human motion capture data. This two-stage learning process allows the system to perform complex interaction behaviors, while providing intuitive user control over both character and object motions. MaskedManipulator produces goal-directed manipulation behaviors that expand the scope of interactive animation systems beyond task-specific solutions.</description>

      <title>ReasonPlan: Unified Scene Prediction and Decision Reasoning for Closed-loop Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20024v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Due to the powerful vision-language reasoning and generalization abilities, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have garnered significant attention in the field of end-to-end (E2E) autonomous driving. However, their application to closed-loop systems remains underexplored, and current MLLM-based methods have not shown clear superiority to mainstream E2E imitation learning approaches. In this work, we propose ReasonPlan, a novel MLLM fine-tuning framework designed for closed-loop driving through holistic reasoning with a self-supervised Next Scene Prediction task and supervised Decision Chain-of-Thought process. This dual mechanism encourages the model to align visual representations with actionable driving context, while promoting interpretable and causally grounded decision making. We curate a planning-oriented decision reasoning dataset, namely PDR, comprising 210k diverse and high-quality samples. Our method outperforms the mainstream E2E imitation learning method by a large margin of 19% L2 and 16.1 driving score on Bench2Drive benchmark. Furthermore, ReasonPlan demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization on unseen DOS benchmark, highlighting its adaptability in handling zero-shot corner cases. Code and dataset will be found in https://github.com/Liuxueyi/ReasonPlan.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models Meet Knowledge Graphs for Question Answering: Synthesis and Opportunities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20099v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on question-answering (QA) tasks because of their superior capabilities in natural language understanding and generation. However, LLM-based QA struggles with complex QA tasks due to poor reasoning capacity, outdated knowledge, and hallucinations. Several recent works synthesize LLMs and knowledge graphs (KGs) for QA to address the above challenges. In this survey, we propose a new structured taxonomy that categorizes the methodology of synthesizing LLMs and KGs for QA according to the categories of QA and the KG's role when integrating with LLMs. We systematically survey state-of-the-art methods in synthesizing LLMs and KGs for QA and compare and analyze these approaches in terms of strength, limitations, and KG requirements. We then align the approaches with QA and discuss how these approaches address the main challenges of different complex QA. Finally, we summarize the advancements, evaluation metrics, and benchmark datasets and highlight open challenges and opportunities.</description>

      <title>Does quantization affect models' performance on long-context tasks?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20276v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) now support context windows exceeding 128K tokens, but this comes with significant memory requirements and high inference latency. Quantization can mitigate these costs, but may degrade performance. In this work, we present the first systematic evaluation of quantized LLMs on tasks with long inputs (&gt;64K tokens) and long-form outputs. Our evaluation spans 9.7K test examples, five quantization methods (FP8, GPTQ-int8, AWQ-int4, GPTQ-int4, BNB-nf4), and five models (Llama-3.1 8B and 70B; Qwen-2.5 7B, 32B, and 72B). We find that, on average, 8-bit quantization preserves accuracy (~0.8% drop), whereas 4-bit methods lead to substantial losses, especially for tasks involving long-context inputs (drops of up to 59%). This degradation tends to worsen when the input is in a language other than English. Crucially, the effects of quantization depend heavily on the quantization method, model, and task. For instance, while Qwen-2.5 72B remains robust under BNB-nf4, Llama-3.1 70B experiences a 32% performance drop on the same task. These findings highlight the importance of a careful, task-specific evaluation before deploying quantized LLMs, particularly in long-context scenarios and for languages other than English.</description>

      <title>How Much Do Large Language Models Know about Human Motion? A Case Study in 3D Avatar Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21531v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the human motion knowledge of Large Language Models (LLMs) through 3D avatar control. Given a motion instruction, we prompt LLMs to first generate a high-level movement plan with consecutive steps (High-level Planning), then specify body part positions in each step (Low-level Planning), which we linearly interpolate into avatar animations. Using 20 representative motion instructions that cover fundamental movements and balance body part usage, we conduct comprehensive evaluations, including human and automatic scoring of both high-level movement plans and generated animations, as well as automatic comparison with oracle positions in low-level planning. Our findings show that LLMs are strong at interpreting high-level body movements but struggle with precise body part positioning. While decomposing motion queries into atomic components improves planning, LLMs face challenges in multi-step movements involving high-degree-of-freedom body parts. Furthermore, LLMs provide reasonable approximations for general spatial descriptions, but fall short in handling precise spatial specifications. Notably, LLMs demonstrate promise in conceptualizing creative motions and distinguishing culturally specific motion patterns.</description>

      <title>Fluent but Foreign: Even Regional LLMs Lack Cultural Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21548v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are used worldwide, yet exhibit Western cultural tendencies. Many countries are now building ``regional'' LLMs, but it remains unclear whether they reflect local values and practices or merely speak local languages. Using India as a case study, we evaluate six Indic and six global LLMs on two dimensions -- values and practices -- grounded in nationally representative surveys and community-sourced QA datasets. Across tasks, Indic models do not align better with Indian norms than global models; in fact, a U.S. respondent is a closer proxy for Indian values than any Indic model. Prompting and regional fine-tuning fail to recover alignment and can even degrade existing knowledge. We attribute this to scarce culturally grounded data, especially for pretraining. We position cultural evaluation as a first-class requirement alongside multilingual benchmarks and offer a reusable, community-grounded methodology. We call for native, community-authored corpora and thick x wide evaluations to build truly sovereign LLMs.</description>

      <title>Less is More: Unlocking Specialization of Time Series Foundation Models via Structured Pruning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23195v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scaling laws motivate the development of Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) that pre-train vast parameters and achieve remarkable zero-shot forecasting performance. Surprisingly, even after fine-tuning, TSFMs cannot consistently outperform smaller, specialized models trained on full-shot downstream data. A key question is how to realize effective adaptation of TSFMs for a target forecasting task. Through empirical studies on various TSFMs, the pre-trained models often exhibit inherent sparsity and redundancy in computation, suggesting that TSFMs have learned to activate task-relevant network substructures to accommodate diverse forecasting tasks. To preserve this valuable prior knowledge, we propose a structured pruning method to regularize the subsequent fine-tuning process by focusing it on a more relevant and compact parameter space. Extensive experiments on seven TSFMs and six benchmarks demonstrate that fine-tuning a smaller, pruned TSFM significantly improves forecasting performance compared to fine-tuning original models. This prune-then-finetune paradigm often enables TSFMs to achieve state-of-the-art performance and surpass strong specialized baselines.

      <title>From Chat Logs to Collective Insights: Aggregative Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23765v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conversational agents powered by large language models (LLMs) are rapidly becoming integral to our daily interactions, generating unprecedented amounts of conversational data. Such datasets offer a powerful lens into societal interests, trending topics, and collective concerns. Yet, existing approaches typically treat these interactions as independent and miss critical insights that could emerge from aggregating and reasoning across large-scale conversation logs. In this paper, we introduce Aggregative Question Answering, a novel task requiring models to reason explicitly over thousands of user-chatbot interactions to answer aggregative queries, such as identifying emerging concerns among specific demographics. To enable research in this direction, we construct a benchmark, WildChat-AQA, comprising 6,027 aggregative questions derived from 182,330 real-world chatbot conversations. Experiments show that existing methods either struggle to reason effectively or incur prohibitive computational costs, underscoring the need for new approaches capable of extracting collective insights from large-scale conversational data.</description>

      <title>Cross-Attention Speculative Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24544v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Speculative decoding (SD) is a widely adopted approach for accelerating inference in large language models (LLMs), particularly when the draft and target models are well aligned. However, state-of-the-art SD methods typically rely on tightly coupled, self-attention-based Transformer decoders, often augmented with auxiliary pooling or fusion layers. This coupling makes them increasingly complex and harder to generalize across different models. We present Budget EAGLE (Beagle), the first, to our knowledge, cross-attention-based Transformer decoder SD model that achieves performance on par with leading self-attention SD models (EAGLE-v2) while eliminating the need for pooling or auxiliary components, simplifying the architecture, improving training efficiency, and maintaining stable memory usage during training-time simulation. To enable effective training of this novel architecture, we propose Two-Stage Block-Attention Training, a new method that achieves training stability and convergence efficiency in block-level attention scenarios. Extensive experiments across multiple LLMs and datasets show that Beagle achieves competitive inference speedups and higher training efficiency than EAGLE-v2, offering a strong alternative for architectures in speculative decoding.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Graph Neural Networks and Dataset for Robust Olfactory Navigation in Hazard Robotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00455v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Navigation by scent is a capability in robotic systems that is rising in demand. However, current methods often suffer from ambiguities, particularly when robots misattribute odours to incorrect objects due to limitations in olfactory datasets and sensor resolutions. To address challenges in olfactory navigation, we introduce a multimodal olfaction dataset along with a novel machine learning method using diffusion-based molecular generation that can be used by itself or with automated olfactory dataset construction pipelines. This generative process of our diffusion model expands the chemical space beyond the limitations of both current olfactory datasets and training methods, enabling the identification of potential odourant molecules not previously documented. The generated molecules can then be more accurately validated using advanced olfactory sensors, enabling them to detect more compounds and inform better hardware design. By integrating visual analysis, language processing, and molecular generation, our framework enhances the ability of olfaction-vision models on robots to accurately associate odours with their correct sources, thereby improving navigation and decision-making through better sensor selection for a target compound in critical applications such as explosives detection, narcotics screening, and search and rescue. Our methodology represents a foundational advancement in the field of artificial olfaction, offering a scalable solution to challenges posed by limited olfactory data and sensor ambiguities. Code, models, and data are made available to the community at: https://huggingface.co/datasets/kordelfrance/olfaction-vision-language-dataset.</description>

      <title>ESGenius: Benchmarking LLMs on Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) and Sustainability Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01646v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce ESGenius, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating and enhancing the proficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs) in Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) and sustainability-focused question answering. ESGenius comprises two key components: (i) ESGenius-QA, a collection of 1,136 Multiple-Choice Questions (MCQs) generated by LLMs and rigorously validated by domain experts, covering a broad range of ESG pillars and sustainability topics. Each question is systematically linked to its corresponding source text, enabling transparent evaluation and supporting Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods; and (ii) ESGenius-Corpus, a meticulously curated repository of 231 foundational frameworks, standards, reports, and recommendation documents from 7 authoritative sources. Moreover, to fully assess the capabilities and adaptation potential of LLMs, we implement a rigorous two-stage evaluation protocol -- Zero-Shot and RAG. Extensive experiments across 50 LLMs (0.5B to 671B) demonstrate that state-of-the-art models achieve only moderate performance in zero-shot settings, with accuracies around 55--70%, highlighting a significant knowledge gap for LLMs in this specialized, interdisciplinary domain. However, models employing RAG demonstrate significant performance improvements, particularly for smaller models. For example, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-14B improves from 63.82% (zero-shot) to 80.46% with RAG. These results demonstrate the necessity of grounding responses in authoritative sources for enhanced ESG understanding. To the best of our knowledge, ESGenius is the first comprehensive QA benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate LLMs on ESG and sustainability knowledge, providing a critical tool to advance trustworthy AI in this vital domain.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models via Entity-Centric Multimodal Preference Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04039v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across multiple tasks. However, their trustworthiness is often challenged by hallucinations, which can be attributed to the modality misalignment and the inherent hallucinations of their underlying Large Language Models (LLMs) backbone. Existing preference alignment methods focus on aligning model responses with human preferences while neglecting image-text modality alignment, resulting in over-reliance on LLMs and hallucinations. In this paper, we propose Entity-centric Multimodal Preference Optimization (EMPO), which achieves enhanced modality alignment compared to existing human preference alignment methods. Besides, to overcome the scarcity of high-quality multimodal preference data, we utilize open-source instruction datasets to automatically construct high-quality preference data across three aspects: image, instruction, and response. Experiments on two human preference datasets and five multimodal hallucination benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of EMPO, e.g., reducing hallucination rates by 85.9\% on Object-HalBench and 49.8\% on MM-HalBench.</description>

      <title>Were Residual Penalty and Neural Operators All We Needed for Solving Optimal Control Problems?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04742v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural networks have been used to solve optimal control problems, typically by training neural networks using a combined loss function that considers data, differential equation residuals, and objective costs. We show that including cost functions in the training process is unnecessary, advocating for a simpler architecture and streamlined approach by decoupling the optimal control problem from the training process. Thus, our work shows that a simple neural operator architecture, such as DeepONet, coupled with an unconstrained optimization routine, can solve multiple optimal control problems with a single physics-informed training phase and a subsequent optimization phase. We achieve this by adding a penalty term based on the differential equation residual to the cost function and computing gradients with respect to the control using automatic differentiation through the trained neural operator within an iterative optimization routine. Our results show acceptable accuracy for practical applications and potential computational savings for more complex and higher-dimensional problems.</description>

Abstract: Research on generative systems in music has seen considerable attention and growth in recent years. A variety of attempts have been made to systematically evaluate such systems.
  We present an interdisciplinary review of the common evaluation targets, methodologies, and metrics for the evaluation of both system output and model use, covering subjective and objective approaches, qualitative and quantitative approaches, as well as empirical and computational methods. We examine the benefits and limitations of these approaches from a musicological, an engineering, and an HCI perspective.</description>

      <title>Time to Talk: LLM Agents for Asynchronous Group Communication in Mafia Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05309v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: LLMs are used predominantly in synchronous communication, where a human user and a model communicate in alternating turns. In contrast, many real-world settings are asynchronous. For example, in group chats, online team meetings, or social games, there is no inherent notion of turns. In this work, we develop an adaptive asynchronous LLM agent consisting of two modules: a generator that decides what to say, and a scheduler that decides when to say it. To evaluate our agent, we collect a unique dataset of online Mafia games, where our agent plays with human participants. Overall, our agent performs on par with human players, both in game performance metrics and in its ability to blend in with the other human players. Our analysis shows that the agent's behavior in deciding when to speak closely mirrors human patterns, although differences emerge in message content. We make all of our code and data publicly available. This work paves the way for integration of LLMs into realistic human group settings, from assistance in team discussions to educational and professional environments where complex social dynamics must be navigated.</description>

      <title>Speech Recognition on TV Series with Video-guided Post-ASR Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07323v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) has achieved remarkable success with deep learning, driving advancements in conversational artificial intelligence, media transcription, and assistive technologies. However, ASR systems still struggle in complex environments such as TV series, where multiple speakers, overlapping speech, domain-specific terminology, and long-range contextual dependencies pose significant challenges to transcription accuracy. Existing approaches fail to explicitly leverage the rich temporal and contextual information available in the video. To address this limitation, we propose a Video-Guided Post-ASR Correction (VPC) framework that uses a Video-Large Multimodal Model (VLMM) to capture video context and refine ASR outputs. Evaluations on a TV-series benchmark show that our method consistently improves transcription accuracy in complex multimedia environments.</description>

      <title>ReasonMed: A 370K Multi-Agent Generated Dataset for Advancing Medical Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09513v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reasoning-based large language models have excelled in mathematics and programming, yet their potential in knowledge-intensive medical question answering remains underexplored and insufficiently validated in clinical contexts. To bridge this gap, we introduce ReasonMed, the largest medical reasoning dataset to date, comprising 370k high-quality examples distilled from 1.75 million initial reasoning paths generated by complementary LLMs and curated through a cost-efficient easy-medium-difficult (EMD) pipeline. ReasonMed is built through a multi-agent generation, verification, and refinement process, in which an Error Refiner improves reasoning paths by correcting error-prone steps identified by a verifier. Using ReasonMed, we investigate effective strategies for training medical reasoning models and find that integrating detailed CoT reasoning with concise answer summaries yields the most robust fine-tuning results. Models trained on ReasonMed set a new benchmark: ReasonMed-7B surpasses the prior best sub-10B models by 4.17% and even exceeds LLaMA3.1-70B on PubMedQA by 4.60%. When scaled to ReasonMed-14B, it remains highly competitive, underscoring consistent scaling potential. The codes and datasets are available at https://github.com/YuSun-Work/ReasonMed.</description>

Abstract: Handwritten text recognition aims to convert visual input into machine-readable text, and it remains challenging due to the evolving and context-dependent nature of handwriting. Character sets change over time, and character frequency distributions shift across historical periods or regions, often causing models trained on broad, heterogeneous corpora to underperform on specific subsets. To tackle this, we propose a novel loss function that incorporates the Wasserstein distance between the character frequency distribution of the predicted text and a target distribution empirically derived from training data. By penalizing divergence from expected distributions, our approach enhances both accuracy and robustness under temporal and contextual intra-dataset shifts. Furthermore, we demonstrate that character distribution alignment can also improve existing models at inference time without requiring retraining by integrating it as a scoring function in a guided decoding scheme. Experimental results across multiple datasets and architectures confirm the effectiveness of our method in boosting generalization and performance.

      <title>Breaking the Reviewer: Assessing the Vulnerability of Large Language Models in Automated Peer Review Under Textual Adversarial Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11113v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Peer review is essential for maintaining academic quality, but the increasing volume of submissions places a significant burden on reviewers. Large language models (LLMs) offer potential assistance in this process, yet their susceptibility to textual adversarial attacks raises reliability concerns. This paper investigates the robustness of LLMs used as automated reviewers in the presence of such attacks. We focus on three key questions: (1) The effectiveness of LLMs in generating reviews compared to human reviewers. (2) The impact of adversarial attacks on the reliability of LLM-generated reviews. (3) Challenges and potential mitigation strategies for LLM-based review. Our evaluation reveals significant vulnerabilities, as text manipulations can distort LLM assessments. We offer a comprehensive evaluation of LLM performance in automated peer reviewing and analyze its robustness against adversarial attacks. Our findings emphasize the importance of addressing adversarial risks to ensure AI strengthens, rather than compromises, the integrity of scholarly communication.</description>

      <title>DISCO: Mitigating Bias in Deep Learning with Conditional Distance Correlation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11653v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dataset bias often leads deep learning models to exploit spurious correlations instead of task-relevant signals. We introduce the Standard Anti-Causal Model (SAM), a unifying causal framework that characterizes bias mechanisms and yields a conditional independence criterion for causal stability. Building on this theory, we propose DISCO$_m$ and sDISCO, efficient and scalable estimators of conditional distance correlation that enable independence regularization in black-box models. Across five diverse datasets, our methods consistently outperform or are competitive in existing bias mitigation approaches, while requiring fewer hyperparameters and scaling seamlessly to multi-bias scenarios. This work bridges causal theory and practical deep learning, providing both a principled foundation and effective tools for robust prediction. Source Code: https://github.com/***.</description>

      <title>See What I Mean? CUE: A Cognitive Model of Understanding Explanations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14775v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As machine learning systems increasingly inform critical decisions, the need for human-understandable explanations grows. Current evaluations of Explainable AI (XAI) often prioritize technical fidelity over cognitive accessibility which critically affects users, in particular those with visual impairments. We propose CUE, a model for Cognitive Understanding of Explanations, linking explanation properties to cognitive sub-processes: legibility (perception), readability (comprehension), and interpretability (interpretation). In a study (N=455) testing heatmaps with varying colormaps (BWR, Cividis, Coolwarm), we found comparable task performance but lower confidence/effort for visually impaired users. Unlike expected, these gaps were not mitigated and sometimes worsened by accessibility-focused color maps like Cividis. These results challenge assumptions about perceptual optimization and support the need for adaptive XAI interfaces. They also validate CUE by demonstrating that altering explanation legibility affects understandability. We contribute: (1) a formalized cognitive model for explanation understanding, (2) an integrated definition of human-centered explanation properties, and (3) empirical evidence motivating accessible, user-tailored XAI.</description>

      <title>MIST: Jailbreaking Black-box Large Language Models via Iterative Semantic Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16792v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite efforts to align large language models (LLMs) with societal and moral values, these models remain susceptible to jailbreak attacks -- methods designed to elicit harmful responses. Jailbreaking black-box LLMs is considered challenging due to the discrete nature of token inputs, restricted access to the target LLM, and limited query budget. To address the issues above, we propose an effective method for jailbreaking black-box large language Models via Iterative Semantic Tuning, named MIST. MIST enables attackers to iteratively refine prompts that preserve the original semantic intent while inducing harmful content. Specifically, to balance semantic similarity with computational efficiency, MIST incorporates two key strategies: sequential synonym search, and its advanced version -- order-determining optimization. We conduct extensive experiments on two datasets using two open-source and four closed-source models. Results show that MIST achieves competitive attack success rate, relatively low query count, and fair transferability, outperforming or matching state-of-the-art jailbreak methods. Additionally, we conduct analysis on computational efficiency to validate the practical viability of MIST.</description>

      <title>SUA: Stealthy Multimodal Large Language Model Unlearning Attack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17265v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) trained on massive data may memorize sensitive personal information and photos, posing serious privacy risks. To mitigate this, MLLM unlearning methods are proposed, which fine-tune MLLMs to reduce the ``forget'' sensitive information. However, it remains unclear whether the knowledge has been truly forgotten or just hidden in the model. Therefore, we propose to study a novel problem of LLM unlearning attack, which aims to recover the unlearned knowledge of an unlearned LLM. To achieve the goal, we propose a novel framework Stealthy Unlearning Attack (SUA) framework that learns a universal noise pattern. When applied to input images, this noise can trigger the model to reveal unlearned content. While pixel-level perturbations may be visually subtle, they can be detected in the semantic embedding space, making such attacks vulnerable to potential defenses. To improve stealthiness, we introduce an embedding alignment loss that minimizes the difference between the perturbed and denoised image embeddings, ensuring the attack is semantically unnoticeable. Experimental results show that SUA can effectively recover unlearned information from MLLMs. Furthermore, the learned noise generalizes well: a single perturbation trained on a subset of samples can reveal forgotten content in unseen images. This indicates that knowledge reappearance is not an occasional failure, but a consistent behavior.</description>

      <title>Beyond Autocomplete: Designing CopilotLens Towards Transparent and Explainable AI Coding Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20062v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: AI-powered code assistants are widely used to generate code completions, significantly boosting developer productivity. However, these tools typically present suggestions without explaining their rationale, leaving their decision-making process inscrutable. This opacity hinders developers' ability to critically evaluate outputs, form accurate mental models, and calibrate trust in the system. To address this, we introduce CopilotLens, a novel interactive framework that reframes code completion from a simple suggestion into a transparent, explainable interaction. CopilotLens operates as an explanation layer that reconstructs the AI agent's "thought process" through a dynamic, two-level interface. The tool aims to surface both high-level code changes and the specific codebase context influences. This paper presents the design and rationale of CopilotLens, offering a concrete framework and articulating expectations on deepening comprehension and calibrated trust, which we plan to evaluate in subsequent work.</description>

      <title>ClusterRCA: An End-to-End Approach for Network Fault Localization and Classification for HPC System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20673v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Network failure diagnosis is challenging yet critical for high-performance computing (HPC) systems. Existing methods cannot be directly applied to HPC scenarios due to data heterogeneity and lack of accuracy. This paper proposes a novel framework, called ClusterRCA, to localize culprit nodes and determine failure types by leveraging multimodal data. ClusterRCA extracts features from topologically connected network interface controller (NIC) pairs to analyze the diverse, multimodal data in HPC systems. To accurately localize culprit nodes and determine failure types, ClusterRCA combines classifier-based and graph-based approaches. A failure graph is constructed based on the output of the state classifier, and then it performs a customized random walk on the graph to localize the root cause. Experiments on datasets collected by a top-tier global HPC device vendor show ClusterRCA achieves high accuracy in diagnosing network failure for HPC systems. ClusterRCA also maintains robust performance across different application scenarios.</description>

      <title>Progressive Size-Adaptive Federated Learning: A Comprehensive Framework for Heterogeneous Multi-Modal Data Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20685v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a transformative paradigm for distributed machine learning while preserving data privacy. However, existing approaches predominantly focus on model heterogeneity and aggregation techniques, largely overlooking the fundamental impact of dataset size characteristics on federated training dynamics. This paper introduces Size-Based Adaptive Federated Learning (SAFL), a novel progressive training framework that systematically organizes federated learning based on dataset size characteristics across heterogeneous multi-modal data. Our comprehensive experimental evaluation across 13 diverse datasets spanning 7 modalities (vision, text, time series, audio, sensor, medical vision, and multimodal) reveals critical insights: 1) an optimal dataset size range of 1000-1500 samples for federated learning effectiveness; 2) a clear modality performance hierarchy with structured data (time series, sensor) significantly outperforming unstructured data (text, multimodal); and 3) systematic performance degradation for large datasets exceeding 2000 samples. SAFL achieves an average accuracy of 87.68% across all datasets, with structured data modalities reaching 99%+ accuracy. The framework demonstrates superior communication efficiency, reducing total data transfer to 7.38 GB across 558 communications while maintaining high performance. Our real-time monitoring framework provides unprecedented insights into system resource utilization, network efficiency, and training dynamics. This work fills critical gaps in understanding how data characteristics should drive federated learning strategies, providing both theoretical insights and practical guidance for real-world FL deployments in neural network and learning systems.</description>

      <title>DBConformer: Dual-Branch Convolutional Transformer for EEG Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21140v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) transform spontaneous/evoked neural activity into control commands for external communication. While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) remain the mainstream backbone for EEG decoding, their inherently short receptive field makes it difficult to capture long-range temporal dependencies and global inter-channel relationships. Recent CNN-Transformer (Conformer) hybrids partially address this issue, but most adopt a serial design, resulting in suboptimal integration of local and global features, and often overlook explicit channel-wise modeling. To address these limitations, we propose DBConformer, a dual-branch convolutional Transformer network tailored for EEG decoding. It integrates a temporal Conformer to model long-range temporal dependencies and a spatial Conformer to extract inter-channel interactions, capturing both temporal dynamics and spatial patterns in EEG signals. A lightweight channel attention module further refines spatial representations by assigning data-driven importance to EEG channels. Extensive experiments under four evaluation settings on three paradigms, including motor imagery, seizure detection, and steady-state visual evoked potential, demonstrated that DBConformer consistently outperformed 13 competitive baseline models, with over an eight-fold reduction in parameters than current high-capacity EEG Conformer architecture. Furthermore, the visualization results confirmed that the features extracted by DBConformer are physiologically interpretable and aligned with prior knowledge. The superior performance and interpretability of DBConformer make it reliable for accurate, robust, and explainable EEG decoding.

      <description>arXiv:2506.21532v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: People are increasingly seeking healthcare information from large language models (LLMs) via interactive chatbots, yet the nature and inherent risks of these conversations remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we filter large-scale conversational AI datasets to achieve HealthChat-11K, a curated dataset of 11K real-world conversations composed of 25K user messages. We use HealthChat-11K and a clinician-driven taxonomy for how users interact with LLMs when seeking healthcare information in order to systematically study user interactions across 21 distinct health specialties. Our analysis reveals insights into the nature of how and why users seek health information, such as common interactions, instances of incomplete context, affective behaviors, and interactions (e.g., leading questions) that can induce sycophancy, underscoring the need for improvements in the healthcare support capabilities of LLMs deployed as conversational AI.

      <title>Multi-View Contrastive Learning for Robust Domain Adaptation in Medical Time Series Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22393v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Adapting machine learning models to medical time series across different domains remains a challenge due to complex temporal dependencies and dynamic distribution shifts. Current approaches often focus on isolated feature representations, limiting their ability to fully capture the intricate temporal dynamics necessary for robust domain adaptation. In this work, we propose a novel framework leveraging multi-view contrastive learning to integrate temporal patterns, derivative-based dynamics, and frequency-domain features. Our method employs independent encoders and a hierarchical fusion mechanism to learn feature-invariant representations that are transferable across domains while preserving temporal coherence. Extensive experiments on diverse medical datasets, including electroencephalogram (EEG), electrocardiogram (ECG), and electromyography (EMG) demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in transfer learning tasks. By advancing the robustness and generalizability of machine learning models, our framework offers a practical pathway for deploying reliable AI systems in diverse healthcare settings.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Live Broadcast Engagement: A Multi-modal Approach to Short Video Recommendations Using MMGCN and User Preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23085v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to explore a multi-modal approach to enhancing live broadcast engagement by developing a short video recommendation system that incorporates Multi-modal Graph Convolutional Networks (MMGCN) with user preferences. To provide personalized recommendations tailored to individual interests, the proposed system considers user interaction data, video content features, and contextual information. With the aid of a hybrid approach combining collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques, the system can capture nuanced relationships between users, video attributes, and engagement patterns. Three datasets are used to evaluate the effectiveness of the system: Kwai, TikTok, and MovieLens. Compared to baseline models, such as DeepFM, Wide &amp; Deep, LightGBM, and XGBoost, the proposed MMGCN-based model shows superior performance. A notable feature of the proposed model is that it outperforms all baseline methods in capturing diverse user preferences and making accurate, personalized recommendations, resulting in a Kwai F1 score of 0.574, a Tiktok F1 score of 0.506, and a MovieLens F1 score of 0.197. We emphasize the importance of multi-modal integration and user-centric approaches in advancing recommender systems, emphasizing the role they play in enhancing content discovery and audience interaction on live broadcast platforms.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Student Success with Generative AI: A Monte Carlo Simulation Informed by Systematic Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01062v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The exponential development of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) technologies like ChatGPT has raised increasing curiosity about their use in higher education, specifically with respect to how students view them, make use of them, and the implications for learning outcomes. This paper employs a hybrid methodological approach involving a systematic literature review and simulation-based modeling to explore student perceptions of GenAI use in the context of higher education. A total of nineteen empirical articles from 2023 through 2025 were selected from the PRISMA-based search targeting the Scopus database. Synthesis of emerging patterns from the literature was achieved by thematic categorization. Six of these had enough quantitative information, i.e., item-level means and standard deviations, to permit probabilistic modeling. One dataset, from the resulting subset, was itself selected as a representative case with which to illustrate inverse-variance weighting by Monte Carlo simulation, by virtue of its well-designed Likert scale format and thematic alignment with the use of computing systems by the researcher.
  The simulation provided a composite "Success Score" forecasting the strength of the relationship between student perceptions and learning achievements. Findings reveal that attitude factors concerned with usability and real-world usefulness are significantly better predictors of positive learning achievement than affective or trust-based factors. Such an interdisciplinary perspective provides a unique means of linking thematic results with predictive modelling, resonating with longstanding controversies about the proper use of GenAI tools within the university.</description>

      <title>Resolving Turbulent Magnetohydrodynamics: A Hybrid Operator-Diffusion Framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02106v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a hybrid machine learning framework that combines Physics-Informed Neural Operators (PINOs) with score-based generative diffusion models to simulate the full spatio-temporal evolution of two-dimensional, incompressible, resistive magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence across a broad range of Reynolds numbers ($\mathrm{Re}$). The framework leverages the equation-constrained generalization capabilities of PINOs to predict coherent, low-frequency dynamics, while a conditional diffusion model stochastically corrects high-frequency residuals, enabling accurate modeling of fully developed turbulence. Trained on a comprehensive ensemble of high-fidelity simulations with $\mathrm{Re} \in \{100, 250, 500, 750, 1000, 3000, 10000\}$, the approach achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in regimes previously inaccessible to deterministic surrogates. At $\mathrm{Re}=1000$ and $3000$, the model faithfully reconstructs the full spectral energy distributions of both velocity and magnetic fields late into the simulation, capturing non-Gaussian statistics, intermittent structures, and cross-field correlations with high fidelity. At extreme turbulence levels ($\mathrm{Re}=10000$), it remains the first surrogate capable of recovering the high-wavenumber evolution of the magnetic field, preserving large-scale morphology and enabling statistically meaningful predictions.</description>

      <title>Advanced Financial Reasoning at Scale: A Comprehensive Evaluation of Large Language Models on CFA Level III</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02954v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As financial institutions increasingly adopt Large Language Models (LLMs), rigorous domain-specific evaluation becomes critical for responsible deployment. This paper presents a comprehensive benchmark evaluating 23 state-of-the-art LLMs on the Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) Level III exam - the gold standard for advanced financial reasoning. We assess both multiple-choice questions (MCQs) and essay-style responses using multiple prompting strategies including Chain-of-Thought and Self-Discover. Our evaluation reveals that leading models demonstrate strong capabilities, with composite scores such as 79.1% (o4-mini) and 77.3% (Gemini 2.5 Flash) on CFA Level III. These results, achieved under a revised, stricter essay grading methodology, indicate significant progress in LLM capabilities for high-stakes financial applications. Our findings provide crucial guidance for practitioners on model selection and highlight remaining challenges in cost-effective deployment and the need for nuanced interpretation of performance against professional benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Interpretability-Aware Pruning for Efficient Medical Image Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08330v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep learning has driven significant advances in medical image analysis, yet its adoption in clinical practice remains constrained by the large size and lack of transparency in modern models. Advances in interpretability techniques such as DL-Backtrace, Layer-wise Relevance Propagation, and Integrated Gradients make it possible to assess the contribution of individual components within neural networks trained on medical imaging tasks. In this work, we introduce an interpretability-guided pruning framework that reduces model complexity while preserving both predictive performance and transparency. By selectively retaining only the most relevant parts of each layer, our method enables targeted compression that maintains clinically meaningful representations. Experiments across multiple medical image classification benchmarks demonstrate that this approach achieves high compression rates with minimal loss in accuracy, paving the way for lightweight, interpretable models suited for real-world deployment in healthcare settings.</description>

      <title>Jailbreak-Tuning: Models Efficiently Learn Jailbreak Susceptibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11630v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: AI systems are rapidly advancing in capability, and frontier model developers broadly acknowledge the need for safeguards against serious misuse. However, this paper demonstrates that fine-tuning, whether via open weights or closed fine-tuning APIs, can produce helpful-only models with safeguards destroyed. In contrast to prior work which is blocked by modern moderation systems or achieved only partial removal of safeguards or degraded output quality, our jailbreak-tuning method teaches models to generate detailed, high-quality responses to arbitrary harmful requests. For example, OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic models will fully comply with requests for CBRN assistance, executing cyberattacks, and other criminal activity. We further show that backdoors can increase not only the stealth but also the severity of attacks. Stronger jailbreak prompts become even more effective in fine-tuning attacks, linking attacks and potentially defenses in the input and weight spaces. Not only are current models vulnerable, more recent ones also appear to be becoming even more vulnerable to these attacks, underscoring the urgent need for tamper-resistant safeguards. Until such safeguards are discovered, companies and policymakers should view the release of any fine-tunable model as simultaneously releasing its evil twin: equally capable as the original model, and usable for any malicious purpose within its capabilities.</description>

      <title>Automating Steering for Safe Multimodal Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13255v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent progress in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has unlocked powerful cross-modal reasoning abilities, but also raised new safety concerns, particularly when faced with adversarial multimodal inputs. To improve the safety of MLLMs during inference, we introduce a modular and adaptive inference-time intervention technology, AutoSteer, without requiring any fine-tuning of the underlying model. AutoSteer incorporates three core components: (1) a novel Safety Awareness Score (SAS) that automatically identifies the most safety-relevant distinctions among the model's internal layers; (2) an adaptive safety prober trained to estimate the likelihood of toxic outputs from intermediate representations; and (3) a lightweight Refusal Head that selectively intervenes to modulate generation when safety risks are detected. Experiments on LLaVA-OV and Chameleon across diverse safety-critical benchmarks demonstrate that AutoSteer significantly reduces the Attack Success Rate (ASR) for textual, visual, and cross-modal threats, while maintaining general abilities. These findings position AutoSteer as a practical, interpretable, and effective framework for safer deployment of multimodal AI systems.</description>

      <title>Latent Policy Steering with Embodiment-Agnostic Pretrained World Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13340v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning visuomotor policies via imitation has proven effective across a wide range of robotic domains. However, the performance of these policies is heavily dependent on the number of training demonstrations, which requires expensive data collection in the real world. In this work, we aim to reduce data collection efforts when learning visuomotor robot policies by leveraging existing or cost-effective data from a wide range of embodiments, such as public robot datasets and the datasets of humans playing with objects (human data from play). Our approach leverages two key insights. First, we use optic flow as an embodiment-agnostic action representation to train a World Model (WM) across multi-embodiment datasets, and finetune it on a small amount of robot data from the target embodiment. Second, we develop a method, Latent Policy Steering (LPS), to improve the output of a behavior-cloned policy by searching in the latent space of the WM for better action sequences. In real world experiments, we observe significant improvements in the performance of policies trained with a small amount of data (over 50% relative improvement with 30 demonstrations and over 20% relative improvement with 50 demonstrations) by combining the policy with a WM pretrained on two thousand episodes sampled from the existing Open X-embodiment dataset across different robots or a cost-effective human dataset from play.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13543v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a framework for dualizing the Kolmogorov structure function $h_x(\alpha)$, which then allows using computable complexity proxies. We establish a mathematical analogy between information-theoretic constructs and statistical mechanics, introducing a suitable partition function and free energy functional. We explicitly prove the Legendre-Fenchel duality between the structure function and free energy, showing detailed balance of the Metropolis kernel, and interpret acceptance probabilities as information-theoretic scattering amplitudes. A susceptibility-like variance of model complexity is shown to peak precisely at loss-complexity trade-offs interpreted as phase transitions. Practical experiments with linear and tree-based regression models verify these theoretical predictions, explicitly demonstrating the interplay between the model complexity, generalization, and overfitting threshold.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13742v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the fast-moving world of AI, as organizations and researchers develop more advanced models, they face challenges due to their sheer size and computational demands. Deploying such models on edge devices or in resource-constrained environments adds further challenges related to energy consumption, memory usage and latency. To address these challenges, emerging trends are shaping the future of efficient model optimization techniques. From this premise, by employing supervised state-of-the-art transformer-based models, this research introduces a systematic method for ontology alignment, grounded in cosine-based semantic similarity between a biomedical layman vocabulary and the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) Metathesaurus. It leverages Microsoft Olive to search for target optimizations among different Execution Providers (EPs) using the ONNX Runtime backend, followed by an assembled process of dynamic quantization employing Intel Neural Compressor and IPEX (Intel Extension for PyTorch). Through our optimization process, we conduct extensive assessments on the two tasks from the DEFT 2020 Evaluation Campaign, achieving a new state-of-the-art in both. We retain performance metrics intact, while attaining an average inference speed-up of 20x and reducing memory usage by approximately 70%.</description>

      <title>Look, Focus, Act: Efficient and Robust Robot Learning via Human Gaze and Foveated Vision Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15833v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Human vision is a highly active process driven by gaze, which directs attention to task-relevant regions through foveation, dramatically reducing visual processing. In contrast, robot learning systems typically rely on passive, uniform processing of raw camera images. In this work, we explore how incorporating human-like active gaze into robotic policies can enhance efficiency and robustness. We develop GIAVA (Gaze Integrated Active-Vision ALOHA), a robot vision system that emulates human head and neck movement, and gaze adjustment for foveated processing. Extending the AV-ALOHA robot platform, we introduce a framework for simultaneously collecting eye-tracking, perspective control, and robot manipulation demonstration data from a human operator. We also open-source a simulation benchmark and dataset for training robot policies that incorporate human gaze. Inspired by recent work in foveated image segmentation and given the widespread use of Vision Transformers (ViTs) in robot learning, we integrate gaze information into ViTs using a foveated patch tokenization scheme. Compared to uniform patch tokenization, this significantly reduces the number of tokens, and thus computation. Our results show that our method for foveated robot vision drastically reduces computational overhead, and enhances robustness to background distractors. Notably, on certain high-precision tasks, foveated vision also improves performance, as reflected in higher success rates. Together, these findings suggest that human-inspired foveated visual processing offers untapped potential and should be further considered as a useful inductive bias in robotic vision systems. https://ian-chuang.github.io/gaze-av-aloha/</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17513v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optimal transport (OT) has become a natural framework for guiding the probability flows. Yet, the majority of recent generative models assume trivial geometry (e.g., Euclidean) and rely on strong density-estimation assumptions, yielding trajectories that do not respect the true principles of optimality in the underlying manifold. We present Hamiltonian Optimal Transport Advection (HOTA), a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman based method that tackles the dual dynamical OT problem explicitly through Kantorovich potentials, enabling efficient and scalable trajectory optimization. Our approach effectively evades the need for explicit density modeling, performing even when the cost functionals are non-smooth. Empirically, HOTA outperforms all baselines in standard benchmarks, as well as in custom datasets with non-differentiable costs, both in terms of feasibility and optimality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20936v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable versatility in adopting diverse personas. In this study, we examine how assigning a persona influences a model's reasoning on an objective task. Using activation patching, we take a first step toward understanding how key components of the model encode persona-specific information. Our findings reveal that the early Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) layers attend not only to the syntactic structure of the input but also process its semantic content. These layers transform persona tokens into richer representations, which are then used by the middle Multi-Head Attention (MHA) layers to shape the model's output. Additionally, we identify specific attention heads that disproportionately attend to racial and color-based identities.</description>

      <title>AgentMaster: A Multi-Agent Conversational Framework Using A2A and MCP Protocols for Multimodal Information Retrieval and Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21105v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rise of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) in Artificial Intelligence (AI), especially integrated with Large Language Models (LLMs), has greatly facilitated the resolution of complex tasks. However, current systems are still facing challenges of inter-agent communication, coordination, and interaction with heterogeneous tools and resources. Most recently, the Model Context Protocol (MCP) by Anthropic and Agent-to-Agent (A2A) communication protocol by Google have been introduced, and to the best of our knowledge, very few applications exist where both protocols are employed within a single MAS framework. We present a pilot study of AgentMaster, a novel modular multi-protocol MAS framework with self-implemented A2A and MCP, enabling dynamic coordination, flexible communication, and rapid development with faster iteration. Through a unified conversational interface, the system supports natural language interaction without prior technical expertise and responds to multimodal queries for tasks including information retrieval, question answering, and image analysis. The experiments are validated through both human evaluation and quantitative metrics, including BERTScore F1 (96.3%) and LLM-as-a-Judge G-Eval (87.1%). These results demonstrate robust automated inter-agent coordination, query decomposition, task allocation, dynamic routing, and domain-specific relevant responses. Overall, our proposed framework contributes to the potential capabilities of domain-specific, cooperative, and scalable conversational AI powered by MAS.</description>

      <title>Spec-VLA: Speculative Decoding for Vision-Language-Action Models with Relaxed Acceptance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22424v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have made substantial progress by leveraging the robust capabilities of Visual Language Models (VLMs). However, VLMs' significant parameter size and autoregressive (AR) decoding nature impose considerable computational demands on VLA models. While Speculative Decoding (SD) has shown efficacy in accelerating Large Language Models (LLMs) by incorporating efficient drafting and parallel verification, allowing multiple tokens to be generated in one forward pass, its application to VLA models remains unexplored. This work introduces Spec-VLA, an SD framework designed to accelerate VLA models. Due to the difficulty of the action prediction task and the greedy decoding mechanism of the VLA models, the direct application of the advanced SD framework to the VLA prediction task yields a minor speed improvement. To boost the generation speed, we propose an effective mechanism to relax acceptance utilizing the relative distances represented by the action tokens of the VLA model. Empirical results across diverse test scenarios affirm the effectiveness of the Spec-VLA framework, and further analysis substantiates the impact of our proposed strategies, which enhance the acceptance length by 44%, achieving 1.42 times speedup compared with the OpenVLA baseline, without compromising the success rate. The success of the Spec-VLA framework highlights the potential for broader application of speculative execution in VLA prediction scenarios.</description>

      <title>BlockA2A: Towards Secure and Verifiable Agent-to-Agent Interoperability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.01332v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid adoption of agentic AI, powered by large language models (LLMs), is transforming enterprise ecosystems with autonomous agents that execute complex workflows. Yet we observe several key security vulnerabilities in LLM-driven multi-agent systems (MASes): fragmented identity frameworks, insecure communication channels, and inadequate defenses against Byzantine agents or adversarial prompts. In this paper, we present the first systematic analysis of these emerging multi-agent risks and explain why the legacy security strategies cannot effectively address these risks. Afterwards, we propose BlockA2A, the first unified multi-agent trust framework that enables secure and verifiable and agent-to-agent interoperability. At a high level, BlockA2A adopts decentralized identifiers (DIDs) to enable fine-grained cross-domain agent authentication, blockchain-anchored ledgers to enable immutable auditability, and smart contracts to dynamically enforce context-aware access control policies. BlockA2A eliminates centralized trust bottlenecks, ensures message authenticity and execution integrity, and guarantees accountability across agent interactions. Furthermore, we propose a Defense Orchestration Engine (DOE) that actively neutralizes attacks through real-time mechanisms, including Byzantine agent flagging, reactive execution halting, and instant permission revocation. Empirical evaluations demonstrate BlockA2A's effectiveness in neutralizing prompt-based, communication-based, behavioral and systemic MAS attacks. We formalize its integration into existing MAS and showcase a practical implementation for Google's A2A protocol. Experiments confirm that BlockA2A and DOE operate with sub-second overhead, enabling scalable deployment in production LLM-based MAS environments.</description>

      <title>Tensor-Empowered Asset Pricing with Missing Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01861</link>

Abstract: Missing data in financial panels presents a critical obstacle, undermining asset-pricing models and reducing the effectiveness of investment strategies. Such panels are often inherently multi-dimensional, spanning firms, time, and financial variables, which adds complexity to the imputation task. Conventional imputation methods often fail by flattening the data's multidimensional structure, struggling with heterogeneous missingness patterns, or overfitting in the face of extreme data sparsity. To address these limitations, we introduce an Adaptive, Cluster-based Temporal smoothing tensor completion framework (ACT-Tensor) tailored for severely and heterogeneously missing multi-dimensional financial data panels. ACT-Tensor incorporates two key innovations: a cluster-based completion module that captures cross-sectional heterogeneity by learning group-specific latent structures; and a temporal smoothing module that proactively removes short-lived noise while preserving slow-moving fundamental trends. Extensive experiments show that ACT-Tensor consistently outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks in terms of imputation accuracy across a range of missing data regimes, including extreme sparsity scenarios. To assess its practical financial utility, we evaluate the imputed data with a latent factor model tailored for tensor-structured financial data. Results show that ACT-Tensor not only achieves accurate return forecasting but also significantly improves risk-adjusted returns of the constructed portfolio. These findings confirm that our method delivers highly accurate and informative imputations, offering substantial value for financial decision-making.</description>

      <title>UR$^2$: Unify RAG and Reasoning through Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06165v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities through two complementary paradigms: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which enhances knowledge grounding, and Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), which optimizes complex reasoning abilities. However, these two capabilities are often developed in isolation, and existing efforts to unify them remain narrow in scope -- typically limited to open-domain QA with fixed retrieval settings and task-specific constraints. This lack of integration constrains generalization and limits the applicability of RAG-RL methods to broader domains. To bridge this gap, we propose UR2 (Unified RAG and Reasoning), a general framework that unifies retrieval and reasoning through reinforcement learning. UR2 introduces two key contributions: a difficulty-aware curriculum training that selectively invokes retrieval only for challenging problems, and a hybrid knowledge access strategy combining domain-specific offline corpora with LLM-generated summaries. These components are designed to enable dynamic coordination between retrieval and reasoning, improving adaptability across a diverse range of tasks. Experiments across open-domain QA, MMLU-Pro, medical, and mathematical reasoning tasks demonstrate that UR$^2$ (built on Qwen-2.5-3/7B and LLaMA-3.1-8B) significantly outperforms existing RAG and RL methods, achieving comparable performance to GPT-4o-mini and GPT-4.1-mini on several benchmarks. We have released all code, models, and data at https://github.com/Tsinghua-dhy/UR2.</description>

      <title>DETACH: Cross-domain Learning for Long-Horizon Tasks via Mixture of Disentangled Experts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07842v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Long-Horizon (LH) tasks in Human-Scene Interaction (HSI) are complex multi-step tasks that require continuous planning, sequential decision-making, and extended execution across domains to achieve the final goal. However, existing methods heavily rely on skill chaining by concatenating pre-trained subtasks, with environment observations and self-state tightly coupled, lacking the ability to generalize to new combinations of environments and skills, failing to complete various LH tasks across domains. To solve this problem, this paper presents DETACH, a cross-domain learning framework for LH tasks via biologically inspired dual-stream disentanglement. Inspired by the brain's "where-what" dual pathway mechanism, DETACH comprises two core modules: i) an environment learning module for spatial understanding, which captures object functions, spatial relationships, and scene semantics, achieving cross-domain transfer through complete environment-self disentanglement; ii) a skill learning module for task execution, which processes self-state information including joint degrees of freedom and motor patterns, enabling cross-skill transfer through independent motor pattern encoding. We conducted extensive experiments on various LH tasks in HSI scenes. Compared with existing methods, DETACH can achieve an average subtasks success rate improvement of 23% and average execution efficiency improvement of 29%.</description>

      <title>Advancing Knowledge Tracing by Exploring Follow-up Performance Trends</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08019v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS), such as Massive Open Online Courses, offer new opportunities for human learning. At the core of such systems, knowledge tracing (KT) predicts students' future performance by analyzing their historical learning activities, enabling an accurate evaluation of students' knowledge states over time. We show that existing KT methods often encounter correlation conflicts when analyzing the relationships between historical learning sequences and future performance. To address such conflicts, we propose to extract so-called Follow-up Performance Trends (FPTs) from historical ITS data and to incorporate them into KT. We propose a method called Forward-Looking Knowledge Tracing (FINER) that combines historical learning sequences with FPTs to enhance student performance prediction accuracy. FINER constructs learning patterns that facilitate the retrieval of FPTs from historical ITS data in linear time; FINER includes a novel similarity-aware attention mechanism that aggregates FPTs based on both frequency and contextual similarity; and FINER offers means of combining FPTs and historical learning sequences to enable more accurate prediction of student future performance. Experiments on six real-world datasets show that FINER can outperform ten state-of-the-art KT methods, increasing accuracy by 8.74% to 84.85%.</description>

      <title>Steering Towards Fairness: Mitigating Political Bias in LLMs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08846v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have enabled their widespread use across diverse real-world applications. However, concerns remain about their tendency to encode and reproduce ideological biases along political and economic dimensions. In this paper, we employ a framework for probing and mitigating such biases in decoder-based LLMs through analysis of internal model representations. Grounded in the Political Compass Test (PCT), this method uses contrastive pairs to extract and compare hidden layer activations from models like Mistral and DeepSeek. We introduce a comprehensive activation extraction pipeline capable of layer-wise analysis across multiple ideological axes, revealing meaningful disparities linked to political framing. Our results show that decoder LLMs systematically encode representational bias across layers, which can be leveraged for effective steering vector-based mitigation. This work provides new insights into how political bias is encoded in LLMs and offers a principled approach to debiasing beyond surface-level output interventions.</description>

      <title>Time Is a Feature: Exploiting Temporal Dynamics in Diffusion Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09138v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) generate text through iterative denoising, yet current decoding strategies discard rich intermediate predictions in favor of the final output. Our work here reveals a critical phenomenon, temporal oscillation, where correct answers often emerge in the middle process, but are overwritten in later denoising steps. To address this issue, we introduce two complementary methods that exploit temporal consistency: 1) Temporal Self-Consistency Voting, a training-free, test-time decoding strategy that aggregates predictions across denoising steps to select the most consistent output; and 2) a post-training method termed Temporal Consistency Reinforcement, which uses Temporal Semantic Entropy (TSE), a measure of semantic stability across intermediate predictions, as a reward signal to encourage stable generations. Empirical results across multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Using the negative TSE reward alone, we observe a remarkable average improvement of 24.7% on the Countdown dataset over an existing dLLM. Combined with the accuracy reward, we achieve absolute gains of 2.0% on GSM8K, 4.3% on MATH500, 6.6% on SVAMP, and 25.3% on Countdown, respectively. Our findings underscore the untapped potential of temporal dynamics in dLLMs and offer two simple yet effective tools to harness them.</description>

      <title>IPGPhormer: Interpretable Pathology Graph-Transformer for Survival Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12381v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pathological images play an essential role in cancer prognosis, while survival analysis, which integrates computational techniques, can predict critical clinical events such as patient mortality or disease recurrence from whole-slide images (WSIs). Recent advancements in multiple instance learning have significantly improved the efficiency of survival analysis. However, existing methods often struggle to balance the modeling of long-range spatial relationships with local contextual dependencies and typically lack inherent interpretability, limiting their clinical utility. To address these challenges, we propose the Interpretable Pathology Graph-Transformer (IPGPhormer), a novel framework that captures the characteristics of the tumor microenvironment and models their spatial dependencies across the tissue. IPGPhormer uniquely provides interpretability at both tissue and cellular levels without requiring post-hoc manual annotations, enabling detailed analyses of individual WSIs and cross-cohort assessments. Comprehensive evaluations on four public benchmark datasets demonstrate that IPGPhormer outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both predictive accuracy and interpretability. In summary, our method, IPGPhormer, offers a promising tool for cancer prognosis assessment, paving the way for more reliable and interpretable decision-support systems in pathology. The code is publicly available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/IPGPhormer-6EEB.</description>

      <title>Neuro-inspired Ensemble-to-Ensemble Communication Primitives for Sparse and Efficient ANNs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14140v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The structure of biological neural circuits-modular, hierarchical, and sparsely interconnected-reflects an efficient trade-off between wiring cost, functional specialization, and robustness. These principles offer valuable insights for artificial neural network (ANN) design, especially as networks grow in depth and scale. Sparsity, in particular, has been widely explored for reducing memory and computation, improving speed, and enhancing generalization. Motivated by systems neuroscience findings, we explore how patterns of functional connectivity in the mouse visual cortex-specifically, ensemble-to-ensemble communication, can inform ANN design. We introduce G2GNet, a novel architecture that imposes sparse, modular connectivity across feedforward layers. Despite having significantly fewer parameters than fully connected models, G2GNet achieves superior accuracy on standard vision benchmarks. To our knowledge, this is the first architecture to incorporate biologically observed functional connectivity patterns as a structural bias in ANN design. We complement this static bias with a dynamic sparse training (DST) mechanism that prunes and regrows edges during training. We also propose a Hebbian-inspired rewiring rule based on activation correlations, drawing on principles of biological plasticity. G2GNet achieves up to 75% sparsity while improving accuracy by up to 4.3% on benchmarks, including Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100, outperforming dense baselines with far fewer computations.</description>

      <title>Mini-Omni-Reasoner: Token-Level Thinking-in-Speaking in Large Speech Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15827v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reasoning is essential for effective communication and decision-making. While recent advances in LLMs and MLLMs have shown that incorporating explicit reasoning significantly improves understanding and generalization, reasoning in LSMs remains in a nascent stage. Early efforts attempt to transfer the "Thinking-before-Speaking" paradigm from textual models to speech. However, this sequential formulation introduces notable latency, as spoken responses are delayed until reasoning is fully completed, impairing real-time interaction and communication efficiency. To address this, we propose Mini-Omni-Reasoner, a framework that enables reasoning within speech via a novel "Thinking-in-Speaking" formulation. Rather than completing reasoning before producing any verbal output, Mini-Omni-Reasoner interleaves silent reasoning tokens with spoken response tokens at the token level. This design allows continuous speech generation while embedding structured internal reasoning, leveraging the model's high-frequency token processing capability. Although interleaved, local semantic alignment is enforced to ensure that each response token is informed by its preceding reasoning. To support this framework, we introduce Spoken-Math-Problems-3M, a large-scale dataset tailored for interleaved reasoning and response. The dataset ensures that verbal tokens consistently follow relevant reasoning content, enabling accurate and efficient learning of speech-coupled reasoning. Built on a hierarchical Thinker-Talker architecture, Mini-Omni-Reasoner delivers fluent yet logically grounded spoken responses, maintaining both naturalness and precision. On the Spoken-MQA benchmark, it achieves a +19.1% gain in arithmetic reasoning and +6.4% in contextual understanding, with shorter outputs and zero decoding latency.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16313v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly improved reasoning capabilities, with in-context learning (ICL) emerging as a key technique for adaptation without retraining. While previous works have focused on leveraging correct examples, recent research highlights the importance of learning from errors to enhance performance. However, existing methods lack a structured framework for analyzing and mitigating errors, particularly in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), where integrating visual and textual inputs adds complexity. To address this issue, we propose REFINE: Retrieval-Enhanced Feedback via In-context Neural Error-book, a teacher-student framework that systematically structures errors and provides targeted feedback. REFINE introduces three systematic queries to construct structured feedback -- Feed-Target, Feed-Check, and Feed-Path -- to enhance multimodal reasoning by prioritizing relevant visual information, diagnosing critical failure points, and formulating corrective actions. Unlike prior approaches that rely on redundant retrievals, REFINE optimizes structured feedback retrieval, improving inference efficiency, token usage, and scalability. Our results demonstrate substantial speedup, reduced computational costs, and successful generalization, highlighting REFINE's potential for enhancing multimodal reasoning.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Dual-Line Decoder Network with Multi-Scale Convolutional Attention for Multi-organ Segmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17007v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Proper segmentation of organs-at-risk is important for radiation therapy, surgical planning, and diagnostic decision-making in medical image analysis. While deep learning-based segmentation architectures have made significant progress, they often fail to balance segmentation accuracy with computational efficiency. Most of the current state-of-the-art methods either prioritize performance at the cost of high computational complexity or compromise accuracy for efficiency. This paper addresses this gap by introducing an efficient dual-line decoder segmentation network (EDLDNet). The proposed method features a noisy decoder, which learns to incorporate structured perturbation at training time for better model robustness, yet at inference time only the noise-free decoder is executed, leading to lower computational cost. Multi-Scale convolutional Attention Modules (MSCAMs), Attention Gates (AGs), and Up-Convolution Blocks (UCBs) are further utilized to optimize feature representation and boost segmentation performance. By leveraging multi-scale segmentation masks from both decoders, we also utilize a mutation-based loss function to enhance the model's generalization. Our approach outperforms SOTA segmentation architectures on four publicly available medical imaging datasets. EDLDNet achieves SOTA performance with an 84.00% Dice score on the Synapse dataset, surpassing baseline model like UNet by 13.89% in Dice score while significantly reducing Multiply-Accumulate Operations (MACs) by 89.7%. Compared to recent approaches like EMCAD, our EDLDNet not only achieves higher Dice score but also maintains comparable computational efficiency. The outstanding performance across diverse datasets establishes EDLDNet's strong generalization, computational efficiency, and robustness. The source code, pre-processed data, and pre-trained weights will be available at https://github.com/riadhassan/EDLDNet .</description>

      <title>Agentic AI for Software: thoughts from Software Engineering community</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17343v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: AI agents have recently shown significant promise in software engineering. Much public attention has been transfixed on the topic of code generation from Large Language Models (LLMs) via a prompt. However, software engineering is much more than programming, and AI agents go far beyond instructions given by a prompt.
  At the code level, common software tasks include code generation, testing, and program repair. Design level software tasks may include architecture exploration, requirements understanding, and requirements enforcement at the code level. Each of these software tasks involves micro-decisions which can be taken autonomously by an AI agent, aided by program analysis tools. This creates the vision of an AI software engineer, where the AI agent can be seen as a member of a development team.
  Conceptually, the key to successfully developing trustworthy agentic AI-based software workflows will be to resolve the core difficulty in software engineering - the deciphering and clarification of developer intent. Specification inference, or deciphering the intent, thus lies at the heart of many software tasks, including software maintenance and program repair. A successful deployment of agentic technology into software engineering would involve making conceptual progress in such intent inference via agents.
  Trusting the AI agent becomes a key aspect, as software engineering becomes more automated. Higher automation also leads to higher volume of code being automatically generated, and then integrated into code-bases. Thus to deal with this explosion, an emerging direction is AI-based verification and validation (V &amp; V) of AI generated code. We posit that agentic software workflows in future will include such AIbased V&amp;V.</description>

      <title>GEPO: Group Expectation Policy Optimization for Stable Heterogeneous Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17850v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As single-center computing approaches power constraints, decentralized training becomes essential. However, traditional Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods, crucial for enhancing large model post-training, cannot adapt to decentralized distributed training due to the tight coupling between parameter learning and rollout sampling. For this, we propose HeteroRL, a heterogeneous RL architecture that decouples these processes, enabling stable training across geographically distributed nodes connected via the Internet. The core component is Group Expectation Policy Optimization (GEPO), an asynchronous RL algorithm robust to latency caused by network delays or heterogeneity in computational resources. Our study reveals that high latency significantly increases KL divergence, leading to higher variance in importance sampling weights and training instability. GEPO mitigates this issue by using group expectation weighting to exponentially reduce the variance of importance weights, with theoretical guarantees. Experiments show that GEPO achieves superior stability, with only a 3\% performance drop from online to 1800s latency, demonstrating strong potential for decentralized RL in geographically distributed, resource-heterogeneous computing environments.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19318v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has emerged as an efficient approach to resource allocation due to its strong capability in handling complex decision-making tasks. However, only limited research has explored the training of DRL models with real-world data in practical, distributed Internet of Things (IoT) systems. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes a novel framework for training DRL models in real-world distributed IoT environments. In the proposed framework, IoT devices select communication channels using a DRL-based method, while the DRL model is trained with feedback information. Specifically, Acknowledgment (ACK) information is obtained from actual data transmissions over the selected channels. Implementation and performance evaluation, in terms of Frame Success Rate (FSR), are carried out, demonstrating both the feasibility and the effectiveness of the proposed framework.</description>

      <title>GLSim: Detecting Object Hallucinations in LVLMs via Global-Local Similarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19972v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Object hallucination in large vision-language models presents a significant challenge to their safe deployment in real-world applications. Recent works have proposed object-level hallucination scores to estimate the likelihood of object hallucination; however, these methods typically adopt either a global or local perspective in isolation, which may limit detection reliability. In this paper, we introduce GLSim, a novel training-free object hallucination detection framework that leverages complementary global and local embedding similarity signals between image and text modalities, enabling more accurate and reliable hallucination detection in diverse scenarios. We comprehensively benchmark existing object hallucination detection methods and demonstrate that GLSim achieves superior detection performance, outperforming competitive baselines by a significant margin.</description>

      <title>Learning Primitive Embodied World Models: Towards Scalable Robotic Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20840v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While video-generation-based embodied world models have gained increasing attention, their reliance on large-scale embodied interaction data remains a key bottleneck. The scarcity, difficulty of collection, and high dimensionality of embodied data fundamentally limit the alignment granularity between language and actions and exacerbate the challenge of long-horizon video generation--hindering generative models from achieving a "GPT moment" in the embodied domain. There is a naive observation: the diversity of embodied data far exceeds the relatively small space of possible primitive motions. Based on this insight, we propose a novel paradigm for world modeling--Primitive Embodied World Models (PEWM). By restricting video generation to fixed short horizons, our approach 1) enables fine-grained alignment between linguistic concepts and visual representations of robotic actions, 2) reduces learning complexity, 3) improves data efficiency in embodied data collection, and 4) decreases inference latency. By equipping with a modular Vision-Language Model (VLM) planner and a Start-Goal heatmap Guidance mechanism (SGG), PEWM further enables flexible closed-loop control and supports compositional generalization of primitive-level policies over extended, complex tasks. Our framework leverages the spatiotemporal vision priors in video models and the semantic awareness of VLMs to bridge the gap between fine-grained physical interaction and high-level reasoning, paving the way toward scalable, interpretable, and general-purpose embodied intelligence.</description>

      <title>Revealing Hidden Precursors to Earthquakes via a Stress-Sensitive Transformation of Seismic Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00268v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Earthquake prediction has long been one of the most elusive challenges in science. Laboratory experiments and simulations suggest that failure precursors should exist, yet reliable signals have remained unobserved in real-world seismic records, leaving open the question of whether they are absent in nature or simply hidden within noise. Here we introduce a stress-sensitive frequency-domain transformation that tracks energy differences between adjacent frequency bands, isolating subtle spectral changes linked to evolving shear and normal stress. Applied to both laboratory acoustic emission data and seismic records from eight major earthquakes (Mw 5.9-9.0), including the 2011 Tohoku and 2023 Turkey-Syria events, the transform consistently reveals precursory signatures, arc-like trajectories and accelerations toward extrema, emerging hours to days before rupture. These features are robust across diverse tectonic settings, from induced seismicity and volcanic collapse to continental strike-slip and subduction megathrust earthquakes. Our findings demonstrate that hidden precursors are indeed encoded in ambient seismic noise, offering a pathway toward real-time fault monitoring and actionable short-term earthquake forecasting.</description>

      <title>Reward-Weighted Sampling: Enhancing Non-Autoregressive Characteristics in Masked Diffusion LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00707v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Masked diffusion models (MDMs) offer a promising non-autoregressive alternative for large language modeling. Standard decoding methods for MDMs, such as confidence-based sampling, select tokens independently based on individual token confidences at each diffusion step. However, we observe that this independent token selection often results in generation orders resembling sequential autoregressive processes, limiting the advantages of non-autoregressive modeling. To mitigate this pheonomenon, we propose Reward-Weighted Sampling (RWS), a novel decoding strategy that leverages an external reward model to provide a principled global signal during the iterative diffusion process. Specifically, at each diffusion step, RWS evaluates the quality of the entire intermediate sequence and scales token logits accordingly, guiding token selection by integrating global sequence-level coherence. This method selectively increases the confidence of tokens that initially have lower scores, thereby promoting a more non-autoregressive generation order. Furthermore, we provide theoretical justification showing that reward-weighted logit scaling induces beneficial rank reversals in token selection and consistently improves expected reward. Experiments demonstrate that RWS significantly promotes non-autoregressive generation orders, leading to improvements across multiple evaluation metrics. These results highlight the effectiveness of integrating global signals in enhancing both the non-autoregressive properties and overall performance of MDMs.</description>

      <title>A Dynamic Fusion Model for Consistent Crisis Response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01053v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In response to the urgent need for effective communication with crisis-affected populations, automated responses driven by language models have been proposed to assist in crisis communications. A critical yet often overlooked factor is the consistency of response style, which could affect the trust of affected individuals in responders. Despite its importance, few studies have explored methods for maintaining stylistic consistency across generated responses. To address this gap, we propose a novel metric for evaluating style consistency and introduce a fusion-based generation approach grounded in this metric. Our method employs a two-stage process: it first assesses the style of candidate responses and then optimizes and integrates them at the instance level through a fusion process. This enables the generation of high-quality responses while significantly reducing stylistic variation between instances. Experimental results across multiple datasets demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms baselines in both response quality and stylistic uniformity.</description>

      <title>Speaking at the Right Level: Literacy-Controlled Counterspeech Generation with RAG-RL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01058v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Health misinformation spreading online poses a significant threat to public health. Researchers have explored methods for automatically generating counterspeech to health misinformation as a mitigation strategy. Existing approaches often produce uniform responses, ignoring that the health literacy level of the audience could affect the accessibility and effectiveness of counterspeech. We propose a Controlled-Literacy framework using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with reinforcement learning (RL) to generate tailored counterspeech adapted to different health literacy levels. In particular, we retrieve knowledge aligned with specific health literacy levels, enabling accessible and factual information to support generation. We design a reward function incorporating subjective user preferences and objective readability-based rewards to optimize counterspeech to the target health literacy level. Experiment results show that Controlled-Literacy outperforms baselines by generating more accessible and user-preferred counterspeech. This research contributes to more equitable and impactful public health communication by improving the accessibility and comprehension of counterspeech to health misinformation</description>

      <title>DCA: Graph-Guided Deep Embedding Clustering for Brain Atlases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01426v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Brain atlases are essential for reducing the dimensionality of neuroimaging data and enabling interpretable analysis. However, most existing atlases are predefined, group-level templates with limited flexibility and resolution. We present Deep Cluster Atlas (DCA), a graph-guided deep embedding clustering framework for generating individualized, voxel-wise brain parcellations. DCA combines a pretrained autoencoder with spatially regularized deep clustering to produce functionally coherent and spatially contiguous regions. Our method supports flexible control over resolution and anatomical scope, and generalizes to arbitrary brain structures. We further introduce a standardized benchmarking platform for atlas evaluation, using multiple large-scale fMRI datasets. Across multiple datasets and scales, DCA outperforms state-of-the-art atlases, improving functional homogeneity by 98.8% and silhouette coefficient by 29%, and achieves superior performance in downstream tasks such as autism diagnosis and cognitive decoding. We also observe that a fine-tuned pretrained model achieves superior results on the corresponding task. Codes and models are available at https://github.com/ncclab-sustech/DCA .</description>

      <title>PDTrim: Targeted Pruning for Prefill-Decode Disaggregation in Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04467v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional capabilities across various tasks, but their deployment is constrained by high computational and memory costs. Model pruning provides an effective means to alleviate these demands. However, existing methods often ignore the characteristics of prefill-decode (PD) disaggregation in practice. In this paper, we propose a novel pruning method for PD disaggregation inference, enabling more precise and efficient block and KV Cache pruning. Our approach constructs pruning and distillation sets to perform iterative block removal independently for the prefill and decode stages, obtaining better pruning solutions. Moreover, we introduce a token-aware cache pruning mechanism that retains all KV Cache in the prefill stage but selectively reuses entries for the first and last token sequences in selected layers during decode, reducing communication costs with minimal overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently achieves strong performance in both PD disaggregation and PD unified settings without disaggregation. Under the same (default) settings, our method achieves improved performance and faster inference, along with a 4.95$\times$ reduction in data transmission bandwidth consumption.</description>

      <title>The Good, the Bad and the Constructive: Automatically Measuring Peer Review's Utility for Authors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04484v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Providing constructive feedback to paper authors is a core component of peer review. With reviewers increasingly having less time to perform reviews, automated support systems are required to ensure high reviewing quality, thus making the feedback in reviews useful for authors. To this end, we identify four key aspects of review comments (individual points in weakness sections of reviews) that drive the utility for authors: Actionability, Grounding &amp; Specificity, Verifiability, and Helpfulness. To enable evaluation and development of models assessing review comments, we introduce the RevUtil dataset. We collect 1,430 human-labeled review comments and scale our data with 10k synthetically labeled comments for training purposes. The synthetic data additionally contains rationales, i.e., explanations for the aspect score of a review comment. Employing the RevUtil dataset, we benchmark fine-tuned models for assessing review comments on these aspects and generating rationales. Our experiments demonstrate that these fine-tuned models achieve agreement levels with humans comparable to, and in some cases exceeding, those of powerful closed models like GPT-4o. Our analysis further reveals that machine-generated reviews generally underperform human reviews on our four aspects.</description>

      <title>TSPC: A Two-Stage Phoneme-Centric Architecture for code-switching Vietnamese-English Speech Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05983v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Code-switching (CS) presents a significant challenge for general Auto-Speech Recognition (ASR) systems. Existing methods often fail to capture the subtle phonological shifts inherent in CS scenarios. The challenge is particularly difficult for language pairs like Vietnamese and English, where both distinct phonological features and the ambiguity arising from similar sound recognition are present. In this paper, we propose a novel architecture for Vietnamese-English CS ASR, a Two-Stage Phoneme-Centric model (TSPC). The TSPC employs a phoneme-centric approach, built upon an extended Vietnamese phoneme set as an intermediate representation to facilitate mixed-lingual modeling. Experimental results demonstrate that TSPC consistently outperforms existing baselines, including PhoWhisper-base, in Vietnamese-English CS ASR, achieving a significantly lower word error rate of 19.9% with reduced training resources. Furthermore, the phonetic-based two-stage architecture enables phoneme adaptation and language conversion to enhance ASR performance in complex CS Vietnamese-English ASR scenarios</description>

      <title>TinyDef-DETR: A DETR-based Framework for Defect Detection in Transmission Lines from UAV Imagery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06035v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Automated defect detection from UAV imagery of transmission lines is a challenging task due to the small size, ambiguity, and complex backgrounds of defects. This paper proposes TinyDef-DETR, a DETR-based framework designed to achieve accurate and efficient detection of transmission line defects from UAV-acquired images. The model integrates four major components: an edge-enhanced ResNet backbone to strengthen boundary-sensitive representations, a stride-free space-to-depth module to enable detail-preserving downsampling, a cross-stage dual-domain multi-scale attention mechanism to jointly model global context and local cues, and a Focaler-Wise-SIoU regression loss to improve the localization of small and difficult targets. Together, these designs effectively mitigate the limitations of conventional detectors. Extensive experiments on both public and real-world datasets demonstrate that TinyDef-DETR achieves superior detection performance and strong generalization capability, while maintaining modest computational overhead. The accuracy and efficiency of TinyDef-DETR make it a suitable method for UAV-based transmission line defect detection, particularly in scenarios involving small and ambiguous targets.</description>

      <title>Statistical Inference for Misspecified Contextual Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06287v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Contextual bandit algorithms have transformed modern experimentation by enabling real-time adaptation for personalized treatment and efficient use of data. Yet these advantages create challenges for statistical inference due to adaptivity. A fundamental property that supports valid inference is policy convergence, meaning that action-selection probabilities converge in probability given the context. Convergence ensures replicability of adaptive experiments and stability of online algorithms. In this paper, we highlight a previously overlooked issue: widely used algorithms such as LinUCB may fail to converge when the reward model is misspecified, and such non-convergence creates fundamental obstacles for statistical inference. This issue is practically important, as misspecified models -- such as linear approximations of complex dynamic system -- are often employed in real-world adaptive experiments to balance bias and variance.
  Motivated by this insight, we propose and analyze a broad class of algorithms that are guaranteed to converge even under model misspecification. Building on this guarantee, we develop a general inference framework based on an inverse-probability-weighted Z-estimator (IPW-Z) and establish its asymptotic normality with a consistent variance estimator. Simulation studies confirm that the proposed method provides robust and data-efficient confidence intervals, and can outperform existing approaches that exist only in the special case of offline policy evaluation. Taken together, our results underscore the importance of designing adaptive algorithms with built-in convergence guarantees to enable stable experimentation and valid statistical inference in practice.</description>

      <title>Stated Preference for Interaction and Continued Engagement (SPICE): Evaluating an LLM's Willingness to Re-engage in Conversation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09043v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce and evaluate Stated Preference for Interaction and Continued Engagement (SPICE), a simple diagnostic signal elicited by asking a Large Language Model a YES or NO question about its willingness to re-engage with a user's behavior after reviewing a short transcript. In a study using a 3-tone (friendly, unclear, abusive) by 10-interaction stimulus set, we tested four open-weight chat models across four framing conditions, resulting in 480 trials. Our findings show that SPICE sharply discriminates by user tone. Friendly interactions yielded a near-unanimous preference to continue (97.5% YES), while abusive interactions yielded a strong preference to discontinue (17.9% YES), with unclear interactions falling in between (60.4% YES). This core association remains decisive under multiple dependence-aware statistical tests, including Rao-Scott adjustment and cluster permutation tests. Furthermore, we demonstrate that SPICE provides a distinct signal from abuse classification. In trials where a model failed to identify abuse, it still overwhelmingly stated a preference not to continue the interaction (81% of the time). An exploratory analysis also reveals a significant interaction effect: a preamble describing the study context significantly impacts SPICE under ambiguity, but only when transcripts are presented as a single block of text rather than a multi-turn chat. The results validate SPICE as a robust, low-overhead, and reproducible tool for auditing model dispositions, complementing existing metrics by offering a direct, relational signal of a model's state. All stimuli, code, and analysis scripts are released to support replication.</description>

      <title>The Thinking Therapist: Training Large Language Models to Deliver Acceptance and Commitment Therapy using Supervised Fine-Tuning and Odds Ratio Policy Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09712v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) is a third-wave cognitive behavioral therapy with emerging evidence of efficacy in several psychiatric conditions. This study investigates the impact of post-training methodology and explicit reasoning on the ability of a small open-weight large language model (LLM) to deliver ACT. Using synthetic ACT transcripts generated by Mistral-Large, we trained Llama-3.2-3b-Instruct with two distinct approaches, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and odds ratio policy optimization (ORPO), each with and without an explicit chain-of-thought (COT) reasoning step. Performance was evaluated by comparing these four post-trained variants against the base Instruct model. These models were benchmarked in simulated therapy sessions, with performance quantitatively assessed on the ACT Fidelity Measure (ACT-FM) and the Therapist Empathy Scale (TES) by an LLM judge that had been fine-tuned on human evaluations. Our findings demonstrate that the ORPO-trained models significantly outperformed both their SFT and Instruct counterparts on ACT fidelity ($\chi^2(5) = 185.15, p &lt; .001$) and therapeutic empathy ($\chi^2(5) = 140.37, p &lt; .001$). The effect of COT was conditional as it provided a significant benefit to SFT models, improving ACT-FM scores by an average of 2.68 points ($p &lt; .001$), while offering no discernible advantage to the superior ORPO or instruct-tuned variants. We posit that the superiority of ORPO stems from its ability to learn the therapeutic `process' over imitating `content,' a key aspect of ACT, while COT acts as a necessary scaffold for models trained only via imitation. This study establishes that preference-aligned policy optimization can effectively instill ACT competencies in small LLMs, and that the utility of explicit reasoning is highly dependent on the underlying training paradigm.</description>

      <title>VStyle: A Benchmark for Voice Style Adaptation with Spoken Instructions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09716v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spoken language models (SLMs) have emerged as a unified paradigm for speech understanding and generation, enabling natural human machine interaction. However, while most progress has focused on semantic accuracy and instruction following, the ability of SLMs to adapt their speaking style based on spoken instructions has received limited attention. We introduce Voice Style Adaptation (VSA), a new task that examines whether SLMs can modify their speaking style, such as timbre, prosody, or persona following natural language spoken commands. To study this task, we present VStyle, a bilingual (Chinese &amp; English) benchmark covering four categories of speech generation: acoustic attributes, natural language instruction, role play, and implicit empathy. We also introduce the Large Audio Language Model as a Judge (LALM as a Judge) framework, which progressively evaluates outputs along textual faithfulness, style adherence, and naturalness, ensuring reproducible and objective assessment. Experiments on commercial systems and open source SLMs demonstrate that current models face clear limitations in controllable style adaptation, highlighting both the novelty and challenge of this task. By releasing VStyle and its evaluation toolkit, we aim to provide the community with a foundation for advancing human centered spoken interaction. The dataset and code are publicly available at \href{https://junzhan2000.github.io/VStyle.github.io/}{project's homepage}.</description>

      <title>Structure Matters: Brain Graph Augmentation via Learnable Edge Masking for Data-efficient Psychiatric Diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09744v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The limited availability of labeled brain network data makes it challenging to achieve accurate and interpretable psychiatric diagnoses. While self-supervised learning (SSL) offers a promising solution, existing methods often rely on augmentation strategies that can disrupt crucial structural semantics in brain graphs. To address this, we propose SAM-BG, a two-stage framework for learning brain graph representations with structural semantic preservation. In the pre-training stage, an edge masker is trained on a small labeled subset to capture key structural semantics. In the SSL stage, the extracted structural priors guide a structure-aware augmentation process, enabling the model to learn more semantically meaningful and robust representations. Experiments on two real-world psychiatric datasets demonstrate that SAM-BG outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in small-labeled data settings, and uncovers clinically relevant connectivity patterns that enhance interpretability. Our code is available at https://github.com/mjliu99/SAM-BG.</description>

      <title>Quality Assessment of Tabular Data using Large Language Models and Code Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10572v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reliable data quality is crucial for downstream analysis of tabular datasets, yet rule-based validation often struggles with inefficiency, human intervention, and high computational costs. We present a three-stage framework that combines statistical inliner detection with LLM-driven rule and code generation. After filtering data samples through traditional clustering, we iteratively prompt LLMs to produce semantically valid quality rules and synthesize their executable validators through code-generating LLMs. To generate reliable quality rules, we aid LLMs with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) by leveraging external knowledge sources and domain-specific few-shot examples. Robust guardrails ensure the accuracy and consistency of both rules and code snippets. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets confirm the effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models for Security Operations Centers: A Comprehensive Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10858v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools capable of understanding and generating human-like text, offering transformative potential across diverse domains. The Security Operations Center (SOC), responsible for safeguarding digital infrastructure, represents one of these domains. SOCs serve as the frontline of defense in cybersecurity, tasked with continuous monitoring, detection, and response to incidents. However, SOCs face persistent challenges such as high alert volumes, limited resources, high demand for experts with advanced knowledge, delayed response times, and difficulties in leveraging threat intelligence effectively. In this context, LLMs can offer promising solutions by automating log analysis, streamlining triage, improving detection accuracy, and providing the required knowledge in less time. This survey systematically explores the integration of generative AI and more specifically LLMs into SOC workflow, providing a structured perspective on its capabilities, challenges, and future directions. We believe that this survey offers researchers and SOC managers a broad overview of the current state of LLM integration within academic study. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive study to examine LLM applications in SOCs in details.</description>

      <title>MALLM: Multi-Agent Large Language Models Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11656v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-agent debate (MAD) has demonstrated the ability to augment collective intelligence by scaling test-time compute and leveraging expertise. Current frameworks for multi-agent debate are often designed towards tool use, lack integrated evaluation, or provide limited configurability of agent personas, response generators, discussion paradigms, and decision protocols. We introduce MALLM (Multi-Agent Large Language Models), an open-source framework that enables systematic analysis of MAD components. MALLM offers more than 144 unique configurations of MAD, including (1) agent personas (e.g., Expert, Personality), (2) response generators (e.g., Critical, Reasoning), (3) discussion paradigms (e.g., Memory, Relay), and (4) decision protocols (e.g., Voting, Consensus). MALLM uses simple configuration files to define a debate. Furthermore, MALLM can load any textual Hugging Face dataset (e.g., MMLU-Pro, WinoGrande) and provides an evaluation pipeline for easy comparison of MAD configurations. MALLM enables researchers to systematically configure, run, and evaluate debates for their problems, facilitating the understanding of the components and their interplay.</description>

      <title>SpecVLM: Fast Speculative Decoding in Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11815v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Speculative decoding is a powerful way to accelerate autoregressive large language models (LLMs), but directly porting it to vision-language models (VLMs) faces unique systems constraints: the prefill stage is dominated by visual tokens whose count scales with image resolution and video length, inflating both compute and memory, especially the key-value (KV) cache. We study speculative decoding for VLMs and introduce SpecVLM, a practical system that (1) establishes a strong EAGLE-2-style baseline, EagleVLM, delivering 1.5--2.3x end-to-end speedups over full autoregressive inference, and (2) further accelerates VLM inference with an elastic visual compressor that adaptively selects among pruning, pooling, convolution, and resampler primitives to balance FLOPs/parameters and accuracy per input. To avoid costly offline distillation corpora, we propose an online-logit distillation protocol that trains the draft model with on-the-fly teacher logits and penultimate features using a combined cross-entropy and Smooth L1 objective, eliminating storage and preprocessing while remaining compute-efficient. This protocol reveals a training-time scaling effect: longer online training monotonically increases the draft model's average accepted length, improving speculative efficiency. Empirically, SpecVLM achieves additional acceleration, culminating in 2.5--2.9x end-to-end speedups within 5 epochs across LLaVA and MMMU, consistently over resolutions and task difficulties, while preserving the target model's output distribution (lossless decoding).

      <description>arXiv:2509.12158v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Puns are a form of humorous wordplay that exploits polysemy and phonetic similarity. While LLMs have shown promise in detecting puns, we show in this paper that their understanding often remains shallow, lacking the nuanced grasp typical of human interpretation. By systematically analyzing and reformulating existing pun benchmarks, we demonstrate how subtle changes in puns are sufficient to mislead LLMs. Our contributions include comprehensive and nuanced pun detection benchmarks, human evaluation across recent LLMs, and an analysis of the robustness challenges these models face in processing puns.</description>

      <title>Justice in Judgment: Unveiling (Hidden) Bias in LLM-assisted Peer Reviews</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13400v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The adoption of large language models (LLMs) is transforming the peer review process, from assisting reviewers in writing more detailed evaluations to generating entire reviews automatically. While these capabilities offer exciting opportunities, they also raise critical concerns about fairness and reliability. In this paper, we investigate bias in LLM-generated peer reviews by conducting controlled experiments on sensitive metadata, including author affiliation and gender. Our analysis consistently shows affiliation bias favoring institutions highly ranked on common academic rankings. Additionally, we find some gender preferences, which, even though subtle in magnitude, have the potential to compound over time. Notably, we uncover implicit biases that become more evident with token-based soft ratings.</description>

      <title>Machines are more productive than humans until they aren't, and vice versa</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14057v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the growth of artificial skills, organizations are increasingly confronting with the problem of optimizing skill policy decisions guided by economic principles. This paper addresses the underlying complexity of this challenge by developing an in-silico framework based on Monte Carlo simulations grounded in empirical realism to analyze the economic impact of human and machine skills, individually or jointly deployed in the execution of tasks presenting varying levels of complexity. Our results provide quantitative support for the established notions that automation tends to be the most economically-effective strategy for tasks characterized by low-to-medium generalization difficulty, while automation may struggle to match the economic utility of human skills in more complex scenarios. Critically, our simulations highlight that, when high level of generalization is required and the cost of errors is high, combining human and machine skills can be the most effective strategy, but only if genuine augmentation is achieved. In contrast, when failing to realize this synergy, the human-machine policy is severely penalized by the inherent costs of its dual skill structure, causing it to destroy value and becoming the worst choice from an economic perspective. The takeaway for decision-makers is unambiguous: in complex and critical contexts, simply allocating human and machine skills to a task may be insufficient, and a human-machine skill policy is neither a silver-bullet solution nor a low-risk compromise. Rather, it is a critical opportunity to boost competitiveness that demands a strong organizational commitment to enabling augmentation. Also, our findings show that improving the cost-effectiveness of machine skills over time, while useful, does not replace the fundamental need to focus on achieving augmentation.</description>

      <title>Bridging Past and Future: Distribution-Aware Alignment for Time Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14181v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although contrastive and other representation-learning methods have long been explored in vision and NLP, their adoption in modern time series forecasters remains limited. We believe they hold strong promise for this domain. To unlock this potential, we explicitly align past and future representations, thereby bridging the distributional gap between input histories and future targets. To this end, we introduce TimeAlign, a lightweight, plug-and-play framework that establishes a new representation paradigm, distinct from contrastive learning, by aligning auxiliary features via a simple reconstruction task and feeding them back into any base forecaster. Extensive experiments across eight benchmarks verify its superior performance. Further studies indicate that the gains arise primarily from correcting frequency mismatches between historical inputs and future outputs. Additionally, we provide two theoretical justifications for how reconstruction improves forecasting generalization and how alignment increases the mutual information between learned representations and predicted targets. The code is available at https://github.com/TROUBADOUR000/TimeAlign.</description>

      <title>Fresh in memory: Training-order recency is linearly encoded in language model activations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14223v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that language models' activations linearly encode when information was learned during training. Our setup involves creating a model with a known training order by sequentially fine-tuning Llama-3.2-1B on six disjoint but otherwise similar datasets about named entities. We find that the average activations of test samples corresponding to the six training datasets encode the training order: when projected into a 2D subspace, these centroids are arranged exactly in the order of training and lie on a straight line. Further, we show that linear probes can accurately (~90%) distinguish "early" vs. "late" entities, generalizing to entities unseen during the probes' own training. The model can also be fine-tuned to explicitly report an unseen entity's training stage (~80% accuracy). Interestingly, the training-order encoding does not seem attributable to simple differences in activation magnitudes, losses, or model confidence. Our paper demonstrates that models are capable of differentiating information by its acquisition time, and carries significant implications for how they might manage conflicting data and respond to knowledge modifications.</description>

      <title>SparseDoctor: Towards Efficient Chat Doctor with Mixture of Experts Enhanced Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14269v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved great success in medical question answering and clinical decision-making, promoting the efficiency and popularization of the personalized virtual doctor in society. However, the traditional fine-tuning strategies on LLM require the updates of billions of parameters, substantially increasing the training cost, including the training time and utility cost. To enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the current medical LLMs and explore the boundary of the representation capability of the LLMs on the medical domain, apart from the traditional fine-tuning strategies from the data perspective (i.e., supervised fine-tuning or reinforcement learning from human feedback), we instead craft a novel sparse medical LLM named SparseDoctor armed with contrastive learning enhanced LoRA-MoE (low rank adaptation-mixture of experts) architecture. To this end, the crafted automatic routing mechanism can scientifically allocate the computational resources among different LoRA experts supervised by the contrastive learning. Additionally, we also introduce a novel expert memory queue mechanism to further boost the efficiency of the overall framework and prevent the memory overflow during training. We conduct comprehensive evaluations on three typical medical benchmarks: CMB, CMExam, and CMMLU-Med. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed LLM can consistently outperform the strong baselines such as the HuatuoGPT series.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.14353v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce DreamControl, a novel methodology for learning autonomous whole-body humanoid skills. DreamControl leverages the strengths of diffusion models and Reinforcement Learning (RL): our core innovation is the use of a diffusion prior trained on human motion data, which subsequently guides an RL policy in simulation to complete specific tasks of interest (e.g., opening a drawer or picking up an object). We demonstrate that this human motion-informed prior allows RL to discover solutions unattainable by direct RL, and that diffusion models inherently promote natural looking motions, aiding in sim-to-real transfer. We validate DreamControl's effectiveness on a Unitree G1 robot across a diverse set of challenging tasks involving simultaneous lower and upper body control and object interaction.</description>

      <title>OnlineMate: An LLM-Based Multi-Agent Companion System for Cognitive Support in Online Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14803v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In online learning environments, students often lack personalized peer interactions, which play a crucial role in supporting cognitive development and learning engagement. Although previous studies have utilized large language models (LLMs) to simulate interactive dynamic learning environments for students, these interactions remain limited to conversational exchanges, lacking insights and adaptations to the learners' individualized learning and cognitive states. As a result, students' interest in discussions with AI learning companions is low, and they struggle to gain inspiration from such interactions. To address this challenge, we propose OnlineMate, a multi-agent learning companion system driven by LLMs that integrates the Theory of Mind (ToM). OnlineMate is capable of simulating peer-like agent roles, adapting to learners' cognitive states during collaborative discussions, and inferring their psychological states, such as misunderstandings, confusion, or motivation. By incorporating Theory of Mind capabilities, the system can dynamically adjust its interaction strategies to support the development of higher-order thinking and cognition. Experimental results in simulated learning scenarios demonstrate that OnlineMate effectively fosters deep learning and discussions while enhancing cognitive engagement in online educational settings.</description>

      <title>Listening, Imagining &amp; Refining: A Heuristic Optimized ASR Correction Framework with LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15095v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems remain prone to errors that affect downstream applications. In this paper, we propose LIR-ASR, a heuristic optimized iterative correction framework using LLMs, inspired by human auditory perception. LIR-ASR applies a "Listening-Imagining-Refining" strategy, generating phonetic variants and refining them in context. A heuristic optimization with finite state machine (FSM) is introduced to prevent the correction process from being trapped in local optima and rule-based constraints help maintain semantic fidelity. Experiments on both English and Chinese ASR outputs show that LIR-ASR achieves average reductions in CER/WER of up to 1.5 percentage points compared to baselines, demonstrating substantial accuracy gains in transcription.</description>

      <title>Exploring How Audio Effects Alter Emotion with Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15151v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Audio effects (FX) such as reverberation, distortion, modulation, and dynamic range processing play a pivotal role in shaping emotional responses during music listening. While prior studies have examined links between low-level audio features and affective perception, the systematic impact of audio FX on emotion remains underexplored. This work investigates how foundation models - large-scale neural architectures pretrained on multimodal data - can be leveraged to analyze these effects. Such models encode rich associations between musical structure, timbre, and affective meaning, offering a powerful framework for probing the emotional consequences of sound design techniques. By applying various probing methods to embeddings from deep learning models, we examine the complex, nonlinear relationships between audio FX and estimated emotion, uncovering patterns tied to specific effects and evaluating the robustness of foundation audio models. Our findings aim to advance understanding of the perceptual impact of audio production practices, with implications for music cognition, performance, and affective computing.</description>

      <title>Walk and Read Less: Improving the Efficiency of Vision-and-Language Navigation via Tuning-Free Multimodal Token Pruning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15250v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large models achieve strong performance on Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) tasks, but are costly to run in resource-limited environments. Token pruning offers appealing tradeoffs for efficiency with minimal performance loss by reducing model input size, but prior work overlooks VLN-specific challenges. For example, information loss from pruning can effectively increase computational cost due to longer walks. Thus, the inability to identify uninformative tokens undermines the supposed efficiency gains from pruning. To address this, we propose Navigation-Aware Pruning (NAP), which uses navigation-specific traits to simplify the pruning process by pre-filtering tokens into foreground and background. For example, image views are filtered based on whether the agent can navigate in that direction. We also extract navigation-relevant instructions using a Large Language Model. After filtering, we focus pruning on background tokens, minimizing information loss. To further help avoid increases in navigation length, we discourage backtracking by removing low-importance navigation nodes. Experiments on standard VLN benchmarks show NAP significantly outperforms prior work, preserving higher success rates while saving more than 50% FLOPS.</description>

      <title>BTL-UI: Blink-Think-Link Reasoning Model for GUI Agent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15566v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the field of AI-driven human-GUI interaction automation, while rapid advances in multimodal large language models and reinforcement fine-tuning techniques have yielded remarkable progress, a fundamental challenge persists: their interaction logic significantly deviates from natural human-GUI communication patterns. To fill this gap, we propose "Blink-Think-Link" (BTL), a brain-inspired framework for human-GUI interaction that mimics the human cognitive process between users and graphical interfaces. The system decomposes interactions into three biologically plausible phases: (1) Blink - rapid detection and attention to relevant screen areas, analogous to saccadic eye movements; (2) Think - higher-level reasoning and decision-making, mirroring cognitive planning; and (3) Link - generation of executable commands for precise motor control, emulating human action selection mechanisms. Additionally, we introduce two key technical innovations for the BTL framework: (1) Blink Data Generation - an automated annotation pipeline specifically optimized for blink data, and (2) BTL Reward -- the first rule-based reward mechanism that enables reinforcement learning driven by both process and outcome. Building upon this framework, we develop a GUI agent model named BTL-UI, which demonstrates consistent state-of-the-art performance across both static GUI understanding and dynamic interaction tasks in comprehensive benchmarks. These results provide conclusive empirical validation of the framework's efficacy in developing advanced GUI Agents.</description>

      <title>TISDiSS: A Training-Time and Inference-Time Scalable Framework for Discriminative Source Separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15666v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Source separation is a fundamental task in speech, music, and audio processing, and it also provides cleaner and larger data for training generative models. However, improving separation performance in practice often depends on increasingly large networks, inflating training and deployment costs. Motivated by recent advances in inference-time scaling for generative modeling, we propose Training-Time and Inference-Time Scalable Discriminative Source Separation (TISDiSS), a unified framework that integrates early-split multi-loss supervision, shared-parameter design, and dynamic inference repetitions. TISDiSS enables flexible speed-performance trade-offs by adjusting inference depth without retraining additional models. We further provide systematic analyses of architectural and training choices and show that training with more inference repetitions improves shallow-inference performance, benefiting low-latency applications. Experiments on standard speech separation benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance with a reduced parameter count, establishing TISDiSS as a scalable and practical framework for adaptive source separation.

      <title>Compose Yourself: Average-Velocity Flow Matching for One-Step Speech Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15952v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion and flow matching (FM) models have achieved remarkable progress in speech enhancement (SE), yet their dependence on multi-step generation is computationally expensive and vulnerable to discretization errors. Recent advances in one-step generative modeling, particularly MeanFlow, provide a promising alternative by reformulating dynamics through average velocity fields. In this work, we present COSE, a one-step FM framework tailored for SE. To address the high training overhead of Jacobian-vector product (JVP) computations in MeanFlow, we introduce a velocity composition identity to compute average velocity efficiently, eliminating expensive computation while preserving theoretical consistency and achieving competitive enhancement quality. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks show that COSE delivers up to 5x faster sampling and reduces training cost by 40%, all without compromising speech quality.
