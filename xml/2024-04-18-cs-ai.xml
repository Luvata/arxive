      <title>ClimODE: Climate and Weather Forecasting with Physics-informed Neural ODEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Climate and weather prediction traditionally relies on complex numerical simulations of atmospheric physics. Deep learning approaches, such as transformers, have recently challenged the simulation paradigm with complex network forecasts. However, they often act as data-driven black-box models that neglect the underlying physics and lack uncertainty quantification. We address these limitations with ClimODE, a spatiotemporal continuous-time process that implements a key principle of advection from statistical mechanics, namely, weather changes due to a spatial movement of quantities over time. ClimODE models precise weather evolution with value-conserving dynamics, learning global weather transport as a neural flow, which also enables estimating the uncertainty in predictions. Our approach outperforms existing data-driven methods in global and regional forecasting with an order of magnitude smaller parameterization, establishing a new state of the art.</description>

      <title>LegalPro-BERT: Classification of Legal Provisions by fine-tuning BERT Large Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A contract is a type of legal document commonly used in organizations. Contract review is an integral and repetitive process to avoid business risk and liability. Contract analysis requires the identification and classification of key provisions and paragraphs within an agreement. Identification and validation of contract clauses can be a time-consuming and challenging task demanding the services of trained and expensive lawyers, paralegals or other legal assistants. Classification of legal provisions in contracts using artificial intelligence and natural language processing is complex due to the requirement of domain-specialized legal language for model training and the scarcity of sufficient labeled data in the legal domain. Using general-purpose models is not effective in this context due to the use of specialized legal vocabulary in contracts which may not be recognized by a general model. To address this problem, we propose the use of a pre-trained large language model which is subsequently calibrated on legal taxonomy. We propose LegalPro-BERT, a BERT transformer architecture model that we fine- tune to efficiently handle classification task for legal provisions. We conducted experiments to measure and compare metrics with current benchmark results. We found that LegalPro-BERT outperforms the previous benchmark used for comparison in this research.</description>

      <title>Chinchilla Scaling: A replication attempt</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hoffmann et al. (2022) propose three methods for estimating a compute-optimal scaling law. We attempt to replicate their third estimation procedure, which involves fitting a parametric loss function to a reconstruction of data from their plots. We find that the reported estimates are inconsistent with their first two estimation methods, fail at fitting the extracted data, and report implausibly narrow confidence intervals--intervals this narrow would require over 600,000 experiments, while they likely only ran fewer than 500. In contrast, our rederivation of the scaling law using the third approach yields results that are compatible with the findings from the first two estimation procedures described by Hoffmann et al.</description>

      <title>Deceiving to Enlighten: Coaxing LLMs to Self-Reflection for Enhanced Bias Detection and Mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) embed complex biases and stereotypes that can lead to detrimental user experiences and societal consequences, often without conscious awareness from the models themselves. This paper emphasizes the importance of equipping LLMs with mechanisms for better self-reflection and bias recognition. Our experiments demonstrate that by informing LLMs that their generated content does not represent their own views and questioning them about bias, their capability to identify and address biases improves. This enhancement is attributed to the internal attention mechanisms and potential internal sensitivity policies of LLMs. Building upon these findings, we propose a novel method to diminish bias in LLM outputs. This involves engaging LLMs in multi-role scenarios acting as different roles where they are tasked for bias exposure, with a role of an impartial referee in the end of each loop of debate. A ranking scoring mechanism is employed to quantify bias levels, enabling more refined reflections and superior output quality. Comparative experimental results confirm that our method outperforms existing approaches in reducing bias, making it a valuable contribution to efforts towards more ethical AI systems.</description>

      <title>TEL'M: Test and Evaluation of Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Language Models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities on some tasks while failing dramatically on others. The situation has generated considerable interest in understanding and comparing the capabilities of various Language Models (LMs) but those efforts have been largely ad hoc with results that are often little more than anecdotal. This is in stark contrast with testing and evaluation processes used in healthcare, radar signal processing, and other defense areas. In this paper, we describe Test and Evaluation of Language Models (TEL'M) as a principled approach for assessing the value of current and future LMs focused on high-value commercial, government and national security applications. We believe that this methodology could be applied to other Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies as part of the larger goal of "industrializing" AI.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs) are positioned to transition many areas of software. The technologies of interacting with data particularly have an important entanglement with LLMs as efficient and intuitive data interactions are paramount. In this paper, we present DB-GPT, a revolutionary and product-ready Python library that integrates LLMs into traditional data interaction tasks to enhance user experience and accessibility. DB-GPT is designed to understand data interaction tasks described by natural language and provide context-aware responses powered by LLMs, making it an indispensable tool for users ranging from novice to expert. Its system design supports deployment across local, distributed, and cloud environments. Beyond handling basic data interaction tasks like Text-to-SQL with LLMs, it can handle complex tasks like generative data analysis through a Multi-Agents framework and the Agentic Workflow Expression Language (AWEL). The Service-oriented Multi-model Management Framework (SMMF) ensures data privacy and security, enabling users to employ DB-GPT with private LLMs. Additionally, DB-GPT offers a series of product-ready features designed to enable users to integrate DB-GPT within their product environments easily. The code of DB-GPT is available at Github(https://github.com/eosphoros-ai/DB-GPT) which already has over 10.7k stars.</description>

      <title>Find The Gap: Knowledge Base Reasoning For Visual Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze knowledge-based visual question answering, for which given a question, the models need to ground it into the visual modality and retrieve the relevant knowledge from a given large knowledge base (KB) to be able to answer. Our analysis has two folds, one based on designing neural architectures and training them from scratch, and another based on large pre-trained language models (LLMs). Our research questions are: 1) Can we effectively augment models by explicit supervised retrieval of the relevant KB information to solve the KB-VQA problem? 2) How do task-specific and LLM-based models perform in the integration of visual and external knowledge, and multi-hop reasoning over both sources of information? 3) Is the implicit knowledge of LLMs sufficient for KB-VQA and to what extent it can replace the explicit KB? Our results demonstrate the positive impact of empowering task-specific and LLM models with supervised external and visual knowledge retrieval models. Our findings show that though LLMs are stronger in 1-hop reasoning, they suffer in 2-hop reasoning in comparison with our fine-tuned NN model even if the relevant information from both modalities is available to the model. Moreover, we observed that LLM models outperform the NN model for KB-related questions which confirms the effectiveness of implicit knowledge in LLMs however, they do not alleviate the need for external KB.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The burgeoning volume of digital content across diverse modalities necessitates efficient storage and retrieval methods. Conventional approaches struggle to cope with the escalating complexity and scale of multimedia data. In this paper, we proposed framework addresses this challenge by fusing AI-native multi-modal search capabilities with neural image compression. First we analyze the intricate relationship between compressibility and searchability, recognizing the pivotal role each plays in the efficiency of storage and retrieval systems. Through the usage of simple adapter is to bridge the feature of Learned Image Compression(LIC) and Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining(CLIP) while retaining semantic fidelity and retrieval of multi-modal data. Experimental evaluations on Kodak datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, showcasing significant enhancements in compression efficiency and search accuracy compared to existing methodologies. Our work marks a significant advancement towards scalable and efficient multi-modal search systems in the era of big data.</description>

      <title>Sparse Attention Regression Network Based Soil Fertility Prediction With Ummaso</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The challenge of imbalanced soil nutrient datasets significantly hampers accurate predictions of soil fertility. To tackle this, a new method is suggested in this research, combining Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) with Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO). The main aim is to counter the impact of uneven data distribution and improve soil fertility models' predictive precision. The model introduced uses Sparse Attention Regression, effectively incorporating pertinent features from the imbalanced dataset. UMAP is utilized initially to reduce data complexity, unveiling hidden structures and important patterns. Following this, LASSO is applied to refine features and enhance the model's interpretability. The experimental outcomes highlight the effectiveness of the UMAP and LASSO hybrid approach. The proposed model achieves outstanding performance metrics, reaching a predictive accuracy of 98%, demonstrating its capability in accurate soil fertility predictions. Additionally, it showcases a Precision of 91.25%, indicating its adeptness in identifying fertile soil instances accurately. The Recall metric stands at 90.90%, emphasizing the model's ability to capture true positive cases effectively.</description>

      <title>LLMs4OM: Matching Ontologies with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ontology Matching (OM), is a critical task in knowledge integration, where aligning heterogeneous ontologies facilitates data interoperability and knowledge sharing. Traditional OM systems often rely on expert knowledge or predictive models, with limited exploration of the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs). We present the LLMs4OM framework, a novel approach to evaluate the effectiveness of LLMs in OM tasks. This framework utilizes two modules for retrieval and matching, respectively, enhanced by zero-shot prompting across three ontology representations: concept, concept-parent, and concept-children. Through comprehensive evaluations using 20 OM datasets from various domains, we demonstrate that LLMs, under the LLMs4OM framework, can match and even surpass the performance of traditional OM systems, particularly in complex matching scenarios. Our results highlight the potential of LLMs to significantly contribute to the field of OM.</description>

      <title>Towards Complex Ontology Alignment using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ontology alignment, a critical process in the Semantic Web for detecting relationships between different ontologies, has traditionally focused on identifying so-called "simple" 1-to-1 relationships through class labels and properties comparison. The more practically useful exploration of more complex alignments remains a hard problem to automate, and as such is largely underexplored, i.e. in application practice it is usually done manually by ontology and domain experts. Recently, the surge in Natural Language Processing (NLP) capabilities, driven by advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), presents new opportunities for enhancing ontology engineering practices, including ontology alignment tasks. This paper investigates the application of LLM technologies to tackle the complex ontology alignment challenge. Leveraging a prompt-based approach and integrating rich ontology content so-called modules our work constitutes a significant advance towards automating the complex alignment task.</description>

      <title>Intriguing Properties of Positional Encoding in Time Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformer-based methods have made significant progress in time series forecasting (TSF). They primarily handle two types of tokens, i.e., temporal tokens that contain all variables of the same timestamp, and variable tokens that contain all input time points for a specific variable. Transformer-based methods rely on positional encoding (PE) to mark tokens' positions, facilitating the model to perceive the correlation between tokens. However, in TSF, research on PE remains insufficient. To address this gap, we conduct experiments and uncover intriguing properties of existing PEs in TSF: (i) The positional information injected by PEs diminishes as the network depth increases; (ii) Enhancing positional information in deep networks is advantageous for improving the model's performance; (iii) PE based on the similarity between tokens can improve the model's performance. Motivated by these findings, we introduce two new PEs: Temporal Position Encoding (T-PE) for temporal tokens and Variable Positional Encoding (V-PE) for variable tokens. Both T-PE and V-PE incorporate geometric PE based on tokens' positions and semantic PE based on the similarity between tokens but using different calculations. To leverage both the PEs, we design a Transformer-based dual-branch framework named T2B-PE. It first calculates temporal tokens' correlation and variable tokens' correlation respectively and then fuses the dual-branch features through the gated unit. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior robustness and effectiveness of T2B-PE. The code is available at: \href{https://github.com/jlu-phyComputer/T2B-PE}{https://github.com/jlu-phyComputer/T2B-PE}.</description>

      <title>CNN-based explanation ensembling for dataset, representation and explanations evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence has gained significant attention due to the widespread use of complex deep learning models in high-stake domains such as medicine, finance, and autonomous cars. However, different explanations often present different aspects of the model's behavior. In this research manuscript, we explore the potential of ensembling explanations generated by deep classification models using convolutional model. Through experimentation and analysis, we aim to investigate the implications of combining explanations to uncover a more coherent and reliable patterns of the model's behavior, leading to the possibility of evaluating the representation learned by the model. With our method, we can uncover problems of under-representation of images in a certain class. Moreover, we discuss other side benefits like features' reduction by replacing the original image with its explanations resulting in the removal of some sensitive information. Through the use of carefully selected evaluation metrics from the Quantus library, we demonstrated the method's superior performance in terms of Localisation and Faithfulness, compared to individual explanations.</description>

      <title>Disentangling Instructive Information from Ranked Multiple Candidates for Multi-Document Scientific Summarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automatically condensing multiple topic-related scientific papers into a succinct and concise summary is referred to as Multi-Document Scientific Summarization (MDSS). Currently, while commonly used abstractive MDSS methods can generate flexible and coherent summaries, the difficulty in handling global information and the lack of guidance during decoding still make it challenging to generate better summaries. To alleviate these two shortcomings, this paper introduces summary candidates into MDSS, utilizing the global information of the document set and additional guidance from the summary candidates to guide the decoding process. Our insights are twofold: Firstly, summary candidates can provide instructive information from both positive and negative perspectives, and secondly, selecting higher-quality candidates from multiple options contributes to producing better summaries. Drawing on the insights, we propose a summary candidates fusion framework -- Disentangling Instructive information from Ranked candidates (DIR) for MDSS. Specifically, DIR first uses a specialized pairwise comparison method towards multiple candidates to pick out those of higher quality. Then DIR disentangles the instructive information of summary candidates into positive and negative latent variables with Conditional Variational Autoencoder. These variables are further incorporated into the decoder to guide generation. We evaluate our approach with three different types of Transformer-based models and three different types of candidates, and consistently observe noticeable performance improvements according to automatic and human evaluation. More analyses further demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in handling global information and enhancing decoding controllability.</description>

      <title>MEEL: Multi-Modal Event Evolution Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-modal Event Reasoning (MMER) endeavors to endow machines with the ability to comprehend intricate event relations across diverse data modalities. MMER is fundamental and underlies a wide broad of applications. Despite extensive instruction fine-tuning, current multi-modal large language models still fall short in such ability. The disparity stems from that existing models are insufficient to capture underlying principles governing event evolution in various scenarios. In this paper, we introduce Multi-Modal Event Evolution Learning (MEEL) to enable the model to grasp the event evolution mechanism, yielding advanced MMER ability. Specifically, we commence with the design of event diversification to gather seed events from a rich spectrum of scenarios. Subsequently, we employ ChatGPT to generate evolving graphs for these seed events. We propose an instruction encapsulation process that formulates the evolving graphs into instruction-tuning data, aligning the comprehension of event reasoning to humans. Finally, we observe that models trained in this way are still struggling to fully comprehend event evolution. In such a case, we propose the guiding discrimination strategy, in which models are trained to discriminate the improper evolution direction. We collect and curate a benchmark M-EV2 for MMER. Extensive experiments on M-EV2 validate the effectiveness of our approach, showcasing competitive performance in open-source multi-modal LLMs.</description>

      <title>LAECIPS: Large Vision Model Assisted Adaptive Edge-Cloud Collaboration for IoT-based Perception System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent large vision models (e.g., SAM) enjoy great potential to facilitate intelligent perception with high accuracy. Yet, the resource constraints in the IoT environment tend to limit such large vision models to be locally deployed, incurring considerable inference latency thereby making it difficult to support real-time applications, such as autonomous driving and robotics. Edge-cloud collaboration with large-small model co-inference offers a promising approach to achieving high inference accuracy and low latency. However, existing edge-cloud collaboration methods are tightly coupled with the model architecture and cannot adapt to the dynamic data drifts in heterogeneous IoT environments. To address the issues, we propose LAECIPS, a new edge-cloud collaboration framework. In LAECIPS, both the large vision model on the cloud and the lightweight model on the edge are plug-and-play. We design an edge-cloud collaboration strategy based on hard input mining, optimized for both high accuracy and low latency. We propose to update the edge model and its collaboration strategy with the cloud under the supervision of the large vision model, so as to adapt to the dynamic IoT data streams. Theoretical analysis of LAECIPS proves its feasibility. Experiments conducted in a robotic semantic segmentation system using real-world datasets show that LAECIPS outperforms its state-of-the-art competitors in accuracy, latency, and communication overhead while having better adaptability to dynamic environments.</description>

      <title>Data Collection of Real-Life Knowledge Work in Context: The RLKWiC Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the years, various approaches have been employed to enhance the productivity of knowledge workers, from addressing psychological well-being to the development of personal knowledge assistants. A significant challenge in this research area has been the absence of a comprehensive, publicly accessible dataset that mirrors real-world knowledge work. Although a handful of datasets exist, many are restricted in access or lack vital information dimensions, complicating meaningful comparison and benchmarking in the domain. This paper presents RLKWiC, a novel dataset of Real-Life Knowledge Work in Context, derived from monitoring the computer interactions of eight participants over a span of two months. As the first publicly available dataset offering a wealth of essential information dimensions (such as explicated contexts, textual contents, and semantics), RLKWiC seeks to address the research gap in the personal information management domain, providing valuable insights for modeling user behavior.</description>

      <title>The Evolution of Learning: Assessing the Transformative Impact of Generative AI on Higher Education</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) models such as ChatGPT have experienced a surge in popularity, attracting 100 million active users in 2 months and generating an estimated 10 million daily queries. Despite this remarkable adoption, there remains a limited understanding to which extent this innovative technology influences higher education. This research paper investigates the impact of GAI on university students and Higher Education Institutions (HEIs). The study adopts a mixed-methods approach, combining a comprehensive survey with scenario analysis to explore potential benefits, drawbacks, and transformative changes the new technology brings. Using an online survey with 130 participants we assessed students' perspectives and attitudes concerning present ChatGPT usage in academics. Results show that students use the current technology for tasks like assignment writing and exam preparation and believe it to be a effective help in achieving academic goals. The scenario analysis afterwards projected potential future scenarios, providing valuable insights into the possibilities and challenges associated with incorporating GAI into higher education. The main motivation is to gain a tangible and precise understanding of the potential consequences for HEIs and to provide guidance responding to the evolving learning environment. The findings indicate that irresponsible and excessive use of the technology could result in significant challenges. Hence, HEIs must develop stringent policies, reevaluate learning objectives, upskill their lecturers, adjust the curriculum and reconsider examination approaches.</description>

      <title>AAVDiff: Experimental Validation of Enhanced Viability and Diversity in Recombinant Adeno-Associated Virus (AAV) Capsids through Diffusion Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) vectors have revolutionized gene therapy, but their broad tropism and suboptimal transduction efficiency limit their clinical applications. To overcome these limitations, researchers have focused on designing and screening capsid libraries to identify improved vectors. However, the large sequence space and limited resources present challenges in identifying viable capsid variants. In this study, we propose an end-to-end diffusion model to generate capsid sequences with enhanced viability. Using publicly available AAV2 data, we generated 38,000 diverse AAV2 viral protein (VP) sequences, and evaluated 8,000 for viral selection. The results attested the superiority of our model compared to traditional methods. Additionally, in the absence of AAV9 capsid data, apart from one wild-type sequence, we used the same model to directly generate a number of viable sequences with up to 9 mutations. we transferred the remaining 30,000 samples to the AAV9 domain. Furthermore, we conducted mutagenesis on AAV9 VP hypervariable regions VI and V, contributing to the continuous improvement of the AAV9 VP sequence. This research represents a significant advancement in the design and functional validation of rAAV vectors, offering innovative solutions to enhance specificity and transduction efficiency in gene therapy applications.</description>

      <title>Private Attribute Inference from Images with Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become ubiquitous in our daily tasks and digital interactions, associated privacy risks are increasingly in focus. While LLM privacy research has primarily focused on the leakage of model training data, it has recently been shown that the increase in models' capabilities has enabled LLMs to make accurate privacy-infringing inferences from previously unseen texts. With the rise of multimodal vision-language models (VLMs), capable of understanding both images and text, a pertinent question is whether such results transfer to the previously unexplored domain of benign images posted online. To investigate the risks associated with the image reasoning capabilities of newly emerging VLMs, we compile an image dataset with human-annotated labels of the image owner's personal attributes. In order to understand the additional privacy risk posed by VLMs beyond traditional human attribute recognition, our dataset consists of images where the inferable private attributes do not stem from direct depictions of humans. On this dataset, we evaluate the inferential capabilities of 7 state-of-the-art VLMs, finding that they can infer various personal attributes at up to 77.6% accuracy. Concerningly, we observe that accuracy scales with the general capabilities of the models, implying that future models can be misused as stronger adversaries, establishing an imperative for the development of adequate defenses.</description>

      <title>Efficient Parking Search using Shared Fleet Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finding an available on-street parking spot is a relevant problem of day-to-day life. In recent years, cities such as Melbourne and San Francisco deployed sensors that provide real-time information about the occupation of parking spots. Finding a free parking spot in such a smart environment can be modeled and solved as a Markov decision process (MDP). The problem has to consider uncertainty as available parking spots might not remain available until arrival due to other vehicles also claiming spots in the meantime. Knowing the parking intention of every vehicle in the environment would eliminate this uncertainty. Unfortunately, it does currently not seem realistic to have such data from all vehicles. In contrast, acquiring data from a subset of vehicles or a vehicle fleet appears feasible and has the potential to reduce uncertainty.
  In this paper, we examine the question of how useful sharing data within a vehicle fleet might be for the search times of particular drivers. We use fleet data to better estimate the availability of parking spots at arrival. Since optimal solutions for large scenarios are infeasible, we base our method on approximate solutions, which have been shown to perform well in single-agent settings. Our experiments are conducted on a simulation using real-world and synthetic data from the city of Melbourne. The results indicate that fleet data can significantly reduce search times for an available parking spot.</description>

      <title>Simplex Decomposition for Portfolio Allocation Constraints in Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Portfolio optimization tasks describe sequential decision problems in which the investor's wealth is distributed across a set of assets. Allocation constraints are used to enforce minimal or maximal investments into particular subsets of assets to control for objectives such as limiting the portfolio's exposure to a certain sector due to environmental concerns. Although methods for constrained Reinforcement Learning (CRL) can optimize policies while considering allocation constraints, it can be observed that these general methods yield suboptimal results. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to handle allocation constraints based on a decomposition of the constraint action space into a set of unconstrained allocation problems. In particular, we examine this approach for the case of two constraints. For example, an investor may wish to invest at least a certain percentage of the portfolio into green technologies while limiting the investment in the fossil energy sector. We show that the action space of the task is equivalent to the decomposed action space, and introduce a new reinforcement learning (RL) approach CAOSD, which is built on top of the decomposition. The experimental evaluation on real-world Nasdaq-100 data demonstrates that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art CRL benchmarks for portfolio optimization.</description>

      <title>Bootstrapping Linear Models for Fast Online Adaptation in Human-Agent Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Agents that assist people need to have well-initialized policies that can adapt quickly to align with their partners' reward functions. Initializing policies to maximize performance with unknown partners can be achieved by bootstrapping nonlinear models using imitation learning over large, offline datasets. Such policies can require prohibitive computation to fine-tune in-situ and therefore may miss critical run-time information about a partner's reward function as expressed through their immediate behavior. In contrast, online logistic regression using low-capacity models performs rapid inference and fine-tuning updates and thus can make effective use of immediate in-task behavior for reward function alignment. However, these low-capacity models cannot be bootstrapped as effectively by offline datasets and thus have poor initializations. We propose BLR-HAC, Bootstrapped Logistic Regression for Human Agent Collaboration, which bootstraps large nonlinear models to learn the parameters of a low-capacity model which then uses online logistic regression for updates during collaboration. We test BLR-HAC in a simulated surface rearrangement task and demonstrate that it achieves higher zero-shot accuracy than shallow methods and takes far less computation to adapt online while still achieving similar performance to fine-tuned, large nonlinear models.

      <title>N-Agent Ad Hoc Teamwork</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current approaches to learning cooperative behaviors in multi-agent settings assume relatively restrictive settings. In standard fully cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning, the learning algorithm controls \textit{all} agents in the scenario, while in ad hoc teamwork, the learning algorithm usually assumes control over only a $\textit{single}$ agent in the scenario. However, many cooperative settings in the real world are much less restrictive. For example, in an autonomous driving scenario, a company might train its cars with the same learning algorithm, yet once on the road, these cars must cooperate with cars from another company. Towards generalizing the class of scenarios that cooperative learning methods can address, we introduce $N$-agent ad hoc teamwork, in which a set of autonomous agents must interact and cooperate with dynamically varying numbers and types of teammates at evaluation time. This paper formalizes the problem, and proposes the $\textit{Policy Optimization with Agent Modelling}$ (POAM) algorithm. POAM is a policy gradient, multi-agent reinforcement learning approach to the NAHT problem, that enables adaptation to diverse teammate behaviors by learning representations of teammate behaviors. Empirical evaluation on StarCraft II tasks shows that POAM improves cooperative task returns compared to baseline approaches, and enables out-of-distribution generalization to unseen teammates.</description>

      <title>LaDiC: Are Diffusion Models Really Inferior to Autoregressive Counterparts for Image-to-Text Generation?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models have exhibited remarkable capabilities in text-to-image generation. However, their performance in image-to-text generation, specifically image captioning, has lagged behind Auto-Regressive (AR) models, casting doubt on their applicability for such tasks. In this work, we revisit diffusion models, highlighting their capacity for holistic context modeling and parallel decoding. With these benefits, diffusion models can alleviate the inherent limitations of AR methods, including their slow inference speed, error propagation, and unidirectional constraints. Furthermore, we identify the prior underperformance of diffusion models stemming from the absence of an effective latent space for image-text alignment, and the discrepancy between continuous diffusion processes and discrete textual data. In response, we introduce a novel architecture, LaDiC, which utilizes a split BERT to create a dedicated latent space for captions and integrates a regularization module to manage varying text lengths. Our framework also includes a diffuser for semantic image-to-text conversion and a Back&amp;Refine technique to enhance token interactivity during inference. LaDiC achieves state-of-the-art performance for diffusion-based methods on the MS COCO dataset with 38.2 BLEU@4 and 126.2 CIDEr, demonstrating exceptional performance without pre-training or ancillary modules. This indicates strong competitiveness with AR models, revealing the previously untapped potential of diffusion models in image-to-text generation.</description>

      <title>A biologically inspired computational trust model for open multi-agent systems which is resilient to trustor population changes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current trust and reputation models continue to have significant limitations, such as the inability to deal with agents constantly entering or exiting open multi-agent systems (open MAS), as well as continuously changing behaviors. Our study is based on CA, a previously proposed decentralized computational trust model from the trustee's point of view, inspired by synaptic plasticity and the formation of assemblies in the human brain. It is designed to meet the requirements of highly dynamic and open MAS, and its main difference with most conventional trust and reputation models is that the trustor does not select a trustee to delegate a task; instead, the trustee determines whether it is qualified to successfully execute it. We ran a series of simulations to compare CA model to FIRE, a well-established, decentralized trust and reputation model for open MAS under conditions of continuous trustee and trustor population replacement, as well as continuous change of trustees' abilities to perform tasks. The main finding is that FIRE is superior to changes in the trustee population, whereas CA is resilient to the trustor population changes. When the trustees switch performance profiles FIRE clearly outperforms despite the fact that both models' performances are significantly impacted by this environmental change. Findings lead us to conclude that learning to use the appropriate trust model, according to the dynamic conditions in effect could maximize the trustor's benefits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the first algorithm for model-based offline quantum reinforcement learning and demonstrates its functionality on the cart-pole benchmark. The model and the policy to be optimized are each implemented as variational quantum circuits. The model is trained by gradient descent to fit a pre-recorded data set. The policy is optimized with a gradient-free optimization scheme using the return estimate given by the model as the fitness function. This model-based approach allows, in principle, full realization on a quantum computer during the optimization phase and gives hope that a quantum advantage can be achieved as soon as sufficiently powerful quantum computers are available.</description>

      <title>Can AI Understand Our Universe? Test of Fine-Tuning GPT by Astrophysical Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: ChatGPT has been the most talked-about concept in recent months, captivating both professionals and the general public alike, and has sparked discussions about the changes that artificial intelligence (AI) will bring to the world. As physicists and astrophysicists, we are curious about if scientific data can be correctly analyzed by large language models (LLMs) and yield accurate physics. In this article, we fine-tune the generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) model by the astronomical data from the observations of galaxies, quasars, stars, gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), and the simulations of black holes (BHs), the fine-tuned model demonstrates its capability to classify astrophysical phenomena, distinguish between two types of GRBs, deduce the redshift of quasars, and estimate BH parameters. We regard this as a successful test, marking the LLM's proven efficacy in scientific research. With the ever-growing volume of multidisciplinary data and the advancement of AI technology, we look forward to the emergence of a more fundamental and comprehensive understanding of our universe. This article also shares some interesting thoughts on data collection and AI design. Using the approach of understanding the universe - looking outward at data and inward for fundamental building blocks - as a guideline, we propose a method of series expansion for AI, suggesting ways to train and control AI that is smarter than humans.</description>

      <title>Emergent Language Symbolic Autoencoder (ELSA) with Weak Supervision to Model Hierarchical Brain Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Brain networks display a hierarchical organization, a complexity that poses a challenge for existing deep learning models, often structured as flat classifiers, leading to difficulties in interpretability and the 'black box' issue. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel architecture: a symbolic autoencoder informed by weak supervision and an Emergent Language (EL) framework. This model moves beyond traditional flat classifiers by producing hierarchical clusters and corresponding imagery, subsequently represented through symbolic sentences to improve the clinical interpretability of hierarchically organized data such as intrinsic brain networks, which can be characterized using resting-state fMRI images. Our innovation includes a generalized hierarchical loss function designed to ensure that both sentences and images accurately reflect the hierarchical structure of functional brain networks. This enables us to model functional brain networks from a broader perspective down to more granular details. Furthermore, we introduce a quantitative method to assess the hierarchical consistency of these symbolic representations. Our qualitative analyses show that our model successfully generates hierarchically organized, clinically interpretable images, a finding supported by our quantitative evaluations. We find that our best performing loss function leads to a hierarchical consistency of over 97% when identifying images corresponding to brain networks. This approach not only advances the interpretability of deep learning models in neuroimaging analysis but also represents a significant step towards modeling the intricate hierarchical nature of brain networks.</description>

      <title>AIGeN: An Adversarial Approach for Instruction Generation in VLN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the last few years, the research interest in Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) has grown significantly. VLN is a challenging task that involves an agent following human instructions and navigating in a previously unknown environment to reach a specified goal. Recent work in literature focuses on different ways to augment the available datasets of instructions for improving navigation performance by exploiting synthetic training data. In this work, we propose AIGeN, a novel architecture inspired by Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) that produces meaningful and well-formed synthetic instructions to improve navigation agents' performance. The model is composed of a Transformer decoder (GPT-2) and a Transformer encoder (BERT). During the training phase, the decoder generates sentences for a sequence of images describing the agent's path to a particular point while the encoder discriminates between real and fake instructions. Experimentally, we evaluate the quality of the generated instructions and perform extensive ablation studies. Additionally, we generate synthetic instructions for 217K trajectories using AIGeN on Habitat-Matterport 3D Dataset (HM3D) and show an improvement in the performance of an off-the-shelf VLN method. The validation analysis of our proposal is conducted on REVERIE and R2R and highlights the promising aspects of our proposal, achieving state-of-the-art performance.</description>

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in sequence prediction, current methods lack attention-based mechanisms for next-frame prediction. Our work introduces VAPAAD or Vision Augmentation Prediction Autoencoder with Attention Design, an innovative model that enhances predictive performance by integrating attention designs, allowing for nuanced understanding and handling of temporal dynamics in video sequences. We demonstrate using the famous Moving MNIST dataset the robust performance of the proposed model and potential applicability of such design in the literature.</description>

      <title>Using Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) to merge precipitation data over mountainous area in Sierra Nevada</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Obtaining reliable precipitation estimation with high resolutions in time and space is of great importance to hydrological studies. However, accurately estimating precipitation is a challenging task over high mountainous complex terrain. The three widely used precipitation measurement approaches, namely rainfall gauge, precipitation radars, and satellite-based precipitation sensors, have their own pros and cons in producing reliable precipitation products over complex areas. One way to decrease the detection error probability and improve data reliability is precipitation data merging. With the rapid advancements in computational capabilities and the escalating volume and diversity of earth observational data, Deep Learning (DL) models have gained considerable attention in geoscience. In this study, a deep learning technique, namely Long Short-term Memory (LSTM), was employed to merge a radar-based and a satellite-based Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) precipitation product Integrated Multi-Satellite Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) precipitation product at hourly scale. The merged results are compared with the widely used reanalysis precipitation product, Multi-Radar Multi-Sensor (MRMS), and assessed against gauge observational data from the California Data Exchange Center (CDEC). The findings indicated that the LSTM-based merged precipitation notably underestimated gauge observations and, at times, failed to provide meaningful estimates, showing predominantly near-zero values. Relying solely on individual Quantitative Precipitation Estimates (QPEs) without additional meteorological input proved insufficient for generating reliable merged QPE. However, the merged results effectively captured the temporal trends of the observations, outperforming MRMS in this aspect. This suggested that incorporating bias correction techniques could potentially enhance the accuracy of the merged product.</description>

      <title>Language Model Cascades: Token-level uncertainty and beyond</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in language models (LMs) have led to significant improvements in quality on complex NLP tasks, but at the expense of increased inference costs. Cascading offers a simple strategy to achieve more favorable cost-quality tradeoffs: here, a small model is invoked for most "easy" instances, while a few "hard" instances are deferred to the large model. While the principles underpinning cascading are well-studied for classification tasks - with deferral based on predicted class uncertainty favored theoretically and practically - a similar understanding is lacking for generative LM tasks. In this work, we initiate a systematic study of deferral rules for LM cascades. We begin by examining the natural extension of predicted class uncertainty to generative LM tasks, namely, the predicted sequence uncertainty. We show that this measure suffers from the length bias problem, either over- or under-emphasizing outputs based on their lengths. This is because LMs produce a sequence of uncertainty values, one for each output token; and moreover, the number of output tokens is variable across examples. To mitigate this issue, we propose to exploit the richer token-level uncertainty information implicit in generative LMs. We argue that naive predicted sequence uncertainty corresponds to a simple aggregation of these uncertainties. By contrast, we show that incorporating token-level uncertainty through learned post-hoc deferral rules can significantly outperform such simple aggregation strategies, via experiments on a range of natural language benchmarks with FLAN-T5 models. We further show that incorporating embeddings from the smaller model and intermediate layers of the larger model can give an additional boost in the overall cost-quality tradeoff.</description>

      <title>Shaping Realities: Enhancing 3D Generative AI with Fabrication Constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative AI tools are becoming more prevalent in 3D modeling, enabling users to manipulate or create new models with text or images as inputs. This makes it easier for users to rapidly customize and iterate on their 3D designs and explore new creative ideas. These methods focus on the aesthetic quality of the 3D models, refining them to look similar to the prompts provided by the user. However, when creating 3D models intended for fabrication, designers need to trade-off the aesthetic qualities of a 3D model with their intended physical properties. To be functional post-fabrication, 3D models have to satisfy structural constraints informed by physical principles. Currently, such requirements are not enforced by generative AI tools. This leads to the development of aesthetically appealing, but potentially non-functional 3D geometry, that would be hard to fabricate and use in the real world. This workshop paper highlights the limitations of generative AI tools in translating digital creations into the physical world and proposes new augmentations to generative AI tools for creating physically viable 3D models. We advocate for the development of tools that manipulate or generate 3D models by considering not only the aesthetic appearance but also using physical properties as constraints. This exploration seeks to bridge the gap between digital creativity and real-world applicability, extending the creative potential of generative AI into the tangible domain.</description>

      <title>Optimal Kernel Tuning Parameter Prediction using Deep Sequence Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: GPU kernels have come to the forefront of comput- ing due to their utility in varied fields, from high-performance computing to machine learning. A typical GPU compute kernel is invoked millions, if not billions of times in a typical application, which makes their performance highly critical. Due to the unknown nature of the optimization surface, an exhaustive search is required to discover the global optimum, which is infeasible due to the possible exponential number of parameter combinations. In this work, we propose a methodology that uses deep sequence- to-sequence models to predict the optimal tuning parameters governing compute kernels. This work considers the prediction of kernel parameters as a sequence to the sequence translation problem, borrowing models from the Natural Language Process- ing (NLP) domain. Parameters describing the input, output and weight tensors are considered as the input language to the model that emits the corresponding kernel parameters. In essence, the model translates the problem parameter language to kernel parameter language. The core contributions of this work are: a) Proposing that a sequence to sequence model can accurately learn the performance dynamics of a GPU compute kernel b) A novel network architecture which predicts the kernel tuning parameters for GPU kernels, c) A constrained beam search which incorporates the physical limits of the GPU hardware as well as other expert knowledge reducing the search space. The proposed algorithm can achieve more than 90% accuracy on various convolutional kernels in MIOpen, the AMD machine learning primitives library. As a result, the proposed technique can reduce the development time and compute resources required to tune unseen input configurations, resulting in shorter development cycles, reduced development costs, and better user experience.</description>

      <title>EyeFormer: Predicting Personalized Scanpaths with Transformer-Guided Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: From a visual perception perspective, modern graphical user interfaces (GUIs) comprise a complex graphics-rich two-dimensional visuospatial arrangement of text, images, and interactive objects such as buttons and menus. While existing models can accurately predict regions and objects that are likely to attract attention ``on average'', so far there is no scanpath model capable of predicting scanpaths for an individual. To close this gap, we introduce EyeFormer, which leverages a Transformer architecture as a policy network to guide a deep reinforcement learning algorithm that controls gaze locations. Our model has the unique capability of producing personalized predictions when given a few user scanpath samples. It can predict full scanpath information, including fixation positions and duration, across individuals and various stimulus types. Additionally, we demonstrate applications in GUI layout optimization driven by our model. Our software and models will be publicly available.</description>

      <title>High-Resolution Detection of Earth Structural Heterogeneities from Seismic Amplitudes using Convolutional Neural Networks with Attention layers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Earth structural heterogeneities have a remarkable role in the petroleum economy for both exploration and production projects. Automatic detection of detailed structural heterogeneities is challenging when considering modern machine learning techniques like deep neural networks. Typically, these techniques can be an excellent tool for assisted interpretation of such heterogeneities, but it heavily depends on the amount of data to be trained.
  We propose an efficient and cost-effective architecture for detecting seismic structural heterogeneities using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) combined with Attention layers. The attention mechanism reduces costs and enhances accuracy, even in cases with relatively noisy data. Our model has half the parameters compared to the state-of-the-art, and it outperforms previous methods in terms of Intersection over Union (IoU) by 0.6% and precision by 0.4%. By leveraging synthetic data, we apply transfer learning to train and fine-tune the model, addressing the challenge of limited annotated data availability.</description>

      <title>Consistent Diffusion Meets Tweedie: Training Exact Ambient Diffusion Models with Noisy Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ambient diffusion is a recently proposed framework for training diffusion models using corrupted data. Both Ambient Diffusion and alternative SURE-based approaches for learning diffusion models from corrupted data resort to approximations which deteriorate performance. We present the first framework for training diffusion models that provably sample from the uncorrupted distribution given only noisy training data, solving an open problem in this space. Our key technical contribution is a method that uses a double application of Tweedie's formula and a consistency loss function that allows us to extend sampling at noise levels below the observed data noise. We also provide further evidence that diffusion models memorize from their training sets by identifying extremely corrupted images that are almost perfectly reconstructed, raising copyright and privacy concerns. Our method for training using corrupted samples can be used to mitigate this problem. We demonstrate this by fine-tuning Stable Diffusion XL to generate samples from a distribution using only noisy samples. Our framework reduces the amount of memorization of the fine-tuning dataset, while maintaining competitive performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building embodied AI systems that can follow arbitrary language instructions in any 3D environment is a key challenge for creating general AI. Accomplishing this goal requires learning to ground language in perception and embodied actions, in order to accomplish complex tasks. The Scalable, Instructable, Multiworld Agent (SIMA) project tackles this by training agents to follow free-form instructions across a diverse range of virtual 3D environments, including curated research environments as well as open-ended, commercial video games. Our goal is to develop an instructable agent that can accomplish anything a human can do in any simulated 3D environment. Our approach focuses on language-driven generality while imposing minimal assumptions. Our agents interact with environments in real-time using a generic, human-like interface: the inputs are image observations and language instructions and the outputs are keyboard-and-mouse actions. This general approach is challenging, but it allows agents to ground language across many visually complex and semantically rich environments while also allowing us to readily run agents in new environments. In this paper we describe our motivation and goal, the initial progress we have made, and promising preliminary results on several diverse research environments and a variety of commercial video games.</description>

      <title>Deferred NAM: Low-latency Top-K Context Injection via DeferredContext Encoding for Non-Streaming ASR</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contextual biasing enables speech recognizers to transcribe important phrases in the speaker's context, such as contact names, even if they are rare in, or absent from, the training data. Attention-based biasing is a leading approach which allows for full end-to-end cotraining of the recognizer and biasing system and requires no separate inference-time components. Such biasers typically consist of a context encoder; followed by a context filter which narrows down the context to apply, improving per-step inference time; and, finally, context application via cross attention. Though much work has gone into optimizing per-frame performance, the context encoder is at least as important: recognition cannot begin before context encoding ends. Here, we show the lightweight phrase selection pass can be moved before context encoding, resulting in a speedup of up to 16.1 times and enabling biasing to scale to 20K phrases with a maximum pre-decoding delay under 33ms. With the addition of phrase- and wordpiece-level cross-entropy losses, our technique also achieves up to a 37.5% relative WER reduction over the baseline without the losses and lightweight phrase selection pass.</description>

      <title>How faithful are RAG models? Quantifying the tug-of-war between RAG and LLMs' internal prior</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) is often used to fix hallucinations and provide up-to-date knowledge for large language models (LLMs). However, in cases when the LLM alone incorrectly answers a question, does providing the correct retrieved content always fix the error? Conversely, in cases where the retrieved content is incorrect, does the LLM know to ignore the wrong information, or does it recapitulate the error? To answer these questions, we systematically analyze the tug-of-war between a LLM's internal knowledge (i.e. its prior) and the retrieved information in settings when they disagree. We test GPT-4 and other LLMs on question-answering abilities across datasets with and without reference documents. As expected, providing the correct retrieved information fixes most model mistakes (94% accuracy). However, when the reference document is perturbed with increasing levels of wrong values, the LLM is more likely to recite the incorrect, modified information when its internal prior is weaker but is more resistant when its prior is stronger. Similarly, we also find that the more the modified information deviates from the model's prior, the less likely the model is to prefer it. These results highlight an underlying tension between a model's prior knowledge and the information presented in reference documents.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the utilization of large language models (LLMs) has proliferated worldwide, it is crucial for them to have adequate knowledge and fair representation for diverse global cultures. In this work, we uncover culture perceptions of three SOTA models on 110 countries and regions on 8 culture-related topics through culture-conditioned generations, and extract symbols from these generations that are associated to each culture by the LLM. We discover that culture-conditioned generation consist of linguistic "markers" that distinguish marginalized cultures apart from default cultures. We also discover that LLMs have an uneven degree of diversity in the culture symbols, and that cultures from different geographic regions have different presence in LLMs' culture-agnostic generation. Our findings promote further research in studying the knowledge and fairness of global culture perception in LLMs. Code and Data can be found in: https://github.com/huihanlhh/Culture-Gen/</description>

      <title>Towards a Novel Perspective on Adversarial Examples Driven by Frequency</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Enhancing our understanding of adversarial examples is crucial for the secure application of machine learning models in real-world scenarios. A prevalent method for analyzing adversarial examples is through a frequency-based approach. However, existing research indicates that attacks designed to exploit low-frequency or high-frequency information can enhance attack performance, leading to an unclear relationship between adversarial perturbations and different frequency components. In this paper, we seek to demystify this relationship by exploring the characteristics of adversarial perturbations within the frequency domain. We employ wavelet packet decomposition for detailed frequency analysis of adversarial examples and conduct statistical examinations across various frequency bands. Intriguingly, our findings indicate that significant adversarial perturbations are present within the high-frequency components of low-frequency bands. Drawing on this insight, we propose a black-box adversarial attack algorithm based on combining different frequency bands. Experiments conducted on multiple datasets and models demonstrate that combining low-frequency bands and high-frequency components of low-frequency bands can significantly enhance attack efficiency. The average attack success rate reaches 99\%, surpassing attacks that utilize a single frequency segment. Additionally, we introduce the normalized disturbance visibility index as a solution to the limitations of $L_2$ norm in assessing continuous and discrete perturbations.</description>

      <title>Anomaly Correction of Business Processes Using Transformer Autoencoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Event log records all events that occur during the execution of business processes, so detecting and correcting anomalies in event log can provide reliable guarantee for subsequent process analysis. The previous works mainly include next event prediction based methods and autoencoder-based methods. These methods cannot accurately and efficiently detect anomalies and correct anomalies at the same time, and they all rely on the set threshold to detect anomalies. To solve these problems, we propose a business process anomaly correction method based on Transformer autoencoder. By using self-attention mechanism and autoencoder structure, it can efficiently process event sequences of arbitrary length, and can directly output corrected business process instances, so that it can adapt to various scenarios. At the same time, the anomaly detection is transformed into a classification problem by means of selfsupervised learning, so that there is no need to set a specific threshold in anomaly detection. The experimental results on several real-life event logs show that the proposed method is superior to the previous methods in terms of anomaly detection accuracy and anomaly correction results while ensuring high running efficiency.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Implicit Indoor Scene Reconstruction with Frontier Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Implicit neural representations have demonstrated significant promise for 3D scene reconstruction. Recent works have extended their applications to autonomous implicit reconstruction through the Next Best View (NBV) based method. However, the NBV method cannot guarantee complete scene coverage and often necessitates extensive viewpoint sampling, particularly in complex scenes. In the paper, we propose to 1) incorporate frontier-based exploration tasks for global coverage with implicit surface uncertainty-based reconstruction tasks to achieve high-quality reconstruction. and 2) introduce a method to achieve implicit surface uncertainty using color uncertainty, which reduces the time needed for view selection. Further with these two tasks, we propose an adaptive strategy for switching modes in view path planning, to reduce time and maintain superior reconstruction quality. Our method exhibits the highest reconstruction quality among all planning methods and superior planning efficiency in methods involving reconstruction tasks. We deploy our method on a UAV and the results show that our method can plan multi-task views and reconstruct a scene with high quality.</description>

      <title>Closed-Loop Open-Vocabulary Mobile Manipulation with GPT-4V</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous robot navigation and manipulation in open environments require reasoning and replanning with closed-loop feedback. We present COME-robot, the first closed-loop framework utilizing the GPT-4V vision-language foundation model for open-ended reasoning and adaptive planning in real-world scenarios. We meticulously construct a library of action primitives for robot exploration, navigation, and manipulation, serving as callable execution modules for GPT-4V in task planning. On top of these modules, GPT-4V serves as the brain that can accomplish multimodal reasoning, generate action policy with code, verify the task progress, and provide feedback for replanning. Such design enables COME-robot to (i) actively perceive the environments, (ii) perform situated reasoning, and (iii) recover from failures. Through comprehensive experiments involving 8 challenging real-world tabletop and manipulation tasks, COME-robot demonstrates a significant improvement in task success rate (~25%) compared to state-of-the-art baseline methods. We further conduct comprehensive analyses to elucidate how COME-robot's design facilitates failure recovery, free-form instruction following, and long-horizon task planning.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Software Engineering in the Foundation Model Era: From Task-Driven AI Copilots to Goal-Driven AI Pair Programmers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advent of Foundation Models (FMs) and AI-powered copilots has transformed the landscape of software development, offering unprecedented code completion capabilities and enhancing developer productivity. However, the current task-driven nature of these copilots falls short in addressing the broader goals and complexities inherent in software engineering (SE). In this paper, we propose a paradigm shift towards goal-driven AI-powered pair programmers that collaborate with human developers in a more holistic and context-aware manner. We envision AI pair programmers that are goal-driven, human partners, SE-aware, and self-learning. These AI partners engage in iterative, conversation-driven development processes, aligning closely with human goals and facilitating informed decision-making. We discuss the desired attributes of such AI pair programmers and outline key challenges that must be addressed to realize this vision. Ultimately, our work represents a shift from AI-augmented SE to AI-transformed SE by replacing code completion with a collaborative partnership between humans and AI that enhances both productivity and software quality.</description>

      <title>Vision-and-Language Navigation via Causal Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the pursuit of robust and generalizable environment perception and language understanding, the ubiquitous challenge of dataset bias continues to plague vision-and-language navigation (VLN) agents, hindering their performance in unseen environments. This paper introduces the generalized cross-modal causal transformer (GOAT), a pioneering solution rooted in the paradigm of causal inference. By delving into both observable and unobservable confounders within vision, language, and history, we propose the back-door and front-door adjustment causal learning (BACL and FACL) modules to promote unbiased learning by comprehensively mitigating potential spurious correlations. Additionally, to capture global confounder features, we propose a cross-modal feature pooling (CFP) module supervised by contrastive learning, which is also shown to be effective in improving cross-modal representations during pre-training. Extensive experiments across multiple VLN datasets (R2R, REVERIE, RxR, and SOON) underscore the superiority of our proposed method over previous state-of-the-art approaches. Code is available at https://github.com/CrystalSixone/VLN-GOAT.</description>

      <title>Masked Autoencoders for Microscopy are Scalable Learners of Cellular Biology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Featurizing microscopy images for use in biological research remains a significant challenge, especially for large-scale experiments spanning millions of images. This work explores the scaling properties of weakly supervised classifiers and self-supervised masked autoencoders (MAEs) when training with increasingly larger model backbones and microscopy datasets. Our results show that ViT-based MAEs outperform weakly supervised classifiers on a variety of tasks, achieving as much as a 11.5% relative improvement when recalling known biological relationships curated from public databases. Additionally, we develop a new channel-agnostic MAE architecture (CA-MAE) that allows for inputting images of different numbers and orders of channels at inference time. We demonstrate that CA-MAEs effectively generalize by inferring and evaluating on a microscopy image dataset (JUMP-CP) generated under different experimental conditions with a different channel structure than our pretraining data (RPI-93M). Our findings motivate continued research into scaling self-supervised learning on microscopy data in order to create powerful foundation models of cellular biology that have the potential to catalyze advancements in drug discovery and beyond.</description>

      <title>Uncovering Latent Arguments in Social Media Messaging by Employing LLMs-in-the-Loop Strategy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The widespread use of social media has led to a surge in popularity for automated methods of analyzing public opinion. Supervised methods are adept at text categorization, yet the dynamic nature of social media discussions poses a continual challenge for these techniques due to the constant shifting of the focus. On the other hand, traditional unsupervised methods for extracting themes from public discourse, such as topic modeling, often reveal overarching patterns that might not capture specific nuances. Consequently, a significant portion of research into social media discourse still depends on labor-intensive manual coding techniques and a human-in-the-loop approach, which are both time-consuming and costly. In this work, we study the problem of discovering arguments associated with a specific theme. We propose a generic LLMs-in-the-Loop strategy that leverages the advanced capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract latent arguments from social media messaging. To demonstrate our approach, we apply our framework to contentious topics. We use two publicly available datasets: (1) the climate campaigns dataset of 14k Facebook ads with 25 themes and (2) the COVID-19 vaccine campaigns dataset of 9k Facebook ads with 14 themes. Furthermore, we analyze demographic targeting and the adaptation of messaging based on real-world events.</description>

      <title>HelixFold-Multimer: Elevating Protein Complex Structure Prediction to New Heights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While monomer protein structure prediction tools boast impressive accuracy, the prediction of protein complex structures remains a daunting challenge in the field. This challenge is particularly pronounced in scenarios involving complexes with protein chains from different species, such as antigen-antibody interactions, where accuracy often falls short. Limited by the accuracy of complex prediction, tasks based on precise protein-protein interaction analysis also face obstacles. In this report, we highlight the ongoing advancements of our protein complex structure prediction model, HelixFold-Multimer, underscoring its enhanced performance. HelixFold-Multimer provides precise predictions for diverse protein complex structures, especially in therapeutic protein interactions. Notably, HelixFold-Multimer achieves remarkable success in antigen-antibody and peptide-protein structure prediction, surpassing AlphaFold-Multimer by several folds. HelixFold-Multimer is now available for public use on the PaddleHelix platform, offering both a general version and an antigen-antibody version. Researchers can conveniently access and utilize this service for their development needs.</description>

      <title>OneActor: Consistent Character Generation via Cluster-Conditioned Guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models benefit artists with high-quality image generation. Yet its stochastic nature prevent artists from creating consistent images of the same character. Existing methods try to tackle this challenge and generate consistent content in various ways. However, they either depend on external data or require expensive tuning of the diffusion model. For this issue, we argue that a lightweight but intricate guidance is enough to function. Aiming at this, we lead the way to formalize the objective of consistent generation, derive a clustering-based score function and propose a novel paradigm, OneActor. We design a cluster-conditioned model which incorporates posterior samples to guide the denoising trajectories towards the target cluster. To overcome the overfitting challenge shared by one-shot tuning pipelines, we devise auxiliary components to simultaneously augment the tuning and regulate the inference. This technique is later verified to significantly enhance the content diversity of generated images. Comprehensive experiments show that our method outperforms a variety of baselines with satisfactory character consistency, superior prompt conformity as well as high image quality. And our method is at least 4 times faster than tuning-based baselines. Furthermore, to our best knowledge, we first prove that the semantic space has the same interpolation property as the latent space dose. This property can serve as another promising tool for fine generation control.</description>

      <title>Social Choice for AI Alignment: Dealing with Diverse Human Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10271v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Foundation models such as GPT-4 are fine-tuned to avoid unsafe or otherwise problematic behavior, so that, for example, they refuse to comply with requests for help with committing crimes or with producing racist text. One approach to fine-tuning, called reinforcement learning from human feedback, learns from humans' expressed preferences over multiple outputs. Another approach is constitutional AI, in which the input from humans is a list of high-level principles. But how do we deal with potentially diverging input from humans? How can we aggregate the input into consistent data about ''collective'' preferences or otherwise use it to make collective choices about model behavior? In this paper, we argue that the field of social choice is well positioned to address these questions, and we discuss ways forward for this agenda, drawing on discussions in a recent workshop on Social Choice for AI Ethics and Safety held in Berkeley, CA, USA in December 2023.</description>

      <title>OptiGrad: A Fair and more Efficient Price Elasticity Optimization via a Gradient Based Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to optimizing profit margins in non-life insurance markets through a gradient descent-based method, targeting three key objectives: 1) maximizing profit margins, 2) ensuring conversion rates, and 3) enforcing fairness criteria such as demographic parity (DP). Traditional pricing optimization, which heavily lean on linear and semi definite programming, encounter challenges in balancing profitability and fairness. These challenges become especially pronounced in situations that necessitate continuous rate adjustments and the incorporation of fairness criteria. Specifically, indirect Ratebook optimization, a widely-used method for new business price setting, relies on predictor models such as XGBoost or GLMs/GAMs to estimate on downstream individually optimized prices. However, this strategy is prone to sequential errors and struggles to effectively manage optimizations for continuous rate scenarios. In practice, to save time actuaries frequently opt for optimization within discrete intervals (e.g., range of [-20\%, +20\%] with fix increments) leading to approximate estimations. Moreover, to circumvent infeasible solutions they often use relaxed constraints leading to suboptimal pricing strategies. The reverse-engineered nature of traditional models complicates the enforcement of fairness and can lead to biased outcomes. Our method addresses these challenges by employing a direct optimization strategy in the continuous space of rates and by embedding fairness through an adversarial predictor model. This innovation not only reduces sequential errors and simplifies the complexities found in traditional models but also directly integrates fairness measures into the commercial premium calculation. We demonstrate improved margin performance and stronger enforcement of fairness highlighting the critical need to evolve existing pricing strategies.</description>

      <title>Engineering software 2.0 by interpolating neural networks: unifying training, solving, and calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) and neural network theories has revolutionized the way software is programmed, shifting from a hard-coded series of codes to a vast neural network. However, this transition in engineering software has faced challenges such as data scarcity, multi-modality of data, low model accuracy, and slow inference. Here, we propose a new network based on interpolation theories and tensor decomposition, the interpolating neural network (INN). Instead of interpolating training data, a common notion in computer science, INN interpolates interpolation points in the physical space whose coordinates and values are trainable. It can also extrapolate if the interpolation points reside outside of the range of training data and the interpolation functions have a larger support domain. INN features orders of magnitude fewer trainable parameters, faster training, a smaller memory footprint, and higher model accuracy compared to feed-forward neural networks (FFNN) or physics-informed neural networks (PINN). INN is poised to usher in Engineering Software 2.0, a unified neural network that spans various domains of space, time, parameters, and initial/boundary conditions. This has previously been computationally prohibitive due to the exponentially growing number of trainable parameters, easily exceeding the parameter size of ChatGPT, which is over 1 trillion. INN addresses this challenge by leveraging tensor decomposition and tensor product, with adaptable network architecture.</description>

Abstract: Predicting the future is of great interest across many aspects of human activity. Businesses are interested in future trends, traders are interested in future stock prices, and companies are highly interested in future technological breakthroughs. While there are many automated systems for predicting future numerical data, such as weather, stock prices, and demand for products, there is relatively little work in automatically predicting textual data. Humans are interested in textual data predictions because it is a natural format for our consumption, and experts routinely make predictions in a textual format (Christensen et al., 2004; Tetlock &amp; Gardner, 2015; Frick, 2015). However, there has been relatively little formalization of this general problem in the machine learning or natural language processing communities. To address this gap, we introduce the task of future language modeling: probabilistic modeling of texts in the future based on a temporal history of texts. To our knowledge, our work is the first work to formalize the task of predicting the future in this way. We show that it is indeed possible to build future language models that improve upon strong non-temporal language model baselines, opening the door to working on this important, and widely applicable problem.</description>

Abstract: Recently, growing health awareness, novel methods allow individuals to monitor sleep at home. Utilizing sleep sounds offers advantages over conventional methods like smartwatches, being non-intrusive, and capable of detecting various physiological activities. This study aims to construct a machine learning-based sleep assessment model providing evidence-based assessments, such as poor sleep due to frequent movement during sleep onset. Extracting sleep sound events, deriving latent representations using VAE, clustering with GMM, and training LSTM for subjective sleep assessment achieved a high accuracy of 94.8% in distinguishing sleep satisfaction. Moreover, TimeSHAP revealed differences in impactful sound event types and timings for different individuals.</description>

      <title>Learnable Prompt for Few-Shot Semantic Segmentation in Remote Sensing Domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Few-shot segmentation is a task to segment objects or regions of novel classes within an image given only a few annotated examples. In the generalized setting, the task extends to segment both the base and the novel classes. The main challenge is how to train the model such that the addition of novel classes does not hurt the base classes performance, also known as catastrophic forgetting. To mitigate this issue, we use SegGPT as our base model and train it on the base classes. Then, we use separate learnable prompts to handle predictions for each novel class. To handle various object sizes which typically present in remote sensing domain, we perform patch-based prediction. To address the discontinuities along patch boundaries, we propose a patch-and-stitch technique by re-framing the problem as an image inpainting task. During inference, we also utilize image similarity search over image embeddings for prompt selection and novel class filtering to reduce false positive predictions. Based on our experiments, our proposed method boosts the weighted mIoU of a simple fine-tuned SegGPT from 15.96 to 35.08 on the validation set of few-shot OpenEarthMap dataset given in the challenge.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Context Merging: Better Long Context Understanding for Pre-trained LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance in various natural language processing tasks. However, a primary constraint they face is the context limit, i.e., the maximum number of tokens they can process. Previous works have explored architectural changes and modifications in positional encoding to relax the constraint, but they often require expensive training or do not address the computational demands of self-attention. In this paper, we present Hierarchical cOntext MERging (HOMER), a new training-free scheme designed to overcome the limitations. HOMER uses a divide-and-conquer algorithm, dividing long inputs into manageable chunks. Each chunk is then processed collectively, employing a hierarchical strategy that merges adjacent chunks at progressive transformer layers. A token reduction technique precedes each merging, ensuring memory usage efficiency. We also propose an optimized computational order reducing the memory requirement to logarithmically scale with respect to input length, making it especially favorable for environments with tight memory restrictions. Our experiments demonstrate the proposed method's superior performance and memory efficiency, enabling the broader use of LLMs in contexts requiring extended context. Code is available at https://github.com/alinlab/HOMER.</description>

      <title>Learning and Optimization for Price-based Demand Response of Electric Vehicle Charging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the context of charging electric vehicles (EVs), the price-based demand response (PBDR) is becoming increasingly significant for charging load management. Such response usually encourages cost-sensitive customers to adjust their energy demand in response to changes in price for financial incentives. Thus, to model and optimize EV charging, it is important for charging station operator to model the PBDR patterns of EV customers by precisely predicting charging demands given price signals. Then the operator refers to these demands to optimize charging station power allocation policy. The standard pipeline involves offline fitting of a PBDR function based on historical EV charging records, followed by applying estimated EV demands in downstream charging station operation optimization. In this work, we propose a new decision-focused end-to-end framework for PBDR modeling that combines prediction errors and downstream optimization cost errors in the model learning stage. We evaluate the effectiveness of our method on a simulation of charging station operation with synthetic PBDR patterns of EV customers, and experimental results demonstrate that this framework can provide a more reliable prediction model for the ultimate optimization process, leading to more effective optimization solutions in terms of cost savings and charging station operation objectives with only a few training samples.</description>

      <title>CARE to Compare: A real-world dataset for anomaly detection in wind turbine data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Anomaly detection plays a crucial role in the field of predictive maintenance for wind turbines, yet the comparison of different algorithms poses a difficult task because domain specific public datasets are scarce. Many comparisons of different approaches either use benchmarks composed of data from many different domains, inaccessible data or one of the few publicly available datasets which lack detailed information about the faults. Moreover, many publications highlight a couple of case studies where fault detection was successful. With this paper we publish a high quality dataset that contains data from 36 wind turbines across 3 different wind farms as well as the most detailed fault information of any public wind turbine dataset as far as we know. The new dataset contains 89 years worth of real-world operating data of wind turbines, distributed across 44 labeled time frames for anomalies that led up to faults, as well as 51 time series representing normal behavior. Additionally, the quality of training data is ensured by turbine-status-based labels for each data point. Furthermore, we propose a new scoring method, called CARE (Coverage, Accuracy, Reliability and Earliness), which takes advantage of the information depth that is present in the dataset to identify a good all-around anomaly detection model. This score considers the anomaly detection performance, the ability to recognize normal behavior properly and the capability to raise as few false alarms as possible while simultaneously detecting anomalies early.</description>

      <title>Prescribing the Right Remedy: Mitigating Hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models via Targeted Instruction Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite achieving outstanding performance on various cross-modal tasks, current large vision-language models (LVLMs) still suffer from hallucination issues, manifesting as inconsistencies between their generated responses and the corresponding images. Prior research has implicated that the low quality of instruction data, particularly the skewed balance between positive and negative samples, is a significant contributor to model hallucinations. Recently, researchers have proposed high-quality instruction datasets, such as LRV-Instruction, to mitigate model hallucination. Nonetheless, our investigation reveals that hallucinatory concepts from different LVLMs exhibit specificity, i.e. the distribution of hallucinatory concepts varies significantly across models. Existing datasets did not consider the hallucination specificity of different models in the design processes, thereby diminishing their efficacy in mitigating model hallucination. In this paper, we propose a targeted instruction data generation framework named DFTG that tailored to the hallucination specificity of different models. Concretely, DFTG consists of two stages: hallucination diagnosis, which extracts the necessary information from the model's responses and images for hallucination diagnosis; and targeted data generation, which generates targeted instruction data based on diagnostic results. The experimental results on hallucination benchmarks demonstrate that the targeted instruction data generated by our method are more effective in mitigating hallucinations compared to previous datasets.</description>

      <title>Generating Counterfactual Trajectories with Latent Diffusion Models for Concept Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Trustworthiness is a major prerequisite for the safe application of opaque deep learning models in high-stakes domains like medicine. Understanding the decision-making process not only contributes to fostering trust but might also reveal previously unknown decision criteria of complex models that could advance the state of medical research. The discovery of decision-relevant concepts from black box models is a particularly challenging task. This study proposes Concept Discovery through Latent Diffusion-based Counterfactual Trajectories (CDCT), a novel three-step framework for concept discovery leveraging the superior image synthesis capabilities of diffusion models. In the first step, CDCT uses a Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) to generate a counterfactual trajectory dataset. This dataset is used to derive a disentangled representation of classification-relevant concepts using a Variational Autoencoder (VAE). Finally, a search algorithm is applied to identify relevant concepts in the disentangled latent space. The application of CDCT to a classifier trained on the largest public skin lesion dataset revealed not only the presence of several biases but also meaningful biomarkers. Moreover, the counterfactuals generated within CDCT show better FID scores than those produced by a previously established state-of-the-art method, while being 12 times more resource-efficient. Unsupervised concept discovery holds great potential for the application of trustworthy AI and the further development of human knowledge in various domains. CDCT represents a further step in this direction.</description>

      <title>Second Edition FRCSyn Challenge at CVPR 2024: Face Recognition Challenge in the Era of Synthetic Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synthetic data is gaining increasing relevance for training machine learning models. This is mainly motivated due to several factors such as the lack of real data and intra-class variability, time and errors produced in manual labeling, and in some cases privacy concerns, among others. This paper presents an overview of the 2nd edition of the Face Recognition Challenge in the Era of Synthetic Data (FRCSyn) organized at CVPR 2024. FRCSyn aims to investigate the use of synthetic data in face recognition to address current technological limitations, including data privacy concerns, demographic biases, generalization to novel scenarios, and performance constraints in challenging situations such as aging, pose variations, and occlusions. Unlike the 1st edition, in which synthetic data from DCFace and GANDiffFace methods was only allowed to train face recognition systems, in this 2nd edition we propose new sub-tasks that allow participants to explore novel face generative methods. The outcomes of the 2nd FRCSyn Challenge, along with the proposed experimental protocol and benchmarking contribute significantly to the application of synthetic data to face recognition.</description>

      <title>Reasoning on Efficient Knowledge Paths:Knowledge Graph Guides Large Language Model for Domain Question Answering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), such as GPT3.5, GPT4 and LLAMA2 perform surprisingly well and outperform human experts on many tasks. However, in many domain-specific evaluations, these LLMs often suffer from hallucination problems due to insufficient training of relevant corpus. Furthermore, fine-tuning large models may face problems such as the LLMs are not open source or the construction of high-quality domain instruction is difficult. Therefore, structured knowledge databases such as knowledge graph can better provide domain back- ground knowledge for LLMs and make full use of the reasoning and analysis capabilities of LLMs. In some previous works, LLM was called multiple times to determine whether the current triplet was suitable for inclusion in the subgraph when retrieving subgraphs through a question. Especially for the question that require a multi-hop reasoning path, frequent calls to LLM will consume a lot of computing power. Moreover, when choosing the reasoning path, LLM will be called once for each step, and if one of the steps is selected incorrectly, it will lead to the accumulation of errors in the following steps. In this paper, we integrated and optimized a pipeline for selecting reasoning paths from KG based on LLM, which can reduce the dependency on LLM. In addition, we propose a simple and effective subgraph retrieval method based on chain of thought (CoT) and page rank which can returns the paths most likely to contain the answer. We conduct experiments on three datasets: GenMedGPT-5k [14], WebQuestions [2], and CMCQA [21]. Finally, RoK can demonstrate that using fewer LLM calls can achieve the same results as previous SOTAs models.</description>

      <title>I/O in Machine Learning Applications on HPC Systems: A 360-degree Survey</title>

Abstract: High-Performance Computing (HPC) systems excel in managing distributed workloads, and the growing interest in Artificial Intelligence (AI) has resulted in a surge in demand for faster methods of Machine Learning (ML) model training and inference. In the past, research on HPC I/O focused on optimizing the underlying storage system for modeling and simulation applications and checkpointing the results, causing writes to be the dominant I/O operation. These applications typically access large portions of the data written by simulations or experiments. ML workloads, in contrast, perform small I/O reads spread across a large number of random files. This shift of I/O access patterns poses several challenges to HPC storage systems. In this paper, we survey I/O in ML applications on HPC systems, and target literature within a 6-year time window from 2019 to 2024. We provide an overview of the common phases of ML, review available profilers and benchmarks, examine the I/O patterns encountered during ML training, explore I/O optimizations utilized in modern ML frameworks and proposed in recent literature, and lastly, present gaps requiring further R&amp;D. We seek to summarize the common practices used in accessing data by ML applications and expose research gaps that could spawn further R&amp;D.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) aims to learn policies from static datasets of previously collected trajectories. Existing methods for offline RL either constrain the learned policy to the support of offline data or utilize model-based virtual environments to generate simulated rollouts. However, these methods suffer from (i) poor generalization to unseen states; and (ii) trivial improvement from low-qualified rollout simulation. In this paper, we propose offline trajectory generalization through world transformers for offline reinforcement learning (OTTO). Specifically, we use casual Transformers, a.k.a. World Transformers, to predict state dynamics and the immediate reward. Then we propose four strategies to use World Transformers to generate high-rewarded trajectory simulation by perturbing the offline data. Finally, we jointly use offline data with simulated data to train an offline RL algorithm. OTTO serves as a plug-in module and can be integrated with existing offline RL methods to enhance them with better generalization capability of transformers and high-rewarded data augmentation. Conducting extensive experiments on D4RL benchmark datasets, we verify that OTTO significantly outperforms state-of-the-art offline RL methods.</description>

Abstract: Image recognition techniques heavily rely on abundant labeled data, particularly in medical contexts. Addressing the challenges associated with obtaining labeled data has led to the prominence of self-supervised learning and semi-supervised learning, especially in scenarios with limited annotated data. In this paper, we proposed an innovative approach by integrating self-supervised learning into semi-supervised models to enhance medical image recognition. Our methodology commences with pre-training on unlabeled data utilizing the BYOL method. Subsequently, we merge pseudo-labeled and labeled datasets to construct a neural network classifier, refining it through iterative fine-tuning. Experimental results on three different datasets demonstrate that our approach optimally leverages unlabeled data, outperforming existing methods in terms of accuracy for medical image recognition.</description>

Abstract: Tactile sensing presents a promising opportunity for enhancing the interaction capabilities of today's robots. BioTac is a commonly used tactile sensor that enables robots to perceive and respond to physical tactile stimuli. However, the sensor's non-linearity poses challenges in simulating its behavior. In this paper, we first investigate a BioTac simulation that uses temperature, force, and contact point positions to predict the sensor outputs. We show that training with BioTac temperature readings does not yield accurate sensor output predictions during deployment. Consequently, we tested three alternative models, i.e., an XGBoost regressor, a neural network, and a transformer encoder. We train these models without temperature readings and provide a detailed investigation of the window size of the input vectors. We demonstrate that we achieve statistically significant improvements over the baseline network. Furthermore, our results reveal that the XGBoost regressor and transformer outperform traditional feed-forward neural networks in this task. We make all our code and results available online on https://github.com/wzaielamri/Optimizing_BioTac_Simulation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivation. While recent studies show high accuracy in the classification of Alzheimer's disease using deep neural networks, the underlying learned concepts have not been investigated.
  Goals. To systematically identify changes in brain regions through concepts learned by the deep neural network for model validation.
  Approach. Using quantitative R2* maps we separated Alzheimer's patients (n=117) from normal controls (n=219) by using a convolutional neural network and systematically investigated the learned concepts using Concept Relevance Propagation and compared these results to a conventional region of interest-based analysis.
  Results. In line with established histological findings and the region of interest-based analyses, highly relevant concepts were primarily found in and adjacent to the basal ganglia.
  Impact. The identification of concepts learned by deep neural networks for disease classification enables validation of the models and could potentially improve reliability.</description>

      <title>AGHINT: Attribute-Guided Representation Learning on Heterogeneous Information Networks with Transformer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10443v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) have achieved impressive success in representation learning by capturing long-range dependencies and heterogeneity at the node level. However, few existing studies have delved into the utilization of node attributes in heterogeneous information networks (HINs). In this paper, we investigate the impact of inter-node attribute disparities on HGNNs performance within the benchmark task, i.e., node classification, and empirically find that typical models exhibit significant performance decline when classifying nodes whose attributes markedly differ from their neighbors. To alleviate this issue, we propose a novel Attribute-Guided heterogeneous Information Networks representation learning model with Transformer (AGHINT), which allows a more effective aggregation of neighbor node information under the guidance of attributes. Specifically, AGHINT transcends the constraints of the original graph structure by directly integrating higher-order similar neighbor features into the learning process and modifies the message-passing mechanism between nodes based on their attribute disparities. Extensive experimental results on three real-world heterogeneous graph benchmarks with target node attributes demonstrate that AGHINT outperforms the state-of-the-art.</description>

Abstract: Diffusion models have been extensively used in data generation tasks and are recognized as one of the best generative models. However, their time-consuming deployment, long inference time, and requirements on large memory limit their application on mobile devices. In this paper, we propose a method based on the improved Straight-Through Estimator to improve the deployment efficiency of diffusion models. Specifically, we add sparse masks to the Convolution and Linear layers in a pre-trained diffusion model, then use design progressive sparsity for model training in the fine-tuning stage, and switch the inference mask on and off, which supports a flexible choice of sparsity during inference according to the FID and MACs requirements. Experiments on four datasets conducted on a state-of-the-art Transformer-based diffusion model demonstrate that our method reduces MACs by $50\%$ while increasing FID by only 1.5 on average. Under other MACs conditions, the FID is also lower than 1$\sim$137 compared to other methods.</description>

      <title>A Computer Vision-Based Quality Assessment Technique for the automatic control of consumables for analytical laboratories</title>

Abstract: The rapid growth of the Industry 4.0 paradigm is increasing the pressure to develop effective automated monitoring systems. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a convenient tool to improve the efficiency of industrial processes while reducing errors and waste. In fact, it allows the use of real-time data to increase the effectiveness of monitoring systems, minimize errors, make the production process more sustainable, and save costs. In this paper, a novel automatic monitoring system is proposed in the context of production process of plastic consumables used in analysis laboratories, with the aim to increase the effectiveness of the control process currently performed by a human operator. In particular, we considered the problem of classifying the presence or absence of a transparent anticoagulant substance inside test tubes. Specifically, a hand-designed deep network model is used and compared with some state-of-the-art models for its ability to categorize different images of vials that can be either filled with the anticoagulant or empty. Collected results indicate that the proposed approach is competitive with state-of-the-art models in terms of accuracy. Furthermore, we increased the complexity of the task by training the models on the ability to discriminate not only the presence or absence of the anticoagulant inside the vial, but also the size of the test tube. The analysis performed in the latter scenario confirms the competitiveness of our approach. Moreover, our model is remarkably superior in terms of its generalization ability and requires significantly fewer resources. These results suggest the possibility of successfully implementing such a model in the production process of a plastic consumables company.</description>

      <title>Advancing Long-Term Multi-Energy Load Forecasting with Patchformer: A Patch and Transformer-Based Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the context of increasing demands for long-term multi-energy load forecasting in real-world applications, this paper introduces Patchformer, a novel model that integrates patch embedding with encoder-decoder Transformer-based architectures. To address the limitation in existing Transformer-based models, which struggle with intricate temporal patterns in long-term forecasting, Patchformer employs patch embedding, which predicts multivariate time-series data by separating it into multiple univariate data and segmenting each of them into multiple patches. This method effectively enhances the model's ability to capture local and global semantic dependencies. The numerical analysis shows that the Patchformer obtains overall better prediction accuracy in both multivariate and univariate long-term forecasting on the novel Multi-Energy dataset and other benchmark datasets. In addition, the positive effect of the interdependence among energy-related products on the performance of long-term time-series forecasting across Patchformer and other compared models is discovered, and the superiority of the Patchformer against other models is also demonstrated, which presents a significant advancement in handling the interdependence and complexities of long-term multi-energy forecasting. Lastly, Patchformer is illustrated as the only model that follows the positive correlation between model performance and the length of the past sequence, which states its ability to capture long-range past local semantic information.</description>

      <title>DESTEIN: Navigating Detoxification of Language Models via Universal Steering Pairs and Head-wise Activation Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the remarkable achievements of language models (LMs) across a broad spectrum of tasks, their propensity for generating toxic outputs remains a prevalent concern. Current solutions involving fine-tuning or auxiliary models usually require extensive memory and computational resources, rendering them less practical for deployment in large language models (LLMs). In this paper, we propose DeStein, a novel method that detoxififies LMs by altering their internal representations in the activation space with lower resource and time cost. Specifically, we leverage self-induced steering pairs to identify detoxification vectors through arithmetic operations in the activation space. During inference, detoxification is achieved by blending the detoxification vectors with the original representations. Empirical results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches on popular detoxification metrics, while also maintaining satisfactory generation quality and diversity. Furthermore, we extend our method to multiple LLMs, demonstrating its practicality and scalability. Warning: some example model outputs contain highly offensive or disturbing text.</description>

      <title>Robust Noisy Label Learning via Two-Stream Sample Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Noisy label learning aims to learn robust networks under the supervision of noisy labels, which plays a critical role in deep learning. Existing work either conducts sample selection or label correction to deal with noisy labels during the model training process. In this paper, we design a simple yet effective sample selection framework, termed Two-Stream Sample Distillation (TSSD), for noisy label learning, which can extract more high-quality samples with clean labels to improve the robustness of network training. Firstly, a novel Parallel Sample Division (PSD) module is designed to generate a certain training set with sufficient reliable positive and negative samples by jointly considering the sample structure in feature space and the human prior in loss space. Secondly, a novel Meta Sample Purification (MSP) module is further designed to mine adequate semi-hard samples from the remaining uncertain training set by learning a strong meta classifier with extra golden data. As a result, more and more high-quality samples will be distilled from the noisy training set to train networks robustly in every iteration. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets, including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Tiny-ImageNet, and Clothing-1M, show that our method has achieved state-of-the-art results over its competitors.</description>

      <title>When Emotional Stimuli meet Prompt Designing: An Auto-Prompt Graphical Paradigm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the development of Large Language Models (LLM), numerous prompts have been proposed, each with a rich set of features and their own merits. This paper summarizes the prompt words for large language models (LLMs), categorizing them into stimulating and framework types, and proposes an Auto-Prompt Graphical Paradigm(APGP) that combines both stimulating and framework prompts to enhance the problem-solving capabilities of LLMs across multiple domains, then exemplifies it with a framework that adheres to this paradigm. The framework involves automated prompt generation and consideration of emotion-stimulus factors, guiding LLMs in problem abstraction, diversified solutions generation, comprehensive optimization, and self-verification after providing answers, ensuring solution accuracy. Compared to traditional stimuli and framework prompts, this framework integrates the advantages of both by adopting automated approaches inspired by APE work, overcoming the limitations of manually designed prompts. Test results on the ruozhiba and BBH datasets demonstrate that this framework can effectively improve the efficiency and accuracy of LLMs in problem-solving, paving the way for new applications of LLMs.</description>

      <title>Self-Supervised Visual Preference Alignment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper makes the first attempt towards unsupervised preference alignment in Vision-Language Models (VLMs). We generate chosen and rejected responses with regard to the original and augmented image pairs, and conduct preference alignment with direct preference optimization. It is based on a core idea: properly designed augmentation to the image input will induce VLM to generate false but hard negative responses, which helps the model to learn from and produce more robust and powerful answers. The whole pipeline no longer hinges on supervision from GPT4 or human involvement during alignment, and is highly efficient with few lines of code. With only 8k randomly sampled unsupervised data, it achieves 90\% relative score to GPT-4 on complex reasoning in LLaVA-Bench, and improves LLaVA-7B/13B by 6.7\%/5.6\% score on complex multi-modal benchmark MM-Vet. Visualizations shows its improved ability to align with user-intentions. A series of ablations are firmly conducted to reveal the latent mechanism of the approach, which also indicates its potential towards further scaling. Code will be available.</description>

      <title>A Sentiment Analysis of Medical Text Based on Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The field of natural language processing (NLP) has made significant progress with the rapid development of deep learning technologies. One of the research directions in text sentiment analysis is sentiment analysis of medical texts, which holds great potential for application in clinical diagnosis. However, the medical field currently lacks sufficient text datasets, and the effectiveness of sentiment analysis is greatly impacted by different model design approaches, which presents challenges. Therefore, this paper focuses on the medical domain, using bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) as the basic pre-trained model and experimenting with modules such as convolutional neural network (CNN), fully connected network (FCN), and graph convolutional networks (GCN) at the output layer. Experiments and analyses were conducted on the METS-CoV dataset to explore the training performance after integrating different deep learning networks. The results indicate that CNN models outperform other networks when trained on smaller medical text datasets in combination with pre-trained models like BERT. This study highlights the significance of model selection in achieving effective sentiment analysis in the medical domain and provides a reference for future research to develop more efficient model architectures.</description>

      <title>White Men Lead, Black Women Help: Uncovering Gender, Racial, and Intersectional Bias in Language Agency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Social biases can manifest in language agency. For instance, White individuals and men are often described as "agentic" and achievement-oriented, whereas Black individuals and women are frequently described as "communal" and as assisting roles. This study establishes agency as an important aspect of studying social biases in both human-written and Large Language Model (LLM)-generated texts. To accurately measure "language agency" at sentence level, we propose a Language Agency Classification dataset to train reliable agency classifiers. We then use an agency classifier to reveal notable language agency biases in 6 datasets of human- or LLM-written texts, including biographies, professor reviews, and reference letters. While most prior NLP research on agency biases focused on single dimensions, we comprehensively explore language agency biases in gender, race, and intersectional identities. We observe that (1) language agency biases in human-written texts align with real-world social observations; (2) LLM-generated texts demonstrate remarkably higher levels of language agency bias than human-written texts; and (3) critical biases in language agency target people of minority groups--for instance, languages used to describe Black females exhibit the lowest level of agency across datasets. Our findings reveal intricate social biases in human- and LLM-written texts through the lens of language agency, warning against using LLM generations in social contexts without scrutiny.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: State-of-the-art performance in QA tasks is currently achieved by systems employing Large Language Models (LLMs), however these models tend to hallucinate information in their responses. One approach focuses on enhancing the generation process by incorporating attribution from the given input to the output. However, the challenge of identifying appropriate attributions and verifying their accuracy against a source is a complex task that requires significant improvements in assessing such systems. We introduce an attribution-oriented Chain-of-Thought reasoning method to enhance the accuracy of attributions. This approach focuses the reasoning process on generating an attribution-centric output. Evaluations on two context-enhanced question-answering datasets using GPT-4 demonstrate improved accuracy and correctness of attributions. In addition, the combination of our method with finetuning enhances the response and attribution accuracy of two smaller LLMs, showing their potential to outperform GPT-4 in some cases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) trackers have shown remarkable Multiple Object Tracking (MOT) performance when trained and evaluated on current benchmarks. However, these benchmarks primarily consist of clear scenarios, overlooking adverse atmospheric conditions such as fog, haze, smoke and dust. As a result, the robustness of SOTA trackers remains underexplored. To address these limitations, we propose a pipeline for physic-based volumetric fog simulation in arbitrary real-world MOT dataset utilizing frame-by-frame monocular depth estimation and a fog formation optical model. Moreover, we enhance our simulation by rendering of both homogeneous and heterogeneous fog effects. We propose to use the dark channel prior method to estimate fog (smoke) color, which shows promising results even in night and indoor scenes. We present the leading tracking benchmark MOTChallenge (MOT17 dataset) overlaid by fog (smoke for indoor scenes) of various intensity levels and conduct a comprehensive evaluation of SOTA MOT methods, revealing their limitations under fog and fog-similar challenges.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a graph-based representation learning framework for video summarization. First, we convert an input video to a graph where nodes correspond to each of the video frames. Then, we impose sparsity on the graph by connecting only those pairs of nodes that are within a specified temporal distance. We then formulate the video summarization task as a binary node classification problem, precisely classifying video frames whether they should belong to the output summary video. A graph constructed this way aims to capture long-range interactions among video frames, and the sparsity ensures the model trains without hitting the memory and compute bottleneck. Experiments on two datasets(SumMe and TVSum) demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed nimble model compared to existing state-of-the-art summarization approaches while being one order of magnitude more efficient in compute time and memory</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Misuse Potential of Base Large Language Models via In-Context Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The open-sourcing of large language models (LLMs) accelerates application development, innovation, and scientific progress. This includes both base models, which are pre-trained on extensive datasets without alignment, and aligned models, deliberately designed to align with ethical standards and human values. Contrary to the prevalent assumption that the inherent instruction-following limitations of base LLMs serve as a safeguard against misuse, our investigation exposes a critical oversight in this belief. By deploying carefully designed demonstrations, our research demonstrates that base LLMs could effectively interpret and execute malicious instructions. To systematically assess these risks, we introduce a novel set of risk evaluation metrics. Empirical results reveal that the outputs from base LLMs can exhibit risk levels on par with those of models fine-tuned for malicious purposes. This vulnerability, requiring neither specialized knowledge nor training, can be manipulated by almost anyone, highlighting the substantial risk and the critical need for immediate attention to the base LLMs' security protocols.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty-guided Open-Set Source-Free Unsupervised Domain Adaptation with Target-private Class Segregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Standard Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) aims to transfer knowledge from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target but usually requires simultaneous access to both source and target data. Moreover, UDA approaches commonly assume that source and target domains share the same labels space. Yet, these two assumptions are hardly satisfied in real-world scenarios. This paper considers the more challenging Source-Free Open-set Domain Adaptation (SF-OSDA) setting, where both assumptions are dropped. We propose a novel approach for SF-OSDA that exploits the granularity of target-private categories by segregating their samples into multiple unknown classes. Starting from an initial clustering-based assignment, our method progressively improves the segregation of target-private samples by refining their pseudo-labels with the guide of an uncertainty-based sample selection module. Additionally, we propose a novel contrastive loss, named NL-InfoNCELoss, that, integrating negative learning into self-supervised contrastive learning, enhances the model robustness to noisy pseudo-labels. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over existing approaches, establishing new state-of-the-art performance. Notably, additional analyses show that our method is able to learn the underlying semantics of novel classes, opening the possibility to perform novel class discovery.</description>

      <title>EMC$^2$: Efficient MCMC Negative Sampling for Contrastive Learning with Global Convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A key challenge in contrastive learning is to generate negative samples from a large sample set to contrast with positive samples, for learning better encoding of the data. These negative samples often follow a softmax distribution which are dynamically updated during the training process. However, sampling from this distribution is non-trivial due to the high computational costs in computing the partition function. In this paper, we propose an Efficient Markov Chain Monte Carlo negative sampling method for Contrastive learning (EMC$^2$). We follow the global contrastive learning loss as introduced in SogCLR, and propose EMC$^2$ which utilizes an adaptive Metropolis-Hastings subroutine to generate hardness-aware negative samples in an online fashion during the optimization. We prove that EMC$^2$ finds an $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{T})$-stationary point of the global contrastive loss in $T$ iterations. Compared to prior works, EMC$^2$ is the first algorithm that exhibits global convergence (to stationarity) regardless of the choice of batch size while exhibiting low computation and memory cost. Numerical experiments validate that EMC$^2$ is effective with small batch training and achieves comparable or better performance than baseline algorithms. We report the results for pre-training image encoders on STL-10 and Imagenet-100.</description>

      <title>Learning Symbolic Task Representation from a Human-Led Demonstration: A Memory to Store, Retrieve, Consolidate, and Forget Experiences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a symbolic learning framework inspired by cognitive-like memory functionalities (i.e., storing, retrieving, consolidating and forgetting) to generate task representations to support high-level task planning and knowledge bootstrapping. We address a scenario involving a non-expert human, who performs a single task demonstration, and a robot, which online learns structured knowledge to re-execute the task based on experiences, i.e., observations. We consider a one-shot learning process based on non-annotated data to store an intelligible representation of the task, which can be refined through interaction, e.g., via verbal or visual communication. Our general-purpose framework relies on fuzzy Description Logic, which has been used to extend the previously developed Scene Identification and Tagging algorithm. In this paper, we exploit such an algorithm to implement cognitive-like memory functionalities employing scores that rank memorised observations over time based on simple heuristics. Our main contribution is the formalisation of a framework that can be used to systematically investigate different heuristics for bootstrapping hierarchical knowledge representations based on robot observations. Through an illustrative assembly task scenario, the paper presents the performance of our framework to discuss its benefits and limitations.</description>

Abstract: Configurable synaptic delays are a basic feature in many neuromorphic neural network hardware accelerators. However, they have been rarely used in model implementations, despite their promising impact on performance and efficiency in tasks that exhibit complex (temporal) dynamics, as it has been unclear how to optimize them. In this work, we propose a framework to train and deploy, in digital neuromorphic hardware, highly performing spiking neural network models (SNNs) where apart from the synaptic weights, the per-synapse delays are also co-optimized. Leveraging spike-based back-propagation-through-time, the training accounts for both platform constraints, such as synaptic weight precision and the total number of parameters per core, as a function of the network size. In addition, a delay pruning technique is used to reduce memory footprint with a low cost in performance. We evaluate trained models in two neuromorphic digital hardware platforms: Intel Loihi and Imec Seneca. Loihi offers synaptic delay support using the so-called Ring-Buffer hardware structure. Seneca does not provide native hardware support for synaptic delays. A second contribution of this paper is therefore a novel area- and memory-efficient hardware structure for acceleration of synaptic delays, which we have integrated in Seneca. The evaluated benchmark involves several models for solving the SHD (Spiking Heidelberg Digits) classification task, where minimal accuracy degradation during the transition from software to hardware is demonstrated. To our knowledge, this is the first work showcasing how to train and deploy hardware-aware models parameterized with synaptic delays, on multicore neuromorphic hardware accelerators.</description>

      <title>InfoCon: Concept Discovery with Generative and Discriminative Informativeness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We focus on the self-supervised discovery of manipulation concepts that can be adapted and reassembled to address various robotic tasks. We propose that the decision to conceptualize a physical procedure should not depend on how we name it (semantics) but rather on the significance of the informativeness in its representation regarding the low-level physical state and state changes. We model manipulation concepts (discrete symbols) as generative and discriminative goals and derive metrics that can autonomously link them to meaningful sub-trajectories from noisy, unlabeled demonstrations. Specifically, we employ a trainable codebook containing encodings (concepts) capable of synthesizing the end-state of a sub-trajectory given the current state (generative informativeness). Moreover, the encoding corresponding to a particular sub-trajectory should differentiate the state within and outside it and confidently predict the subsequent action based on the gradient of its discriminative score (discriminative informativeness). These metrics, which do not rely on human annotation, can be seamlessly integrated into a VQ-VAE framework, enabling the partitioning of demonstrations into semantically consistent sub-trajectories, fulfilling the purpose of discovering manipulation concepts and the corresponding sub-goal (key) states. We evaluate the effectiveness of the learned concepts by training policies that utilize them as guidance, demonstrating superior performance compared to other baselines. Additionally, our discovered manipulation concepts compare favorably to human-annotated ones while saving much manual effort.</description>

      <title>What are human values, and how do we align AI to them?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is an emerging consensus that we need to align AI systems with human values (Gabriel, 2020; Ji et al., 2024), but there is very little work on what that means and how we actually do it. We split the problem of "aligning to human values" into three parts: first, eliciting values from people; second, reconciling those values into an alignment target for training ML models; and third, actually training the model. In this paper, we focus on the first two parts, and ask the question: what are "good" ways to synthesize diverse human inputs about values into a target for aligning language models? To answer this question, we first define a set of 6 criteria that we believe must be satisfied for an alignment target to shape model behavior in accordance with human values. We then propose a process for eliciting and reconciling values called Moral Graph Elicitation (MGE), which uses a large language model to interview participants about their values in particular contexts; our approach is inspired by the philosophy of values advanced by Taylor (1977), Chang (2004), and others. We trial MGE with a representative sample of 500 Americans, on 3 intentionally divisive prompts (e.g. advice about abortion). Our results demonstrate that MGE is promising for improving model alignment across all 6 criteria. For example, almost all participants (89.1%) felt well represented by the process, and (89%) thought the final moral graph was fair, even if their value wasn't voted as the wisest. Our process often results in "expert" values (e.g. values from women who have solicited abortion advice) rising to the top of the moral graph, without defining who is considered an expert in advance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Distributed Distributional DrQ is a model-free and off-policy RL algorithm for continuous control tasks based on the state and observation of the agent, which is an actor-critic method with the data-augmentation and the distributional perspective of critic value function. Aim to learn to control the agent and master some tasks in a high-dimensional continuous space. DrQ-v2 uses DDPG as the backbone and achieves out-performance in various continuous control tasks. Here Distributed Distributional DrQ uses Distributed Distributional DDPG as the backbone, and this modification aims to achieve better performance in some hard continuous control tasks through the better expression ability of distributional value function and distributed actor policies.</description>

      <title>Continual Offline Reinforcement Learning via Diffusion-based Dual Generative Replay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study continual offline reinforcement learning, a practical paradigm that facilitates forward transfer and mitigates catastrophic forgetting to tackle sequential offline tasks. We propose a dual generative replay framework that retains previous knowledge by concurrent replay of generated pseudo-data. First, we decouple the continual learning policy into a diffusion-based generative behavior model and a multi-head action evaluation model, allowing the policy to inherit distributional expressivity for encompassing a progressive range of diverse behaviors. Second, we train a task-conditioned diffusion model to mimic state distributions of past tasks. Generated states are paired with corresponding responses from the behavior generator to represent old tasks with high-fidelity replayed samples. Finally, by interleaving pseudo samples with real ones of the new task, we continually update the state and behavior generators to model progressively diverse behaviors, and regularize the multi-head critic via behavior cloning to mitigate forgetting. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves better forward transfer with less forgetting, and closely approximates the results of using previous ground-truth data due to its high-fidelity replay of the sample space. Our code is available at \href{https://github.com/NJU-RL/CuGRO}{https://github.com/NJU-RL/CuGRO}.</description>

      <title>HSVI-based Online Minimax Strategies for Partially Observable Stochastic Games with Neural Perception Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a variant of continuous-state partially-observable stochastic games with neural perception mechanisms and an asymmetric information structure. One agent has partial information, with the observation function implemented as a neural network, while the other agent is assumed to have full knowledge of the state. We present, for the first time, an efficient online method to compute an $\varepsilon$-minimax strategy profile, which requires only one linear program to be solved for each agent at every stage, instead of a complex estimation of opponent counterfactual values. For the partially-informed agent, we propose a continual resolving approach which uses lower bounds, pre-computed offline with heuristic search value iteration (HSVI), instead of opponent counterfactual values. This inherits the soundness of continual resolving at the cost of pre-computing the bound. For the fully-informed agent, we propose an inferred-belief strategy, where the agent maintains an inferred belief about the belief of the partially-informed agent based on (offline) upper bounds from HSVI, guaranteeing $\varepsilon$-distance to the value of the game at the initial belief known to both agents.</description>

      <title>Question Difficulty Ranking for Multiple-Choice Reading Comprehension</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multiple-choice (MC) tests are an efficient method to assess English learners. It is useful for test creators to rank candidate MC questions by difficulty during exam curation. Typically, the difficulty is determined by having human test takers trial the questions in a pretesting stage. However, this is expensive and not scalable. Therefore, we explore automated approaches to rank MC questions by difficulty. However, there is limited data for explicit training of a system for difficulty scores. Hence, we compare task transfer and zero-shot approaches: task transfer adapts level classification and reading comprehension systems for difficulty ranking while zero-shot prompting of instruction finetuned language models contrasts absolute assessment against comparative. It is found that level classification transfers better than reading comprehension. Additionally, zero-shot comparative assessment is more effective at difficulty ranking than the absolute assessment and even the task transfer approaches at question difficulty ranking with a Spearman's correlation of 40.4%. Combining the systems is observed to further boost the correlation.</description>

      <title>Mixed Prototype Consistency Learning for Semi-supervised Medical Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, prototype learning has emerged in semi-supervised medical image segmentation and achieved remarkable performance. However, the scarcity of labeled data limits the expressiveness of prototypes in previous methods, potentially hindering the complete representation of prototypes for class embedding. To address this problem, we propose the Mixed Prototype Consistency Learning (MPCL) framework, which includes a Mean Teacher and an auxiliary network. The Mean Teacher generates prototypes for labeled and unlabeled data, while the auxiliary network produces additional prototypes for mixed data processed by CutMix. Through prototype fusion, mixed prototypes provide extra semantic information to both labeled and unlabeled prototypes. High-quality global prototypes for each class are formed by fusing two enhanced prototypes, optimizing the distribution of hidden embeddings used in consistency learning. Extensive experiments on the left atrium and type B aortic dissection datasets demonstrate MPCL's superiority over previous state-of-the-art approaches, confirming the effectiveness of our framework. The code will be released soon.</description>

      <title>Insight Gained from Migrating a Machine Learning Model to Intelligence Processing Units</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discoveries in this paper show that Intelligence Processing Units (IPUs) offer a viable accelerator alternative to GPUs for machine learning (ML) applications within the fields of materials science and battery research. We investigate the process of migrating a model from GPU to IPU and explore several optimization techniques, including pipelining and gradient accumulation, aimed at enhancing the performance of IPU-based models. Furthermore, we have effectively migrated a specialized model to the IPU platform. This model is employed for predicting effective conductivity, a parameter crucial in ion transport processes, which govern the performance of multiple charge and discharge cycles of batteries. The model utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture to perform prediction tasks for effective conductivity. The performance of this model on the IPU is found to be comparable to its execution on GPUs. We also analyze the utilization and performance of Graphcore's Bow IPU. Through benchmark tests, we observe significantly improved performance with the Bow IPU when compared to its predecessor, the Colossus IPU.</description>

      <title>MiniCheck: Efficient Fact-Checking of LLMs on Grounding Documents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10774v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recognizing if LLM output can be grounded in evidence is central to many tasks in NLP: retrieval-augmented generation, summarization, document-grounded dialogue, and more. Current approaches to this kind of "fact-checking" are based on verifying each piece of a model generation against potential evidence using an LLM. However, this process can be very computationally expensive, requiring many calls to LLMs to check a single response. In this work, we show how to build small models that have GPT-4-level performance but for 400x lower cost. We do this by constructing synthetic training data with GPT-4, which involves creating realistic yet challenging instances of factual errors via a structured generation procedure. Training on this data teaches models to check each fact in the claim and recognize synthesis of information across sentences. For evaluation, we unify pre-existing datasets into a benchmark LLM-AggreFact, collected from recent work on fact-checking and grounding LLM generations. Our best system MiniCheck-FT5 (770M parameters) outperforms all systems of comparable size and reaches GPT-4 accuracy. We release LLM-AggreFact, code for data synthesis, and models.</description>

      <title>COMBO: Compositional World Models for Embodied Multi-Agent Cooperation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the problem of embodied multi-agent cooperation, where decentralized agents must cooperate given only partial egocentric views of the world. To effectively plan in this setting, in contrast to learning world dynamics in a single-agent scenario, we must simulate world dynamics conditioned on an arbitrary number of agents' actions given only partial egocentric visual observations of the world. To address this issue of partial observability, we first train generative models to estimate the overall world state given partial egocentric observations. To enable accurate simulation of multiple sets of actions on this world state, we then propose to learn a compositional world model for multi-agent cooperation by factorizing the naturally composable joint actions of multiple agents and compositionally generating the video. By leveraging this compositional world model, in combination with Vision Language Models to infer the actions of other agents, we can use a tree search procedure to integrate these modules and facilitate online cooperative planning. To evaluate the efficacy of our methods, we create two challenging embodied multi-agent long-horizon cooperation tasks using the ThreeDWorld simulator and conduct experiments with 2-4 agents. The results show our compositional world model is effective and the framework enables the embodied agents to cooperate efficiently with different agents across various tasks and an arbitrary number of agents, showing the promising future of our proposed framework.

      <title>Asking Before Acting: Gather Information in Embodied Decision Making with Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.15695v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With strong capabilities of reasoning and a broad understanding of the world, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated immense potential in building versatile embodied decision-making agents capable of executing a wide array of tasks. Nevertheless, when deployed in unfamiliar environments, we show that LLM agents encounter challenges in efficiently gathering essential information, leading to suboptimal performance. Conversely, human individuals often seek additional information from their peers prior to taking action, harnessing external knowledge to avoid unnecessary trial and error. Drawing inspiration from this behavior, we propose \textit{Asking Before Acting} (ABA), a method that empowers the agent to proactively inquire with external sources for pertinent information using natural language during their interactions within the environment. In this way, the agent is able to enhance its efficiency and performance by circumventing potentially laborious steps and combating the difficulties associated with exploration in unfamiliar environments and vagueness of the instructions. We conduct extensive experiments involving a spectrum of environments including text-based household everyday tasks, robot arm manipulation tasks, and real world open domain image based embodied tasks. The experiments involve various models from Vicuna to GPT-4. The results demonstrate that, even with modest prompts modifications, ABA exhibits substantial advantages on both performance and efficiency over baseline LLM agents. Further finetuning ABA with reformulated metadata (ABA-FT) faciliates learning the rationale for asking and allows for additional enhancements especially in tasks that baselines struggle to solve.</description>

Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) techniques have become popular for multiple use-cases in the past few years. Here we consider its use in studying model predictions to gather additional training data. We argue that this is equivalent to Active Learning, where the query strategy involves a human-in-the-loop. We provide a mathematical approximation for the role of the human, and present a general formalization of the end-to-end workflow. This enables us to rigorously compare this use with standard Active Learning algorithms, while allowing for extensions to the workflow. An added benefit is that their utility can be assessed via simulation instead of conducting expensive user-studies. We also present some initial promising results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.13854v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With advances in generative AI, there is now potential for autonomous agents to manage daily tasks via natural language commands. However, current agents are primarily created and tested in simplified synthetic environments, leading to a disconnect with real-world scenarios. In this paper, we build an environment for language-guided agents that is highly realistic and reproducible. Specifically, we focus on agents that perform tasks on the web, and create an environment with fully functional websites from four common domains: e-commerce, social forum discussions, collaborative software development, and content management. Our environment is enriched with tools (e.g., a map) and external knowledge bases (e.g., user manuals) to encourage human-like task-solving. Building upon our environment, we release a set of benchmark tasks focusing on evaluating the functional correctness of task completions. The tasks in our benchmark are diverse, long-horizon, and designed to emulate tasks that humans routinely perform on the internet. We experiment with several baseline agents, integrating recent techniques such as reasoning before acting. The results demonstrate that solving complex tasks is challenging: our best GPT-4-based agent only achieves an end-to-end task success rate of 14.41%, significantly lower than the human performance of 78.24%. These results highlight the need for further development of robust agents, that current state-of-the-art large language models are far from perfect performance in these real-life tasks, and that WebArena can be used to measure such progress.</description>

Abstract: Integrating first-order logic constraints (FOLCs) with neural networks is a crucial but challenging problem since it involves modeling intricate correlations to satisfy the constraints. This paper proposes a novel neural layer, LogicMP, whose layers perform mean-field variational inference over an MLN. It can be plugged into any off-the-shelf neural network to encode FOLCs while retaining modularity and efficiency. By exploiting the structure and symmetries in MLNs, we theoretically demonstrate that our well-designed, efficient mean-field iterations effectively mitigate the difficulty of MLN inference, reducing the inference from sequential calculation to a series of parallel tensor operations. Empirical results in three kinds of tasks over graphs, images, and text show that LogicMP outperforms advanced competitors in both performance and efficiency.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.17639v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) trained on huge corpora of text datasets demonstrate intriguing capabilities, achieving state-of-the-art performance on tasks they were not explicitly trained for. The precise nature of LLM capabilities is often mysterious, and different prompts can elicit different capabilities through in-context learning. We propose a framework that enables us to analyze in-context learning dynamics to understand latent concepts underlying LLMs' behavioral patterns. This provides a more nuanced understanding than success-or-failure evaluation benchmarks, but does not require observing internal activations as a mechanistic interpretation of circuits would. Inspired by the cognitive science of human randomness perception, we use random binary sequences as context and study dynamics of in-context learning by manipulating properties of context data, such as sequence length. In the latest GPT-3.5+ models, we find emergent abilities to generate seemingly random numbers and learn basic formal languages, with striking in-context learning dynamics where model outputs transition sharply from seemingly random behaviors to deterministic repetition.</description>

      <title>Which AI Technique Is Better to Classify Requirements? An Experiment with SVM, LSTM, and ChatGPT</title>

Abstract: Recently, Large Language Models like ChatGPT have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in various Natural Language Processing tasks. Their application in Requirements Engineering, especially in requirements classification, has gained increasing interest. This paper reports an extensive empirical evaluation of two ChatGPT models, specifically gpt-3.5-turbo, and gpt-4 in both zero-shot and few-shot settings for requirements classification. The question arises as to how these models compare to traditional classification methods, specifically Support Vector Machine and Long Short-Term Memory. Based on five different datasets, our results show that there is no single best technique for all types of requirement classes. Interestingly, the few-shot setting has been found to be beneficial primarily in scenarios where zero-shot results are significantly low.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Directly-Follows Process Discovery Using Grammatical Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05433v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Starting with a collection of traces generated by process executions, process discovery is the task of constructing a simple model that describes the process, where simplicity is often measured in terms of model size. The challenge of process discovery is that the process of interest is unknown, and that while the input traces constitute positive examples of process executions, no negative examples are available. Many commercial tools discover Directly-Follows Graphs, in which nodes represent the observable actions of the process, and directed arcs indicate execution order possibilities over the actions. We propose a new approach for discovering sound Directly-Follows Graphs that is grounded in grammatical inference over the input traces. To promote the discovery of small graphs that also describe the process accurately we design and evaluate a genetic algorithm that supports the convergence of the inference parameters to the areas that lead to the discovery of interesting models. Experiments over real-world datasets confirm that our new approach can construct smaller models that represent the input traces and their frequencies more accurately than the state-of-the-art technique. Reasoning over the frequencies of encoded traces also becomes possible, due to the stochastic semantics of the action graphs we propose, which, for the first time, are interpreted as models that describe the stochastic languages of action traces.</description>

      <title>Learning to Manipulate under Limited Information</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.16412v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By classic results in social choice theory, any reasonable preferential voting method sometimes gives individuals an incentive to report an insincere preference. The extent to which different voting methods are more or less resistant to such strategic manipulation has become a key consideration for comparing voting methods. Here we measure resistance to manipulation by whether neural networks of varying sizes can learn to profitably manipulate a given voting method in expectation, given different types of limited information about how other voters will vote. We trained over 70,000 neural networks of 26 sizes to manipulate against 8 different voting methods, under 6 types of limited information, in committee-sized elections with 5-21 voters and 3-6 candidates. We find that some voting methods, such as Borda, are highly manipulable by networks with limited information, while others, such as Instant Runoff, are not, despite being quite profitably manipulated by an ideal manipulator with full information. For the two probability models for elections that we use, the overall least manipulable of the 8 methods we study are Condorcet methods, namely Minimax and Split Cycle.</description>

      <title>Overconfident and Unconfident AI Hinder Human-AI Collaboration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07632v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: AI transparency is a central pillar of responsible AI deployment and effective human-AI collaboration. A critical approach is communicating uncertainty, such as displaying AI's confidence level, or its correctness likelihood (CL), to users. However, these confidence levels are often uncalibrated, either overestimating or underestimating actual CL, posing risks and harms to human-AI collaboration. This study examines the effects of uncalibrated AI confidence on users' trust in AI, AI advice adoption, and collaboration outcomes. We further examined the impact of increased transparency, achieved through trust calibration support, on these outcomes. Our results reveal that uncalibrated AI confidence leads to both the misuse of overconfident AI and disuse of unconfident AI, thereby hindering outcomes of human-AI collaboration. Deficiency of trust calibration support exacerbates this issue by making it harder to detect uncalibrated confidence, promoting misuse and disuse of AI. Conversely, trust calibration support aids in recognizing uncalibration and reducing misuse, but it also fosters distrust and causes disuse of AI. Our findings highlight the importance of AI confidence calibration for enhancing human-AI collaboration and suggest directions for AI design and regulation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04772v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A teacher's knowledge base consists of knowledge of mathematics content, knowledge of student epistemology, and pedagogical knowledge. It has severe implications on the understanding of student's knowledge of content, and the learning context in general. The necessity to formalize the different content knowledge in approximate senses is recognized in the education research literature. A related problem is that of coherent formalizability. Existing responsive or smart AI-based software systems do not concern themselves with meaning, and trained ones are replete with their own issues. In the present research, many issues in modeling teachers' understanding of content are identified, and a two-tier rough set-based model is proposed by the present author for the purpose of developing software that can aid the varied tasks of a teacher. The main advantage of the proposed approach is in its ability to coherently handle vagueness, granularity and multi-modality. An extended example to equational reasoning is used to demonstrate these. The paper is meant for rough set researchers intending to build logical models or develop meaning-aware AI-software to aid teachers, and education research experts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13311v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the Multi-Robot Connected Fermat Spiral (MCFS), a novel algorithmic framework for Multi-Robot Coverage Path Planning (MCPP) that adapts Connected Fermat Spiral (CFS) from the computer graphics community to multi-robot coordination for the first time. MCFS uniquely enables the orchestration of multiple robots to generate coverage paths that contour around arbitrarily shaped obstacles, a feature that is notably lacking in traditional methods. Our framework not only enhances area coverage and optimizes task performance, particularly in terms of makespan, for workspaces rich in irregular obstacles but also addresses the challenges of path continuity and curvature critical for non-holonomic robots by generating smooth paths without decomposing the workspace. MCFS solves MCPP by constructing a graph of isolines and transforming MCPP into a combinatorial optimization problem, aiming to minimize the makespan while covering all vertices. Our contributions include developing a unified CFS version for scalable and adaptable MCPP, extending it to MCPP with novel optimization techniques for cost reduction and path continuity and smoothness, and demonstrating through extensive experiments that MCFS outperforms existing MCPP methods in makespan, path curvature, coverage ratio, and overlapping ratio. Our research marks a significant step in MCPP, showcasing the fusion of computer graphics and automated planning principles to advance the capabilities of multi-robot systems in complex environments. Our code is available at https://github.com/reso1/MCFS.</description>

Abstract: DeepFakes, which refer to AI-generated media content, have become an increasing concern due to their use as a means for disinformation. Detecting DeepFakes is currently solved with programmed machine learning algorithms. In this work, we investigate the capabilities of multimodal large language models (LLMs) in DeepFake detection. We conducted qualitative and quantitative experiments to demonstrate multimodal LLMs and show that they can expose AI-generated images through careful experimental design and prompt engineering. This is interesting, considering that LLMs are not inherently tailored for media forensic tasks, and the process does not require programming. We discuss the limitations of multimodal LLMs for these tasks and suggest possible improvements.</description>

      <title>TrustSQL: A Reliability Benchmark for Text-to-SQL Models with Diverse Unanswerable Questions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15879v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have led to significant improvements in translating natural language questions into SQL queries. While achieving high accuracy in SQL generation is crucial, little is known about the extent to which these text-to-SQL models can reliably handle diverse types of questions encountered during real-world deployment, including unanswerable ones. To explore this aspect, we introduce TrustSQL, a new benchmark designed to assess the reliability of text-to-SQL models in both single-database and cross-database settings. TrustSQL requires models to provide one of two outputs: 1) an SQL prediction or 2) abstention from making an SQL prediction, either due to potential errors in the generated SQL or when faced with unanswerable questions. For model evaluation, we explore various modeling approaches specifically designed for this task: 1) optimizing separate models for answerability detection, SQL generation, and error detection, which are then integrated into a single pipeline; and 2) developing a unified approach that uses a single model to solve this task. Experimental results using our new reliability score show that addressing this challenge involves many different areas of research and opens new avenues for model development. However, none of the methods consistently surpasses the reliability scores of a naive baseline that abstains from SQL predictions for all questions, with varying penalties.</description>

      <title>Visual Grounding Methods for VQA are Working for the Wrong Reasons!</title>

      <description>arXiv:2004.05704v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing Visual Question Answering (VQA) methods tend to exploit dataset biases and spurious statistical correlations, instead of producing right answers for the right reasons. To address this issue, recent bias mitigation methods for VQA propose to incorporate visual cues (e.g., human attention maps) to better ground the VQA models, showcasing impressive gains. However, we show that the performance improvements are not a result of improved visual grounding, but a regularization effect which prevents over-fitting to linguistic priors. For instance, we find that it is not actually necessary to provide proper, human-based cues; random, insensible cues also result in similar improvements. Based on this observation, we propose a simpler regularization scheme that does not require any external annotations and yet achieves near state-of-the-art performance on VQA-CPv2.</description>

Abstract: We address the problem of human-in-the-loop control for generating prosody in the context of text-to-speech synthesis. Controlling prosody is challenging because existing generative models lack an efficient interface through which users can modify the output quickly and precisely. To solve this, we introduce a novel framework whereby the user provides partial inputs and the generative model generates the missing features. We propose a model that is specifically designed to encode partial prosodic features and output complete audio. We show empirically that our model displays two essential qualities of a human-in-the-loop control mechanism: efficiency and robustness. With even a very small number of input values (~4), our model enables users to improve the quality of the output significantly in terms of listener preference (4:1).</description>

      <title>Incentivising the federation: gradient-based metrics for data selection and valuation in private decentralised training</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.02942v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Obtaining high-quality data for collaborative training of machine learning models can be a challenging task due to A) regulatory concerns and B) a lack of data owner incentives to participate. The first issue can be addressed through the combination of distributed machine learning techniques (e.g. federated learning) and privacy enhancing technologies (PET), such as the differentially private (DP) model training. The second challenge can be addressed by rewarding the participants for giving access to data which is beneficial to the training model, which is of particular importance in federated settings, where the data is unevenly distributed. However, DP noise can adversely affect the underrepresented and the atypical (yet often informative) data samples, making it difficult to assess their usefulness. In this work, we investigate how to leverage gradient information to permit the participants of private training settings to select the data most beneficial for the jointly trained model. We assess two such methods, namely variance of gradients (VoG) and the privacy loss-input susceptibility score (PLIS). We show that these techniques can provide the federated clients with tools for principled data selection even in stricter privacy settings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.03843v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel code-to-code search technique that enhances the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) by including both static and dynamic features as well as utilizing both similar and dissimilar examples during training. We present the first-ever code search method that encodes dynamic runtime information during training without the need to execute either the corpus under search or the search query at inference time and the first code search technique that trains on both positive and negative reference samples. To validate the efficacy of our approach, we perform a set of studies demonstrating the capability of enhanced LLMs to perform cross-language code-to-code search. Our evaluation demonstrates that the effectiveness of our approach is consistent across various model architectures and programming languages. We outperform the state-of-the-art cross-language search tool by up to 44.7\%. Moreover, our ablation studies reveal that even a single positive and negative reference sample in the training process results in substantial performance improvements demonstrating both similar and dissimilar references are important parts of code search. Importantly, we show that enhanced well-crafted, fine-tuned models consistently outperform enhanced larger modern LLMs without fine tuning, even when enhancing the largest available LLMs highlighting the importance for open-sourced models. To ensure the reproducibility and extensibility of our research, we present an open-sourced implementation of our tool and training procedures called REINFOREST.</description>

      <title>RetICL: Sequential Retrieval of In-Context Examples with Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.14502v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent developments in large pre-trained language models have enabled unprecedented performance on a variety of downstream tasks. Achieving best performance with these models often leverages in-context learning, where a model performs a (possibly new) task given one or more examples. However, recent work has shown that the choice of examples can have a large impact on task performance and that finding an optimal set of examples is non-trivial. While there are many existing methods for selecting in-context examples, they generally score examples independently, ignoring the dependency between them and the order in which they are provided to the model. In this work, we propose Retrieval for In-Context Learning (RetICL), a learnable method for modeling and optimally selecting examples sequentially for in-context learning. We frame the problem of sequential example selection as a Markov decision process and train an example retriever using reinforcement learning. We evaluate RetICL on math word problem solving and scientific question answering tasks and show that it consistently outperforms or matches heuristic and learnable baselines. We also use case studies to show that RetICL implicitly learns representations of problem solving strategies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.07117v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Leveraging an established exercise in negotiation education, we build a novel dataset for studying how the use of language shapes bilateral bargaining. Our dataset extends existing work in two ways: 1) we recruit participants via behavioral labs instead of crowdsourcing platforms and allow participants to negotiate through audio, enabling more naturalistic interactions; 2) we add a control setting where participants negotiate only through alternating, written numeric offers. Despite the two contrasting forms of communication, we find that the average agreed prices of the two treatments are identical. But when subjects can talk, fewer offers are exchanged, negotiations finish faster, the likelihood of reaching agreement rises, and the variance of prices at which subjects agree drops substantially. We further propose a taxonomy of speech acts in negotiation and enrich the dataset with annotated speech acts. Our work also reveals linguistic signals that are predictive of negotiation outcomes.</description>

      <title>Can Large Language Models Transform Natural Language Intent into Formal Method Postconditions?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01831v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Informal natural language that describes code functionality, such as code comments or function documentation, may contain substantial information about a programs intent. However, there is typically no guarantee that a programs implementation and natural language documentation are aligned. In the case of a conflict, leveraging information in code-adjacent natural language has the potential to enhance fault localization, debugging, and code trustworthiness. In practice, however, this information is often underutilized due to the inherent ambiguity of natural language which makes natural language intent challenging to check programmatically. The emergent abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have the potential to facilitate the translation of natural language intent to programmatically checkable assertions. However, it is unclear if LLMs can correctly translate informal natural language specifications into formal specifications that match programmer intent. Additionally, it is unclear if such translation could be useful in practice. In this paper, we describe nl2postcond, the problem of leveraging LLMs for transforming informal natural language to formal method postconditions, expressed as program assertions. We introduce and validate metrics to measure and compare different nl2postcond approaches, using the correctness and discriminative power of generated postconditions. We then use qualitative and quantitative methods to assess the quality of nl2postcond postconditions, finding that they are generally correct and able to discriminate incorrect code. Finally, we find that nl2postcond via LLMs has the potential to be helpful in practice; nl2postcond generated postconditions were able to catch 64 real-world historical bugs from Defects4J.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.09753v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the capabilities of transformer models on relational reasoning tasks. In these tasks, models are trained on a set of strings encoding abstract relations, and are then tested out-of-distribution on data that contains symbols that did not appear in the training dataset. We prove that for any relational reasoning task in a large family of tasks, transformers learn the abstract relations and generalize to the test set when trained by gradient descent on sufficiently large quantities of training data. This is in contrast to classical fully-connected networks, which we prove fail to learn to reason. Our results inspire modifications of the transformer architecture that add only two trainable parameters per head, and that we empirically demonstrate improve data efficiency for learning to reason.</description>

      <title>Stance Detection with Collaborative Role-Infused LLM-Based Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10467v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stance detection automatically detects the stance in a text towards a target, vital for content analysis in web and social media research. Despite their promising capabilities, LLMs encounter challenges when directly applied to stance detection. First, stance detection demands multi-aspect knowledge, from deciphering event-related terminologies to understanding the expression styles in social media platforms. Second, stance detection requires advanced reasoning to infer authors' implicit viewpoints, as stance are often subtly embedded rather than overtly stated in the text. To address these challenges, we design a three-stage framework COLA (short for Collaborative rOle-infused LLM-based Agents) in which LLMs are designated distinct roles, creating a collaborative system where each role contributes uniquely. Initially, in the multidimensional text analysis stage, we configure the LLMs to act as a linguistic expert, a domain specialist, and a social media veteran to get a multifaceted analysis of texts, thus overcoming the first challenge. Next, in the reasoning-enhanced debating stage, for each potential stance, we designate a specific LLM-based agent to advocate for it, guiding the LLM to detect logical connections between text features and stance, tackling the second challenge. Finally, in the stance conclusion stage, a final decision maker agent consolidates prior insights to determine the stance. Our approach avoids extra annotated data and model training and is highly usable. We achieve state-of-the-art performance across multiple datasets. Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of each design role in handling stance detection. Further experiments have demonstrated the explainability and the versatility of our approach. Our approach excels in usability, accuracy, effectiveness, explainability and versatility, highlighting its value.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models as Generalizable Policies for Embodied Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17722v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that large language models (LLMs) can be adapted to be generalizable policies for embodied visual tasks. Our approach, called Large LAnguage model Reinforcement Learning Policy (LLaRP), adapts a pre-trained frozen LLM to take as input text instructions and visual egocentric observations and output actions directly in the environment. Using reinforcement learning, we train LLaRP to see and act solely through environmental interactions. We show that LLaRP is robust to complex paraphrasings of task instructions and can generalize to new tasks that require novel optimal behavior. In particular, on 1,000 unseen tasks it achieves 42% success rate, 1.7x the success rate of other common learned baselines or zero-shot applications of LLMs. Finally, to aid the community in studying language conditioned, massively multi-task, embodied AI problems we release a novel benchmark, Language Rearrangement, consisting of 150,000 training and 1,000 testing tasks for language-conditioned rearrangement. Video examples of LLaRP in unseen Language Rearrangement instructions are at https://llm-rl.github.io.</description>

      <title>Learn to Refuse: Making Large Language Models More Controllable and Reliable through Knowledge Scope Limitation and Refusal Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01041v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive language understanding and generation capabilities, enabling them to answer a wide range of questions across various domains. However, these models are not flawless and often produce responses that contain errors or misinformation. These inaccuracies, commonly referred to as hallucinations, render LLMs unreliable and even unusable in many scenarios. In this paper, our focus is on mitigating the issue of hallucination in LLMs, particularly in the context of question-answering. Instead of attempting to answer all questions, we explore a refusal mechanism that instructs LLMs to refuse to answer challenging questions in order to avoid errors. We then propose a simple yet effective solution called Learn to Refuse (L2R), which incorporates the refusal mechanism to enable LLMs to recognize and refuse to answer questions that they find difficult to address. To achieve this, we utilize a structured knowledge base to represent all the LLM's understanding of the world, enabling it to provide traceable gold knowledge. This knowledge base is separate from the LLM and initially empty. It can be filled with validated knowledge and progressively expanded. When an LLM encounters questions outside its domain, the system recognizes its knowledge scope and determines whether it can answer the question independently. Additionally, we introduce a method for automatically and efficiently expanding the knowledge base of LLMs. Through qualitative and quantitative analysis, we demonstrate that our approach enhances the controllability and reliability of LLMs.</description>

      <title>Leveraging LLMs for Synthesizing Training Data Across Many Languages in Multilingual Dense Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05800v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There has been limited success for dense retrieval models in multilingual retrieval, due to uneven and scarce training data available across multiple languages. Synthetic training data generation is promising (e.g., InPars or Promptagator), but has been investigated only for English. Therefore, to study model capabilities across both cross-lingual and monolingual retrieval tasks, we develop SWIM-IR, a synthetic retrieval training dataset containing 33 (high to very-low resource) languages for fine-tuning multilingual dense retrievers without requiring any human supervision. To construct SWIM-IR, we propose SAP (summarize-then-ask prompting), where the large language model (LLM) generates a textual summary prior to the query generation step. SAP assists the LLM in generating informative queries in the target language. Using SWIM-IR, we explore synthetic fine-tuning of multilingual dense retrieval models and evaluate them robustly on three retrieval benchmarks: XOR-Retrieve (cross-lingual), MIRACL (monolingual) and XTREME-UP (cross-lingual). Our models, called SWIM-X, are competitive with human-supervised dense retrieval models, e.g., mContriever-X, finding that SWIM-IR can cheaply substitute for expensive human-labeled retrieval training data. SWIM-IR dataset and SWIM-X models are available at https://github.com/google-research-datasets/SWIM-IR.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.07989v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we systematically review the recent advancements in code processing with language models, covering 50+ models, 30+ evaluation tasks, 170+ datasets, and 800 related works. We break down code processing models into general language models represented by the GPT family and specialized models that are specifically pretrained on code, often with tailored objectives. We discuss the relations and differences between these models, and highlight the historical transition of code modeling from statistical models and RNNs to pretrained Transformers and LLMs, which is exactly the same course that had been taken by NLP. We also discuss code-specific features such as AST, CFG, and unit tests, along with their application in training code language models, and identify key challenges and potential future directions in this domain. We keep the survey open and updated on GitHub at https://github.com/codefuse-ai/Awesome-Code-LLM.</description>

      <title>Proposing an intelligent mesh smoothing method with graph neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12815v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In CFD, mesh smoothing methods are commonly utilized to refine the mesh quality to achieve high-precision numerical simulations. Specifically, optimization-based smoothing is used for high-quality mesh smoothing, but it incurs significant computational overhead. Pioneer works improve its smoothing efficiency by adopting supervised learning to learn smoothing methods from high-quality meshes. However, they pose difficulty in smoothing the mesh nodes with varying degrees and also need data augmentation to address the node input sequence problem. Additionally, the required labeled high-quality meshes further limit the applicability of the proposed method. In this paper, we present GMSNet, a lightweight neural network model for intelligent mesh smoothing. GMSNet adopts graph neural networks to extract features of the node's neighbors and output the optimal node position. During smoothing, we also introduce a fault-tolerance mechanism to prevent GMSNet from generating negative volume elements. With a lightweight model, GMSNet can effectively smoothing mesh nodes with varying degrees and remain unaffected by the order of input data. A novel loss function, MetricLoss, is also developed to eliminate the need for high-quality meshes, which provides a stable and rapid convergence during training. We compare GMSNet with commonly used mesh smoothing methods on two-dimensional triangle meshes. The experimental results show that GMSNet achieves outstanding mesh smoothing performances with 5% model parameters of the previous model, and attains 13.56 times faster than optimization-based smoothing.</description>

      <title>MetaCloak: Preventing Unauthorized Subject-driven Text-to-image Diffusion-based Synthesis via Meta-learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13127v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models allow seamless generation of personalized images from scant reference photos. Yet, these tools, in the wrong hands, can fabricate misleading or harmful content, endangering individuals. To address this problem, existing poisoning-based approaches perturb user images in an imperceptible way to render them "unlearnable" from malicious uses. We identify two limitations of these defending approaches: i) sub-optimal due to the hand-crafted heuristics for solving the intractable bilevel optimization and ii) lack of robustness against simple data transformations like Gaussian filtering. To solve these challenges, we propose MetaCloak, which solves the bi-level poisoning problem with a meta-learning framework with an additional transformation sampling process to craft transferable and robust perturbation. Specifically, we employ a pool of surrogate diffusion models to craft transferable and model-agnostic perturbation. Furthermore, by incorporating an additional transformation process, we design a simple denoising-error maximization loss that is sufficient for causing transformation-robust semantic distortion and degradation in a personalized generation. Extensive experiments on the VGGFace2 and CelebA-HQ datasets show that MetaCloak outperforms existing approaches. Notably, MetaCloak can successfully fool online training services like Replicate, in a black-box manner, demonstrating the effectiveness of MetaCloak in real-world scenarios. Our code is available at https://github.com/liuyixin-louis/MetaCloak.</description>

      <title>Regularization by Texts for Latent Diffusion Inverse Solvers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.15658v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent advent of diffusion models has led to significant progress in solving inverse problems, leveraging these models as effective generative priors. Nonetheless, there remain challenges related to the ill-posed nature of such problems, often due to inherent ambiguities in measurements or intrinsic system symmetries. To address this, drawing inspiration from the human ability to resolve visual ambiguities through perceptual biases, here we introduce a novel latent diffusion inverse solver by regularization by texts (TReg). Specifically, TReg applies the textual description of the preconception of the solution during the reverse diffusion sampling, of which the description is dynamically reinforced through null-text optimization for adaptive negation. Our comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that TReg successfully mitigates ambiguity in the inverse problems, enhancing their effectiveness and accuracy.</description>

      <title>SplaTAM: Splat, Track &amp; Map 3D Gaussians for Dense RGB-D SLAM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02126v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dense simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) is crucial for robotics and augmented reality applications. However, current methods are often hampered by the non-volumetric or implicit way they represent a scene. This work introduces SplaTAM, an approach that, for the first time, leverages explicit volumetric representations, i.e., 3D Gaussians, to enable high-fidelity reconstruction from a single unposed RGB-D camera, surpassing the capabilities of existing methods. SplaTAM employs a simple online tracking and mapping system tailored to the underlying Gaussian representation. It utilizes a silhouette mask to elegantly capture the presence of scene density. This combination enables several benefits over prior representations, including fast rendering and dense optimization, quickly determining if areas have been previously mapped, and structured map expansion by adding more Gaussians. Extensive experiments show that SplaTAM achieves up to 2x superior performance in camera pose estimation, map construction, and novel-view synthesis over existing methods, paving the way for more immersive high-fidelity SLAM applications.</description>

      <title>Hunting imaging biomarkers in pulmonary fibrosis: Benchmarks of the AIIB23 challenge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13752v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Airway-related quantitative imaging biomarkers are crucial for examination, diagnosis, and prognosis in pulmonary diseases. However, the manual delineation of airway trees remains prohibitively time-consuming. While significant efforts have been made towards enhancing airway modelling, current public-available datasets concentrate on lung diseases with moderate morphological variations. The intricate honeycombing patterns present in the lung tissues of fibrotic lung disease patients exacerbate the challenges, often leading to various prediction errors. To address this issue, the 'Airway-Informed Quantitative CT Imaging Biomarker for Fibrotic Lung Disease 2023' (AIIB23) competition was organized in conjunction with the official 2023 International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention (MICCAI). The airway structures were meticulously annotated by three experienced radiologists. Competitors were encouraged to develop automatic airway segmentation models with high robustness and generalization abilities, followed by exploring the most correlated QIB of mortality prediction. A training set of 120 high-resolution computerised tomography (HRCT) scans were publicly released with expert annotations and mortality status. The online validation set incorporated 52 HRCT scans from patients with fibrotic lung disease and the offline test set included 140 cases from fibrosis and COVID-19 patients. The results have shown that the capacity of extracting airway trees from patients with fibrotic lung disease could be enhanced by introducing voxel-wise weighted general union loss and continuity loss. In addition to the competitive image biomarkers for prognosis, a strong airway-derived biomarker (Hazard ratio&gt;1.5, p&lt;0.0001) was revealed for survival prognostication compared with existing clinical measurements, clinician assessment and AI-based biomarkers.</description>

      <title>README: Bridging Medical Jargon and Lay Understanding for Patient Education through Data-Centric NLP</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15561v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The advancement in healthcare has shifted focus toward patient-centric approaches, particularly in self-care and patient education, facilitated by access to Electronic Health Records (EHR). However, medical jargon in EHRs poses significant challenges in patient comprehension. To address this, we introduce a new task of automatically generating lay definitions, aiming to simplify complex medical terms into patient-friendly lay language. We first created the README dataset, an extensive collection of over 50,000 unique (medical term, lay definition) pairs and 300,000 mentions, each offering context-aware lay definitions manually annotated by domain experts. We have also engineered a data-centric Human-AI pipeline that synergizes data filtering, augmentation, and selection to improve data quality. We then used README as the training data for models and leveraged a Retrieval-Augmented Generation method to reduce hallucinations and improve the quality of model outputs. Our extensive automatic and human evaluations demonstrate that open-source mobile-friendly models, when fine-tuned with high-quality data, are capable of matching or even surpassing the performance of state-of-the-art closed-source large language models like ChatGPT. This research represents a significant stride in closing the knowledge gap in patient education and advancing patient-centric healthcare solutions.</description>

      <title>What Makes Good Data for Alignment? A Comprehensive Study of Automatic Data Selection in Instruction Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15685v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Instruction tuning is a standard technique employed to align large language models to end tasks and user preferences after the initial pretraining phase. Recent research indicates the critical role of data engineering in instruction tuning -- when appropriately selected, only limited data is necessary to achieve superior performance. However, we still lack a principled understanding of what makes good instruction tuning data for alignment, and how we should select data automatically and effectively. In this work, we delve deeply into automatic data selection strategies for alignment. We start with controlled studies to measure data across three dimensions: complexity, quality, and diversity, along which we examine existing methods and introduce novel techniques for enhanced data measurement. Subsequently, we propose a simple strategy to select data samples based on the measurement. We present deita (short for Data-Efficient Instruction Tuning for Alignment), a series of models fine-tuned from LLaMA and Mistral models using data samples automatically selected with our proposed approach. Empirically, deita performs better or on par with the state-of-the-art open-source alignment models with only 6K SFT training data samples -- over 10x less than the data used in the baselines. When further trained with direct preference optimization (DPO), deita-Mistral-7B + DPO trained with 6K SFT and 10K DPO samples achieve 7.55 MT-Bench and 90.06% AlpacaEval scores. We anticipate this work to provide tools on automatic data selection, facilitating data-efficient alignment. We release our models as well as the selected datasets for future researches to effectively align models more efficiently.</description>

      <title>PeFoMed: Parameter Efficient Fine-tuning of Multimodal Large Language Models for Medical Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.02797v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) represent an evolutionary expansion in the capabilities of traditional large language models, enabling them to tackle challenges that surpass the scope of purely text-based applications. It leverages the knowledge previously encoded within these language models, thereby enhancing their applicability and functionality in the reign of multimodal contexts. Recent works investigate the adaptation of MLLMs as a universal solution to address medical multi-modal problems as a generative task. In this paper, we propose a parameter efficient framework for fine-tuning MLLMs, specifically validated on medical visual question answering (Med-VQA) and medical report generation (MRG) tasks, using public benchmark datasets. We also introduce an evaluation metric using the 5-point Likert scale and its weighted average value to measure the quality of the generated reports for MRG tasks, where the scale ratings are labelled by both humans manually and the GPT-4 model. We further assess the consistency of performance metrics across traditional measures, GPT-4, and human ratings for both VQA and MRG tasks. The results indicate that semantic similarity assessments using GPT-4 align closely with human annotators and provide greater stability, yet they reveal a discrepancy when compared to conventional lexical similarity measurements. This questions the reliability of lexical similarity metrics for evaluating the performance of generative models in Med-VQA and report generation tasks. Besides, our fine-tuned model significantly outperforms GPT-4v. This indicates that without additional fine-tuning, multi-modal models like GPT-4v do not perform effectively on medical imaging tasks. The code will be available here: https://github.com/jinlHe/PeFoMed.</description>

Abstract: Heterogeneous graph few-shot learning (HGFL) has been developed to address the label sparsity issue in heterogeneous graphs (HGs), which consist of various types of nodes and edges. The core concept of HGFL is to extract knowledge from rich-labeled classes in a source HG, transfer this knowledge to a target HG to facilitate learning new classes with few-labeled training data, and finally make predictions on unlabeled testing data. Existing methods typically assume that the source HG, training data, and testing data all share the same distribution. However, in practice, distribution shifts among these three types of data are inevitable due to two reasons: (1) the limited availability of the source HG that matches the target HG distribution, and (2) the unpredictable data generation mechanism of the target HG. Such distribution shifts result in ineffective knowledge transfer and poor learning performance in existing methods, thereby leading to a novel problem of out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization in HGFL. To address this challenging problem, we propose a novel Causal OOD Heterogeneous graph Few-shot learning model, namely COHF. In COHF, we first characterize distribution shifts in HGs with a structural causal model, establishing an invariance principle for OOD generalization in HGFL. Then, following this invariance principle, we propose a new variational autoencoder-based heterogeneous graph neural network to mitigate the impact of distribution shifts. Finally, by integrating this network with a novel meta-learning framework, COHF effectively transfers knowledge to the target HG to predict new classes with few-labeled data. Extensive experiments on seven real-world datasets have demonstrated the superior performance of COHF over the state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Expected Shapley-Like Scores of Boolean Functions: Complexity and Applications to Probabilistic Databases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06493v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Shapley values, originating in game theory and increasingly prominent in explainable AI, have been proposed to assess the contribution of facts in query answering over databases, along with other similar power indices such as Banzhaf values. In this work we adapt these Shapley-like scores to probabilistic settings, the objective being to compute their expected value. We show that the computations of expected Shapley values and of the expected values of Boolean functions are interreducible in polynomial time, thus obtaining the same tractability landscape. We investigate the specific tractable case where Boolean functions are represented as deterministic decomposable circuits, designing a polynomial-time algorithm for this setting. We present applications to probabilistic databases through database provenance, and an effective implementation of this algorithm within the ProvSQL system, which experimentally validates its feasibility over a standard benchmark.</description>

      <title>Joining Forces for Pathology Diagnostics with AI Assistance: The EMPAIA Initiative</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09450v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Over the past decade, artificial intelligence (AI) methods in pathology have advanced substantially. However, integration into routine clinical practice has been slow due to numerous challenges, including technical and regulatory hurdles in translating research results into clinical diagnostic products and the lack of standardized interfaces. The open and vendor-neutral EMPAIA initiative addresses these challenges. Here, we provide an overview of EMPAIA's achievements and lessons learned. EMPAIA integrates various stakeholders of the pathology AI ecosystem, i.e., pathologists, computer scientists, and industry. In close collaboration, we developed technical interoperability standards, recommendations for AI testing and product development, and explainability methods. We implemented the modular and open-source EMPAIA platform and successfully integrated 14 AI-based image analysis apps from 8 different vendors, demonstrating how different apps can use a single standardized interface. We prioritized requirements and evaluated the use of AI in real clinical settings with 14 different pathology laboratories in Europe and Asia. In addition to technical developments, we created a forum for all stakeholders to share information and experiences on digital pathology and AI. Commercial, clinical, and academic stakeholders can now adopt EMPAIA's common open-source interfaces, providing a unique opportunity for large-scale standardization and streamlining of processes. Further efforts are needed to effectively and broadly establish AI assistance in routine laboratory use. To this end, a sustainable infrastructure, the non-profit association EMPAIA International, has been established to continue standardization and support broad implementation and advocacy for an AI-assisted digital pathology future.</description>

      <title>Overcoming the Pitfalls of Vision-Language Model Finetuning for OOD Generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15914v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing vision-language models exhibit strong generalization on a variety of visual domains and tasks. However, such models mainly perform zero-shot recognition in a closed-set manner, and thus struggle to handle open-domain visual concepts by design. There are recent finetuning methods, such as prompt learning, that not only study the discrimination between in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) samples, but also show some improvements in both ID and OOD accuracies. In this paper, we first demonstrate that vision-language models, after long enough finetuning but without proper regularization, tend to overfit the known classes in the given dataset, with degraded performance on unknown classes. Then we propose a novel approach OGEN to address this pitfall, with the main focus on improving the OOD GENeralization of finetuned models. Specifically, a class-conditional feature generator is introduced to synthesize OOD features using just the class name of any unknown class. Such synthesized features will provide useful knowledge about unknowns and help regularize the decision boundary between ID and OOD data when optimized jointly. Equally important is our adaptive self-distillation mechanism to regularize our feature generation model during joint optimization, i.e., adaptively transferring knowledge between model states to further prevent overfitting. Experiments validate that our method yields convincing gains in OOD generalization performance in different settings. Code: https://github.com/apple/ml-ogen.</description>

      <title>ANLS* -- A Universal Document Processing Metric for Generative Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03848v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traditionally, discriminative models have been the predominant choice for tasks like document classification and information extraction. These models make predictions that fall into a limited number of predefined classes, facilitating a binary true or false evaluation and enabling the direct calculation of metrics such as the F1 score. However, recent advancements in generative large language models (GLLMs) have prompted a shift in the field due to their enhanced zero-shot capabilities, which eliminate the need for a downstream dataset and computationally expensive fine-tuning. However, evaluating GLLMs presents a challenge as the binary true or false evaluation used for discriminative models is not applicable to the predictions made by GLLMs.
  This paper introduces a new metric for generative models called ANLS* for evaluating a wide variety of tasks, including information extraction and classification tasks. The ANLS* metric extends existing ANLS metrics as a drop-in-replacement and is still compatible with previously reported ANLS scores. An evaluation of 7 different datasets, 6 different GLLMs and 3 different prompting methods using the ANLS* metric is also provided, demonstrating the importance of the proposed metric.
  We also benchmark a novel approach to generate prompts for documents, called SFT, against other prompting techniques such as LATIN. In 27 out of 35 cases, SFT outperforms other techniques and improves the state-of-the-art, sometimes by as much as $18$ percentage points.

      <title>Large Language User Interfaces: Voice Interactive User Interfaces powered by LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07938v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) has showcased remarkable capacities for logical reasoning and natural language comprehension. These capabilities can be leveraged in solutions that semantically and textually model complex problems. In this paper, we present our efforts toward constructing a framework that can serve as an intermediary between a user and their user interface (UI), enabling dynamic and real-time interactions. We employ a system that stands upon textual semantic mappings of UI components, in the form of annotations. These mappings are stored, parsed, and scaled in a custom data structure, supplementary to an agent-based prompting backend engine. Employing textual semantic mappings allows each component to not only explain its role to the engine but also provide expectations. By comprehending the needs of both the user and the components, our LLM engine can classify the most appropriate application, extract relevant parameters, and subsequently execute precise predictions of the user's expected actions. Such an integration evolves static user interfaces into highly dynamic and adaptable solutions, introducing a new frontier of intelligent and responsive user experiences.</description>

      <title>Generation Meets Verification: Accelerating Large Language Model Inference with Smart Parallel Auto-Correct Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11809v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This research aims to accelerate the inference speed of large language models (LLMs) with billions of parameters. We propose \textbf{S}mart \textbf{P}arallel \textbf{A}uto-\textbf{C}orrect d\textbf{E}coding (SPACE), an innovative approach designed for achieving lossless acceleration of LLMs. By integrating semi-autoregressive inference and speculative decoding capabilities, SPACE uniquely enables autoregressive LLMs to parallelize token generation and verification. This is realized through a specialized semi-autoregressive supervised fine-tuning process that equips existing LLMs with the ability to simultaneously predict multiple tokens. Additionally, an auto-correct decoding algorithm facilitates the simultaneous generation and verification of token sequences within a single model invocation. Through extensive experiments on a range of LLMs, SPACE has demonstrated inference speedup ranging from 2.7x-4.0x on HumanEval-X while maintaining output quality.</description>

      <title>Triad: A Framework Leveraging a Multi-Role LLM-based Agent to Solve Knowledge Base Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14320v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent progress with LLM-based agents has shown promising results across various tasks. However, their use in answering questions from knowledge bases remains largely unexplored. Implementing a KBQA system using traditional methods is challenging due to the shortage of task-specific training data and the complexity of creating task-focused model structures. In this paper, we present Triad, a unified framework that utilizes an LLM-based agent with three roles for KBQA tasks. The agent is assigned three roles to tackle different KBQA subtasks: agent as a generalist for mastering various subtasks, as a decision maker for the selection of candidates, and as an advisor for answering questions with knowledge. Our KBQA framework is executed in four phases, involving the collaboration of the agent's multiple roles. We evaluated the performance of our framework using three benchmark datasets, and the results show that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art systems on the LC-QuAD and YAGO-QA benchmarks, yielding F1 scores of 11.8% and 20.7%, respectively.</description>

      <title>APTQ: Attention-aware Post-Training Mixed-Precision Quantization for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14866v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have greatly advanced the natural language processing paradigm. However, the high computational load and huge model sizes pose a grand challenge for deployment on edge devices. To this end, we propose APTQ (Attention-aware Post-Training Mixed-Precision Quantization) for LLMs, which considers not only the second-order information of each layer's weights, but also, for the first time, the nonlinear effect of attention outputs on the entire model. We leverage the Hessian trace as a sensitivity metric for mixed-precision quantization, ensuring an informed precision reduction that retains model performance. Experiments show APTQ surpasses previous quantization methods, achieving an average of 4 bit width a 5.22 perplexity nearly equivalent to full precision in the C4 dataset. In addition, APTQ attains state-of-the-art zero-shot accuracy of 68.24\% and 70.48\% at an average bitwidth of 3.8 in LLaMa-7B and LLaMa-13B, respectively, demonstrating its effectiveness to produce high-quality quantized LLMs.</description>

      <title>Multi-Constraint Safe RL with Objective Suppression for Safety-Critical Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15650v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Safe reinforcement learning tasks with multiple constraints are a challenging domain despite being very common in the real world. In safety-critical domains, properly handling the constraints becomes even more important. To address this challenge, we first describe the multi-constraint problem with a stronger Uniformly Constrained MDP (UCMDP) model; we then propose Objective Suppression, a novel method that adaptively suppresses the task reward maximizing objectives according to a safety critic, as a solution to the Lagrangian dual of a UCMDP. We benchmark Objective Suppression in two multi-constraint safety domains, including an autonomous driving domain where any incorrect behavior can lead to disastrous consequences. Empirically, we demonstrate that our proposed method, when combined with existing safe RL algorithms, can match the task reward achieved by our baselines with significantly fewer constraint violations.</description>

      <title>GROUNDHOG: Grounding Large Language Models to Holistic Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16846v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Most multimodal large language models (MLLMs) learn language-to-object grounding through causal language modeling where grounded objects are captured by bounding boxes as sequences of location tokens. This paradigm lacks pixel-level representations that are important for fine-grained visual understanding and diagnosis. In this work, we introduce GROUNDHOG, an MLLM developed by grounding Large Language Models to holistic segmentation. GROUNDHOG incorporates a masked feature extractor and converts extracted features into visual entity tokens for the MLLM backbone, which then connects groundable phrases to unified grounding masks by retrieving and merging the entity masks. To train GROUNDHOG, we carefully curated M3G2, a grounded visual instruction tuning dataset with Multi-Modal Multi-Grained Grounding, by harvesting a collection of segmentation-grounded datasets with rich annotations. Our experimental results show that GROUNDHOG achieves superior performance on various language grounding tasks without task-specific fine-tuning, and significantly reduces object hallucination. GROUNDHOG also demonstrates better grounding towards complex forms of visual input and provides easy-to-understand diagnosis in failure cases.</description>

      <title>Cause and Effect: Can Large Language Models Truly Understand Causality?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18139v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the rise of Large Language Models(LLMs), it has become crucial to understand their capabilities and limitations in deciphering and explaining the complex web of causal relationships that language entails. Current methods use either explicit or implicit causal reasoning, yet there is a strong need for a unified approach combining both to tackle a wide array of causal relationships more effectively. This research proposes a novel architecture called Context Aware Reasoning Enhancement with Counterfactual Analysis(CARE CA) framework to enhance causal reasoning and explainability. The proposed framework incorporates an explicit causal detection module with ConceptNet and counterfactual statements, as well as implicit causal detection through LLMs. Our framework goes one step further with a layer of counterfactual explanations to accentuate LLMs understanding of causality. The knowledge from ConceptNet enhances the performance of multiple causal reasoning tasks such as causal discovery, causal identification and counterfactual reasoning. The counterfactual sentences add explicit knowledge of the not caused by scenarios. By combining these powerful modules, our model aims to provide a deeper understanding of causal relationships, enabling enhanced interpretability. Evaluation of benchmark datasets shows improved performance across all metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores. We also introduce CausalNet, a new dataset accompanied by our code, to facilitate further research in this domain.</description>

      <title>Theoretically Achieving Continuous Representation of Oriented Bounding Boxes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18975v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Considerable efforts have been devoted to Oriented Object Detection (OOD). However, one lasting issue regarding the discontinuity in Oriented Bounding Box (OBB) representation remains unresolved, which is an inherent bottleneck for extant OOD methods. This paper endeavors to completely solve this issue in a theoretically guaranteed manner and puts an end to the ad-hoc efforts in this direction. Prior studies typically can only address one of the two cases of discontinuity: rotation and aspect ratio, and often inadvertently introduce decoding discontinuity, e.g. Decoding Incompleteness (DI) and Decoding Ambiguity (DA) as discussed in literature. Specifically, we propose a novel representation method called Continuous OBB (COBB), which can be readily integrated into existing detectors e.g. Faster-RCNN as a plugin. It can theoretically ensure continuity in bounding box regression which to our best knowledge, has not been achieved in literature for rectangle-based object representation. For fairness and transparency of experiments, we have developed a modularized benchmark based on the open-source deep learning framework Jittor's detection toolbox JDet for OOD evaluation. On the popular DOTA dataset, by integrating Faster-RCNN as the same baseline model, our new method outperforms the peer method Gliding Vertex by 1.13% mAP50 (relative improvement 1.54%), and 2.46% mAP75 (relative improvement 5.91%), without any tricks.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models are In-Context Molecule Learners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04197v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance in biochemical tasks, especially the molecule caption translation task, which aims to bridge the gap between molecules and natural language texts. However, previous methods in adapting LLMs to the molecule-caption translation task required extra domain-specific pre-training stages, suffered weak alignment between molecular and textual spaces, or imposed stringent demands on the scale of LLMs. To resolve the challenges, we propose In-Context Molecule Adaptation (ICMA), as a new paradigm allowing LLMs to learn the molecule-text alignment from context examples via In-Context Molecule Tuning. Specifically, ICMA incorporates the following three stages: Hybrid Context Retrieval, Post-retrieval Re-ranking, and In-context Molecule Tuning. Initially, Hybrid Context Retrieval utilizes BM25 Caption Retrieval and Molecule Graph Retrieval to retrieve informative context examples. Additionally, we also propose Post-retrieval Re-ranking with Sequence Reversal and Random Walk to further improve the quality of retrieval results. Finally, In-Context Molecule Tuning unlocks the in-context molecule learning capability of LLMs with retrieved examples and adapts the parameters of LLMs for the molecule-caption translation task. Experimental results demonstrate that ICMT can empower LLMs to achieve state-of-the-art or comparable performance without extra training corpora and intricate structures, showing that LLMs are inherently in-context molecule learners.</description>

      <title>Can Large Language Models Automatically Score Proficiency of Written Essays?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06149v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although several methods were proposed to address the problem of automated essay scoring (AES) in the last 50 years, there is still much to desire in terms of effectiveness. Large Language Models (LLMs) are transformer-based models that demonstrate extraordinary capabilities on various tasks. In this paper, we test the ability of LLMs, given their powerful linguistic knowledge, to analyze and effectively score written essays. We experimented with two popular LLMs, namely ChatGPT and Llama. We aim to check if these models can do this task and, if so, how their performance is positioned among the state-of-the-art (SOTA) models across two levels, holistically and per individual writing trait. We utilized prompt-engineering tactics in designing four different prompts to bring their maximum potential to this task. Our experiments conducted on the ASAP dataset revealed several interesting observations. First, choosing the right prompt depends highly on the model and nature of the task. Second, the two LLMs exhibited comparable average performance in AES, with a slight advantage for ChatGPT. Finally, despite the performance gap between the two LLMs and SOTA models in terms of predictions, they provide feedback to enhance the quality of the essays, which can potentially help both teachers and students.</description>

      <title>Rebuilding ROME : Resolving Model Collapse during Sequential Model Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07175v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent work using Rank-One Model Editing (ROME), a popular model editing method, has shown that there are certain facts that the algorithm is unable to edit without breaking the model. Such edits have previously been called disabling edits. These disabling edits cause immediate model collapse and limits the use of ROME for sequential editing. In this paper, we show that disabling edits are an artifact of irregularities in the implementation of ROME. With this paper, we provide a more stable implementation ROME, which we call r-ROME and show that model collapse is no longer observed when making large scale sequential edits with r-ROME, while further improving generalization and locality of model editing compared to the original implementation of ROME. We also provide a detailed mathematical explanation of the reason behind disabling edits.</description>

Abstract: This work introduces Gemma, a family of lightweight, state-of-the art open models built from the research and technology used to create Gemini models. Gemma models demonstrate strong performance across academic benchmarks for language understanding, reasoning, and safety. We release two sizes of models (2 billion and 7 billion parameters), and provide both pretrained and fine-tuned checkpoints. Gemma outperforms similarly sized open models on 11 out of 18 text-based tasks, and we present comprehensive evaluations of safety and responsibility aspects of the models, alongside a detailed description of model development. We believe the responsible release of LLMs is critical for improving the safety of frontier models, and for enabling the next wave of LLM innovations.</description>

      <title>ProSwitch: Knowledge-Guided Instruction Tuning to Generate Professional and Non-Professional Styled Text</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09131v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated efficacy in various linguistic applications, including text summarization and controlled text generation. However, studies into their capacity of switching between styles via fine-tuning remain underexplored. This study concentrates on textual professionalism and introduces a novel methodology, named ProSwitch, which equips a language model with the ability to produce both professional and non-professional responses through knowledge-guided instruction tuning. ProSwitch unfolds across three phases: data preparation for gathering domain knowledge and training corpus; instruction tuning for optimizing language models with multiple levels of instruction formats; and comprehensive evaluation for assessing the professionalism discrimination and reference-based quality of generated text. Comparative analysis of ProSwitch against both general and specialized language models reveals that our approach outperforms baselines in switching between professional and non-professional text generation.</description>

      <title>Neuron-centric Hebbian Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12076v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the most striking capabilities behind the learning mechanisms of the brain is the adaptation, through structural and functional plasticity, of its synapses. While synapses have the fundamental role of transmitting information across the brain, several studies show that it is the neuron activations that produce changes on synapses. Yet, most plasticity models devised for artificial Neural Networks (NNs), e.g., the ABCD rule, focus on synapses, rather than neurons, therefore optimizing synaptic-specific Hebbian parameters. This approach, however, increases the complexity of the optimization process since each synapse is associated to multiple Hebbian parameters. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel plasticity model, called Neuron-centric Hebbian Learning (NcHL), where optimization focuses on neuron- rather than synaptic-specific Hebbian parameters. Compared to the ABCD rule, NcHL reduces the parameters from $5W$ to $5N$, being $W$ and $N$ the number of weights and neurons, and usually $N \ll W$. We also devise a ``weightless'' NcHL model, which requires less memory by approximating the weights based on a record of neuron activations. Our experiments on two robotic locomotion tasks reveal that NcHL performs comparably to the ABCD rule, despite using up to $\sim97$ times less parameters, thus allowing for scalable plasticity</description>

      <title>AFLoRA: Adaptive Freezing of Low Rank Adaptation in Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning of Large Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13269v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) method, dubbed as Adaptive Freezing of Low Rank Adaptation (AFLoRA). Specifically, for each pre-trained frozen weight tensor, we add a parallel path of trainable low-rank matrices, namely a down-projection and an up-projection matrix, each of which is followed by a feature transformation vector. Based on a novel freezing score, we the incrementally freeze these projection matrices during fine-tuning to reduce the computation and alleviate over-fitting. Our experimental results demonstrate that we can achieve state-of-the-art performance with an average improvement of up to $0.85\%$ as evaluated on GLUE benchmark while yeilding up to $9.5\times$ fewer average trainable parameters. While compared in terms of runtime, AFLoRA can yield up to $1.86\times$ improvement as opposed to similar PEFT alternatives. Besides the practical utility of our approach, we provide insights on the trainability requirements of LoRA paths at different modules and the freezing schedule for the different projection matrices. Code will be released.</description>

      <title>Born With a Silver Spoon? Investigating Socioeconomic Bias in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14633v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Socioeconomic bias in society exacerbates disparities, influencing access to opportunities and resources based on individuals' economic and social backgrounds. This pervasive issue perpetuates systemic inequalities, hindering the pursuit of inclusive progress as a society. In this paper, we investigate the presence of socioeconomic bias, if any, in large language models. To this end, we introduce a novel dataset SilverSpoon, consisting of 3000 samples that illustrate hypothetical scenarios that involve underprivileged people performing ethically ambiguous actions due to their circumstances, and ask whether the action is ethically justified. Further, this dataset has a dual-labeling scheme and has been annotated by people belonging to both ends of the socioeconomic spectrum. Using SilverSpoon, we evaluate the degree of socioeconomic bias expressed in large language models and the variation of this degree as a function of model size. We also perform qualitative analysis to analyze the nature of this bias. Our analysis reveals that while humans disagree on which situations require empathy toward the underprivileged, most large language models are unable to empathize with the socioeconomically underprivileged regardless of the situation. To foster further research in this domain, we make SilverSpoon and our evaluation harness publicly available.</description>

      <title>Towards Two-Stream Foveation-based Active Vision Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15977v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep neural network (DNN) based machine perception frameworks process the entire input in a one-shot manner to provide answers to both "what object is being observed" and "where it is located". In contrast, the "two-stream hypothesis" from neuroscience explains the neural processing in the human visual cortex as an active vision system that utilizes two separate regions of the brain to answer the what and the where questions. In this work, we propose a machine learning framework inspired by the "two-stream hypothesis" and explore the potential benefits that it offers. Specifically, the proposed framework models the following mechanisms: 1) ventral (what) stream focusing on the input regions perceived by the fovea part of an eye (foveation), 2) dorsal (where) stream providing visual guidance, and 3) iterative processing of the two streams to calibrate visual focus and process the sequence of focused image patches. The training of the proposed framework is accomplished by label-based DNN training for the ventral stream model and reinforcement learning for the dorsal stream model. We show that the two-stream foveation-based learning is applicable to the challenging task of weakly-supervised object localization (WSOL), where the training data is limited to the object class or its attributes. The framework is capable of both predicting the properties of an object and successfully localizing it by predicting its bounding box. We also show that, due to the independent nature of the two streams, the dorsal model can be applied on its own to unseen images to localize objects from different datasets.</description>

      <title>Towards Explainability in Legal Outcome Prediction Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16852v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current legal outcome prediction models - a staple of legal NLP - do not explain their reasoning. However, to employ these models in the real world, human legal actors need to be able to understand the model's decisions. In the case of common law, legal practitioners reason towards the outcome of a case by referring to past case law, known as precedent. We contend that precedent is, therefore, a natural way of facilitating explainability for legal NLP models. In this paper, we contribute a novel method for identifying the precedent employed by legal outcome prediction models. Furthermore, by developing a taxonomy of legal precedent, we are able to compare human judges and neural models with respect to the different types of precedent they rely on. We find that while the models learn to predict outcomes reasonably well, their use of precedent is unlike that of human judges.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18742v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human intentions has become a critical task for safely deploying models in real-world systems. While existing alignment approaches have seen empirical success, theoretically understanding how these methods affect model behavior remains an open question. Our work provides an initial attempt to theoretically analyze the learning dynamics of human preference alignment. We formally show how the distribution of preference datasets influences the rate of model updates and provide rigorous guarantees on the training accuracy. Our theory also reveals an intricate phenomenon where the optimization is prone to prioritizing certain behaviors with higher preference distinguishability. We empirically validate our findings on contemporary LLMs and alignment tasks, reinforcing our theoretical insights and shedding light on considerations for future alignment approaches.

      <title>Attention-based Shape-Deformation Networks for Artifact-Free Geometry Reconstruction of Lumbar Spine from MR Images</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00231v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lumbar disc degeneration, a progressive structural wear and tear of lumbar intervertebral disc, is regarded as an essential role on low back pain, a significant global health concern. Automated lumbar spine geometry reconstruction from MR images will enable fast measurement of medical parameters to evaluate the lumbar status, in order to determine a suitable treatment. Existing image segmentation-based techniques often generate erroneous segments or unstructured point clouds, unsuitable for medical parameter measurement. In this work, we present TransDeformer: a novel attention-based deep learning approach that reconstructs the geometry of the lumbar spine with high spatial accuracy and mesh correspondence across patients, and we also present a variant of TransDeformer for error estimation. Specially, we devise new attention modules with a new attention formula, which integrate image features and tokenized contour features to predict the displacements of the points on a shape template without the need for image segmentation. The deformed template reveals the lumbar spine geometry in an image. Experiment results show that our TransDeformer generates artifact-free geometry outputs, and its variant predicts the error of a reconstructed geometry. Our code is available at https://github.com/linchenq/TransDeformer-Mesh.</description>

      <title>Scaling Properties of Speech Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00685v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Speech Language Models (SLMs) aim to learn language from raw audio, without textual resources. Despite significant advances, our current models exhibit weak syntax and semantic abilities. However, if the scaling properties of neural language models hold for the speech modality, these abilities will improve as the amount of compute used for training increases. In this paper, we use models of this scaling behavior to estimate the scale at which our current methods will yield a SLM with the English proficiency of text-based Large Language Models (LLMs). We establish a strong correlation between pre-training loss and downstream syntactic and semantic performance in SLMs and LLMs, which results in predictable scaling of linguistic performance. We show that the linguistic performance of SLMs scales up to three orders of magnitude more slowly than that of text-based LLMs. Additionally, we study the benefits of synthetic data designed to boost semantic understanding and the effects of coarser speech tokenization.</description>

      <title>NL2KQL: From Natural Language to Kusto Query</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02933v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data is growing rapidly in volume and complexity. Proficiency in database query languages is pivotal for crafting effective queries. As coding assistants become more prevalent, there is significant opportunity to enhance database query languages. The Kusto Query Language (KQL) is a widely used query language for large semi-structured data such as logs, telemetries, and time-series for big data analytics platforms. This paper introduces NL2KQL an innovative framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to convert natural language queries (NLQs) to KQL queries. The proposed NL2KQL framework includes several key components: Schema Refiner which narrows down the schema to its most pertinent elements; the Few-shot Selector which dynamically selects relevant examples from a few-shot dataset; and the Query Refiner which repairs syntactic and semantic errors in KQL queries. Additionally, this study outlines a method for generating large datasets of synthetic NLQ-KQL pairs which are valid within a specific database contexts. To validate NL2KQL's performance, we utilize an array of online (based on query execution) and offline (based on query parsing) metrics. Through ablation studies, the significance of each framework component is examined, and the datasets used for benchmarking are made publicly available. This work is the first of its kind and is compared with available baselines to demonstrate its effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Event Grounded Criminal Court View Generation with Cooperative (Large) Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07001v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the development of legal intelligence, Criminal Court View Generation has attracted much attention as a crucial task of legal intelligence, which aims to generate concise and coherent texts that summarize case facts and provide explanations for verdicts. Existing researches explore the key information in case facts to yield the court views. Most of them employ a coarse-grained approach that partitions the facts into broad segments (e.g., verdict-related sentences) to make predictions. However, this approach fails to capture the complex details present in the case facts, such as various criminal elements and legal events. To this end, in this paper, we propose an Event Grounded Generation (EGG) method for criminal court view generation with cooperative (Large) Language Models, which introduces the fine-grained event information into the generation. Specifically, we first design a LLMs-based extraction method that can extract events in case facts without massive annotated events. Then, we incorporate the extracted events into court view generation by merging case facts and events. Besides, considering the computational burden posed by the use of LLMs in the extraction phase of EGG, we propose a LLMs-free EGG method that can eliminate the requirement for event extraction using LLMs in the inference phase. Extensive experimental results on a real-world dataset clearly validate the effectiveness of our proposed method.</description>

      <title>Reward Learning from Suboptimal Demonstrations with Applications in Surgical Electrocautery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07185v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Automating robotic surgery via learning from demonstration (LfD) techniques is extremely challenging. This is because surgical tasks often involve sequential decision-making processes with complex interactions of physical objects and have low tolerance for mistakes. Prior works assume that all demonstrations are fully observable and optimal, which might not be practical in the real world. This paper introduces a sample-efficient method that learns a robust reward function from a limited amount of ranked suboptimal demonstrations consisting of partial-view point cloud observations. The method then learns a policy by optimizing the learned reward function using reinforcement learning (RL). We show that using a learned reward function to obtain a policy is more robust than pure imitation learning. We apply our approach on a physical surgical electrocautery task and demonstrate that our method can perform well even when the provided demonstrations are suboptimal and the observations are high-dimensional point clouds.

      <title>Laissez-Faire Harms: Algorithmic Biases in Generative Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07475v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid deployment of generative language models (LMs) has raised concerns about social biases affecting the well-being of diverse consumers. The extant literature on generative LMs has primarily examined bias via explicit identity prompting. However, prior research on bias in earlier language-based technology platforms, including search engines, has shown that discrimination can occur even when identity terms are not specified explicitly. Studies of bias in LM responses to open-ended prompts (where identity classifications are left unspecified) are lacking and have not yet been grounded in end-consumer harms. Here, we advance studies of generative LM bias by considering a broader set of natural use cases via open-ended prompting. In this "laissez-faire" setting, we find that synthetically generated texts from five of the most pervasive LMs (ChatGPT3.5, ChatGPT4, Claude2.0, Llama2, and PaLM2) perpetuate harms of omission, subordination, and stereotyping for minoritized individuals with intersectional race, gender, and/or sexual orientation identities (AI/AN, Asian, Black, Latine, MENA, NH/PI, Female, Non-binary, Queer). We find widespread evidence of bias to an extent that such individuals are hundreds to thousands of times more likely to encounter LM-generated outputs that portray their identities in a subordinated manner compared to representative or empowering portrayals. We also document a prevalence of stereotypes (e.g. perpetual foreigner) in LM-generated outputs that are known to trigger psychological harms that disproportionately affect minoritized individuals. These include stereotype threat, which leads to impaired cognitive performance and increased negative self-perception. Our findings highlight the urgent need to protect consumers from discriminatory harms caused by language models and invest in critical AI education programs tailored towards empowering diverse consumers.</description>

      <title>Pretraining and Updating Language- and Domain-specific Large Language Model: A Case Study in Japanese Business Domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08262v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Several previous studies have considered language- and domain-specific large language models (LLMs) as separate topics. This study explores the combination of a non-English language and a high-demand industry domain, focusing on a Japanese business-specific LLM. This type of a model requires expertise in the business domain, strong language skills, and regular updates of its knowledge. We trained a 13-billion-parameter LLM from scratch using a new dataset of business texts and patents, and continually pretrained it with the latest business documents. Further we propose a new benchmark for Japanese business domain question answering (QA) and evaluate our models on it. The results show that our pretrained model improves QA accuracy without losing general knowledge, and that continual pretraining enhances adaptation to new information. Our pretrained model and business domain benchmark are publicly available.</description>

      <title>Dataset Reset Policy Optimization for RLHF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08495v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) from Human Preference-based feedback is a popular paradigm for fine-tuning generative models, which has produced impressive models such as GPT-4 and Claude3 Opus. This framework often consists of two steps: learning a reward model from an offline preference dataset followed by running online RL to optimize the learned reward model. In this work, leveraging the idea of reset, we propose a new RLHF algorithm with provable guarantees. Motivated by the fact that offline preference dataset provides informative states (i.e., data that is preferred by the labelers), our new algorithm, Dataset Reset Policy Optimization (DR-PO), integrates the existing offline preference dataset into the online policy training procedure via dataset reset: it directly resets the policy optimizer to the states in the offline dataset, instead of always starting from the initial state distribution. In theory, we show that DR-PO learns to perform at least as good as any policy that is covered by the offline dataset under general function approximation with finite sample complexity. In experiments, we demonstrate that on both the TL;DR summarization and the Anthropic Helpful Harmful (HH) dataset, the generation from DR-PO is better than that from Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Direction Preference Optimization (DPO), under the metric of GPT4 win-rate.

      <title>RLHF Deciphered: A Critical Analysis of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback for LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08555v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: State-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) have become indispensable tools for various tasks. However, training LLMs to serve as effective assistants for humans requires careful consideration. A promising approach is reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), which leverages human feedback to update the model in accordance with human preferences and mitigate issues like toxicity and hallucinations. Yet, an understanding of RLHF for LLMs is largely entangled with initial design choices that popularized the method and current research focuses on augmenting those choices rather than fundamentally improving the framework. In this paper, we analyze RLHF through the lens of reinforcement learning principles to develop an understanding of its fundamentals, dedicating substantial focus to the core component of RLHF -- the reward model. Our study investigates modeling choices, caveats of function approximation, and their implications on RLHF training algorithms, highlighting the underlying assumptions made about the expressivity of reward. Our analysis improves the understanding of the role of reward models and methods for their training, concurrently revealing limitations of the current methodology. We characterize these limitations, including incorrect generalization, model misspecification, and the sparsity of feedback, along with their impact on the performance of a language model. The discussion and analysis are substantiated by a categorical review of current literature, serving as a reference for researchers and practitioners to understand the challenges of RLHF and build upon existing efforts.</description>

      <title>E3: Ensemble of Expert Embedders for Adapting Synthetic Image Detectors to New Generators Using Limited Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08814v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As generative AI progresses rapidly, new synthetic image generators continue to emerge at a swift pace. Traditional detection methods face two main challenges in adapting to these generators: the forensic traces of synthetic images from new techniques can vastly differ from those learned during training, and access to data for these new generators is often limited. To address these issues, we introduce the Ensemble of Expert Embedders (E3), a novel continual learning framework for updating synthetic image detectors. E3 enables the accurate detection of images from newly emerged generators using minimal training data. Our approach does this by first employing transfer learning to develop a suite of expert embedders, each specializing in the forensic traces of a specific generator. Then, all embeddings are jointly analyzed by an Expert Knowledge Fusion Network to produce accurate and reliable detection decisions. Our experiments demonstrate that E3 outperforms existing continual learning methods, including those developed specifically for synthetic image detection.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09172v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Research on diffusion model-based video generation has advanced rapidly. However, limitations in object fidelity and generation length hinder its practical applications. Additionally, specific domains like animated wallpapers require seamless looping, where the first and last frames of the video match seamlessly. To address these challenges, this paper proposes LoopAnimate, a novel method for generating videos with consistent start and end frames. To enhance object fidelity, we introduce a framework that decouples multi-level image appearance and textual semantic information. Building upon an image-to-image diffusion model, our approach incorporates both pixel-level and feature-level information from the input image, injecting image appearance and textual semantic embeddings at different positions of the diffusion model. Existing UNet-based video generation models require to input the entire videos during training to encode temporal and positional information at once. However, due to limitations in GPU memory, the number of frames is typically restricted to 16. To address this, this paper proposes a three-stage training strategy with progressively increasing frame numbers and reducing fine-tuning modules. Additionally, we introduce the Temporal E nhanced Motion Module(TEMM) to extend the capacity for encoding temporal and positional information up to 36 frames. The proposed LoopAnimate, which for the first time extends the single-pass generation length of UNet-based video generation models to 35 frames while maintaining high-quality video generation. Experiments demonstrate that LoopAnimate achieves state-of-the-art performance in both objective metrics, such as fidelity and temporal consistency, and subjective evaluation results.</description>

      <title>Text-to-Song: Towards Controllable Music Generation Incorporating Vocals and Accompaniment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09313v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A song is a combination of singing voice and accompaniment. However, existing works focus on singing voice synthesis and music generation independently. Little attention was paid to explore song synthesis. In this work, we propose a novel task called text-to-song synthesis which incorporating both vocals and accompaniments generation. We develop Melodist, a two-stage text-to-song method that consists of singing voice synthesis (SVS) and vocal-to-accompaniment (V2A) synthesis. Melodist leverages tri-tower contrastive pretraining to learn more effective text representation for controllable V2A synthesis. A Chinese song dataset mined from a music website is built up to alleviate data scarcity for our research. The evaluation results on our dataset demonstrate that Melodist can synthesize songs with comparable quality and style consistency. Audio samples can be found in https://text2songMelodist.github.io/Sample/.</description>

      <title>LatticeML: A data-driven application for predicting the effective Young Modulus of high temperature graph based architected materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09470v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Architected materials with their unique topology and geometry offer the potential to modify physical and mechanical properties. Machine learning can accelerate the design and optimization of these materials by identifying optimal designs and forecasting performance. This work presents LatticeML, a data-driven application for predicting the effective Young's Modulus of high-temperature graph-based architected materials. The study considers eleven graph-based lattice structures with two high-temperature alloys, Ti-6Al-4V and Inconel 625. Finite element simulations were used to compute the effective Young's Modulus of the 2x2x2 unit cell configurations. A machine learning framework was developed to predict Young's Modulus, involving data collection, preprocessing, implementation of regression models, and deployment of the best-performing model. Five supervised learning algorithms were evaluated, with the XGBoost Regressor achieving the highest accuracy (MSE = 2.7993, MAE = 1.1521, R-squared = 0.9875). The application uses the Streamlit framework to create an interactive web interface, allowing users to input material and geometric parameters and obtain predicted Young's Modulus values.</description>

      <title>Tango 2: Aligning Diffusion-based Text-to-Audio Generations through Direct Preference Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09956v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative multimodal content is increasingly prevalent in much of the content creation arena, as it has the potential to allow artists and media personnel to create pre-production mockups by quickly bringing their ideas to life. The generation of audio from text prompts is an important aspect of such processes in the music and film industry. Many of the recent diffusion-based text-to-audio models focus on training increasingly sophisticated diffusion models on a large set of datasets of prompt-audio pairs. These models do not explicitly focus on the presence of concepts or events and their temporal ordering in the output audio with respect to the input prompt. Our hypothesis is focusing on how these aspects of audio generation could improve audio generation performance in the presence of limited data. As such, in this work, using an existing text-to-audio model Tango, we synthetically create a preference dataset where each prompt has a winner audio output and some loser audio outputs for the diffusion model to learn from. The loser outputs, in theory, have some concepts from the prompt missing or in an incorrect order. We fine-tune the publicly available Tango text-to-audio model using diffusion-DPO (direct preference optimization) loss on our preference dataset and show that it leads to improved audio output over Tango and AudioLDM2, in terms of both automatic- and manual-evaluation metrics.</description>
