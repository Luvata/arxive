      <title>Partitioning Message Passing for Graph Fraud Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Label imbalance and homophily-heterophily mixture are the fundamental problems encountered when applying Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to Graph Fraud Detection (GFD) tasks. Existing GNN-based GFD models are designed to augment graph structure to accommodate the inductive bias of GNNs towards homophily, by excluding heterophilic neighbors during message passing. In our work, we argue that the key to applying GNNs for GFD is not to exclude but to {\em distinguish} neighbors with different labels. Grounded in this perspective, we introduce Partitioning Message Passing (PMP), an intuitive yet effective message passing paradigm expressly crafted for GFD. Specifically, in the neighbor aggregation stage of PMP, neighbors with different classes are aggregated with distinct node-specific aggregation functions. By this means, the center node can adaptively adjust the information aggregated from its heterophilic and homophilic neighbors, thus avoiding the model gradient being dominated by benign nodes which occupy the majority of the population. We theoretically establish a connection between the spatial formulation of PMP and spectral analysis to characterize that PMP operates an adaptive node-specific spectral graph filter, which demonstrates the capability of PMP to handle heterophily-homophily mixed graphs. Extensive experimental results show that PMP can significantly boost the performance on GFD tasks.</description>

      <title>Planning vs Reasoning: Ablations to Test Capabilities of LoRA layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) layers have emerged as a promising approach for efficient model fine-tuning, but their capabilities and limitations have not been fully explored. This paper: 1) Investigates the fundamental question of whether LoRA layers are effective at increasing reasoning + planning abilities 2) We introduce HashChain Reasoning, a novel evaluation dataset that deterministically tests reasoning capabilities.
  Through systematic ablation studies on GPT-2, we demonstrate that reasoning capabilities appear to exist primarily in low-rank spaces and can be effectively enhanced using LoRA layers. The effective rank analysis of trained LoRA matrices reveals a 2-3x lower rank requirement for reasoning tasks compared to planning tasks, giving context on where LoRA layers would be effective. This also provides evidence for reasoning fundamentally preferring low-parameter spaces for generalization.</description>

      <title>Can an AI Agent Safely Run a Government? Existence of Probably Approximately Aligned Policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While autonomous agents often surpass humans in their ability to handle vast and complex data, their potential misalignment (i.e., lack of transparency regarding their true objective) has thus far hindered their use in critical applications such as social decision processes. More importantly, existing alignment methods provide no formal guarantees on the safety of such models. Drawing from utility and social choice theory, we provide a novel quantitative definition of alignment in the context of social decision-making. Building on this definition, we introduce probably approximately aligned (i.e., near-optimal) policies, and we derive a sufficient condition for their existence. Lastly, recognizing the practical difficulty of satisfying this condition, we introduce the relaxed concept of safe (i.e., nondestructive) policies, and we propose a simple yet robust method to safeguard the black-box policy of any autonomous agent, ensuring all its actions are verifiably safe for the society.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Industrial networks are undergoing rapid transformation driven by the convergence of emerging technologies that are revolutionizing conventional workflows, enhancing operational efficiency, and fundamentally redefining the industrial landscape across diverse sectors. Amidst this revolution, Digital Twin (DT) emerges as a transformative innovation that seamlessly integrates real-world systems with their virtual counterparts, bridging the physical and digital realms. In this article, we present a comprehensive survey of the emerging DT-enabled services and applications across industries, beginning with an overview of DT fundamentals and its components to a discussion of key enabling technologies for DT. Different from literature works, we investigate and analyze the capabilities of DT across a wide range of industrial services, including data sharing, data offloading, integrated sensing and communication, content caching, resource allocation, wireless networking, and metaverse. In particular, we present an in-depth technical discussion of the roles of DT in industrial applications across various domains, including manufacturing, healthcare, transportation, energy, agriculture, space, oil and gas, as well as robotics. Throughout the technical analysis, we delve into real-time data communications between physical and virtual platforms to enable industrial DT networking. Subsequently, we extensively explore and analyze a wide range of major privacy and security issues in DT-based industry. Taxonomy tables and the key research findings from the survey are also given, emphasizing important insights into the significance of DT in industries. Finally, we point out future research directions to spur further research in this promising area.</description>

      <title>An AI-Driven Data Mesh Architecture Enhancing Decision-Making in Infrastructure Construction and Public Procurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Infrastructure construction, often dubbed an "industry of industries," is closely linked with government spending and public procurement, offering significant opportunities for improved efficiency and productivity through better transparency and information access. By leveraging these opportunities, we can achieve notable gains in productivity, cost savings, and broader economic benefits. Our approach introduces an integrated software ecosystem utilizing Data Mesh and Service Mesh architectures. This system includes the largest training dataset for infrastructure and procurement, encompassing over 100 billion tokens, scientific publications, activities, and risk data, all structured by a systematic AI framework. Supported by a Knowledge Graph linked to domain-specific multi-agent tasks and Q&amp;A capabilities, our platform standardizes and ingests diverse data sources, transforming them into structured knowledge. Leveraging large language models (LLMs) and automation, our system revolutionizes data structuring and knowledge creation, aiding decision-making in early-stage project planning, detailed research, market trend analysis, and qualitative assessments. Its web-scalable architecture delivers domain-curated information, enabling AI agents to facilitate reasoning and manage uncertainties, while preparing for future expansions with specialized agents targeting particular challenges. This integration of AI with domain expertise not only boosts efficiency and decision-making in construction and infrastructure but also establishes a framework for enhancing government efficiency and accelerating the transition of traditional industries to digital workflows. This work is poised to significantly influence AI-driven initiatives in this sector and guide best practices in AI Operations.</description>

      <title>Integrating Social Determinants of Health into Knowledge Graphs: Evaluating Prediction Bias and Fairness in Healthcare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social determinants of health (SDoH) play a crucial role in patient health outcomes, yet their integration into biomedical knowledge graphs remains underexplored. This study addresses this gap by constructing an SDoH-enriched knowledge graph using the MIMIC-III dataset and PrimeKG. We introduce a novel fairness formulation for graph embeddings, focusing on invariance with respect to sensitive SDoH information. Via employing a heterogeneous-GCN model for drug-disease link prediction, we detect biases related to various SDoH factors. To mitigate these biases, we propose a post-processing method that strategically reweights edges connected to SDoHs, balancing their influence on graph representations. This approach represents one of the first comprehensive investigations into fairness issues within biomedical knowledge graphs incorporating SDoH. Our work not only highlights the importance of considering SDoH in medical informatics but also provides a concrete method for reducing SDoH-related biases in link prediction tasks, paving the way for more equitable healthcare recommendations. Our code is available at \url{https://github.com/hwq0726/SDoH-KG}.</description>

      <title>Fine Tuning Large Language Models to Deliver CBT for Depression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is a well-established, evidence-based treatment for Major Depressive Disorder. Unfortunately, there exist significant barriers to individuals accessing CBT, including cost, scarcity of therapists and stigma. This study explores the feasibility of fine-tuning small open weight large language models (LLMs) to deliver CBT for depression. Using 58 sets of synthetic CBT transcripts generated by the Nous Research fine-tune of Llama 3.1 405b, we fine-tuned three models: Mistral 7b v0.3, Qwen 2.5 7b, and Llama 3.1 8b. CBT fidelity was evaluated through a modified Cognitive Therapy Rating Scale (CTRS). All fine-tuned models were compared against each other, as well as their instruct-tuned variants. Simulated patient transcripts were generated for the purpose of evaluating model performance, with the instruct and CBT-tuned models acting as the therapist and DeepSeek-V2.5 acting as the patient. These simulated transcripts were evaluated on a modified CTRS by Gemini 1.5 Pro-002. Our findings demonstrated that the CBT-tuned models significantly outperformed their instruct-tuned counterparts, with an average improvement of 11.33 points (p &lt; 0.001) on total CTRS score. Llama 3.1 8b had the strongest performance (mean CTRS score 67.86 +/- 7.24), followed by Qwen 2.5 7b (64.28 +/- 9.55) and Mistral 7b v0.3 (64.17 +/- 9.79), with these differences between models being statistically significant. The CBT-tuned models were competent in implementing core CBT techniques and providing empathetic responses, however, there were limitations observed in agenda adherence, exploration depth and long-context coherence. This study establishes that CBT specific fine-tuning can effectively encode therapeutic competencies in small LLMs, though significant technical and ethical considerations must be resolved prior to clinical deployment.</description>

      <title>Streamlining the review process: AI-generated annotations in research manuscripts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing volume of research paper submissions poses a significant challenge to the traditional academic peer-review system, leading to an overwhelming workload for reviewers. This study explores the potential of integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) into the peer-review process to enhance efficiency without compromising effectiveness. We focus on manuscript annotations, particularly excerpt highlights, as a potential area for AI-human collaboration. While LLMs excel in certain tasks like aspect coverage and informativeness, they often lack high-level analysis and critical thinking, making them unsuitable for replacing human reviewers entirely. Our approach involves using LLMs to assist with specific aspects of the review process. This paper introduces AnnotateGPT, a platform that utilizes GPT-4 for manuscript review, aiming to improve reviewers' comprehension and focus. We evaluate AnnotateGPT using a Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) questionnaire with nine participants and generalize the findings. Our work highlights annotation as a viable middle ground for AI-human collaboration in academic review, offering insights into integrating LLMs into the review process and tuning traditional annotation tools for LLM incorporation.</description>

      <title>PlanCritic: Formal Planning with Human Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real world planning problems are often too complex to be effectively tackled by a single unaided human. To alleviate this, some recent work has focused on developing a collaborative planning system to assist humans in complex domains, with bridging the gap between the system's problem representation and the real world being a key consideration. Transferring the speed and correctness formal planners provide to real-world planning problems is greatly complicated by the dynamic and online nature of such tasks. Formal specifications of task and environment dynamics frequently lack constraints on some behaviors or goal conditions relevant to the way a human operator prefers a plan to be carried out. While adding constraints to the representation with the objective of increasing its realism risks slowing down the planner, we posit that the same benefits can be realized without sacrificing speed by modeling this problem as an online preference learning task. As part of a broader cooperative planning system, we present a feedback-driven plan critic. This method makes use of reinforcement learning with human feedback in conjunction with a genetic algorithm to directly optimize a plan with respect to natural-language user preferences despite the non-differentiability of traditional planners. Directly optimizing the plan bridges the gap between research into more efficient planners and research into planning with language models by utilizing the convenience of natural language to guide the output of formal planners. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our plan critic at adhering to user preferences on a disaster recovery task, and observe improved performance compared to an llm-only neurosymbolic approach.</description>

      <title>Empowering the Deaf and Hard of Hearing Community: Enhancing Video Captions Using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In today's digital age, video content is prevalent, serving as a primary source of information, education, and entertainment. However, the Deaf and Hard of Hearing (DHH) community often faces significant challenges in accessing video content due to the inadequacy of automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems in providing accurate and reliable captions. This paper addresses the urgent need to improve video caption quality by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs). We present a comprehensive study that explores the integration of LLMs to enhance the accuracy and context-awareness of captions generated by ASR systems. Our methodology involves a novel pipeline that corrects ASR-generated captions using advanced LLMs. It explicitly focuses on models like GPT-3.5 and Llama2-13B due to their robust performance in language comprehension and generation tasks. We introduce a dataset representative of real-world challenges the DHH community faces to evaluate our proposed pipeline. Our results indicate that LLM-enhanced captions significantly improve accuracy, as evidenced by a notably lower Word Error Rate (WER) achieved by ChatGPT-3.5 (WER: 9.75%) compared to the original ASR captions (WER: 23.07%), ChatGPT-3.5 shows an approximate 57.72% improvement in WER compared to the original ASR captions.</description>

      <title>CaDA: Cross-Problem Routing Solver with Constraint-Aware Dual-Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vehicle Routing Problems (VRPs) are significant Combinatorial Optimization (CO) problems holding substantial practical importance. Recently, Neural Combinatorial Optimization (NCO), which involves training deep learning models on extensive data to learn vehicle routing heuristics, has emerged as a promising approach due to its efficiency and the reduced need for manual algorithm design. However, applying NCO across diverse real-world scenarios with various constraints necessitates cross-problem capabilities. Current NCO methods typically employ a unified model lacking a constraint-specific structure, thereby restricting their cross-problem performance. Current multi-task methods for VRPs typically employ a constraint-unaware model, limiting their cross-problem performance. Furthermore, they rely solely on global connectivity, which fails to focus on key nodes and leads to inefficient representation learning. This paper introduces a Constraint-Aware Dual-Attention Model (CaDA), designed to address these limitations. CaDA incorporates a constraint prompt that efficiently represents different problem variants. Additionally, it features a dual-attention mechanism with a global branch for capturing broader graph-wide information and a sparse branch that selectively focuses on the most relevant nodes. We comprehensively evaluate our model on 16 different VRPs and compare its performance against existing cross-problem VRP solvers. CaDA achieves state-of-the-art results across all the VRPs. Our ablation study further confirms that each component of CaDA contributes positively to its cross-problem learning performance.</description>

      <title>Safety Alignment Backfires: Preventing the Re-emergence of Suppressed Concepts in Fine-tuned Text-to-Image Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fine-tuning text-to-image diffusion models is widely used for personalization and adaptation for new domains. In this paper, we identify a critical vulnerability of fine-tuning: safety alignment methods designed to filter harmful content (e.g., nudity) can break down during fine-tuning, allowing previously suppressed content to resurface, even when using benign datasets. While this "fine-tuning jailbreaking" issue is known in large language models, it remains largely unexplored in text-to-image diffusion models. Our investigation reveals that standard fine-tuning can inadvertently undo safety measures, causing models to relearn harmful concepts that were previously removed and even exacerbate harmful behaviors. To address this issue, we present a novel but immediate solution called Modular LoRA, which involves training Safety Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) modules separately from Fine-Tuning LoRA components and merging them during inference. This method effectively prevents the re-learning of harmful content without compromising the model's performance on new tasks. Our experiments demonstrate that Modular LoRA outperforms traditional fine-tuning methods in maintaining safety alignment, offering a practical approach for enhancing the security of text-to-image diffusion models against potential attacks.</description>

      <title>Unified Parameter-Efficient Unlearning for LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized natural language processing, enabling advanced understanding and reasoning capabilities across a variety of tasks. Fine-tuning these models for specific domains, particularly through Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) strategies like LoRA, has become a prevalent practice due to its efficiency. However, this raises significant privacy and security concerns, as models may inadvertently retain and disseminate sensitive or undesirable information. To address these issues, we introduce a novel instance-wise unlearning framework, LLMEraser, which systematically categorizes unlearning tasks and applies precise parameter adjustments using influence functions. Unlike traditional unlearning techniques that are often limited in scope and require extensive retraining, LLMEraser is designed to handle a broad spectrum of unlearning tasks without compromising model performance. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that LLMEraser excels in efficiently managing various unlearning scenarios while maintaining the overall integrity and efficacy of the models.</description>

      <title>Strategic Application of AIGC for UAV Trajectory Design: A Channel Knowledge Map Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly utilized in wireless communication, yet accurate channel loss prediction remains a significant challenge, limiting resource optimization performance. To address this issue, this paper leverages Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) for the efficient construction of Channel Knowledge Maps (CKM) and UAV trajectory design. Given the time-consuming nature of channel data collection, AI techniques are employed in a Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN) to extract environmental features and augment the data. Experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in improving CKM construction accuracy. Moreover, integrating CKM into UAV trajectory planning reduces channel gain uncertainty, demonstrating its potential to enhance wireless communication efficiency.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing capabilities of large language models in natural language understanding significantly strengthen existing agentic systems. To power performant on-device mobile agents for better data privacy, we introduce DroidCall, the first training and testing dataset for accurate Android intent invocation. With a highly flexible and reusable data generation pipeline, we constructed 10k samples in DroidCall. Given a task instruction in natural language, small language models such as Qwen2.5-3B and Gemma2-2B fine-tuned with DroidCall can approach or even surpass the capabilities of GPT-4o for accurate Android intent invocation. We also provide an end-to-end Android app equipped with these fine-tuned models to demonstrate the Android intent invocation process. The code and dataset are available at https://github.com/UbiquitousLearning/DroidCall.</description>

      <title>Federated Progressive Self-Distillation with Logits Calibration for Personalized IIoT Edge Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) focuses on tailoring models to individual IIoT clients in federated learning by addressing data heterogeneity and diverse user needs. Although existing studies have proposed effective PFL solutions from various perspectives, they overlook the issue of forgetting both historical personalized knowledge and global generalized knowledge during local training on clients. Therefore, this study proposes a novel PFL method, Federated Progressive Self-Distillation (FedPSD), based on logits calibration and progressive self-distillation. We analyze the impact mechanism of client data distribution characteristics on personalized and global knowledge forgetting. To address the issue of global knowledge forgetting, we propose a logits calibration approach for the local training loss and design a progressive self-distillation strategy to facilitate the gradual inheritance of global knowledge, where the model outputs from the previous epoch serve as virtual teachers to guide the training of subsequent epochs. Moreover, to address personalized knowledge forgetting, we construct calibrated fusion labels by integrating historical personalized model outputs, which are then used as teacher model outputs to guide the initial epoch of local self-distillation, enabling rapid recall of personalized knowledge. Extensive experiments under various data heterogeneity scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed FedPSD method.</description>

      <title>Predictive Models in Sequential Recommendations: Bridging Performance Laws with Data Quality Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sequential Recommendation (SR) plays a critical role in predicting users' sequential preferences. Despite its growing prominence in various industries, the increasing scale of SR models incurs substantial computational costs and unpredictability, challenging developers to manage resources efficiently. Under this predicament, Scaling Laws have achieved significant success by examining the loss as models scale up. However, there remains a disparity between loss and model performance, which is of greater concern in practical applications. Moreover, as data continues to expand, it incorporates repetitive and inefficient data. In response, we introduce the Performance Law for SR models, which aims to theoretically investigate and model the relationship between model performance and data quality. Specifically, we first fit the HR and NDCG metrics to transformer-based SR models. Subsequently, we propose Approximate Entropy (ApEn) to assess data quality, presenting a more nuanced approach compared to traditional data quantity metrics. Our method enables accurate predictions across various dataset scales and model sizes, demonstrating a strong correlation in large SR models and offering insights into achieving optimal performance for any given model configuration.</description>

      <title>Benchmark Real-time Adaptation and Communication Capabilities of Embodied Agent in Collaborative Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have opened transformative possibilities for human-robot interaction, especially in collaborative environments. However, Real-time human-AI collaboration requires agents to adapt to unseen human behaviors while maintaining effective communication dynamically. Existing benchmarks fall short in evaluating such adaptability for embodied agents, focusing mostly on the task performance of the agent itself. To address this gap, we propose a novel benchmark that assesses agents' reactive adaptability and instantaneous communication capabilities at every step. Based on this benchmark, we propose a Monitor-then-Adapt framework (MonTA), combining strong adaptability and communication with real-time execution. MonTA contains three key LLM modules, a lightweight \textit{Monitor} for monitoring the need for adaptation in high frequency, and two proficient \textit{Adapters} for subtask and path adaptation reasoning in low frequency. Our results demonstrate that MonTA outperforms other baseline agents on our proposed benchmark. Further user studies confirm the high reasonability adaptation plan and consistent language instruction provided by our framework.</description>

      <title>Node Importance Estimation Leveraging LLMs for Semantic Augmentation in Knowledge Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Node Importance Estimation (NIE) is a task that quantifies the importance of node in a graph. Recent research has investigated to exploit various information from Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to estimate node importance scores. However, the semantic information in KGs could be insufficient, missing, and inaccurate, which would limit the performance of existing NIE models. To address these issues, we leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) for semantic augmentation thanks to the LLMs' extra knowledge and ability of integrating knowledge from both LLMs and KGs. To this end, we propose the LLMs Empowered Node Importance Estimation (LENIE) method to enhance the semantic information in KGs for better supporting NIE tasks. To our best knowledge, this is the first work incorporating LLMs into NIE. Specifically, LENIE employs a novel clustering-based triplet sampling strategy to extract diverse knowledge of a node sampled from the given KG. After that, LENIE adopts the node-specific adaptive prompts to integrate the sampled triplets and the original node descriptions, which are then fed into LLMs for generating richer and more precise augmented node descriptions. These augmented descriptions finally initialize node embeddings for boosting the downstream NIE model performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate LENIE's effectiveness in addressing semantic deficiencies in KGs, enabling more informative semantic augmentation and enhancing existing NIE models to achieve the state-of-the-art performance. The source code of LENIE is freely available at \url{https://github.com/XinyuLin-FZ/LENIE}.</description>

      <title>LAMBDA: Covering the Multimodal Critical Scenarios for Automated Driving Systems by Search Space Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scenario-based virtual testing is one of the most significant methods to test and evaluate the safety of automated driving systems (ADSs). However, it is impractical to enumerate all concrete scenarios in a logical scenario space and test them exhaustively. Recently, Black-Box Optimization (BBO) was introduced to accelerate the scenario-based test of ADSs by utilizing the historical test information to generate new test cases. However, a single optimum found by the BBO algorithm is insufficient for the purpose of a comprehensive safety evaluation of ADSs in a logical scenario. In fact, all the subspaces representing danger in the logical scenario space, rather than only the most critical concrete scenario, play a more significant role for the safety evaluation. Covering as many of the critical concrete scenarios in a logical scenario space through a limited number of tests is defined as the Black-Box Coverage (BBC) problem in this paper. We formalized this problem in a sample-based search paradigm and constructed a coverage criterion with Confusion Matrix Analysis. Furthermore, we propose LAMBDA (Latent-Action Monte-Carlo Beam Search with Density Adaption) to solve BBC problems. LAMBDA can quickly focus on critical subspaces by recursively partitioning the logical scenario space into accepted and rejected parts. Compared with its predecessor LaMCTS, LAMBDA introduces sampling density to overcome the sampling bias from optimization and Beam Search to obtain more parallelizability. Experimental results show that LAMBDA achieves state-of-the-art performance among all baselines and can reach at most 33 and 6000 times faster than Random Search to get 95% coverage of the critical areas in 2- and 5-dimensional synthetic functions, respectively. Experiments also demonstrate that LAMBDA has a promising future in the safety evaluation of ADSs in virtual tests.</description>

      <title>Forma mentis networks predict creativity ratings of short texts via interpretable artificial intelligence in human and GPT-simulated raters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Creativity is a fundamental skill of human cognition. We use textual forma mentis networks (TFMN) to extract network (semantic/syntactic associations) and emotional features from approximately one thousand human- and GPT3.5-generated stories. Using Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), we test whether features relative to Mednick's associative theory of creativity can explain creativity ratings assigned by humans and GPT-3.5. Using XGBoost, we examine three scenarios: (i) human ratings of human stories, (ii) GPT-3.5 ratings of human stories, and (iii) GPT-3.5 ratings of GPT-generated stories. Our findings reveal that GPT-3.5 ratings differ significantly from human ratings not only in terms of correlations but also because of feature patterns identified with XAI methods. GPT-3.5 favours 'its own' stories and rates human stories differently from humans. Feature importance analysis with SHAP scores shows that: (i) network features are more predictive for human creativity ratings but also for GPT-3.5's ratings of human stories; (ii) emotional features played a greater role than semantic/syntactic network structure in GPT-3.5 rating its own stories. These quantitative results underscore key limitations in GPT-3.5's ability to align with human assessments of creativity. We emphasise the need for caution when using GPT-3.5 to assess and generate creative content, as it does not yet capture the nuanced complexity that characterises human creativity.</description>

      <title>FullStack Bench: Evaluating LLMs as Full Stack Coder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the capabilities of code large language models (LLMs) continue to expand, their applications across diverse code intelligence domains are rapidly increasing. However, most existing datasets only evaluate limited application domains. To address this gap, we have developed a comprehensive code evaluation dataset FullStack Bench focusing on full-stack programming, which encompasses a wide range of application domains (e.g., basic programming, data analysis, software engineering, mathematics, and machine learning). Besides, to assess multilingual programming capabilities, in FullStack Bench, we design real-world instructions and corresponding unit test cases from 16 widely-used programming languages to reflect real-world usage scenarios rather than simple translations. Moreover, we also release an effective code sandbox execution tool (i.e., SandboxFusion) supporting various programming languages and packages to evaluate the performance of our FullStack Bench efficiently. Comprehensive experimental results on our FullStack Bench demonstrate the necessity and effectiveness of our FullStack Bench and SandboxFusion.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Generalizability and Discriminability of Self-Supervised Learning from Evolutionary Game Theory Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Representations learned by self-supervised approaches are generally considered to possess sufficient generalizability and discriminability. However, we disclose a nontrivial mutual-exclusion relationship between these critical representation properties through an exploratory demonstration on self-supervised learning. State-of-the-art self-supervised methods tend to enhance either generalizability or discriminability but not both simultaneously. Thus, learning representations jointly possessing strong generalizability and discriminability presents a specific challenge for self-supervised learning. To this end, we revisit the learning paradigm of self-supervised learning from the perspective of evolutionary game theory (EGT) and outline the theoretical roadmap to achieve a desired trade-off between these representation properties. EGT performs well in analyzing the trade-off point in a two-player game by utilizing dynamic system modeling. However, the EGT analysis requires sufficient annotated data, which contradicts the principle of self-supervised learning, i.e., the EGT analysis cannot be conducted without the annotations of the specific target domain for self-supervised learning. Thus, to enhance the methodological generalization, we propose a novel self-supervised learning method that leverages advancements in reinforcement learning to jointly benefit from the general guidance of EGT and sequentially optimize the model to chase the consistent improvement of generalizability and discriminability for specific target domains during pre-training. Theoretically, we establish that the proposed method tightens the generalization error upper bound of self-supervised learning. Empirically, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on various benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Opus: A Large Work Model for Complex Workflow Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces Opus, a novel framework for generating and optimizing Workflows tailored to complex Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) use cases, focusing on cost reduction and quality enhancement while adhering to established industry processes and operational constraints. Our approach generates executable Workflows from Intention, defined as the alignment of Client Input, Client Output, and Process Context. These Workflows are represented as Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), with nodes as Tasks consisting of sequences of executable Instructions, including tools and human expert reviews. We adopt a two-phase methodology: Workflow Generation and Workflow Optimization. In the Generation phase, Workflows are generated using a Large Work Model (LWM) informed by a Work Knowledge Graph (WKG) that encodes domain-specific procedural and operational knowledge. In the Optimization phase, Workflows are transformed into Workflow Graphs (WFGs), where optimal Workflows are determined through path optimization. Our experiments demonstrate that state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) face challenges in reliably retrieving detailed process data as well as generating industry-compliant workflows. The key contributions of this paper include: - The integration of a Work Knowledge Graph (WKG) into a Large Work Model (LWM), enabling the generation of context-aware, semantically aligned, structured and auditable Workflows. - A two-phase approach that combines Workflow Generation from Intention with graph-based Workflow Optimization. - Opus Alpha 1 Large and Opus Alpha 1 Small, models that outperform state-of-the-art LLMs by 38\% and 29\% respectively in Workflow Generation for a Medical Coding use case.</description>

      <title>Turing Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA): A Flexible Method for Measuring Alignment Between Human and Artificial Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As we consider entrusting Large Language Models (LLMs) with key societal and decision-making roles, measuring their alignment with human cognition becomes critical. This requires methods that can assess how these systems represent information and facilitate comparisons to human understanding across diverse tasks. To meet this need, we developed Turing Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA), a method that uses pairwise similarity ratings to quantify alignment between AIs and humans. We tested this approach on semantic alignment across text and image modalities, measuring how different Large Language and Vision Language Model (LLM and VLM) similarity judgments aligned with human responses at both group and individual levels. GPT-4o showed the strongest alignment with human performance among the models we tested, particularly when leveraging its text processing capabilities rather than image processing, regardless of the input modality. However, no model we studied adequately captured the inter-individual variability observed among human participants. This method helped uncover certain hyperparameters and prompts that could steer model behavior to have more or less human-like qualities at an inter-individual or group level. Turing RSA enables the efficient and flexible quantification of human-AI alignment and complements existing accuracy-based benchmark tasks. We demonstrate its utility across multiple modalities (words, sentences, images) for understanding how LLMs encode knowledge and for examining representational alignment with human cognition.</description>

      <title>Fairness at Every Intersection: Uncovering and Mitigating Intersectional Biases in Multimodal Clinical Predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biases in automated clinical decision-making using Electronic Healthcare Records (EHR) impose significant disparities in patient care and treatment outcomes. Conventional approaches have primarily focused on bias mitigation strategies stemming from single attributes, overlooking intersectional subgroups -- groups formed across various demographic intersections (such as race, gender, ethnicity, etc.). Rendering single-attribute mitigation strategies to intersectional subgroups becomes statistically irrelevant due to the varying distribution and bias patterns across these subgroups. The multimodal nature of EHR -- data from various sources such as combinations of text, time series, tabular, events, and images -- adds another layer of complexity as the influence on minority groups may fluctuate across modalities. In this paper, we take the initial steps to uncover potential intersectional biases in predictions by sourcing extensive multimodal datasets, MIMIC-Eye1 and MIMIC-IV ED, and propose mitigation at the intersectional subgroup level. We perform and benchmark downstream tasks and bias evaluation on the datasets by learning a unified text representation from multimodal sources, harnessing the enormous capabilities of the pre-trained clinical Language Models (LM), MedBERT, Clinical BERT, and Clinical BioBERT. Our findings indicate that the proposed sub-group-specific bias mitigation is robust across different datasets, subgroups, and embeddings, demonstrating effectiveness in addressing intersectional biases in multimodal settings.</description>

Abstract: Extracting relevant and structured knowledge from large, complex technical documents within the Reliability and Maintainability (RAM) domain is labor-intensive and prone to errors. Our work addresses this challenge by presenting OntoKGen, a genuine pipeline for ontology extraction and Knowledge Graph (KG) generation. OntoKGen leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) through an interactive user interface guided by our adaptive iterative Chain of Thought (CoT) algorithm to ensure that the ontology extraction process and, thus, KG generation align with user-specific requirements. Although KG generation follows a clear, structured path based on the confirmed ontology, there is no universally correct ontology as it is inherently based on the user's preferences. OntoKGen recommends an ontology grounded in best practices, minimizing user effort and providing valuable insights that may have been overlooked, all while giving the user complete control over the final ontology. Having generated the KG based on the confirmed ontology, OntoKGen enables seamless integration into schemeless, non-relational databases like Neo4j. This integration allows for flexible storage and retrieval of knowledge from diverse, unstructured sources, facilitating advanced querying, analysis, and decision-making. Moreover, the generated KG serves as a robust foundation for future integration into Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, offering enhanced capabilities for developing domain-specific intelligent applications.</description>

      <title>A Comparative Study of LLM-based ASR and Whisper in Low Resource and Code Switching Scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have showcased exceptional performance across diverse NLP tasks, and their integration with speech encoder is rapidly emerging as a dominant trend in the Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) field. Previous works mainly concentrated on leveraging LLMs for speech recognition in English and Chinese. However, their potential for addressing speech recognition challenges in low resource settings remains underexplored. Hence, in this work, we aim to explore the capability of LLMs in low resource ASR and Mandarin-English code switching ASR. We also evaluate and compare the recognition performance of LLM-based ASR systems against Whisper model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LLM-based ASR yields a relative gain of 12.8\% over the Whisper model in low resource ASR while Whisper performs better in Mandarin-English code switching ASR. We hope that this study could shed light on ASR for low resource scenarios.</description>

      <title>AdaScale: Dynamic Context-aware DNN Scaling via Automated Adaptation Loop on Mobile Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning is reshaping mobile applications, with a growing trend of deploying deep neural networks (DNNs) directly to mobile and embedded devices to address real-time performance and privacy. To accommodate local resource limitations, techniques like weight compression, convolution decomposition, and specialized layer architectures have been developed. However, the \textit{dynamic} and \textit{diverse} deployment contexts of mobile devices pose significant challenges. Adapting deep models to meet varied device-specific requirements for latency, accuracy, memory, and energy is labor-intensive. Additionally, changing processor states, fluctuating memory availability, and competing processes frequently necessitate model re-compression to preserve user experience. To address these issues, we introduce AdaScale, an elastic inference framework that automates the adaptation of deep models to dynamic contexts. AdaScale leverages a self-evolutionary model to streamline network creation, employs diverse compression operator combinations to reduce the search space and improve outcomes, and integrates a resource availability awareness block and performance profilers to establish an automated adaptation loop. Our experiments demonstrate that AdaScale significantly enhances accuracy by 5.09%, reduces training overhead by 66.89%, speeds up inference latency by 1.51 to 6.2 times, and lowers energy costs by 4.69 times.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Self-Supervised Heterogeneous Graph Learning from Spectral Clustering Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-supervised heterogeneous graph learning (SHGL) has shown promising potential in diverse scenarios. However, while existing SHGL methods share a similar essential with clustering approaches, they encounter two significant limitations: (i) noise in graph structures is often introduced during the message-passing process to weaken node representations, and (ii) cluster-level information may be inadequately captured and leveraged, diminishing the performance in downstream tasks. In this paper, we address these limitations by theoretically revisiting SHGL from the spectral clustering perspective and introducing a novel framework enhanced by rank and dual consistency constraints. Specifically, our framework incorporates a rank-constrained spectral clustering method that refines the affinity matrix to exclude noise effectively. Additionally, we integrate node-level and cluster-level consistency constraints that concurrently capture invariant and clustering information to facilitate learning in downstream tasks. We theoretically demonstrate that the learned representations are divided into distinct partitions based on the number of classes and exhibit enhanced generalization ability across tasks. Experimental results affirm the superiority of our method, showcasing remarkable improvements in several downstream tasks compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>Exploring Cognition through Morphological Info-Computational Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditionally, cognition has been considered a uniquely human capability involving perception, memory, learning, reasoning, and problem-solving. However, recent research shows that cognition is a fundamental ability shared by all living beings, from single cells to complex organisms. This chapter takes an info-computational approach (ICON), viewing natural structures as information and the processes of change in these structures as computations. It is a relational framework dependent on the perspective of a cognizing observer/cognizer. Informational structures are properties of the material substrate, and when focusing on the behavior of the substrate, we discuss morphological computing (MC). ICON and MC are complementary perspectives for a cognizer. Information and computation are inseparably connected with cognition. This chapter explores research connecting nature as a computational structure for a cognizer, with morphological computation, morphogenesis, agency, extended cognition, and extended evolutionary synthesis, using examples of the free energy principle and active inference. It introduces theoretical and practical approaches challenging traditional computational models of cognition limited to abstract symbol processing, highlighting the computational capacities inherent in the material substrate (embodiment). Understanding the embodiment of cognition through its morphological computational basis is crucial for biology, evolution, intelligence theory, AI, robotics, and other fields.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Cognition: Morphological Info-Computation and the Embodied Paradigm in Life and Artificial Intelligence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study aims to place Lorenzo Magnanis Eco-Cognitive Computationalism within the broader context of current work on information, computation, and cognition. Traditionally, cognition was believed to be exclusive to humans and a result of brain activity. However, recent studies reveal it as a fundamental characteristic of all life forms, ranging from single cells to complex multicellular organisms and their networks. Yet, the literature and general understanding of cognition still largely remain human-brain-focused, leading to conceptual gaps and incoherency. This paper presents a variety of computational (information processing) approaches, including an info-computational approach to cognition, where natural structures represent information and dynamical processes on natural structures are regarded as computation, relative to an observing cognizing agent. We model cognition as a web of concurrent morphological computations, driven by processes of self-assembly, self-organisation, and autopoiesis across physical, chemical, and biological domains. We examine recent findings linking morphological computation, morphogenesis, agency, basal cognition, extended evolutionary synthesis, and active inference. We establish a connection to Magnanis Eco-Cognitive Computationalism and the idea of computational domestication of ignorant entities. Novel theoretical and applied insights question the boundaries of conventional computational models of cognition. The traditional models prioritize symbolic processing and often neglect the inherent constraints and potentialities in the physical embodiment of agents on different levels of organization. Gaining a better info-computational grasp of cognitive embodiment is crucial for the advancement of fields such as biology, evolutionary studies, artificial intelligence, robotics, medicine, and more.</description>

      <title>HT-HEDL: High-Throughput Hypothesis Evaluation in Description Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present High-Throughput Hypothesis Evaluation in Description Logic (HT-HEDL). HT-HEDL is a high-performance hypothesis evaluation engine that accelerates hypothesis evaluation computations for inductive logic programming (ILP) learners using description logic (DL) for their knowledge representation; in particular, HT-HEDL targets accelerating computations for the $\mathcal{ALCQI}^{\mathcal{(D)}}$ DL language. HT-HEDL aggregates the computing power of multi-core CPUs with multi-GPUs to improve hypothesis computations at two levels: 1) the evaluation of a single hypothesis and 2) the evaluation of multiple hypotheses (i.e., batch of hypotheses). In the first level, HT-HEDL uses a single GPU or a vectorized multi-threaded CPU to evaluate a single hypothesis. In vectorized multi-threaded CPU evaluation, classical (scalar) CPU multi-threading is combined with CPU's extended vector instructions set to extract more CPU-based performance. The experimental results revealed that HT-HEDL increased performance using CPU-based evaluation (on a single hypothesis): from 20.4 folds using classical multi-threading to $\sim85$ folds using vectorized multi-threading. In the GPU-based evaluation, HT-HEDL achieved speedups of up to $\sim38$ folds for single hypothesis evaluation using a single GPU. To accelerate the evaluation of multiple hypotheses, HT-HEDL combines, in parallel, GPUs with multi-core CPUs to increase evaluation throughput (number of evaluated hypotheses per second). The experimental results revealed that HT-HEDL increased evaluation throughput by up to 29.3 folds using two GPUs and up to $\sim44$ folds using two GPUs combined with a CPU's vectorized multi-threaded evaluation.</description>

      <title>Long text outline generation: Chinese text outline based on unsupervised framework and large language mode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Outline generation aims to reveal the internal structure of a document by identifying underlying chapter relationships and generating corresponding chapter summaries. Although existing deep learning methods and large models perform well on small- and medium-sized texts, they struggle to produce readable outlines for very long texts (such as fictional works), often failing to segment chapters coherently. In this paper, we propose a novel outline generation method for Chinese, combining an unsupervised framework with large models. Specifically, the method first generates chapter feature graph data based on entity and syntactic dependency relationships. Then, a representation module based on graph attention layers learns deep embeddings of the chapter graph data. Using these chapter embeddings, we design an operator based on Markov chain principles to segment plot boundaries. Finally, we employ a large model to generate summaries of each plot segment and produce the overall outline. We evaluate our model based on segmentation accuracy and outline readability, and our performance outperforms several deep learning models and large models in comparative evaluations.</description>

      <title>Improving Physics Reasoning in Large Language Models Using Mixture of Refinement Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities in various reasoning tasks. However, they encounter significant challenges when it comes to scientific reasoning, particularly in physics, which requires not only mathematical reasoning but also factual and conceptual understanding. When addressing complex physics problems, LLMs typically face three key issues: problem miscomprehension, incorrect concept application, and computational errors. While each of these problems can be addressed individually, there is a need for a generalized approach that can tackle all three issues simultaneously. To address this, we introduce Mixture of Refinement Agents (MoRA), a novel agentic refinement framework that iteratively refines the LLM generated base solution by correcting the aforementioned errors, resulting in a significant performance improvement for open-source LLMs. Our approach aims to bridge the gap between opensource LLMs and GPT-4o by utilizing the latter as error identifier to guide these refinement agents. We evaluate our approach on the SciEval and MMLU subsets along with our own physics dataset (PhysicsQA). MoRA significantly improves the performance of Llama-3-70B and Gemma-2-27B on these datasets, achieving up to a 16% increase in final answer accuracy.</description>

      <title>SPILDL: A Scalable and Parallel Inductive Learner in Description Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present SPILDL, a Scalable and Parallel Inductive Learner in Description Logic (DL). SPILDL is based on the DL-Learner (the state of the art in DL-based ILP learning). As a DL-based ILP learner, SPILDL targets the $\mathcal{ALCQI}^{\mathcal{(D)}}$ DL language, and can learn DL hypotheses expressed as disjunctions of conjunctions (using the $\sqcup$ operator). Moreover, SPILDL's hypothesis language also incorporates the use of string concrete roles (also known as string data properties in the Web Ontology Language, OWL); As a result, this incorporation of powerful DL constructs, enables SPILDL to learn powerful DL-based hypotheses for describing many real-world complex concepts. SPILDL employs a hybrid parallel approach which combines both shared-memory and distributed-memory approaches, to accelerates ILP learning (for both hypothesis search and evaluation). According to experimental results, SPILDL's parallel search improved performance by up to $\sim$27.3 folds (best case). For hypothesis evaluation, SPILDL improved evaluation performance through HT-HEDL (our multi-core CPU + multi-GPU hypothesis evaluation engine), by up to 38 folds (best case). By combining both parallel search and evaluation, SPILDL improved performance by up to $\sim$560 folds (best case). In terms of worst case scenario, SPILDL's parallel search doesn't provide consistent speedups on all datasets, and is highly dependent on the search space nature of the ILP dataset. For some datasets, increasing the number of parallel search threads result in reduced performance, similar or worse than baseline. Some ILP datasets benefit from parallel search, while others don't (or the performance gains are negligible). In terms of parallel evaluation, on small datasets, parallel evaluation provide similar or worse performance than baseline.</description>

      <title>Improving Multimodal LLMs Ability In Geometry Problem Solving, Reasoning, And Multistep Scoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents GPSM4K, a comprehensive geometry multimodal dataset tailored to augment the problem-solving capabilities of Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs). GPSM4K encompasses 2157 multimodal question-answer pairs manually extracted from mathematics textbooks spanning grades 7-12 and is further augmented to 5340 problems, consisting of both numerical and theorem-proving questions. In contrast to PGPS9k, Geometry3K, and Geo170K which feature only objective-type questions, GPSM4K offers detailed step-by-step solutions in a consistent format, facilitating a comprehensive evaluation of problem-solving approaches. This dataset serves as an excellent benchmark for assessing the geometric reasoning capabilities of LVLMs. Evaluation of our test set shows that there is scope for improvement needed in open-source language models in geometry problem-solving. Finetuning on our training set increases the geometry problem-solving capabilities of models. Further, We also evaluate the effectiveness of techniques such as image captioning and Retrieval Augmentation generation (RAG) on model performance. We leveraged LLM to automate the task of final answer evaluation by providing ground truth and predicted solutions. This research will help to assess and improve the geometric reasoning capabilities of LVLMs.</description>

      <title>Learn to Unlearn: Meta-Learning-Based Knowledge Graph Embedding Unlearning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowledge graph (KG) embedding methods map entities and relations into continuous vector spaces, improving performance in tasks like link prediction and question answering. With rising privacy concerns, machine unlearning (MU) has emerged as a critical AI technology, enabling models to eliminate the influence of specific data. Existing MU approaches often rely on data obfuscation and adjustments to training loss but lack generalization across unlearning tasks. This paper introduces MetaEU, a Meta-Learning-Based Knowledge Graph Embedding Unlearning framework. MetaEU leverages meta-learning to unlearn specific embeddings, mitigating their impact while preserving model performance on remaining data. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate its effectiveness in KG embedding unlearning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) has advanced from text-to-image generation to text-to-video and multimodal video synthesis. However, generating playable games presents significant challenges due to the stringent requirements for real-time interaction, high visual quality, and accurate simulation of game mechanics. Existing approaches often fall short, either lacking real-time capabilities or failing to accurately simulate interactive mechanics. To tackle the playability issue, we propose a novel method called \emph{PlayGen}, which encompasses game data generation, an autoregressive DiT-based diffusion model, and a comprehensive playability-based evaluation framework. Validated on well-known 2D and 3D games, PlayGen achieves real-time interaction, ensures sufficient visual quality, and provides accurate interactive mechanics simulation. Notably, these results are sustained even after over 1000 frames of gameplay on an NVIDIA RTX 2060 GPU. Our code is publicly available: https://github.com/GreatX3/Playable-Game-Generation. Our playable demo generated by AI is: http://124.156.151.207.</description>

      <title>BIGCity: A Universal Spatiotemporal Model for Unified Trajectory and Traffic State Data Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Typical dynamic ST data includes trajectory data (representing individual-level mobility) and traffic state data (representing population-level mobility). Traditional studies often treat trajectory and traffic state data as distinct, independent modalities, each tailored to specific tasks within a single modality. However, real-world applications, such as navigation apps, require joint analysis of trajectory and traffic state data. Treating these data types as two separate domains can lead to suboptimal model performance. Although recent advances in ST data pre-training and ST foundation models aim to develop universal models for ST data analysis, most existing models are "multi-task, solo-data modality" (MTSM), meaning they can handle multiple tasks within either trajectory data or traffic state data, but not both simultaneously. To address this gap, this paper introduces BIGCity, the first multi-task, multi-data modality (MTMD) model for ST data analysis. The model targets two key challenges in designing an MTMD ST model: (1) unifying the representations of different ST data modalities, and (2) unifying heterogeneous ST analysis tasks. To overcome the first challenge, BIGCity introduces a novel ST-unit that represents both trajectories and traffic states in a unified format. Additionally, for the second challenge, BIGCity adopts a tunable large model with ST task-oriented prompt, enabling it to perform a range of heterogeneous tasks without the need for fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that BIGCity achieves state-of-the-art performance across 8 tasks, outperforming 18 baselines. To the best of our knowledge, BIGCity is the first model capable of handling both trajectories and traffic states for diverse heterogeneous tasks.

      <title>Large Language Models as Mirrors of Societal Moral Standards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prior research has demonstrated that language models can, to a limited extent, represent moral norms in a variety of cultural contexts. This research aims to replicate these findings and further explore their validity, concentrating on issues like 'homosexuality' and 'divorce'. This study evaluates the effectiveness of these models using information from two surveys, the WVS and the PEW, that encompass moral perspectives from over 40 countries. The results show that biases exist in both monolingual and multilingual models, and they typically fall short of accurately capturing the moral intricacies of diverse cultures. However, the BLOOM model shows the best performance, exhibiting some positive correlations, but still does not achieve a comprehensive moral understanding. This research underscores the limitations of current PLMs in processing cross-cultural differences in values and highlights the importance of developing culturally aware AI systems that better align with universal human values.</description>

      <title>LLMs as mirrors of societal moral standards: reflection of cultural divergence and agreement across ethical topics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become increasingly pivotal in various domains due the recent advancements in their performance capabilities. However, concerns persist regarding biases in LLMs, including gender, racial, and cultural biases derived from their training data. These biases raise critical questions about the ethical deployment and societal impact of LLMs. Acknowledging these concerns, this study investigates whether LLMs accurately reflect cross-cultural variations and similarities in moral perspectives. In assessing whether the chosen LLMs capture patterns of divergence and agreement on moral topics across cultures, three main methods are employed: (1) comparison of model-generated and survey-based moral score variances, (2) cluster alignment analysis to evaluate the correspondence between country clusters derived from model-generated moral scores and those derived from survey data, and (3) probing LLMs with direct comparative prompts. All three methods involve the use of systematic prompts and token pairs designed to assess how well LLMs understand and reflect cultural variations in moral attitudes. The findings of this study indicate overall variable and low performance in reflecting cross-cultural differences and similarities in moral values across the models tested, highlighting the necessity for improving models' accuracy in capturing these nuances effectively. The insights gained from this study aim to inform discussions on the ethical development and deployment of LLMs in global contexts, emphasizing the importance of mitigating biases and promoting fair representation across diverse cultural perspectives.</description>

      <title>Linear Probe Penalties Reduce LLM Sycophancy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are often sycophantic, prioritizing agreement with their users over accurate or objective statements. This problematic behavior becomes more pronounced during reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), an LLM fine-tuning stage intended to align model outputs with human values. Instead of increasing accuracy and reliability, the reward model learned from RLHF often rewards sycophancy. We develop a linear probing method to identify and penalize markers of sycophancy within the reward model, producing rewards that discourage sycophantic behavior. Our experiments show that constructing and optimizing against this surrogate reward function reduces sycophantic behavior in multiple open-source LLMs. Our results suggest a generalizable methodology for reducing unwanted LLM behaviors that are not sufficiently disincentivized by RLHF fine-tuning.</description>

      <title>Reducing Inference Energy Consumption Using Dual Complementary CNNs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Energy efficiency of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) has become an important area of research, with various strategies being developed to minimize the power consumption of these models. Previous efforts, including techniques like model pruning, quantization, and hardware optimization, have made significant strides in this direction. However, there remains a need for more effective on device AI solutions that balance energy efficiency with model performance. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to reduce the energy requirements of inference of CNNs. Our methodology employs two small Complementary CNNs that collaborate with each other by covering each other's "weaknesses" in predictions. If the confidence for a prediction of the first CNN is considered low, the second CNN is invoked with the aim of producing a higher confidence prediction. This dual-CNN setup significantly reduces energy consumption compared to using a single large deep CNN. Additionally, we propose a memory component that retains previous classifications for identical inputs, bypassing the need to re-invoke the CNNs for the same input, further saving energy. Our experiments on a Jetson Nano computer demonstrate an energy reduction of up to 85.8% achieved on modified datasets where each sample was duplicated once. These findings indicate that leveraging a complementary CNN pair along with a memory component effectively reduces inference energy while maintaining high accuracy.</description>

      <title>A Hierarchical Heuristic for Clustered Steiner Trees in the Plane with Obstacles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Euclidean Steiner trees are relevant to model minimal networks in real-world applications ubiquitously. In this paper, we study the feasibility of a hierarchical approach embedded with bundling operations to compute multiple and mutually disjoint Euclidean Steiner trees that avoid clutter and overlapping with obstacles in the plane, which is significant to model the decentralized and the multipoint coordination of agents in constrained 2D domains. Our computational experiments using arbitrary obstacle configuration with convex and non-convex geometries show the feasibility and the attractive performance when computing multiple obstacle-avoiding Steiner trees in the plane. Our results offer the mechanisms to elucidate new operators for obstacle-avoiding Steiner trees.</description>

      <title>VERA: Explainable Video Anomaly Detection via Verbalized Learning of Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of vision-language models (VLMs) has established a new paradigm in video anomaly detection (VAD): leveraging VLMs to simultaneously detect anomalies and provide comprehendible explanations for the decisions. Existing work in this direction often assumes the complex reasoning required for VAD exceeds the capabilities of pretrained VLMs. Consequently, these approaches either incorporate specialized reasoning modules during inference or rely on instruction tuning datasets through additional training to adapt VLMs for VAD. However, such strategies often incur substantial computational costs or data annotation overhead. To address these challenges in explainable VAD, we introduce a verbalized learning framework named VERA that enables VLMs to perform VAD without model parameter modifications. Specifically, VERA automatically decomposes the complex reasoning required for VAD into reflections on simpler, more focused guiding questions capturing distinct abnormal patterns. It treats these reflective questions as learnable parameters and optimizes them through data-driven verbal interactions between learner and optimizer VLMs, using coarsely labeled training data. During inference, VERA embeds the learned questions into model prompts to guide VLMs in generating segment-level anomaly scores, which are then refined into frame-level scores via the fusion of scene and temporal contexts. Experimental results on challenging benchmarks demonstrate that the learned questions of VERA are highly adaptable, significantly improving both detection performance and explainability of VLMs for VAD.</description>

      <title>How the use of feature selection methods influences the efficiency and accuracy of complex network simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex network systems' models are designed to perfectly emulate real-world networks through the use of simulation and link prediction. Complex network systems are defined by nodes and their connections where both have real-world features that result in a heterogeneous network in which each of the nodes has distinct characteristics. Thus, incorporating real-world features is an important component to achieve a simulation which best represents the real-world. Currently very few complex network systems implement real-world features, thus this study proposes feature selection methods which utilise unsupervised filtering techniques to rank real-world node features alongside a wrapper function to test combinations of the ranked features. The chosen method was coined FS-SNS which improved 8 out of 10 simulations of real-world networks. A consistent threshold of included features was also discovered which saw a threshold of 4 features to achieve the most accurate simulation for all networks. Through these findings the study also proposes future work and discusses how the findings can be used to further the Digital Twin and complex network system field.</description>

      <title>TAS-TsC: A Data-Driven Framework for Estimating Time of Arrival Using Temporal-Attribute-Spatial Tri-space Coordination of Truck Trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately estimating time of arrival (ETA) for trucks is crucial for optimizing transportation efficiency in logistics. GPS trajectory data offers valuable information for ETA, but challenges arise due to temporal sparsity, variable sequence lengths, and the interdependencies among multiple trucks. To address these issues, we propose the Temporal-Attribute-Spatial Tri-space Coordination (TAS-TsC) framework, which leverages three feature spaces-temporal, attribute, and spatial-to enhance ETA. Our framework consists of a Temporal Learning Module (TLM) using state space models to capture temporal dependencies, an Attribute Extraction Module (AEM) that transforms sequential features into structured attribute embeddings, and a Spatial Fusion Module (SFM) that models the interactions among multiple trajectories using graph representation learning.These modules collaboratively learn trajectory embeddings, which are then used by a Downstream Prediction Module (DPM) to estimate arrival times. We validate TAS-TsC on real truck trajectory datasets collected from Shenzhen, China, demonstrating its superior performance compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>Superhypergraph Neural Networks and Plithogenic Graph Neural Networks: Theoretical Foundations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hypergraphs extend traditional graphs by allowing edges to connect multiple nodes, while superhypergraphs further generalize this concept to represent even more complex relationships. Neural networks, inspired by biological systems, are widely used for tasks such as pattern recognition, data classification, and prediction. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), a well-established framework, have recently been extended to Hypergraph Neural Networks (HGNNs), with their properties and applications being actively studied. The Plithogenic Graph framework enhances graph representations by integrating multi-valued attributes, as well as membership and contradiction functions, enabling the detailed modeling of complex relationships. In the context of handling uncertainty, concepts such as Fuzzy Graphs and Neutrosophic Graphs have gained prominence. It is well established that Plithogenic Graphs serve as a generalization of both Fuzzy Graphs and Neutrosophic Graphs. Furthermore, the Fuzzy Graph Neural Network has been proposed and is an active area of research. This paper establishes the theoretical foundation for the development of SuperHyperGraph Neural Networks (SHGNNs) and Plithogenic Graph Neural Networks, expanding the applicability of neural networks to these advanced graph structures. While mathematical generalizations and proofs are presented, future computational experiments are anticipated.</description>

      <title>FD-LLM: Large Language Model for Fault Diagnosis of Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are effective at capturing complex, valuable conceptual representations from textual data for a wide range of real-world applications. However, in fields like Intelligent Fault Diagnosis (IFD), incorporating additional sensor data-such as vibration signals, temperature readings, and operational metrics-is essential but it is challenging to capture such sensor data information within traditional text corpora. This study introduces a novel IFD approach by effectively adapting LLMs to numerical data inputs for identifying various machine faults from time-series sensor data. We propose FD-LLM, an LLM framework specifically designed for fault diagnosis by formulating the training of the LLM as a multi-class classification problem. We explore two methods for encoding vibration signals: the first method uses a string-based tokenization technique to encode vibration signals into text representations, while the second extracts statistical features from both the time and frequency domains as statistical summaries of each signal. We assess the fault diagnosis capabilities of four open-sourced LLMs based on the FD-LLM framework, and evaluate the models' adaptability and generalizability under various operational conditions and machine components, namely for traditional fault diagnosis, cross-operational conditions, and cross-machine component settings. Our results show that LLMs such as Llama3 and Llama3-instruct demonstrate strong fault detection capabilities and significant adaptability across different operational conditions, outperforming state-of-the-art deep learning (DL) approaches in many cases.</description>

      <title>Best Practices for Large Language Models in Radiology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At the heart of radiological practice is the challenge of integrating complex imaging data with clinical information to produce actionable insights. Nuanced application of language is key for various activities, including managing requests, describing and interpreting imaging findings in the context of clinical data, and concisely documenting and communicating the outcomes. The emergence of large language models (LLMs) offers an opportunity to improve the management and interpretation of the vast data in radiology. Despite being primarily general-purpose, these advanced computational models demonstrate impressive capabilities in specialized language-related tasks, even without specific training. Unlocking the potential of LLMs for radiology requires basic understanding of their foundations and a strategic approach to navigate their idiosyncrasies. This review, drawing from practical radiology and machine learning expertise and recent literature, provides readers insight into the potential of LLMs in radiology. It examines best practices that have so far stood the test of time in the rapidly evolving landscape of LLMs. This includes practical advice for optimizing LLM characteristics for radiology practices along with limitations, effective prompting, and fine-tuning strategies.</description>

      <title>Collaborative Instance Navigation: Leveraging Agent Self-Dialogue to Minimize User Input</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing embodied instance goal navigation tasks, driven by natural language, assume human users to provide complete and nuanced instance descriptions prior to the navigation, which can be impractical in the real world as human instructions might be brief and ambiguous. To bridge this gap, we propose a new task, Collaborative Instance Navigation (CoIN), with dynamic agent-human interaction during navigation to actively resolve uncertainties about the target instance in natural, template-free, open-ended dialogues. To address CoIN, we propose a novel method, Agent-user Interaction with UncerTainty Awareness (AIUTA), leveraging the perception capability of Vision Language Models (VLMs) and the capability of Large Language Models (LLMs). First, upon object detection, a Self-Questioner model initiates a self-dialogue to obtain a complete and accurate observation description, while a novel uncertainty estimation technique mitigates inaccurate VLM perception. Then, an Interaction Trigger module determines whether to ask a question to the user, continue or halt navigation, minimizing user input. For evaluation, we introduce CoIN-Bench, a benchmark supporting both real and simulated humans. AIUTA achieves competitive performance in instance navigation against state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating great flexibility in handling user inputs.</description>

      <title>CPRM: A LLM-based Continual Pre-training Framework for Relevance Modeling in Commercial Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relevance modeling between queries and items stands as a pivotal component in commercial search engines, directly affecting the user experience. Given the remarkable achievements of large language models (LLMs) in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, LLM-based relevance modeling is gradually being adopted within industrial search systems. Nevertheless, foundational LLMs lack domain-specific knowledge and do not fully exploit the potential of in-context learning. Furthermore, structured item text remains underutilized, and there is a shortage in the supply of corresponding queries and background knowledge. We thereby propose CPRM (Continual Pre-training for Relevance Modeling), a framework designed for the continual pre-training of LLMs to address these issues. Our CPRM framework includes three modules: 1) employing both queries and multi-field item to jointly pre-train for enhancing domain knowledge, 2) applying in-context pre-training, a novel approach where LLMs are pre-trained on a sequence of related queries or items, and 3) conducting reading comprehension on items to produce associated domain knowledge and background information (e.g., generating summaries and corresponding queries) to further strengthen LLMs. Results on offline experiments and online A/B testing demonstrate that our model achieves convincing performance compared to strong baselines.</description>

      <title>FedPAW: Federated Learning with Personalized Aggregation Weights for Urban Vehicle Speed Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vehicle speed prediction is crucial for intelligent transportation systems, promoting more reliable autonomous driving by accurately predicting future vehicle conditions. Due to variations in drivers' driving styles and vehicle types, speed predictions for different target vehicles may significantly differ. Existing methods may not realize personalized vehicle speed prediction while protecting drivers' data privacy. We propose a Federated learning framework with Personalized Aggregation Weights (FedPAW) to overcome these challenges. This method captures client-specific information by measuring the weighted mean squared error between the parameters of local models and global models. The server sends tailored aggregated models to clients instead of a single global model, without incurring additional computational and communication overhead for clients. To evaluate the effectiveness of FedPAW, we collected driving data in urban scenarios using the autonomous driving simulator CARLA, employing an LSTM-based Seq2Seq model with a multi-head attention mechanism to predict the future speed of target vehicles.

      <title>Multimodal Medical Disease Classification with LLaMA II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medical patient data is always multimodal. Images, text, age, gender, histopathological data are only few examples for different modalities in this context. Processing and integrating this multimodal data with deep learning based methods is of utmost interest due to its huge potential for medical procedure such as diagnosis and patient treatment planning. In this work we retrain a multimodal transformer-based model for disease classification. To this end we use the text-image pair dataset from OpenI consisting of 2D chest X-rays associated with clinical reports. Our focus is on fusion methods for merging text and vision information extracted from medical datasets. Different architecture structures with a LLaMA II backbone model are tested. Early fusion of modality specific features creates better results with the best model reaching 97.10% mean AUC than late fusion from a deeper level of the architecture (best model: 96.67% mean AUC). Both outperform former classification models tested on the same multimodal dataset. The newly introduced multimodal architecture can be applied to other multimodal datasets with little effort and can be easily adapted for further research, especially, but not limited to, the field of medical AI.</description>

      <title>Research on Cervical Cancer p16/Ki-67 Immunohistochemical Dual-Staining Image Recognition Algorithm Based on YOLO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The p16/Ki-67 dual staining method is a new approach for cervical cancer screening with high sensitivity and specificity. However, there are issues of mis-detection and inaccurate recognition when the YOLOv5s algorithm is directly applied to dual-stained cell images. This paper Proposes a novel cervical cancer dual-stained image recognition (DSIR-YOLO) model based on an YOLOv5. By fusing the Swin-Transformer module, GAM attention mechanism, multi-scale feature fusion, and EIoU loss function, the detection performance is significantly improved, with mAP@0.5 and mAP@0.5:0.95 reaching 92.6% and 70.5%, respectively. Compared with YOLOv5s in five-fold cross-validation, the accuracy, recall, mAP@0.5, and mAP@0.5:0.95 of the improved algorithm are increased by 2.3%, 4.1%, 4.3%, and 8.0%, respectively, with smaller variances and higher stability. Compared with other detection algorithms, DSIR-YOLO in this paper sacrifices some performance requirements to improve the network recognition effect. In addition, the influence of dataset quality on the detection results is studied. By controlling the sealing property of pixels, scale difference, unlabelled cells, and diagonal annotation, the model detection accuracy, recall, mAP@0.5, and mAP@0.5:0.95 are improved by 13.3%, 15.3%, 18.3%, and 30.5%, respectively.</description>

      <title>Convolutional Transformer Neural Collaborative Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we introduce Convolutional Transformer Neural Collaborative Filtering (CTNCF), a novel approach aimed at enhancing recommendation systems by effectively capturing high-order structural information in user?item interactions. CTNCF represents a significant advancement over the traditional Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF) model by seamlessly integrating Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformer layers. This sophisticated integration enables the model to adeptly capture and understand complex interaction patterns inherent in recommendation systems. Specifically, CNNs are employed to extract local features from user and item embeddings, allowing the model to capture intricate spatial dependencies within the data. Furthermore, the utilization of Transformer layers enables the model to capture long-range dependencies and interactions among user and item features, thereby enhancing its ability to understand the underlying relationships in the data. To validate the effectiveness of our proposed CTNCF framework, we conduct extensive experiments on two real-world datasets. The results demonstrate that CTNCF significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, highlighting its efficacy in improving recommendation system performance.</description>

      <title>A Survey on Deep Neural Networks in Collaborative Filtering Recommendation Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This survey provides an examination of the use of Deep Neural Networks (DNN) in Collaborative Filtering (CF) recommendation systems. As the digital world increasingly relies on data-driven approaches, traditional CF techniques face limitations in scalability and flexibility. DNNs can address these challenges by effectively modeling complex, non-linear relationships within the data. We begin by exploring the fundamental principles of both collaborative filtering and deep neural networks, laying the groundwork for understanding their integration. Subsequently, we review key advancements in the field, categorizing various deep learning models that enhance CF systems, including Multilayer Perceptrons (MLP), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Graph Neural Networks (GNN), autoencoders, Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), and Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM). The paper also discusses evaluation protocols, various publicly available auxiliary information, and data features. Furthermore, the survey concludes with a discussion of the challenges and future research opportunities in enhancing collaborative filtering systems with deep learning.</description>

      <title>LMAct: A Benchmark for In-Context Imitation Learning with Long Multimodal Demonstrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Today's largest foundation models have increasingly general capabilities, yet when used as agents, they often struggle with simple reasoning and decision-making tasks, even though they possess good factual knowledge of the task and how to solve it. In this paper, we present a benchmark to pressure-test these models' multimodal decision-making capabilities in the very long-context regime (up to one million tokens) and investigate whether they can learn from a large number of expert demonstrations in their context. We evaluate a wide range of state-of-the-art frontier models as policies across a battery of simple interactive decision-making tasks: playing tic-tac-toe, chess, and Atari, navigating grid worlds, solving crosswords, and controlling a simulated cheetah. We measure the performance of Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Gemini 1.5 Flash, Gemini 1.5 Pro, GPT-4o, o1-mini, and o1-preview under increasing amounts of expert demonstrations in the context $\unicode{x2013}$ from no demonstrations up to 512 full episodes, pushing these models' multimodal long-context reasoning capabilities to their limits. Across our tasks, today's frontier models rarely manage to fully reach expert performance, showcasing the difficulty of our benchmark. Presenting more demonstrations often has little effect, but some models steadily improve with more demonstrations on a few tasks. We investigate the effect of encoding observations as text or images and the impact of chain-of-thought prompting. Overall, our results suggest that even today's most capable models often struggle to imitate desired behavior by generalizing purely from in-context demonstrations. To help quantify the impact of other approaches and future innovations aiming to tackle this problem, we open source our benchmark that covers the zero-, few-, and many-shot regimes in a unified evaluation.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence significantly enhances the visual art industry by analyzing, identifying and generating digitized artistic images. This review highlights the substantial benefits of integrating geometric data into AI models, addressing challenges such as high inter-class variations, domain gaps, and the separation of style from content by incorporating geometric information. Models not only improve AI-generated graphics synthesis quality, but also effectively distinguish between style and content, utilizing inherent model biases and shared data traits. We explore methods like geometric data extraction from artistic images, the impact on human perception, and its use in discriminative tasks. The review also discusses the potential for improving data quality through innovative annotation techniques and the use of geometric data to enhance model adaptability and output refinement. Overall, incorporating geometric guidance boosts model performance in classification and synthesis tasks, providing crucial insights for future AI applications in the visual arts domain.</description>

      <title>FastRM: An efficient and automatic explainability framework for multimodal generative models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have become masterly capable in reasoning over human prompts and visual inputs, they are still prone to producing responses that contain misinformation. Identifying incorrect responses that are not grounded in evidence has become a crucial task in building trustworthy AI. Explainability methods such as gradient-based relevancy maps on LVLM outputs can provide an insight on the decision process of models, however these methods are often computationally expensive and not suited for on-the-fly validation of outputs. In this work, we propose FastRM, an effective way for predicting the explainable Relevancy Maps of LVLM models. Experimental results show that employing FastRM leads to a 99.8% reduction in compute time for relevancy map generation and an 44.4% reduction in memory footprint for the evaluated LVLM, making explainable AI more efficient and practical, thereby facilitating its deployment in real-world applications.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Apache Spark is better suited for load data mining and machine learning that require a lot of iteration by using memory-distributed data sets. Due to the complexity of Spark, the high learning threshold of Scala, and the low reusability of its code, this paper designs and implements a Spark-based visual process AI+machine learning method under a big data environment. On the one hand, it designs component models to describe the basic steps of machine learning, including data preprocessing, feature processing, and model training. Practice and validate evaluation. On the other hand, a visual process modeling tool is provided to support analysts to design machine learning processes, which can be translated automatically into Spark platform code for efficient execution. This tool can greatly improve the AI machine learning efficiency of the Spark platform. This paper introduces the method theory, key technologies, and effectiveness of the tool.
  This paper explores the application of Spark in the field of large model agents. Langchain, as an open-source framework, is committed to simplifying the development of end-to-end applications based on language models. It provides interfaces for interacting with a variety of large language models, optimizing prompt engineering, and endowing large models with the ability to invoke external tools. LangGraph demonstrates its powerful state management and graph construction capabilities by defining node functions and graphs to build complex agent applications. The development of Spark agent applications based on LangGraph has further promoted the development of AI applications in the big data analysis environment .</description>

      <title>ArtBrain: An Explainable end-to-end Toolkit for Classification and Attribution of AI-Generated Art and Style</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the quality of artworks generated using Artificial Intelligence (AI) has increased significantly, resulting in growing difficulties in detecting synthetic artworks. However, limited studies have been conducted on identifying the authenticity of synthetic artworks and their source. This paper introduces AI-ArtBench, a dataset featuring 185,015 artistic images across 10 art styles. It includes 125,015 AI-generated images and 60,000 pieces of human-created artwork. This paper also outlines a method to accurately detect AI-generated images and trace them to their source model. This work proposes a novel Convolutional Neural Network model based on the ConvNeXt model called AttentionConvNeXt. AttentionConvNeXt was implemented and trained to differentiate between the source of the artwork and its style with an F1-Score of 0.869. The accuracy of attribution to the generative model reaches 0.999. To combine the scientific contributions arising from this study, a web-based application named ArtBrain was developed to enable both technical and non-technical users to interact with the model. Finally, this study presents the results of an Artistic Turing Test conducted with 50 participants. The findings reveal that humans could identify AI-generated images with an accuracy of approximately 58%, while the model itself achieved a significantly higher accuracy of around 99%.</description>

      <title>CopyrightShield: Spatial Similarity Guided Backdoor Defense against Copyright Infringement in Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The diffusion model has gained significant attention due to its remarkable data generation ability in fields such as image synthesis. However, its strong memorization and replication abilities with respect to the training data also make it a prime target for copyright infringement attacks. This paper provides an in-depth analysis of the spatial similarity of replication in diffusion model and leverages this key characteristic to design a method for detecting poisoning data. By employing a joint assessment of spatial-level and feature-level information from the detected segments, we effectively identify covertly dispersed poisoned samples. Building upon detected poisoning data, we propose a novel defense method specifically targeting copyright infringement attacks by introducing a protection constraint term into the loss function to mitigate the impact of poisoning. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves an average F1 score of 0.709 in detecting copyright infringement backdoors, resulting in an average increase of 68.1% in First-Attack Epoch (FAE) and an average decrease of 51.4% in Copyright Infringement Rate (CIR) of the poisoned model, effectively defending against copyright infringement. Additionally, we introduce the concept of copyright feature inversion, which aids in determining copyright responsibility and expands the application scenarios of defense strategies.</description>

      <title>MBA-RAG: a Bandit Approach for Adaptive Retrieval-Augmented Generation through Question Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has proven to be highly effective in boosting the generative performance of language model in knowledge-intensive tasks. However, existing RAG framework either indiscriminately perform retrieval or rely on rigid single-class classifiers to select retrieval methods, leading to inefficiencies and suboptimal performance across queries of varying complexity. To address these challenges, we propose a reinforcement learning-based framework that dynamically selects the most suitable retrieval strategy based on query complexity. % our solution Our approach leverages a multi-armed bandit algorithm, which treats each retrieval method as a distinct ``arm'' and adapts the selection process by balancing exploration and exploitation. Additionally, we introduce a dynamic reward function that balances accuracy and efficiency, penalizing methods that require more retrieval steps, even if they lead to a correct result. Our method achieves new state of the art results on multiple single-hop and multi-hop datasets while reducing retrieval costs.

      <title>Handwriting-based Automated Assessment and Grading of Degree of Handedness: A Pilot Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hand preference and degree of handedness (DoH) are two different aspects of human behavior which are often confused to be one. DoH is a person's inherent capability of the brain; affected by nature and nurture. In this study, we used dominant and non-dominant handwriting traits to assess DoH for the first time, on 43 subjects of three categories- Unidextrous, Partially Unidextrous, and Ambidextrous. Features extracted from the segmented handwriting signals called strokes were used for DoH quantification. Davies Bouldin Index, Multilayer perceptron, and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) were used for automated grading of DoH. The outcomes of these methods were compared with the widely used DoH assessment questionnaires from Edinburgh Inventory (EI). The CNN based automated grading outperformed other computational methods with an average classification accuracy of 95.06% under stratified 10-fold cross-validation. The leave-one-subject-out strategy on this CNN resulted in a test individual's DoH score which was converted into a 4-point score. Around 90% of the obtained scores from all the implemented computational methods were found to be in accordance with the EI scores under 95% confidence interval. Automated grading of degree of handedness using handwriting signals can provide more resolution to the Edinburgh Inventory scores. This could be used in multiple applications concerned with neuroscience, rehabilitation, physiology, psychometry, behavioral sciences, and forensics.</description>

Abstract: Our aim for the ML Contest for Chip Design with HLS 2024 was to predict the validity, running latency in the form of cycle counts, utilization rate of BRAM (util-BRAM), utilization rate of lookup tables (uti-LUT), utilization rate of flip flops (util-FF), and the utilization rate of digital signal processors (util-DSP). We used Chain-of-thought techniques with large language models to perform classification and regression tasks. Our prediction is that with larger models reasoning was much improved. We release our prompts and propose a HLS benchmarking task for LLMs.</description>

      <title>Command-line Risk Classification using Transformer-based Neural Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To protect large-scale computing environments necessary to meet increasing computing demand, cloud providers have implemented security measures to monitor Operations and Maintenance (O&amp;M) activities and therefore prevent data loss and service interruption. Command interception systems are used to intercept, assess, and block dangerous Command-line Interface (CLI) commands before they can cause damage. Traditional solutions for command risk assessment include rule-based systems, which require expert knowledge and constant human revision to account for unseen commands. To overcome these limitations, several end-to-end learning systems have been proposed to classify CLI commands. These systems, however, have several other limitations, including the adoption of general-purpose text classifiers, which may not adapt to the language characteristics of scripting languages such as Bash or PowerShell, and may not recognize dangerous commands in the presence of an unbalanced class distribution. In this paper, we propose a transformer-based command risk classification system, which leverages the generalization power of Large Language Models (LLM) to provide accurate classification and the ability to identify rare dangerous commands effectively, by exploiting the power of transfer learning. We verify the effectiveness of our approach on a realistic dataset of production commands and show how to apply our model for other security-related tasks, such as dangerous command interception and auditing of existing rule-based systems.</description>

      <title>Digital Epidemiology: Leveraging Social Media for Insight into Epilepsy and Mental Health</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social media platforms, particularly Reddit's r/Epilepsy community, offer a unique perspective into the experiences of individuals with epilepsy (PWE) and their caregivers. This study analyzes 57k posts and 533k comments to explore key themes across demographics such as age, gender, and relationships. Our findings highlight significant discussions on epilepsy-related challenges, including depression (with 39.75\% of posts indicating severe symptoms), driving restrictions, workplace concerns, and pregnancy-related issues in women with epilepsy. We introduce a novel engagement metric, F(P), which incorporates post length, sentiment scores, and readability to quantify community interaction. This analysis underscores the importance of integrated care addressing both neurological and mental health challenges faced by PWE. The insights from this study inform strategies for targeted support and awareness interventions.</description>

      <title>Automated Toll Management System Using RFID and Image Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traveling through toll plazas is one of the primary causes of congestion, as identified in recent studies. Electronic Toll Collection (ETC) systems can mitigate this problem. This experiment focuses on enhancing the security of ETC using RFID tags and number plate verification. For number plate verification, image processing is employed, and a CNN classifier is implemented to detect vehicle registration numbers. Based on the registered number, a notification email is sent to the respective owner for toll fee payment within a specific timeframe to avoid fines. Additionally, toll fees are automatically deducted in real-time from the owner's balance. This system benefits travelers by eliminating the need to queue for toll payment, thereby reducing delays and improving convenience.</description>

      <title>A Neurosymbolic Fast and Slow Architecture for Graph Coloring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs) present significant challenges to artificial intelligence due to their intricate constraints and the necessity for precise solutions. Existing symbolic solvers are often slow, and prior research has shown that Large Language Models (LLMs) alone struggle with CSPs because of their complexity. To bridge this gap, we build upon the existing SOFAI architecture (or SOFAI-v1), which adapts Daniel Kahneman's ''Thinking, Fast and Slow'' cognitive model to AI. Our enhanced architecture, SOFAI-v2, integrates refined metacognitive governance mechanisms to improve adaptability across complex domains, specifically tailored for solving CSPs like graph coloring. SOFAI-v2 combines a fast System 1 (S1) based on LLMs with a deliberative System 2 (S2) governed by a metacognition module. S1's initial solutions, often limited by non-adherence to constraints, are enhanced through metacognitive governance, which provides targeted feedback and examples to adapt S1 to CSP requirements. If S1 fails to solve the problem, metacognition strategically invokes S2, ensuring accurate and reliable solutions. With empirical results, we show that SOFAI-v2 for graph coloring problems achieves a 16.98% increased success rate and is 32.42% faster than symbolic solvers.</description>

      <title>Efficient Compression of Sparse Accelerator Data Using Implicit Neural Representations and Importance Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-energy, large-scale particle colliders in nuclear and high-energy physics generate data at extraordinary rates, reaching up to $1$ terabyte and several petabytes per second, respectively. The development of real-time, high-throughput data compression algorithms capable of reducing this data to manageable sizes for permanent storage is of paramount importance. A unique characteristic of the tracking detector data is the extreme sparsity of particle trajectories in space, with an occupancy rate ranging from approximately $10^{-6}$ to $10\%$. Furthermore, for downstream tasks, a continuous representation of this data is often more useful than a voxel-based, discrete representation due to the inherently continuous nature of the signals involved. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach using implicit neural representations for data learning and compression. We also introduce an importance sampling technique to accelerate the network training process. Our method is competitive with traditional compression algorithms, such as MGARD, SZ, and ZFP, while offering significant speed-ups and maintaining negligible accuracy loss through our importance sampling strategy.</description>

      <title>Noise Injection Reveals Hidden Capabilities of Sandbagging Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Capability evaluations play a critical role in ensuring the safe deployment of frontier AI systems, but this role may be undermined by intentional underperformance or ``sandbagging.'' We present a novel model-agnostic method for detecting sandbagging behavior using noise injection. Our approach is founded on the observation that introducing Gaussian noise into the weights of models either prompted or fine-tuned to sandbag can considerably improve their performance. We test this technique across a range of model sizes and multiple-choice question benchmarks (MMLU, AI2, WMDP). Our results demonstrate that noise injected sandbagging models show performance improvements compared to standard models. Leveraging this effect, we develop a classifier that consistently identifies sandbagging behavior. Our unsupervised technique can be immediately implemented by frontier labs or regulatory bodies with access to weights to improve the trustworthiness of capability evaluations.</description>

      <title>GETAE: Graph information Enhanced deep neural NeTwork ensemble ArchitecturE for fake news detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In today's digital age, fake news has become a major problem that has serious consequences, ranging from social unrest to political upheaval. To address this issue, new methods for detecting and mitigating fake news are required. In this work, we propose to incorporate contextual and network-aware features into the detection process. This involves analyzing not only the content of a news article but also the context in which it was shared and the network of users who shared it, i.e., the information diffusion. Thus, we propose GETAE, \underline{G}raph Information \underline{E}nhanced Deep Neural Ne\underline{t}work Ensemble \underline{A}rchitectur\underline{E} for Fake News Detection, a novel ensemble architecture that uses textual content together with the social interactions to improve fake news detection. GETAE contains two Branches: the Text Branch and the Propagation Branch. The Text Branch uses Word and Transformer Embeddings and a Deep Neural Network based on feed-forward and bidirectional Recurrent Neural Networks (\textsc{[Bi]RNN}) for learning novel contextual features and creating a novel Text Content Embedding. The Propagation Branch considers the information propagation within the graph network and proposes a Deep Learning architecture that employs Node Embeddings to create novel Propagation Embedding. GETAE Ensemble combines the two novel embeddings, i.e., Text Content Embedding and Propagation Embedding, to create a novel \textit{Propagation-Enhanced Content Embedding} which is afterward used for classification. The experimental results obtained on two real-world publicly available datasets, i.e., Twitter15 and Twitter16, prove that using this approach improves fake news detection and outperforms state-of-the-art models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Economists model knowledge use and acquisition as a cause-and-effect calculus associating observations made by a decision-maker about their world with possible underlying causes. Knowledge models are well-established for static contexts, but not for contexts of innovative and unbounded change. We develop a representation of knowledge use and acquisition in open-ended evolutionary systems and demonstrate its primary results, including that observers embedded in open-ended evolutionary systems can agree to disagree and that their ability to theorize about their systems is fundamentally local and constrained to their frame of reference what we call frame relativity. The results of our framework formalize local knowledge use, the many-selves interpretation of reasoning through time, and motivate the emergence of nonlogical modes of reasoning like institutional and aesthetic codes.</description>

      <title>Spatial-variant causal Bayesian inference for rapid seismic ground failures and impacts estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rapid and accurate estimation of post-earthquake ground failures and building damage is critical for effective post-disaster responses. Progression in remote sensing technologies has paved the way for rapid acquisition of detailed, localized data, enabling swift hazard estimation through analysis of correlation deviations between pre- and post-quake satellite imagery. However, discerning seismic hazards and their impacts is challenged by overlapping satellite signals from ground failures, building damage, and environmental noise. Previous advancements introduced a novel causal graph-based Bayesian network that continually refines seismic ground failure and building damage estimates derived from satellite imagery, accounting for the intricate interplay among geospatial elements, seismic activity, ground failures, building structures, damages, and satellite data. However, this model's neglect of spatial heterogeneity across different locations in a seismic region limits its precision in capturing the spatial diversity of seismic effects. In this study, we pioneer an approach that accounts for spatial intricacies by introducing a spatial variable influenced by the bilateral filter to capture relationships from surrounding hazards. The bilateral filter considers both spatial proximity of neighboring hazards and their ground shaking intensity values, ensuring refined modeling of spatial relationships. This integration achieves a balance between site-specific characteristics and spatial tendencies, offering a comprehensive representation of the post-disaster landscape. Our model, tested across multiple earthquake events, demonstrates significant improvements in capturing spatial heterogeneity in seismic hazard estimation. The results highlight enhanced accuracy and efficiency in post-earthquake large-scale multi-impact estimation, effectively informing rapid disaster responses.</description>

      <title>Beyond Monte Carlo: Harnessing Diffusion Models to Simulate Financial Market Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a highly efficient and accurate methodology for generating synthetic financial market data using a diffusion model approach. The synthetic data produced by our methodology align closely with observed market data in several key aspects: (i) they pass the two-sample Cramer - von Mises test for portfolios of assets, and (ii) Q - Q plots demonstrate consistency across quantiles, including in the tails, between observed and generated market data. Moreover, the covariance matrices derived from a large set of synthetic market data exhibit significantly lower condition numbers compared to the estimated covariance matrices of the observed data. This property makes them suitable for use as regularized versions of the latter. For model training, we develop an efficient and fast algorithm based on numerical integration rather than Monte Carlo simulations. The methodology is tested on a large set of equity data.</description>

      <title>Creating Hierarchical Dispositions of Needs in an Agent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel method for learning hierarchical abstractions that prioritize competing objectives, leading to improved global expected rewards. Our approach employs a secondary rewarding agent with multiple scalar outputs, each associated with a distinct level of abstraction. The traditional agent then learns to maximize these outputs in a hierarchical manner, conditioning each level on the maximization of the preceding level. We derive an equation that orders these scalar values and the global reward by priority, inducing a hierarchy of needs that informs goal formation. Experimental results on the Pendulum v1 environment demonstrate superior performance compared to a baseline implementation.We achieved state of the art results.</description>

Abstract: Audio-visual correlation learning aims to capture and understand natural phenomena between audio and visual data. The rapid growth of Deep Learning propelled the development of proposals that process audio-visual data and can be observed in the number of proposals in the past years. Thus encouraging the development of a comprehensive survey. Besides analyzing the models used in this context, we also discuss some tasks of definition and paradigm applied in AI multimedia. In addition, we investigate objective functions frequently used and discuss how audio-visual data is exploited in the optimization process, i.e., the different methodologies for representing knowledge in the audio-visual domain. In fact, we focus on how human-understandable mechanisms, i.e., structured knowledge that reflects comprehensible knowledge, can guide the learning process. Most importantly, we provide a summarization of the recent progress of Audio-Visual Correlation Learning (AVCL) and discuss the future research directions.</description>

      <title>TransFair: Transferring Fairness from Ocular Disease Classification to Progression Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in automated disease classification significantly reduces healthcare costs and improves the accessibility of services. However, this transformation has given rise to concerns about the fairness of AI, which disproportionately affects certain groups, particularly patients from underprivileged populations. Recently, a number of methods and large-scale datasets have been proposed to address group performance disparities. Although these methods have shown effectiveness in disease classification tasks, they may fall short in ensuring fair prediction of disease progression, mainly because of limited longitudinal data with diverse demographics available for training a robust and equitable prediction model. In this paper, we introduce TransFair to enhance demographic fairness in progression prediction for ocular diseases. TransFair aims to transfer a fairness-enhanced disease classification model to the task of progression prediction with fairness preserved. Specifically, we train a fair EfficientNet, termed FairEN, equipped with a fairness-aware attention mechanism using extensive data for ocular disease classification. Subsequently, this fair classification model is adapted to a fair progression prediction model through knowledge distillation, which aims to minimize the latent feature distances between the classification and progression prediction models. We evaluate FairEN and TransFair for fairness-enhanced ocular disease classification and progression prediction using both two-dimensional (2D) and 3D retinal images. Extensive experiments and comparisons with models with and without considering fairness learning show that TransFair effectively enhances demographic equity in predicting ocular disease progression.</description>

      <title>LeMoLE: LLM-Enhanced Mixture of Linear Experts for Time Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent research has shown that large language models (LLMs) can be effectively used for real-world time series forecasting due to their strong natural language understanding capabilities. However, aligning time series into semantic spaces of LLMs comes with high computational costs and inference complexity, particularly for long-range time series generation. Building on recent advancements in using linear models for time series, this paper introduces an LLM-enhanced mixture of linear experts for precise and efficient time series forecasting. This approach involves developing a mixture of linear experts with multiple lookback lengths and a new multimodal fusion mechanism. The use of a mixture of linear experts is efficient due to its simplicity, while the multimodal fusion mechanism adaptively combines multiple linear experts based on the learned features of the text modality from pre-trained large language models. In experiments, we rethink the need to align time series to LLMs by existing time-series large language models and further discuss their efficiency and effectiveness in time series forecasting. Our experimental results show that the proposed LeMoLE model presents lower prediction errors and higher computational efficiency than existing LLM models.</description>

      <title>Improving Medical Diagnostics with Vision-Language Models: Convex Hull-Based Uncertainty Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, vision-language models (VLMs) have been applied to various fields, including healthcare, education, finance, and manufacturing, with remarkable performance. However, concerns remain regarding VLMs' consistency and uncertainty, particularly in critical applications such as healthcare, which demand a high level of trust and reliability. This paper proposes a novel approach to evaluate uncertainty in VLMs' responses using a convex hull approach on a healthcare application for Visual Question Answering (VQA). LLM-CXR model is selected as the medical VLM utilized to generate responses for a given prompt at different temperature settings, i.e., 0.001, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, and 1.00. According to the results, the LLM-CXR VLM shows a high uncertainty at higher temperature settings. Experimental outcomes emphasize the importance of uncertainty in VLMs' responses, especially in healthcare applications.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Coordinate-Wise Step Sizes for Quasi-Newton Methods: A Learning-to-Optimize Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tuning effective step sizes is crucial for the stability and efficiency of optimization algorithms. While adaptive coordinate-wise step sizes tuning methods have been explored in first-order methods, second-order methods still lack efficient techniques. Current approaches, including hypergradient descent and cutting plane methods, offer limited improvements or encounter difficulties in second-order contexts. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel Learning-to-Optimize (L2O) model within the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) framework, which leverages neural networks to predict optimal coordinate-wise step sizes. Our model integrates a theoretical foundation that establishes conditions for the stability and convergence of these step sizes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves substantial improvements over traditional backtracking line search and hypergradient descent-based methods, offering up to 7$\times$ faster and stable performance across diverse optimization tasks.</description>

      <title>MOSABench: Multi-Object Sentiment Analysis Benchmark for Evaluating Multimodal Large Language Models Understanding of Complex Image</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable progress in high-level semantic tasks such as visual question answering, image captioning, and emotion recognition. However, despite advancements, there remains a lack of standardized benchmarks for evaluating MLLMs performance in multi-object sentiment analysis, a key task in semantic understanding. To address this gap, we introduce MOSABench, a novel evaluation dataset designed specifically for multi-object sentiment analysis. MOSABench includes approximately 1,000 images with multiple objects, requiring MLLMs to independently assess the sentiment of each object, thereby reflecting real-world complexities. Key innovations in MOSABench include distance-based target annotation, post-processing for evaluation to standardize outputs, and an improved scoring mechanism. Our experiments reveal notable limitations in current MLLMs: while some models, like mPLUG-owl and Qwen-VL2, demonstrate effective attention to sentiment-relevant features, others exhibit scattered focus and performance declines, especially as the spatial distance between objects increases. This research underscores the need for MLLMs to enhance accuracy in complex, multi-object sentiment analysis tasks and establishes MOSABench as a foundational tool for advancing sentiment analysis capabilities in MLLMs.</description>

      <title>Speculative Decoding with CTC-based Draft Model for LLM Inference Acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inference acceleration of large language models (LLMs) has been put forward in many application scenarios and speculative decoding has shown its advantage in addressing inference acceleration. Speculative decoding usually introduces a draft model to assist the base LLM where the draft model produces drafts and the base LLM verifies the draft for acceptance or rejection. In this framework, the final inference speed is decided by the decoding speed of the draft model and the acceptance rate of the draft provided by the draft model. Currently the widely used draft models usually generate draft tokens for the next several positions in a non-autoregressive way without considering the correlations between draft tokens. Therefore, it has a high decoding speed but an unsatisfactory acceptance rate. In this paper, we focus on how to improve the performance of the draft model and aim to accelerate inference via a high acceptance rate. To this end, we propose a CTC-based draft model which strengthens the correlations between draft tokens during the draft phase, thereby generating higher-quality draft candidate sequences. Experiment results show that compared to strong baselines, the proposed method can achieve a higher acceptance rate and hence a faster inference speed.</description>

      <title>DiffGuard: Text-Based Safety Checker for Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in Diffusion Models have enabled the generation of images from text, with powerful closed-source models like DALL-E and Midjourney leading the way. However, open-source alternatives, such as StabilityAI's Stable Diffusion, offer comparable capabilities. These open-source models, hosted on Hugging Face, come equipped with ethical filter protections designed to prevent the generation of explicit images. This paper reveals first their limitations and then presents a novel text-based safety filter that outperforms existing solutions. Our research is driven by the critical need to address the misuse of AI-generated content, especially in the context of information warfare. DiffGuard enhances filtering efficacy, achieving a performance that surpasses the best existing filters by over 14%.</description>

      <title>Recurrent Stochastic Configuration Networks with Hybrid Regularization for Nonlinear Dynamics Modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recurrent stochastic configuration networks (RSCNs) have shown great potential in modelling nonlinear dynamic systems with uncertainties. This paper presents an RSCN with hybrid regularization to enhance both the learning capacity and generalization performance of the network. Given a set of temporal data, the well-known least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) is employed to identify the significant order variables. Subsequently, an improved RSCN with L2 regularization is introduced to approximate the residuals between the output of the target plant and the LASSO model. The output weights are updated in real-time through a projection algorithm, facilitating a rapid response to dynamic changes within the system. A theoretical analysis of the universal approximation property is provided, contributing to the understanding of the network's effectiveness in representing various complex nonlinear functions. Experimental results from a nonlinear system identification problem and two industrial predictive tasks demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other models across all testing datasets.</description>

      <title>COAP: Memory-Efficient Training with Correlation-Aware Gradient Projection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Training large-scale neural networks in vision, and multimodal domains demands substantial memory resources, primarily due to the storage of optimizer states. While LoRA, a popular parameter-efficient method, reduces memory usage, it often suffers from suboptimal performance due to the constraints of low-rank updates. Low-rank gradient projection methods (e.g., GaLore, Flora) reduce optimizer memory by projecting gradients and moment estimates into low-rank spaces via singular value decomposition or random projection. However, they fail to account for inter-projection correlation, causing performance degradation, and their projection strategies often incur high computational costs. In this paper, we present COAP (Correlation-Aware Gradient Projection), a memory-efficient method that minimizes computational overhead while maintaining training performance. Evaluated across various vision, language, and multimodal tasks, COAP outperforms existing methods in both training speed and model performance. For LLaMA-1B, it reduces optimizer memory by 61% with only 2% additional time cost, achieving the same PPL as AdamW. With 8-bit quantization, COAP cuts optimizer memory by 81% and achieves 4x speedup over GaLore for LLaVA-v1.5-7B fine-tuning, while delivering higher accuracy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rise of advanced AI models like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and diffusion models such as Stable Diffusion has made the creation of highly realistic images accessible, posing risks of misuse in misinformation and manipulation. This study evaluates the effectiveness of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), as well as DenseNet architectures, for detecting AI-generated images. Using variations of the CIFAKE dataset, including images generated by different versions of Stable Diffusion, we analyze the impact of updates and modifications such as Gaussian blurring, prompt text changes, and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on detection accuracy. The findings highlight vulnerabilities in current detection methods and propose strategies to enhance the robustness and reliability of AI-image detection systems.</description>

      <title>Selfish Evolution: Making Discoveries in Extreme Label Noise with the Help of Overfitting Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the scarcity of proper labels in an astrophysical application, we have developed a novel technique, called Selfish Evolution, which allows for the detection and correction of corrupted labels in a weakly supervised fashion. Unlike methods based on early stopping, we let the model train on the noisy dataset. Only then do we intervene and allow the model to overfit to individual samples. The ``evolution'' of the model during this process reveals patterns with enough information about the noisiness of the label, as well as its correct version. We train a secondary network on these spatiotemporal ``evolution cubes'' to correct potentially corrupted labels. We incorporate the technique in a closed-loop fashion, allowing for automatic convergence towards a mostly clean dataset, without presumptions about the state of the network in which we intervene. We evaluate on the main task of the Supernova-hunting dataset but also demonstrate efficiency on the more standard MNIST dataset.</description>

      <title>Dual Prototyping with Domain and Class Prototypes for Affective Brain-Computer Interface in Unseen Target Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: EEG signals have emerged as a powerful tool in affective brain-computer interfaces, playing a crucial role in emotion recognition. However, current deep transfer learning-based methods for EEG recognition face challenges due to the reliance of both source and target data in model learning, which significantly affect model performance and generalization. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel framework (PL-DCP) and introduce the concepts of feature disentanglement and prototype inference. The dual prototyping mechanism incorporates both domain and class prototypes: domain prototypes capture individual variations across subjects, while class prototypes represent the ideal class distributions within their respective domains. Importantly, the proposed PL-DCP framework operates exclusively with source data during training, meaning that target data remains completely unseen throughout the entire process. To address label noise, we employ a pairwise learning strategy that encodes proximity relationships between sample pairs, effectively reducing the influence of mislabeled data. Experimental validation on the SEED and SEED-IV datasets demonstrates that PL-DCP, despite not utilizing target data during training, achieves performance comparable to deep transfer learning methods that require both source and target data. This highlights the potential of PL-DCP as an effective and robust approach for EEG-based emotion recognition.</description>

      <title>Visual Error Patterns in Multi-Modal AI: A Statistical Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) has achieved transformative success across a wide range of domains, revolutionizing fields such as healthcare, education, and human-computer interaction. However, the mechanisms driving AI's performance often remain opaque, particularly in the context of large language models (LLMs), which have advanced at an unprecedented pace in recent years. Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) like GPT-4o exemplify this evolution, integrating text, audio, and visual inputs to enable interaction across diverse domains. Despite their remarkable capabilities, these models remain largely "black boxes," offering limited insight into how they process multi-modal information internally. This lack of transparency poses significant challenges, including systematic biases, flawed associations, and unintended behaviors, which require careful investigation. Understanding the decision-making processes of MLLMs is both beneficial and essential for mitigating these challenges and ensuring their reliable deployment in critical applications. GPT-4o was chosen as the focus of this study for its advanced multi-modal capabilities, which allow simultaneous processing of textual and visual information. These capabilities make it an ideal model for investigating the parallels and distinctions between machine-driven and human-driven visual perception. While GPT-4o performs effectively in tasks involving structured and complete data, its reliance on bottom-up processing, which involves a feature-by-feature analysis of sensory inputs, presents challenges when interpreting complex or ambiguous stimuli. This limitation contrasts with human vision, which is remarkably adept at resolving ambiguity and reconstructing incomplete information through high-level cognitive processes.</description>

      <title>Graph Canvas for Controllable 3D Scene Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatial intelligence is foundational to AI systems that interact with the physical world, particularly in 3D scene generation and spatial comprehension. Current methodologies for 3D scene generation often rely heavily on predefined datasets, and struggle to adapt dynamically to changing spatial relationships. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{GraphCanvas3D}, a programmable, extensible, and adaptable framework for controllable 3D scene generation. Leveraging in-context learning, GraphCanvas3D enables dynamic adaptability without the need for retraining, supporting flexible and customizable scene creation. Our framework employs hierarchical, graph-driven scene descriptions, representing spatial elements as graph nodes and establishing coherent relationships among objects in 3D environments. Unlike conventional approaches, which are constrained in adaptability and often require predefined input masks or retraining for modifications, GraphCanvas3D allows for seamless object manipulation and scene adjustments on the fly. Additionally, GraphCanvas3D supports 4D scene generation, incorporating temporal dynamics to model changes over time. Experimental results and user studies demonstrate that GraphCanvas3D enhances usability, flexibility, and adaptability for scene generation. Our code and models are available on the project website: https://github.com/ILGLJ/Graph-Canvas.</description>

      <title>Mixture of Cache-Conditional Experts for Efficient Mobile Device Inference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mixture of Experts (MoE) LLMs have recently gained attention for their ability to enhance performance by selectively engaging specialized subnetworks or "experts" for each input. However, deploying MoEs on memory-constrained devices remains challenging, particularly when generating tokens sequentially with a batch size of one, as opposed to typical high-throughput settings involving long sequences or large batches. In this work, we optimize MoE on memory-constrained devices where only a subset of expert weights fit in DRAM. We introduce a novel cache-aware routing strategy that leverages expert reuse during token generation to improve cache locality. We evaluate our approach on language modeling, MMLU, and GSM8K benchmarks and present on-device results demonstrating 2$\times$ speedups on mobile devices, offering a flexible, training-free solution to extend MoE's applicability across real-world applications.</description>

      <title>MLLM-Search: A Zero-Shot Approach to Finding People using Multimodal Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robotic search of people in human-centered environments, including healthcare settings, is challenging as autonomous robots need to locate people without complete or any prior knowledge of their schedules, plans or locations. Furthermore, robots need to be able to adapt to real-time events that can influence a person's plan in an environment. In this paper, we present MLLM-Search, a novel zero-shot person search architecture that leverages multimodal large language models (MLLM) to address the mobile robot problem of searching for a person under event-driven scenarios with varying user schedules. Our approach introduces a novel visual prompting method to provide robots with spatial understanding of the environment by generating a spatially grounded waypoint map, representing navigable waypoints by a topological graph and regions by semantic labels. This is incorporated into a MLLM with a region planner that selects the next search region based on the semantic relevance to the search scenario, and a waypoint planner which generates a search path by considering the semantically relevant objects and the local spatial context through our unique spatial chain-of-thought prompting approach. Extensive 3D photorealistic experiments were conducted to validate the performance of MLLM-Search in searching for a person with a changing schedule in different environments. An ablation study was also conducted to validate the main design choices of MLLM-Search. Furthermore, a comparison study with state-of-the art search methods demonstrated that MLLM-Search outperforms existing methods with respect to search efficiency. Real-world experiments with a mobile robot in a multi-room floor of a building showed that MLLM-Search was able to generalize to finding a person in a new unseen environment.</description>

      <title>Differential learning kinetics govern the transition from memorization to generalization during in-context learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transformers exhibit in-context learning (ICL): the ability to use novel information presented in the context without additional weight updates. Recent work shows that ICL emerges when models are trained on a sufficiently diverse set of tasks and the transition from memorization to generalization is sharp with increasing task diversity. One interpretation is that a network's limited capacity to memorize favors generalization. Here, we examine the mechanistic underpinnings of this transition using a small transformer applied to a synthetic ICL task. Using theory and experiment, we show that the sub-circuits that memorize and generalize can be viewed as largely independent. The relative rates at which these sub-circuits learn explains the transition from memorization to generalization, rather than capacity constraints. We uncover a memorization scaling law, which determines the task diversity threshold at which the network generalizes. The theory quantitatively explains a variety of other ICL-related phenomena, including the long-tailed distribution of when ICL is acquired, the bimodal behavior of solutions close to the task diversity threshold, the influence of contextual and data distributional statistics on ICL, and the transient nature of ICL.</description>

      <title>Virtual Sensing to Enable Real-Time Monitoring of Inaccessible Locations \&amp; Unmeasurable Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real-time monitoring of critical parameters is essential for energy systems' safe and efficient operation. However, traditional sensors often fail and degrade in harsh environments where physical sensors cannot be placed (inaccessible locations). In addition, there are important parameters that cannot be directly measured by sensors. We need machine learning (ML)-based real-time monitoring in those remote locations to ensure system operations. However, traditional ML models struggle to process continuous sensor profile data to fit model requirements, leading to the loss of spatial relationships. Another challenge for real-time monitoring is ``dataset shift" and the need for frequent retraining under varying conditions, where extensive retraining prohibits real-time inference. To resolve these challenges, this study addressed the limitations of real-time monitoring methods by enabling monitoring in locations where physical sensors are impractical to deploy. Our proposed approach, utilizing Multi-Input Operator Network virtual sensors, leverages deep learning to seamlessly integrate diverse data sources and accurately predict key parameters in real-time without the need for additional physical sensors. The approach's effectiveness is demonstrated through thermal-hydraulic monitoring in a nuclear reactor subchannel, achieving remarkable accuracy.</description>

      <title>Demographic Predictability in 3D CT Foundation Embeddings</title>

Abstract: Self-supervised foundation models have recently been successfully extended to encode three-dimensional (3D) computed tomography (CT) images, with excellent performance across several downstream tasks, such as intracranial hemorrhage detection and lung cancer risk forecasting. However, as self-supervised models learn from complex data distributions, questions arise concerning whether these embeddings capture demographic information, such as age, sex, or race. Using the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) dataset, which contains 3D CT images and demographic data, we evaluated a range of classifiers: softmax regression, linear regression, linear support vector machine, random forest, and decision tree, to predict sex, race, and age of the patients in the images. Our results indicate that the embeddings effectively encoded age and sex information, with a linear regression model achieving a root mean square error (RMSE) of 3.8 years for age prediction and a softmax regression model attaining an AUC of 0.998 for sex classification. Race prediction was less effective, with an AUC of 0.878. These findings suggest a detailed exploration into the information encoded in self-supervised learning frameworks is needed to help ensure fair, responsible, and patient privacy-protected healthcare AI.</description>

Abstract: Traditional electrostatic simulation are meshed-based methods which convert partial differential equations into an algebraic system of equations and their solutions are approximated through numerical methods. These methods are time consuming and any changes in their initial or boundary conditions will require solving the numerical problem again. Newer computational methods such as the physics informed neural net (PINN) similarly require re-training when boundary conditions changes. In this work, we propose an end-to-end deep learning approach to model parameter changes to the boundary conditions. The proposed method is demonstrated on the test problem of a long air-filled capacitor structure. The proposed approach is compared to plain vanilla deep learning (NN) and PINN. It is shown that our method can significantly outperform both NN and PINN under dynamic boundary condition as well as retaining its full capability as a forward model.</description>

      <title>SceneTAP: Scene-Coherent Typographic Adversarial Planner against Vision-Language Models in Real-World Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in interpreting visual content. While existing works demonstrate these models' vulnerability to deliberately placed adversarial texts, such texts are often easily identifiable as anomalous. In this paper, we present the first approach to generate scene-coherent typographic adversarial attacks that mislead advanced LVLMs while maintaining visual naturalness through the capability of the LLM-based agent. Our approach addresses three critical questions: what adversarial text to generate, where to place it within the scene, and how to integrate it seamlessly. We propose a training-free, multi-modal LLM-driven scene-coherent typographic adversarial planning (SceneTAP) that employs a three-stage process: scene understanding, adversarial planning, and seamless integration. The SceneTAP utilizes chain-of-thought reasoning to comprehend the scene, formulate effective adversarial text, strategically plan its placement, and provide detailed instructions for natural integration within the image. This is followed by a scene-coherent TextDiffuser that executes the attack using a local diffusion mechanism. We extend our method to real-world scenarios by printing and placing generated patches in physical environments, demonstrating its practical implications. Extensive experiments show that our scene-coherent adversarial text successfully misleads state-of-the-art LVLMs, including ChatGPT-4o, even after capturing new images of physical setups. Our evaluations demonstrate a significant increase in attack success rates while maintaining visual naturalness and contextual appropriateness. This work highlights vulnerabilities in current vision-language models to sophisticated, scene-coherent adversarial attacks and provides insights into potential defense mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Relation-Aware Meta-Learning for Zero-shot Sketch-Based Image Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sketch-based image retrieval (SBIR) relies on free-hand sketches to retrieve natural photos within the same class. However, its practical application is limited by its inability to retrieve classes absent from the training set. To address this limitation, the task has evolved into Zero-Shot Sketch-Based Image Retrieval (ZS-SBIR), where model performance is evaluated on unseen categories. Traditional SBIR primarily focuses on narrowing the domain gap between photo and sketch modalities. However, in the zero-shot setting, the model not only needs to address this cross-modal discrepancy but also requires a strong generalization capability to transfer knowledge to unseen categories. To this end, we propose a novel framework for ZS-SBIR that employs a pair-based relation-aware quadruplet loss to bridge feature gaps. By incorporating two negative samples from different modalities, the approach prevents positive features from becoming disproportionately distant from one modality while remaining close to another, thus enhancing inter-class separability. We also propose a Relation-Aware Meta-Learning Network (RAMLN) to obtain the margin, a hyper-parameter of cross-modal quadruplet loss, to improve the generalization ability of the model. RAMLN leverages external memory to store feature information, which it utilizes to assign optimal margin values. Experimental results obtained on the extended Sketchy and TU-Berlin datasets show a sharp improvement over existing state-of-the-art methods in ZS-SBIR.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Discriminative Attribute-Object Embedding Network for Compositional Zero-Shot Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) recognizes new combinations by learning from known attribute-object pairs. However, the main challenge of this task lies in the complex interactions between attributes and object visual representations, which lead to significant differences in images. In addition, the long-tail label distribution in the real world makes the recognition task more complicated. To address these problems, we propose a novel method, named Hybrid Discriminative Attribute-Object Embedding (HDA-OE) network. To increase the variability of training data, HDA-OE introduces an attribute-driven data synthesis (ADDS) module. ADDS generates new samples with diverse attribute labels by combining multiple attributes of the same object. By expanding the attribute space in the dataset, the model is encouraged to learn and distinguish subtle differences between attributes. To further improve the discriminative ability of the model, HDA-OE introduces the subclass-driven discriminative embedding (SDDE) module, which enhances the subclass discriminative ability of the encoding by embedding subclass information in a fine-grained manner, helping to capture the complex dependencies between attributes and object visual features. The proposed model has been evaluated on three benchmark datasets, and the results verify its effectiveness and reliability.</description>

      <title>Orthus: Autoregressive Interleaved Image-Text Generation with Modality-Specific Heads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Orthus, an autoregressive (AR) transformer that excels in generating images given textual prompts, answering questions based on visual inputs, and even crafting lengthy image-text interleaved contents. Unlike prior arts on unified multimodal modeling, Orthus simultaneously copes with discrete text tokens and continuous image features under the AR modeling principle. The continuous treatment of visual signals minimizes the information loss for both image understanding and generation while the fully AR formulation renders the characterization of the correlation between modalities straightforward. The key mechanism enabling Orthus to leverage these advantages lies in its modality-specific heads -- one regular language modeling (LM) head predicts discrete text tokens and one diffusion head generates continuous image features conditioning on the output of the backbone. We devise an efficient strategy for building Orthus -- by substituting the Vector Quantization (VQ) operation in the existing unified AR model with a soft alternative, introducing a diffusion head, and tuning the added modules to reconstruct images, we can create an Orthus-base model effortlessly (e.g., within mere 72 A100 GPU hours). Orthus-base can further embrace post-training to better model interleaved images and texts. Empirically, Orthus surpasses competing baselines including Show-o and Chameleon across standard benchmarks, achieving a GenEval score of 0.58 and an MME-P score of 1265.8 using 7B parameters. Orthus also shows exceptional mixed-modality generation capabilities, reflecting the potential for handling intricate practical generation tasks.</description>

      <title>Road User Classification from High-Frequency GNSS Data Using Distributed Edge Intelligence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real-world traffic involves diverse road users, ranging from pedestrians to heavy trucks, necessitating effective road user classification for various applications within Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS). Traditional approaches often rely on intrusive and/or expensive external hardware sensors. These systems typically have limited spatial coverage. In response to these limitations, this work aims to investigate an unintrusive and cost-effective alternative for road user classification by using high-frequency (1-2 Hz) positional sequences. A cutting-edge solution could involve leveraging positioning data from 5G networks. However, this feature is currently only proposed in the 3GPP standard and has not yet been implemented for outdoor applications by 5G equipment vendors. Therefore, our approach relies on positional data, that is recorded under real-world conditions using Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) and processed on distributed edge devices. As a start-ing point, four types of road users are distinguished: pedestri-ans, cyclists, motorcycles, and passenger cars. While earlier approaches used classical statistical methods, we propose Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networks (RNNs) as the preferred classification method, as they repre-sent state-of-the-art in processing sequential data. An RNN architecture for road user classification, based on selected motion characteristics derived from raw positional sequences is presented and the influence of sequence length on classifica-tion quality is examined. The results of the work show that RNNs are capable of efficiently classifying road users on dis-tributed devices, and can particularly differentiate between types of motorized vehicles, based on two- to four-minute se-quences.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Visual text images are prevalent in various applications, requiring careful font selection and typographic choices. Recent advances in Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based text-to-image (T2I) models show promise in automating these processes. However, these methods still face challenges such as inconsistent fonts, style variation, and limited fine-grained control, particularly at the word level. This paper proposes a two-stage DiT-based pipeline to address these issues by enhancing controllability over typography and style in text rendering. We introduce Typography Control (TC) finetuning, an efficient parameter fine-tuning method, and enclosing typography control tokens (ETC-tokens), which enable precise word-level application of typographic features. To further enhance style control, we present a Style Control Adapter (SCA) that injects style information through image inputs independent of text prompts. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in achieving superior word-level typographic control, font consistency, and style consistency in Basic and Artistic Text Rendering (BTR and ATR) tasks. Our results mark a significant advancement in the precision and adaptability of T2I models, presenting new possibilities for creative applications and design-oriented tasks.</description>

      <title>Unleashing the Power of Data Synthesis in Visual Localization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Visual localization, which estimates a camera's pose within a known scene, is a long-standing challenge in vision and robotics. Recent end-to-end methods that directly regress camera poses from query images have gained attention for fast inference. However, existing methods often struggle to generalize to unseen views. In this work, we aim to unleash the power of data synthesis to promote the generalizability of pose regression. Specifically, we lift real 2D images into 3D Gaussian Splats with varying appearance and deblurring abilities, which are then used as a data engine to synthesize more posed images. To fully leverage the synthetic data, we build a two-branch joint training pipeline, with an adversarial discriminator to bridge the syn-to-real gap. Experiments on established benchmarks show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art end-to-end approaches, reducing translation and rotation errors by 50% and 21.6% on indoor datasets, and 35.56% and 38.7% on outdoor datasets. We also validate the effectiveness of our method in dynamic driving scenarios under varying weather conditions. Notably, as data synthesis scales up, our method exhibits a growing ability to interpolate and extrapolate training data for localizing unseen views.

      <title>Sparse Attention Vectors: Generative Multimodal Model Features Are Discriminative Vision-Language Classifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) like LLaVA and Qwen-VL excel at a wide variety of vision-language (VL) tasks such as image captioning or visual question answering. Despite strong performance, LMMs are not directly suited for foundational discriminative vision-language tasks (i.e., tasks requiring discrete label predictions) such as image classification and multiple-choice VQA. One key challenge in utilizing LMMs for discriminative tasks is the extraction of useful features from generative models. To overcome this issue, we propose an approach for finding features in the model's latent space to more effectively leverage LMMs for discriminative tasks. Toward this end, we present Sparse Attention Vectors (SAVs) -- a finetuning-free method that leverages sparse attention head activations (fewer than 1\% of the heads) in LMMs as strong features for VL tasks. With only few-shot examples, SAVs demonstrate state-of-the-art performance compared to a variety of few-shot and finetuned baselines on a collection of discriminative tasks. Our experiments also imply that SAVs can scale in performance with additional examples and generalize to similar tasks, establishing SAVs as both effective and robust multimodal feature representations.</description>

Abstract: Knowledge-augmented learning enables the combination of knowledge-based and data-driven approaches. For anomaly detection and diagnosis, understandability is typically an important factor, especially in high-risk areas. Therefore, explainability and interpretability are also major criteria in such contexts. This chapter focuses on knowledge-augmented explainable and interpretable learning to enhance understandability, transparency and ultimately computational sensemaking. We exemplify different approaches and methods in the domains of anomaly detection and diagnosis - from comparatively simple interpretable methods towards more advanced neuro-symbolic approaches.</description>

      <title>DLaVA: Document Language and Vision Assistant for Answer Localization with Enhanced Interpretability and Trustworthiness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Document Visual Question Answering (VQA) requires models to interpret textual information within complex visual layouts and comprehend spatial relationships to answer questions based on document images. Existing approaches often lack interpretability and fail to precisely localize answers within the document, hindering users' ability to verify responses and understand the reasoning process. Moreover, standard metrics like Average Normalized Levenshtein Similarity (ANLS) focus on text accuracy but overlook spatial correctness. We introduce DLaVA, a novel method that enhances Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with answer localization capabilities for Document VQA. Our approach integrates image annotation directly into the MLLM pipeline, improving interpretability by enabling users to trace the model's reasoning. We present both OCR-dependent and OCR-free architectures, with the OCR-free approach eliminating the need for separate text recognition components, thus reducing complexity. To the best of our knowledge, DLaVA is the first approach to introduce answer localization within multimodal QA, marking a significant step forward in enhancing user trust and reducing the risk of AI hallucinations. Our contributions include enhancing interpretability and reliability by grounding responses in spatially annotated visual content, introducing answer localization in MLLMs, proposing a streamlined pipeline that combines an MLLM with a text detection module, and conducting comprehensive evaluations using both textual and spatial accuracy metrics, including Intersection over Union (IoU). Experimental results on standard datasets demonstrate that DLaVA achieves SOTA performance, significantly enhancing model transparency and reliability. Our approach sets a new benchmark for Document VQA, highlighting the critical importance of precise answer localization and model interpretability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The autonomous learning of new goals in robotics remains a complex issue to address. Here, we propose a model where curiosity influence learning flexibility. To do so, this paper proposes to root curiosity and attention together by taking inspiration from the Locus Coeruleus-Norepinephrine system along with various cognitive processes such as cognitive persistence and visual habituation. We apply our approach by experimenting with a simulated robotic arm on a set of objects with varying difficulty. The robot first discovers new goals via bottom-up attention through motor babbling with an inhibition of return mechanism, then engage to the learning of goals due to neural activity arising within the curiosity mechanism. The architecture is modelled with dynamic neural fields and the learning of goals such as pushing the objects in diverse directions is supported by the use of forward and inverse models implemented by multi-layer perceptrons. The adoption of dynamic neural fields to model curiosity, habituation and persistence allows the robot to demonstrate various learning trajectories depending on the object. In addition, the approach exhibits interesting properties regarding the learning of similar goals as well as the continuous switch between exploration and exploitation.</description>

      <title>o1-Coder: an o1 Replication for Coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The technical report introduces O1-CODER, an attempt to replicate OpenAI's o1 model with a focus on coding tasks. It integrates reinforcement learning (RL) and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to enhance the model's System-2 thinking capabilities. The framework includes training a Test Case Generator (TCG) for standardized code testing, using MCTS to generate code data with reasoning processes, and iteratively fine-tuning the policy model to initially produce pseudocode, followed by the generation of the full code. The report also addresses the opportunities and challenges in deploying o1-like models in real-world applications, suggesting transitioning to the System-2 paradigm and highlighting the imperative for environment state updates. Updated model progress and experimental results will be reported in subsequent versions. All source code, curated datasets, as well as the derived models will be disclosed at https://github.com/ADaM-BJTU/O1-CODER .</description>

      <title>VISION-XL: High Definition Video Inverse Problem Solver using Latent Image Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel framework for solving high-definition video inverse problems using latent image diffusion models. Building on recent advancements in spatio-temporal optimization for video inverse problems using image diffusion models, our approach leverages latent-space diffusion models to achieve enhanced video quality and resolution. To address the high computational demands of processing high-resolution frames, we introduce a pseudo-batch consistent sampling strategy, allowing efficient operation on a single GPU. Additionally, to improve temporal consistency, we present batch-consistent inversion, an initialization technique that incorporates informative latents from the measurement frame. By integrating with SDXL, our framework achieves state-of-the-art video reconstruction across a wide range of spatio-temporal inverse problems, including complex combinations of frame averaging and various spatial degradations, such as deblurring, super-resolution, and inpainting. Unlike previous methods, our approach supports multiple aspect ratios (landscape, vertical, and square) and delivers HD-resolution reconstructions (exceeding 1280x720) in under 2.5 minutes on a single NVIDIA 4090 GPU.

      <title>To Ensemble or Not: Assessing Majority Voting Strategies for Phishing Detection with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) significantly relies on the quality of the prompts they receive. However, even when processing identical prompts, LLMs can yield varying outcomes due to differences in their training processes. To leverage the collective intelligence of multiple LLMs and enhance their performance, this study investigates three majority voting strategies for text classification, focusing on phishing URL detection. The strategies are: (1) a prompt-based ensemble, which utilizes majority voting across the responses generated by a single LLM to various prompts; (2) a model-based ensemble, which entails aggregating responses from multiple LLMs to a single prompt; and (3) a hybrid ensemble, which combines the two methods by sending different prompts to multiple LLMs and then aggregating their responses. Our analysis shows that ensemble strategies are most suited in cases where individual components exhibit equivalent performance levels. However, when there is a significant discrepancy in individual performance, the effectiveness of the ensemble method may not exceed that of the highest-performing single LLM or prompt. In such instances, opting for ensemble techniques is not recommended.</description>

      <title>Origin-Destination Demand Prediction: An Urban Radiation and Attraction Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, origin-destination (OD) demand prediction has gained significant attention for its profound implications in urban development. Existing data-driven deep learning methods primarily focus on the spatial or temporal dependency between regions yet neglecting regions' fundamental functional difference. Though knowledge-driven physical methods have characterised regions' functions by their radiation and attraction capacities, these functions are defined on numerical factors like population without considering regions' intrinsic nominal attributes, e.g., a region is a residential or industrial district. Moreover, the complicated relationships between two types of capacities, e.g., the radiation capacity of a residential district in the morning will be transformed into the attraction capacity in the evening, are totally missing from physical methods.
  In this paper, we not only generalize the physical radiation and attraction capacities into the deep learning framework with the extended capability to fulfil regions' functions, but also present a new model that captures the relationships between two types of capacities. Specifically, we first model regions' radiation and attraction capacities using a bilateral branch network, each equipped with regions' attribute representations. We then describe the transformation relationship of different capacities of the same region using a hypergraph-based parameter generation method. We finally unveil the competition relationship of different regions with the same attraction capacity through cluster-based adversarial learning. Extensive experiments on two datasets demonstrate the consistent improvements of our method over the state-of-the-art baselines, as well as the good explainability of regions' functions using their nominal attributes.</description>

      <title>SOLAMI: Social Vision-Language-Action Modeling for Immersive Interaction with 3D Autonomous Characters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human beings are social animals. How to equip 3D autonomous characters with similar social intelligence that can perceive, understand and interact with humans remains an open yet foundamental problem. In this paper, we introduce SOLAMI, the first end-to-end Social vision-Language-Action (VLA) Modeling framework for Immersive interaction with 3D autonomous characters. Specifically, SOLAMI builds 3D autonomous characters from three aspects: (1) Social VLA Architecture: We propose a unified social VLA framework to generate multimodal response (speech and motion) based on the user's multimodal input to drive the character for social interaction. (2) Interactive Multimodal Data: We present SynMSI, a synthetic multimodal social interaction dataset generated by an automatic pipeline using only existing motion datasets to address the issue of data scarcity. (3) Immersive VR Interface: We develop a VR interface that enables users to immersively interact with these characters driven by various architectures. Extensive quantitative experiments and user studies demonstrate that our framework leads to more precise and natural character responses (in both speech and motion) that align with user expectations with lower latency.</description>

      <title>Twisted Convolutional Networks (TCNs): Enhancing Feature Interactions for Non-Spatial Data Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Twisted Convolutional Networks (TCNs) are introduced as a novel neural network architecture designed to effectively process one-dimensional data with arbitrary feature order and minimal spatial relationships. Unlike traditional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which excel at handling structured two-dimensional data like images, TCNs reduce dependency on feature order by combining input features in innovative ways to create new representations. By explicitly enhancing feature interactions and employing diverse feature combinations, TCNs generate richer and more informative representations, making them especially effective for classification tasks on datasets with arbitrary feature arrangements. This paper details the TCN architecture and its feature combination strategy, providing a comprehensive comparison with traditional CNNs, DeepSets, Transformers, and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that TCNs achieve superior performance, particularly in classification scenarios involving one-dimensional data.</description>

      <title>Generating a Low-code Complete Workflow via Task Decomposition and RAG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AI technologies are moving rapidly from research to production. With the popularity of Foundation Models (FMs) that generate text, images, and video, AI-based systems are increasing their complexity. Compared to traditional AI-based software, systems employing FMs, or GenAI-based systems, are more difficult to design due to their scale and versatility. This makes it necessary to document best practices, known as design patterns in software engineering, that can be used across GenAI applications. Our first contribution is to formalize two techniques, Task Decomposition and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), as design patterns for GenAI-based systems. We discuss their trade-offs in terms of software quality attributes and comment on alternative approaches. We recommend to AI practitioners to consider these techniques not only from a scientific perspective but also from the standpoint of desired engineering properties such as flexibility, maintainability, safety, and security. As a second contribution, we describe our industry experience applying Task Decomposition and RAG to build a complex real-world GenAI application for enterprise users: Workflow Generation. The task of generating workflows entails generating a specific plan using data from the system environment, taking as input a user requirement. As these two patterns affect the entire AI development cycle, we explain how they impacted the dataset creation, model training, model evaluation, and deployment phases.</description>

      <title>Realistic Corner Case Generation for Autonomous Vehicles with Multimodal Large Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To guarantee the safety and reliability of autonomous vehicle (AV) systems, corner cases play a crucial role in exploring the system's behavior under rare and challenging conditions within simulation environments. However, current approaches often fall short in meeting diverse testing needs and struggle to generalize to novel, high-risk scenarios that closely mirror real-world conditions. To tackle this challenge, we present AutoScenario, a multimodal Large Language Model (LLM)-based framework for realistic corner case generation. It converts safety-critical real-world data from multiple sources into textual representations, enabling the generalization of key risk factors while leveraging the extensive world knowledge and advanced reasoning capabilities of LLMs.Furthermore, it integrates tools from the Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO) and CARLA simulators to simplify and execute the code generated by LLMs. Our experiments demonstrate that AutoScenario can generate realistic and challenging test scenarios, precisely tailored to specific testing requirements or textual descriptions. Additionally, we validated its ability to produce diverse and novel scenarios derived from multimodal real-world data involving risky situations, harnessing the powerful generalization capabilities of LLMs to effectively simulate a wide range of corner cases.</description>

      <title>Attribute-Enhanced Similarity Ranking for Sparse Link Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Link prediction is a fundamental problem in graph data. In its most realistic setting, the problem consists of predicting missing or future links between random pairs of nodes from the set of disconnected pairs. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become the predominant framework for link prediction. GNN-based methods treat link prediction as a binary classification problem and handle the extreme class imbalance -- real graphs are very sparse -- by sampling (uniformly at random) a balanced number of disconnected pairs not only for training but also for evaluation. However, we show that the reported performance of GNNs for link prediction in the balanced setting does not translate to the more realistic imbalanced setting and that simpler topology-based approaches are often better at handling sparsity. These findings motivate Gelato, a similarity-based link-prediction method that applies (1) graph learning based on node attributes to enhance a topological heuristic, (2) a ranking loss for addressing class imbalance, and (3) a negative sampling scheme that efficiently selects hard training pairs via graph partitioning. Experiments show that Gelato outperforms existing GNN-based alternatives.</description>

      <title>Average-Over-Time Spiking Neural Networks for Uncertainty Estimation in Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Uncertainty estimation is a standard tool to quantify the reliability of modern deep learning models, and crucial for many real-world applications. However, efficient uncertainty estimation methods for spiking neural networks, particularly for regression models, have been lacking. Here, we introduce two methods that adapt the Average-Over-Time Spiking Neural Network (AOT-SNN) framework to regression tasks, enhancing uncertainty estimation in event-driven models. The first method uses the heteroscedastic Gaussian approach, where SNNs predict both the mean and variance at each time step, thereby generating a conditional probability distribution of the target variable. The second method leverages the Regression-as-Classification (RAC) approach, reformulating regression as a classification problem to facilitate uncertainty estimation. We evaluate our approaches on both a toy dataset and several benchmark datasets, demonstrating that the proposed AOT-SNN models achieve performance comparable to or better than state-of-the-art deep neural network methods, particularly in uncertainty estimation. Our findings highlight the potential of SNNs for uncertainty estimation in regression tasks, providing an efficient and biologically inspired alternative for applications requiring both accuracy and energy efficiency.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In both 2016 and 2018, a census of the highly-endangered Grevy's zebra population was enabled by the Great Grevy's Rally (GGR), a citizen science event that produces population estimates via expert and algorithmic curation of volunteer-captured images. A complementary, scalable, and long-term Grevy's population monitoring approach involves deploying camera trap networks. However, in both scenarios, a substantial majority of zebra images are not usable for individual identification due to poor in-the-wild imaging conditions; camera trap images in particular present high rates of occlusion and high spatio-temporal similarity within image bursts. Our proposed filtering pipeline incorporates animal detection, species identification, viewpoint estimation, quality evaluation, and temporal subsampling to obtain individual crops suitable for re-ID, which are subsequently curated by the LCA decision management algorithm. Our method processed images taken during GGR-16 and GGR-18 in Meru County, Kenya, into 4,142 highly-comparable annotations, requiring only 120 contrastive human decisions to produce a population estimate within 4.6% of the ground-truth count. Our method also efficiently processed 8.9M unlabeled camera trap images from 70 cameras at the Mpala Research Centre in Laikipia County, Kenya over two years into 685 encounters of 173 individuals, requiring only 331 contrastive human decisions.</description>

      <title>Adaptformer: Sequence models as adaptive iterative planners</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite recent advances in learning-based behavioral planning for autonomous systems, decision-making in multi-task missions remains a challenging problem. For instance, a mission might require a robot to explore an unknown environment, locate the goals, and navigate to them, even if there are obstacles along the way. Such problems are difficult to solve due to: a) sparse rewards, meaning a reward signal is available only once all the tasks in a mission have been satisfied, and b) the agent having to perform tasks at run-time that are not covered in the training data, e.g., demonstrations only from an environment where all doors were unlocked. Consequently, state-of-the-art decision-making methods in such settings are limited to missions where the required tasks are well-represented in the training demonstrations and can be solved within a short planning horizon. To overcome these limitations, we propose Adaptformer, a stochastic and adaptive planner that utilizes sequence models for sample-efficient exploration and exploitation. This framework relies on learning an energy-based heuristic, which needs to be minimized over a sequence of high-level decisions. To generate successful action sequences for long-horizon missions, Adaptformer aims to achieve shorter sub-goals, which are proposed through an intrinsic sub-goal curriculum. Through these two key components, Adaptformer allows for generalization to out-of-distribution tasks and environments, i.e., missions that were not a part of the training data. Empirical results in multiple simulation environments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Notably, Adaptformer not only outperforms the state-of-the-art method by up to 25% in multi-goal maze reachability tasks but also successfully adapts to multi-task missions that the state-of-the-art method could not complete, leveraging demonstrations from single-goal-reaching tasks.</description>

      <title>BOTS: Batch Bayesian Optimization of Extended Thompson Sampling for Severely Episode-Limited RL Settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In settings where the application of reinforcement learning (RL) requires running real-world trials, including the optimization of adaptive health interventions, the number of episodes available for learning can be severely limited due to cost or time constraints. In this setting, the bias-variance trade-off of contextual bandit methods can be significantly better than that of more complex full RL methods. However, Thompson sampling bandits are limited to selecting actions based on distributions of immediate rewards. In this paper, we extend the linear Thompson sampling bandit to select actions based on a state-action utility function consisting of the Thompson sampler's estimate of the expected immediate reward combined with an action bias term. We use batch Bayesian optimization over episodes to learn the action bias terms with the goal of maximizing the expected return of the extended Thompson sampler. The proposed approach is able to learn optimal policies for a strictly broader class of Markov decision processes (MDPs) than standard Thompson sampling. Using an adaptive intervention simulation environment that captures key aspects of behavioral dynamics, we show that the proposed method can significantly out-perform standard Thompson sampling in terms of total return, while requiring significantly fewer episodes than standard value function and policy gradient methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study explores the field of audio classification from raw waveform using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), a method that eliminates the need for extracting specialised features in the pre-processing step. Unlike recent trends in literature, which often focuses on designing frontends or filters for only the initial layers of CNNs, our research introduces the Cosine Convolutional Neural Network (CosCovNN) replacing the traditional CNN filters with Cosine filters. The CosCovNN surpasses the accuracy of the equivalent CNN architectures with approximately $77\%$ less parameters. Our research further progresses with the development of an augmented CosCovNN named Vector Quantised Cosine Convolutional Neural Network with Memory (VQCCM), incorporating a memory and vector quantisation layer VQCCM achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across five different datasets in comparison with existing literature. Our findings show that cosine filters can greatly improve the efficiency and accuracy of CNNs in raw audio classification.</description>

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a powerful tool to capture intricate network patterns, achieving success across different domains. However, existing GNNs require careful domain-specific architecture designs and training from scratch on each dataset, leading to an expertise-intensive process with difficulty in generalizing across graphs from different domains. Therefore, it can be hard for practitioners to infer which GNN model can generalize well to graphs from their domains. To address this challenge, we propose a novel cross-domain pretraining framework, "one model for one graph," which overcomes the limitations of previous approaches that failed to use a single GNN to capture diverse graph patterns across domains with significant gaps. Specifically, we pretrain a bank of expert models, with each one corresponding to a specific dataset. When inferring to a new graph, gating functions choose a subset of experts to effectively integrate prior model knowledge while avoiding negative transfer. Extensive experiments consistently demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method on both link prediction and node classification tasks.</description>

      <title>HiMoE: Heterogeneity-Informed Mixture-of-Experts for Fair Spatial-Temporal Forecasting</title>

Abstract: Spatial-temporal forecasting has various applications in transportation, climate, and human activity domains. Current spatial-temporal forecasting models primarily adopt a macro perspective, focusing on achieving strong overall prediction performance for the entire system. However, most of these models overlook the importance of enhancing the uniformity of prediction performance across different nodes, leading to poor prediction capabilities for certain nodes and rendering some results impractical. This task is particularly challenging due to the inherent heterogeneity of spatial-temporal data. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a novel Heterogeneity-informed Mixture-of-Experts (HiMoE) for fair spatial-temporal forecasting. Specifically, we design a Heterogeneity-Informed Graph Convolutional Network (HiGCN), integrated into each expert model to enhance the flexibility of the experts. To adapt to the heterogeneity of spatial-temporal data, we design a Node-wise Mixture-of-Experts (NMoE). This model decouples the spatial-temporal prediction task into sub-tasks at the spatial scale, which are then assigned to different experts. To allocate these sub-tasks, we use a mean-based graph decoupling method to distinguish the graph structure for each expert. The results are then aggregated using an output gating mechanism based on a dense Mixture-of-Experts (dMoE). Additionally, fairness-aware loss and evaluation functions are proposed to train the model with uniformity and accuracy as objectives. Experiments conducted on four datasets, encompassing diverse data types and spatial scopes, validate HiMoE's ability to scale across various real-world scenarios. Furthermore, HiMoE consistently outperforms baseline models, achieving superior performance in both accuracy and uniformity.</description>

      <title>Improving speaker verification robustness with synthetic emotional utterances</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A speaker verification (SV) system offers an authentication service designed to confirm whether a given speech sample originates from a specific speaker. This technology has paved the way for various personalized applications that cater to individual preferences. A noteworthy challenge faced by SV systems is their ability to perform consistently across a range of emotional spectra. Most existing models exhibit high error rates when dealing with emotional utterances compared to neutral ones. Consequently, this phenomenon often leads to missing out on speech of interest. This issue primarily stems from the limited availability of labeled emotional speech data, impeding the development of robust speaker representations that encompass diverse emotional states.
  To address this concern, we propose a novel approach employing the CycleGAN framework to serve as a data augmentation method. This technique synthesizes emotional speech segments for each specific speaker while preserving the unique vocal identity. Our experimental findings underscore the effectiveness of incorporating synthetic emotional data into the training process. The models trained using this augmented dataset consistently outperform the baseline models on the task of verifying speakers in emotional speech scenarios, reducing equal error rate by as much as 3.64% relative.</description>

      <title>Cognitive Biases in Large Language Models: A Survey and Mitigation Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained on large corpora written by humans and demonstrate high performance on various tasks. However, as humans are susceptible to cognitive biases, which can result in irrational judgments, LLMs can also be influenced by these biases, leading to irrational decision-making. For example, changing the order of options in multiple-choice questions affects the performance of LLMs due to order bias. In our research, we first conducted an extensive survey of existing studies examining LLMs' cognitive biases and their mitigation. The mitigation techniques in LLMs have the disadvantage that they are limited in the type of biases they can apply or require lengthy inputs or outputs. We then examined the effectiveness of two mitigation methods for humans, SoPro and AwaRe, when applied to LLMs, inspired by studies in crowdsourcing. To test the effectiveness of these methods, we conducted experiments on GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 to evaluate the influence of six biases on the outputs before and after applying these methods. The results demonstrate that while SoPro has little effect, AwaRe enables LLMs to mitigate the effect of these biases and make more rational responses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: MusicGen is a music generation language model (LM) that can be conditioned on textual descriptions and melodic features. We introduce MusicGen-Chord, which extends this capability by incorporating chord progression features. This model modifies one-hot encoded melody chroma vectors into multi-hot encoded chord chroma vectors, enabling the generation of music that reflects both chord progressions and textual descriptions. Furthermore, we developed MusicGen-Remixer, an application utilizing MusicGen-Chord to generate remixes of input music conditioned on textual descriptions. Both models are integrated into Replicate's web-UI using cog, facilitating broad accessibility and user-friendly controllable interaction for creating and experiencing AI-generated music.</description>

      <title>EFTViT: Efficient Federated Training of Vision Transformers with Masked Images on Resource-Constrained Edge Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated learning research has recently shifted from Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to Vision Transformers (ViTs) due to their superior capacity. ViTs training demands higher computational resources due to the lack of 2D inductive biases inherent in CNNs. However, efficient federated training of ViTs on resource-constrained edge devices remains unexplored in the community. In this paper, we propose EFTViT, a hierarchical federated framework that leverages masked images to enable efficient, full-parameter training on resource-constrained edge devices, offering substantial benefits for learning on heterogeneous data. In general, we patchify images and randomly mask a portion of the patches, observing that excluding them from training has minimal impact on performance while substantially reducing computation costs and enhancing data content privacy protection. Specifically, EFTViT comprises a series of lightweight local modules and a larger global module, updated independently on clients and the central server, respectively. The local modules are trained on masked image patches, while the global module is trained on intermediate patch features uploaded from the local client, balanced through a proposed median sampling strategy to erase client data distribution privacy. We analyze the computational complexity and privacy protection of EFTViT. Extensive experiments on popular benchmarks show that EFTViT achieves up to 28.17% accuracy improvement, reduces local training computational cost by up to 2.8$\times$, and cuts local training time by up to 4.4$\times$ compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Zero-shot Chain of Thought Prompting via Uncertainty-Guided Strategy Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting has significantly enhanced the capability of large language models (LLMs) by structuring their reasoning processes. However, existing methods face critical limitations: handcrafted demonstrations require extensive human expertise, while trigger phrases are prone to inaccuracies. In this paper, we propose the Zero-shot Uncertainty-based Selection (ZEUS) method, a novel approach that improves CoT prompting by utilizing uncertainty estimates to select effective demonstrations without needing access to model parameters. Unlike traditional methods, ZEUS offers high sensitivity in distinguishing between helpful and ineffective questions, ensuring more precise and reliable selection. Our extensive evaluation shows that ZEUS consistently outperforms existing CoT strategies across four challenging reasoning benchmarks, demonstrating its robustness and scalability.</description>

      <title>On the Role of Noise in Factorizers for Disentangling Distributed Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To efficiently factorize high-dimensional distributed representations to the constituent atomic vectors, one can exploit the compute-in-superposition capabilities of vector-symbolic architectures (VSA). Such factorizers however suffer from the phenomenon of limit cycles.
  Applying noise during the iterative decoding is one mechanism to address this issue. In this paper, we explore ways to further relax the noise requirement by applying noise only at the time of VSA's reconstruction codebook initialization. While the need for noise during iterations proves analog in-memory computing systems to be a natural choice as an implementation media, the adequacy of initialization noise allows digital hardware to remain equally indispensable. This broadens the implementation possibilities of factorizers. Our study finds that while the best performance shifts from initialization noise to iterative noise as the number of factors increases from 2 to 4, both extend the operational capacity by at least 50 times compared to the baseline factorizer resonator networks.

      <title>2-Factor Retrieval for Improved Human-AI Decision Making in Radiology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human-machine teaming in medical AI requires us to understand to what degree a trained clinician should weigh AI predictions. While previous work has shown the potential of AI assistance at improving clinical predictions, existing clinical decision support systems either provide no explainability of their predictions or use techniques like saliency and Shapley values, which do not allow for physician-based verification. To address this gap, this study compares previously used explainable AI techniques with a newly proposed technique termed '2-factor retrieval (2FR)', which is a combination of interface design and search retrieval that returns similarly labeled data without processing this data. This results in a 2-factor security blanket where: (a) correct images need to be retrieved by the AI; and (b) humans should associate the retrieved images with the current pathology under test. We find that when tested on chest X-ray diagnoses, 2FR leads to increases in clinician accuracy, with particular improvements when clinicians are radiologists and have low confidence in their decision. Our results highlight the importance of understanding how different modes of human-AI decision making may impact clinician accuracy in clinical decision support systems.</description>

      <title>Approximate Fiber Product: A Preliminary Algebraic-Geometric Perspective on Multimodal Embedding Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal tasks, such as image-text retrieval and generation, require embedding data from diverse modalities into a shared representation space. Aligning embeddings from heterogeneous sources while preserving shared and modality-specific information is a fundamental challenge. This paper provides an initial attempt to integrate algebraic geometry into multimodal representation learning, offering a foundational perspective for further exploration.
  We model image and text data as polynomials over discrete rings, \( \mathbb{Z}_{256}[x] \) and \( \mathbb{Z}_{|V|}[x] \), respectively, enabling the use of algebraic tools like fiber products to analyze alignment properties. To accommodate real-world variability, we extend the classical fiber product to an approximate fiber product with a tolerance parameter \( \epsilon \), balancing precision and noise tolerance. We study its dependence on \( \epsilon \), revealing asymptotic behavior, robustness to perturbations, and sensitivity to embedding dimensionality.
  Additionally, we propose a decomposition of the shared embedding space into orthogonal subspaces, \( Z = Z_s \oplus Z_I \oplus Z_T \), where \( Z_s \) captures shared semantics, and \( Z_I \), \( Z_T \) encode modality-specific features. This decomposition is geometrically interpreted via manifolds and fiber bundles, offering insights into embedding structure and optimization.
  This framework establishes a principled foundation for analyzing multimodal alignment, uncovering connections between robustness, dimensionality allocation, and algebraic structure. It lays the groundwork for further research on embedding spaces in multimodal learning using algebraic geometry.</description>

      <title>Fine-Tuning Pre-trained Large Time Series Models for Prediction of Wind Turbine SCADA Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The remarkable achievements of large models in the fields of natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV) have sparked interest in their application to time series forecasting within industrial contexts. This paper explores the application of a pre-trained large time series model, Timer, which was initially trained on a wide range of time series data from multiple domains, in the prediction of Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) data collected from wind turbines. The model was fine-tuned on SCADA datasets sourced from two wind farms, which exhibited differing characteristics, and its accuracy was subsequently evaluated. Additionally, the impact of data volume was studied to evaluate the few-shot ability of the Timer. Finally, an application study on one-turbine fine-tuning for whole-plant prediction was implemented where both few-shot and cross-turbine generalization capacity is required. The results reveal that the pre-trained large model does not consistently outperform other baseline models in terms of prediction accuracy whenever the data is abundant or not, but demonstrates superior performance in the application study. This result underscores the distinctive advantages of the pre-trained large time series model in facilitating swift deployment.</description>

      <title>Mixture of Experts for Node Classification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00418v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nodes in the real-world graphs exhibit diverse patterns in numerous aspects, such as degree and homophily. However, most existent node predictors fail to capture a wide range of node patterns or to make predictions based on distinct node patterns, resulting in unsatisfactory classification performance. In this paper, we reveal that different node predictors are good at handling nodes with specific patterns and only apply one node predictor uniformly could lead to suboptimal result. To mitigate this gap, we propose a mixture of experts framework, MoE-NP, for node classification. Specifically, MoE-NP combines a mixture of node predictors and strategically selects models based on node patterns. Experimental results from a range of real-world datasets demonstrate significant performance improvements from MoE-NP.</description>

      <title>FreeCond: Free Lunch in the Input Conditions of Text-Guided Inpainting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we aim to determine and solve the deficiency of Stable Diffusion Inpainting (SDI) in following the instruction of both prompt and mask. Due to the training bias from masking, the inpainting quality is hindered when the prompt instruction and image condition are not related. Therefore, we conduct a detailed analysis of the internal representations learned by SDI, focusing on how the mask input influences the cross-attention layer. We observe that adapting text key tokens toward the input mask enables the model to selectively paint within the given area. Leveraging these insights, we propose FreeCond, which adjusts only the input mask condition and image condition. By increasing the latent mask value and modifying the frequency of image condition, we align the cross-attention features with the model's training bias to improve generation quality without additional computation, particularly when user inputs are complicated and deviate from the training setup. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FreeCond can enhance any SDI-based model, e.g., yielding up to a 60% and 58% improvement of SDI and SDXLI in the CLIP score.</description>

      <title>Learner Attentiveness and Engagement Analysis in Online Education Using Computer Vision</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent times, online education and the usage of video-conferencing platforms have experienced massive growth. Due to the limited scope of a virtual classroom, it may become difficult for instructors to analyze learners' attention and comprehension in real time while teaching. In the digital mode of education, it would be beneficial for instructors to have an automated feedback mechanism to be informed regarding learners' attentiveness at any given time. This research presents a novel computer vision-based approach to analyze and quantify learners' attentiveness, engagement, and other affective states within online learning scenarios. This work presents the development of a multiclass multioutput classification method using convolutional neural networks on a publicly available dataset - DAiSEE. A machine learning-based algorithm is developed on top of the classification model that outputs a comprehensive attentiveness index of the learners. Furthermore, an end-to-end pipeline is proposed through which learners' live video feed is processed, providing detailed attentiveness analytics of the learners to the instructors. By comparing the experimental outcomes of the proposed method against those of previous methods, it is demonstrated that the proposed method exhibits better attentiveness detection than state-of-the-art methods. The proposed system is a comprehensive, practical, and real-time solution that is deployable and easy to use. The experimental results also demonstrate the system's efficiency in gauging learners' attentiveness.</description>

      <title>On the Conditions for Domain Stability for Machine Learning: a Mathematical Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work proposes a mathematical approach that (re)defines a property of Machine Learning models named stability and determines sufficient conditions to validate it. Machine Learning models are represented as functions, and the characteristics in scope depend upon the domain of the function, what allows us to adopt topological and metric spaces theory as a basis. Finally, this work provides some equivalences useful to prove and test stability in Machine Learning models. The results suggest that whenever stability is aligned with the notion of function smoothness, then the stability of Machine Learning models primarily depends upon certain topological, measurable properties of the classification sets within the ML model domain.</description>

      <title>AgriBench: A Hierarchical Agriculture Benchmark for Multimodal Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce AgriBench, the first agriculture benchmark designed to evaluate MultiModal Large Language Models (MM-LLMs) for agriculture applications. To further address the agriculture knowledge-based dataset limitation problem, we propose MM-LUCAS, a multimodal agriculture dataset, that includes 1,784 landscape images, segmentation masks, depth maps, and detailed annotations (geographical location, country, date, land cover and land use taxonomic details, quality scores, aesthetic scores, etc), based on the Land Use/Cover Area Frame Survey (LUCAS) dataset, which contains comparable statistics on land use and land cover for the European Union (EU) territory. This work presents a groundbreaking perspective in advancing agriculture MM-LLMs and is still in progress, offering valuable insights for future developments and innovations in specific expert knowledge-based MM-LLMs.</description>

      <title>Improved Cleanup and Decoding of Fractional Power Encodings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-dimensional vectors have been proposed as a neural method for representing information in the brain using Vector Symbolic Algebras (VSAs). While previous work has explored decoding and cleaning up these vectors under the noise that arises during computation, existing methods are limited. Cleanup methods are essential for robust computation within a VSA. However, cleanup methods for continuous-value encodings are not as effective. In this paper, we present an iterative optimization method to decode and clean up Fourier Holographic Reduced Representation (FHRR) vectors that are encoding continuous values. We combine composite likelihood estimation (CLE) and maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) to ensure convergence to the global optimum. We also demonstrate that this method can effectively decode FHRR vectors under different noise conditions, and show that it outperforms existing methods.</description>

      <title>Homeostazis and Sparsity in Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The transformer architecture has become an integral part of the field of modern neural networks, playing a crucial role in a variety of tasks, such as text generation, machine translation, image and audio processing, among others. There is also an alternative approach to building intelligent systems, proposed by Jeff Hawkins and inspired by the processes occurring in the neocortex. In our article we want to combine some of these ideas and to propose the use of homeostazis mechanisms, such as RFB-kWTA and "Smart" Inhibition, in the attention mechanism of the transformer and at the output of the transformer block, as well as conducting an experiment involving the introduction of sparse distributed representations of the transformer at various points. RFB-kWTA utilizes statistics of layer activations across time to adjust the entire layer, enhancing the values of rare activations while reducing those of frequent ones. "Smart" Inhibition also uses activation statistics to sample sparsity masks, with rarer activation times are more likely to be activated. Our proposed mechanisms significantly outperform the classical transformer 0.2768 BLEU and a model that only makes use of dropout in the attention mechanism and output of the transformer block 0.3007 BLEU, achieving a score of 0.3062 on the Multi30K dataset.</description>

      <title>Graph-to-SFILES: Control structure prediction from process topologies using generative artificial intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Control structure design is an important but tedious step in P&amp;ID development. Generative artificial intelligence (AI) promises to reduce P&amp;ID development time by supporting engineers. Previous research on generative AI in chemical process design mainly represented processes by sequences. However, graphs offer a promising alternative because of their permutation invariance. We propose the Graph-to-SFILES model, a generative AI method to predict control structures from flowsheet topologies. The Graph-to-SFILES model takes the flowsheet topology as a graph input and returns a control-extended flowsheet as a sequence in the SFILES 2.0 notation. We compare four different graph encoder architectures, one of them being a graph neural network (GNN) proposed in this work. The Graph-to-SFILES model achieves a top-5 accuracy of 73.2% when trained on 10,000 flowsheet topologies. In addition, the proposed GNN performs best among the encoder architectures. Compared to a purely sequence-based approach, the Graph-to-SFILES model improves the top-5 accuracy for a relatively small training dataset of 1,000 flowsheets from 0.9% to 28.4%. However, the sequence-based approach performs better on a large-scale dataset of 100,000 flowsheets. These results highlight the potential of graph-based AI models to accelerate P&amp;ID development in small-data regimes but their effectiveness on industry relevant case studies still needs to be investigated.</description>

      <title>Energy-Based Prior Latent Space Diffusion model for Reconstruction of Lumbar Vertebrae from Thick Slice MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lumbar spine problems are ubiquitous, motivating research into targeted imaging for treatment planning and guided interventions. While high resolution and high contrast CT has been the modality of choice, MRI can capture both bone and soft tissue without the ionizing radiation of CT albeit longer acquisition time. The critical trade-off between contrast quality and acquisition time has motivated 'thick slice MRI', which prioritises faster imaging with high in-plane resolution but variable contrast and low through-plane resolution. We investigate a recently developed post-acquisition pipeline which segments vertebrae from thick-slice acquisitions and uses a variational autoencoder to enhance quality after an initial 3D reconstruction. We instead propose a latent space diffusion energy-based prior to leverage diffusion models, which exhibit high-quality image generation. Crucially, we mitigate their high computational cost and low sample efficiency by learning an energy-based latent representation to perform the diffusion processes. Our resulting method outperforms existing approaches across metrics including Dice and VS scores, and more faithfully captures 3D features.</description>

Abstract: Full-blown AI-generated video generation continues its journey through the uncanny valley to produce content that is perceptually indistinguishable from reality. Intermixed with many exciting and creative applications are malicious applications that harm individuals, organizations, and democracies. We describe an effective and robust technique for distinguishing real from AI-generated human motion. This technique leverages a multi-modal semantic embedding, making it robust to the types of laundering that typically confound more low- to mid-level approaches. This method is evaluated against a custom-built dataset of video clips with human actions generated by seven text-to-video AI models and matching real footage.</description>

      <title>Towards Fault Tolerance in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Agent faults pose a significant threat to the performance of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms, introducing two key challenges. First, agents often struggle to extract critical information from the chaotic state space created by unexpected faults. Second, transitions recorded before and after faults in the replay buffer affect training unevenly, leading to a sample imbalance problem. To overcome these challenges, this paper enhances the fault tolerance of MARL by combining optimized model architecture with a tailored training data sampling strategy. Specifically, an attention mechanism is incorporated into the actor and critic networks to automatically detect faults and dynamically regulate the attention given to faulty agents. Additionally, a prioritization mechanism is introduced to selectively sample transitions critical to current training needs. To further support research in this area, we design and open-source a highly decoupled code platform for fault-tolerant MARL, aimed at improving the efficiency of studying related problems. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in handling various types of faults, faults occurring in any agent, and faults arising at random times.</description>

      <title>TextClass Benchmark: A Continuous Elo Rating of LLMs in Social Sciences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The TextClass Benchmark project is an ongoing, continuous benchmarking process that aims to provide a comprehensive, fair, and dynamic evaluation of LLMs and transformers for text classification tasks. This evaluation spans various domains and languages in social sciences disciplines engaged in NLP and text-as-data approach. The leaderboards present performance metrics and relative ranking using a tailored Elo rating system. With each leaderboard cycle, novel models are added, fixed test sets can be replaced for unseen, equivalent data to test generalisation power, ratings are updated, and a Meta-Elo leaderboard combines and weights domain-specific leaderboards. This article presents the rationale and motivation behind the project, explains the Elo rating system in detail, and estimates Meta-Elo across different classification tasks in social science disciplines. We also present a snapshot of the first cycle of classification tasks on incivility data in Chinese, English, German and Russian. This ongoing benchmarking process includes not only additional languages such as Arabic, Hindi, and Spanish but also a classification of policy agenda topics, misinformation, among others.</description>

      <title>Motion Dreamer: Realizing Physically Coherent Video Generation through Scene-Aware Motion Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent numerous video generation models, also known as world models, have demonstrated the ability to generate plausible real-world videos. However, many studies have shown that these models often produce motion results lacking logical or physical coherence. In this paper, we revisit video generation models and find that single-stage approaches struggle to produce high-quality results while maintaining coherent motion reasoning. To address this issue, we propose \textbf{Motion Dreamer}, a two-stage video generation framework. In Stage I, the model generates an intermediate motion representation-such as a segmentation map or depth map-based on the input image and motion conditions, focusing solely on the motion itself. In Stage II, the model uses this intermediate motion representation as a condition to generate a high-detail video. By decoupling motion reasoning from high-fidelity video synthesis, our approach allows for more accurate and physically plausible motion generation. We validate the effectiveness of our approach on the Physion dataset and in autonomous driving scenarios. For example, given a single push, our model can synthesize the sequential toppling of a set of dominoes. Similarly, by varying the movements of ego-cars, our model can produce different effects on other vehicles. Our work opens new avenues in creating models that can reason about physical interactions in a more coherent and realistic manner.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Performance Challenges of Large Language Models in Low-Resource Healthcare: A Demographic Fairness Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the performance of large language models (LLMs), particularly regarding demographic fairness, in solving real-world healthcare tasks. We evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs with three prevalent learning frameworks across six diverse healthcare tasks and find significant challenges in applying LLMs to real-world healthcare tasks and persistent fairness issues across demographic groups. We also find that explicitly providing demographic information yields mixed results, while LLM's ability to infer such details raises concerns about biased health predictions. Utilizing LLMs as autonomous agents with access to up-to-date guidelines does not guarantee performance improvement. We believe these findings reveal the critical limitations of LLMs in healthcare fairness and the urgent need for specialized research in this area.</description>

      <title>Blind Inverse Problem Solving Made Easy by Text-to-Image Latent Diffusion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Blind inverse problems, where both the target data and forward operator are unknown, are crucial to many computer vision applications. Existing methods often depend on restrictive assumptions such as additional training, operator linearity, or narrow image distributions, thus limiting their generalizability. In this work, we present LADiBI, a training-free framework that uses large-scale text-to-image diffusion models to solve blind inverse problems with minimal assumptions. By leveraging natural language prompts, LADiBI jointly models priors for both the target image and operator, allowing for flexible adaptation across a variety of tasks. Additionally, we propose a novel posterior sampling approach that combines effective operator initialization with iterative refinement, enabling LADiBI to operate without predefined operator forms. Our experiments show that LADiBI is capable of solving a broad range of image restoration tasks, including both linear and nonlinear problems, on diverse target image distributions.</description>

      <title>Polish Medical Exams: A new dataset for cross-lingual medical knowledge transfer assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in handling specialized tasks, including medical problem-solving. However, most studies predominantly focus on English-language contexts. This study introduces a novel benchmark dataset based on Polish medical licensing and specialization exams (LEK, LDEK, PES) taken by medical doctor candidates and practicing doctors pursuing specialization. The dataset was web-scraped from publicly available resources provided by the Medical Examination Center and the Chief Medical Chamber. It comprises over 24,000 exam questions, including a subset of parallel Polish-English corpora, where the English portion was professionally translated by the examination center for foreign candidates. By creating a structured benchmark from these existing exam questions, we systematically evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs, including general-purpose, domain-specific, and Polish-specific models, and compare their performance against human medical students. Our analysis reveals that while models like GPT-4o achieve near-human performance, significant challenges persist in cross-lingual translation and domain-specific understanding. These findings underscore disparities in model performance across languages and medical specialties, highlighting the limitations and ethical considerations of deploying LLMs in clinical practice.</description>

      <title>Friend or Foe? Harnessing Controllable Overfitting for Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Overfitting has long been stigmatized as detrimental to model performance, especially in the context of anomaly detection. Our work challenges this conventional view by introducing a paradigm shift, recasting overfitting as a controllable and strategic mechanism for enhancing model discrimination capabilities. In this paper, we present Controllable Overfitting-based Anomaly Detection (COAD), a novel framework designed to leverage overfitting for optimized anomaly detection. We propose the Aberrance Retention Quotient (ARQ), a novel metric that systematically quantifies the extent of overfitting, enabling the identification of an optimal "golden overfitting interval." Within this interval, overfitting is leveraged to significantly amplify the model's sensitivity to anomalous patterns, while preserving generalization to normal samples. Additionally, we present the Relative Anomaly Distribution Index (RADI), an innovative metric designed to complement AUROC pixel by providing a more versatile and theoretically robust framework for assessing model performance. RADI leverages ARQ to track and evaluate how overfitting impacts anomaly detection, offering an integrated approach to understanding the relationship between overfitting dynamics and model efficacy. Our theoretical work also rigorously validates the use of Gaussian noise in pseudo anomaly synthesis, providing the foundation for its broader applicability across diverse domains. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our controllable overfitting method not only achieves State of the Art (SOTA) performance in both one-class and multi-class anomaly detection tasks but also redefines overfitting from a modeling challenge into a powerful tool for optimizing anomaly detection.</description>

Audio Atlas is designed to facilitate the exploration and analysis of audio datasets using a contrastive embedding model and a vector database for efficient data management and semantic search. The system maps audio embeddings into a two-dimensional space and leverages DeepScatter for dynamic visualization. Designed for extensibility, Audio Atlas allows easy integration of new datasets, enabling users to better understand their audio data and identify both patterns and outliers.

      <title>Generative LiDAR Editing with Controllable Novel Object Layouts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a framework to edit real-world Lidar scans with novel object layouts while preserving a realistic background environment. Compared to the synthetic data generation frameworks where Lidar point clouds are generated from scratch, our framework focuses on new scenario generation in a given background environment, and our method also provides labels for the generated data. This approach ensures the generated data remains relevant to the specific environment, aiding both the development and the evaluation of algorithms in real-world scenarios. Compared with novel view synthesis, our framework allows the creation of counterfactual scenarios with significant changes in the object layout and does not rely on multi-frame optimization. In our framework, the object removal and insertion are supported by generative background inpainting and object point cloud completion, and the entire pipeline is built upon spherical voxelization, which realizes the correct Lidar projective geometry by construction. Experiments show that our framework generates realistic Lidar scans with object layout changes and benefits the development of Lidar-based self-driving systems.</description>

      <title>PhyT2V: LLM-Guided Iterative Self-Refinement for Physics-Grounded Text-to-Video Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text-to-video (T2V) generation has been recently enabled by transformer-based diffusion models, but current T2V models lack capabilities in adhering to the real-world common knowledge and physical rules, due to their limited understanding of physical realism and deficiency in temporal modeling. Existing solutions are either data-driven or require extra model inputs, but cannot be generalizable to out-of-distribution domains. In this paper, we present PhyT2V, a new data-independent T2V technique that expands the current T2V model's capability of video generation to out-of-distribution domains, by enabling chain-of-thought and step-back reasoning in T2V prompting. Our experiments show that PhyT2V improves existing T2V models' adherence to real-world physical rules by 2.3x, and achieves 35% improvement compared to T2V prompt enhancers.

      <title>Exposing LLM Vulnerabilities: Adversarial Scam Detection and Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Can we trust Large Language Models (LLMs) to accurately predict scam? This paper investigates the vulnerabilities of LLMs when facing adversarial scam messages for the task of scam detection. We addressed this issue by creating a comprehensive dataset with fine-grained labels of scam messages, including both original and adversarial scam messages. The dataset extended traditional binary classes for the scam detection task into more nuanced scam types. Our analysis showed how adversarial examples took advantage of vulnerabilities of a LLM, leading to high misclassification rate. We evaluated the performance of LLMs on these adversarial scam messages and proposed strategies to improve their robustness.</description>

      <title>Visual Modality Prompt for Adapting Vision-Language Object Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The zero-shot performance of object detectors degrades when tested on different modalities, such as infrared and depth. While recent work has explored image translation techniques to adapt detectors to new modalities, these methods are limited to a single modality and apply only to traditional detectors. Recently, vision-language detectors, such as YOLO-World and Grounding DINO, have shown promising zero-shot capabilities, however, they have not yet been adapted for other visual modalities. Traditional fine-tuning approaches tend to compromise the zero-shot capabilities of the detectors. The visual prompt strategies commonly used for classification with vision-language models apply the same linear prompt translation to each image making them less effective. To address these limitations, we propose ModPrompt, a visual prompt strategy to adapt vision-language detectors to new modalities without degrading zero-shot performance. In particular, an encoder-decoder visual prompt strategy is proposed, further enhanced by the integration of inference-friendly task residuals, facilitating more robust adaptation. Empirically, we benchmark our method for modality adaptation on two vision-language detectors, YOLO-World and Grounding DINO, and on challenging infrared (LLVIP, FLIR) and depth (NYUv2) data, achieving performance comparable to full fine-tuning while preserving the model's zero-shot capability.

      <title>ARChef: An iOS-Based Augmented Reality Cooking Assistant Powered by Multimodal Gemini LLM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cooking meals can be difficult, causing many to use cookbooks and online recipes, which results in missing ingredients, nutritional hazards, unsatisfactory meals. Using Augmented Reality (AR) can address this issue, however, current AR cooking applications have poor user interfaces and limited accessibility. This paper proposes a prototype of an iOS application that integrates AR and Computer Vision (CV) into the cooking process. We leverage Google's Gemini Large Language Model (LLM) to identify ingredients based on the camera's field of vision, and generate recipe choices with their nutritional information. Additionally, this application uses Apple's ARKit to create an AR user interface compatible with iOS devices. Users can personalize their meal suggestions by inputting their dietary preferences and rating each meal. The application's effectiveness is evaluated through user experience surveys. This application contributes to the field of accessible cooking assistance technologies, aiming to reduce food wastage and improve the meal planning experience.</description>

      <title>ROSE: A Reward-Oriented Data Selection Framework for LLM Task-Specific Instruction Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Instruction tuning has underscored the significant potential of large language models (LLMs) in producing more human-controllable and effective outputs in various domains. In this work, we focus on the data selection problem for task-specific instruction tuning of LLMs. Prevailing methods primarily rely on the crafted similarity metrics to select training data that aligns with the test data distribution. The goal is to minimize instruction tuning loss on the test data, ultimately improving performance on the target task. However, it has been widely observed that instruction tuning loss (i.e., cross-entropy loss for next token prediction) in LLMs often fails to exhibit a monotonic relationship with actual task performance. This misalignment undermines the effectiveness of current data selection methods for task-specific instruction tuning. To address this issue, we introduce ROSE, a novel Reward-Oriented inStruction data sElection method which leverages pairwise preference loss as a reward signal to optimize data selection for task-specific instruction tuning. Specifically, ROSE adapts an influence formulation to approximate the influence of training data points relative to a few-shot preference validation set to select the most task-related training data points. Experimental results show that by selecting just 5% of the training data using ROSE, our approach can achieve competitive results compared to fine-tuning with the full training dataset, and it surpasses other state-of-the-art data selection methods for task-specific instruction tuning. Our qualitative analysis further confirms the robust generalizability of our method across multiple benchmark datasets and diverse model architectures.</description>

      <title>Predictive Inference With Fast Feature Conformal Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conformal prediction is widely adopted in uncertainty quantification, due to its post-hoc, distribution-free, and model-agnostic properties. In the realm of modern deep learning, researchers have proposed Feature Conformal Prediction (FCP), which deploys conformal prediction in a feature space, yielding reduced band lengths. However, the practical utility of FCP is limited due to the time-consuming non-linear operations required to transform confidence bands from feature space to output space. In this paper, we introduce Fast Feature Conformal Prediction (FFCP), which features a novel non-conformity score and is convenient for practical applications. FFCP serves as a fast version of FCP, in that it equivalently employs a Taylor expansion to approximate the aforementioned non-linear operations in FCP. Empirical validations showcase that FFCP performs comparably with FCP (both outperforming the vanilla version) while achieving a significant reduction in computational time by approximately 50x.

      <title>Improving Vietnamese Legal Document Retrieval using Synthetic Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the field of legal information retrieval, effective embedding-based models are essential for accurate question-answering systems. However, the scarcity of large annotated datasets poses a significant challenge, particularly for Vietnamese legal texts. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach that leverages large language models to generate high-quality, diverse synthetic queries for Vietnamese legal passages. This synthetic data is then used to pre-train retrieval models, specifically bi-encoder and ColBERT, which are further fine-tuned using contrastive loss with mined hard negatives. Our experiments demonstrate that these enhancements lead to strong improvement in retrieval accuracy, validating the effectiveness of synthetic data and pre-training techniques in overcoming the limitations posed by the lack of large labeled datasets in the Vietnamese legal domain.</description>

      <title>Mean-Field Sampling for Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Designing efficient algorithms for multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is fundamentally challenging due to the fact that the size of the joint state and action spaces are exponentially large in the number of agents. These difficulties are exacerbated when balancing sequential global decision-making with local agent interactions. In this work, we propose a new algorithm \texttt{SUBSAMPLE-MFQ} (\textbf{Subsample}-\textbf{M}ean-\textbf{F}ield-\textbf{Q}-learning) and a decentralized randomized policy for a system with $n$ agents. For $k\leq n$, our algorithm system learns a policy for the system in time polynomial in $k$. We show that this learned policy converges to the optimal policy in the order of $\tilde{O}(1/\sqrt{k})$ as the number of subsampled agents $k$ increases. We validate our method empirically on Gaussian squeeze and global exploration settings.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning for Longitudinal Gross Tumor Volume Segmentation in MRI-Guided Adaptive Radiotherapy for Head and Neck Cancer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate segmentation of gross tumor volume (GTV) is essential for effective MRI-guided adaptive radiotherapy (MRgART) in head and neck cancer. However, manual segmentation of the GTV over the course of therapy is time-consuming and prone to interobserver variability. Deep learning (DL) has the potential to overcome these challenges by automatically delineating GTVs. In this study, our team, $\textit{UW LAIR}$, tackled the challenges of both pre-radiotherapy (pre-RT) (Task 1) and mid-radiotherapy (mid-RT) (Task 2) tumor volume segmentation. To this end, we developed a series of DL models for longitudinal GTV segmentation. The backbone of our models for both tasks was SegResNet with deep supervision. For Task 1, we trained the model using a combined dataset of pre-RT and mid-RT MRI data, which resulted in the improved aggregated Dice similarity coefficient (DSCagg) on an internal testing set compared to models trained solely on pre-RT MRI data. In Task 2, we introduced mask-aware attention modules, enabling pre-RT GTV masks to influence intermediate features learned from mid-RT data. This attention-based approach yielded slight improvements over the baseline method, which concatenated mid-RT MRI with pre-RT GTV masks as input. In the final testing phase, the ensemble of 10 pre-RT segmentation models achieved an average DSCagg of 0.794, with 0.745 for primary GTV (GTVp) and 0.844 for metastatic lymph nodes (GTVn) in Task 1. For Task 2, the ensemble of 10 mid-RT segmentation models attained an average DSCagg of 0.733, with 0.607 for GTVp and 0.859 for GTVn, leading us to $\textbf{achieve 1st place}$. In summary, we presented a collection of DL models that could facilitate GTV segmentation in MRgART, offering the potential to streamline radiation oncology workflows. Our code and model weights are available at https://github.com/xtie97/HNTS-MRG24-UWLAIR.</description>

      <title>Paint Outside the Box: Synthesizing and Selecting Training Data for Visual Grounding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Visual grounding aims to localize the image regions based on a textual query. Given the difficulty of large-scale data curation, we investigate how to effectively learn visual grounding under data-scarce settings in this paper. To address data scarcity, we propose a novel framework, POBF (Paint Outside the Box, then Filter). POBF synthesizes images by inpainting outside the box, tackling a label misalignment issue encountered in previous works. Furthermore, POBF leverages an innovative filtering scheme to identify the most effective training data. This scheme combines a hardness score and an overfitting score, balanced by a penalty term. Experimental results show that POBF achieves superior performance across four datasets, delivering an average improvement of 5.83% and outperforming leading baselines by 2.29% to 3.85% in accuracy. Additionally, we validate the robustness and generalizability of POBF across various generative models, data ratios, and model architectures.</description>

      <title>LVLM-COUNT: Enhancing the Counting Ability of Large Vision-Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Counting is a fundamental skill for various visual tasks in real-life applications, requiring both object recognition and robust counting capabilities. Despite their advanced visual perception, large vision-language models (LVLMs) struggle with counting tasks, especially when the number of objects exceeds those commonly encountered during training. We enhance LVLMs' counting abilities using a divide-and-conquer approach, breaking counting problems into sub-counting tasks. Unlike prior methods, which do not generalize well to counting datasets on which they have not been trained, our method performs well on new datasets without any additional training or fine-tuning. We demonstrate that our approach enhances counting capabilities across various datasets and benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Protect Your Secrets: Understanding and Measuring Data Exposure in VSCode Extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent years have witnessed the emerging trend of extensions in modern Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) like Visual Studio Code (VSCode) that significantly enhance developer productivity. Especially, popular AI coding assistants like GitHub Copilot and Tabnine provide conveniences like automated code completion and debugging. While these extensions offer numerous benefits, they may introduce privacy and security concerns to software developers. However, there is no existing work that systematically analyzes the security and privacy concerns, including the risks of data exposure in VSCode extensions.
  In this paper, we investigate on the security issues of cross-extension interactions in VSCode and shed light on the vulnerabilities caused by data exposure among different extensions. Our study uncovers high-impact security flaws that could allow adversaries to stealthily acquire or manipulate credential-related data (e.g., passwords, API keys, access tokens) from other extensions if not properly handled by extension vendors. To measure their prevalence, we design a novel automated risk detection framework that leverages program analysis and natural language processing techniques to automatically identify potential risks in VSCode extensions. By applying our tool to 27,261 real-world VSCode extensions, we discover that 8.5\% of them (i.e., 2,325 extensions) are exposed to credential-related data leakage through various vectors, such as commands, user input, and configurations. Our study sheds light on the security challenges and flaws of the extension-in-IDE paradigm and provides suggestions and recommendations for improving the security of VSCode extensions and mitigating the risks of data exposure.</description>

      <title>Well log data generation and imputation using sequence-based generative adversarial networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Well log analysis is crucial for hydrocarbon exploration, providing detailed insights into subsurface geological formations. However, gaps and inaccuracies in well log data, often due to equipment limitations, operational challenges, and harsh subsurface conditions, can introduce significant uncertainties in reservoir evaluation. Addressing these challenges requires effective methods for both synthetic data generation and precise imputation of missing data, ensuring data completeness and reliability. This study introduces a novel framework utilizing sequence-based generative adversarial networks (GANs) specifically designed for well log data generation and imputation. The framework integrates two distinct sequence-based GAN models: Time Series GAN (TSGAN) for generating synthetic well log data and Sequence GAN (SeqGAN) for imputing missing data. Both models were tested on a dataset from the North Sea, Netherlands region, focusing on different sections of 5, 10, and 50 data points. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach achieves superior accuracy in filling data gaps compared to other deep learning models for spatial series analysis. The method yielded R^2 values of 0.921, 0.899, and 0.594, with corresponding mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) values of 8.320, 0.005, and 151.154, and mean absolute error (MAE) values of 0.012, 0.005, and 0.032, respectively. These results set a new benchmark for data integrity and utility in geosciences, particularly in well log data analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Language Agent could be endowed with different mechanisms for autonomous task accomplishment. Current agents typically rely on fixed mechanisms or a set of mechanisms activated in a predefined order, limiting their adaptation to varied potential task solution structures. To this end, this paper proposes \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{L}anguage \textbf{A}gent \textbf{M}echanism \textbf{A}ctivation Learning with Self-Exploration (\textbf{ALAMA}), which focuses on optimizing mechanism activation adaptability without reliance on expert models. Initially, it builds a harmonized agent framework (\textbf{UniAct}) to \textbf{Uni}fy different mechanisms via \textbf{Act}ions. Then it leverages a training-efficient optimization method based on self-exploration to enable the UniAct to adaptively activate the appropriate mechanisms according to the potential characteristics of the task. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in downstream agent tasks, affirming the effectiveness of our approach in facilitating more dynamic and context-sensitive mechanism activation.</description>

      <title>Decision Transformer vs. Decision Mamba: Analysing the Complexity of Sequential Decision Making in Atari Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work analyses the disparity in performance between Decision Transformer (DT) and Decision Mamba (DM) in sequence modelling reinforcement learning tasks for different Atari games. The study first observed that DM generally outperformed DT in the games Breakout and Qbert, while DT performed better in more complicated games, such as Hero and Kung Fu Master. To understand these differences, we expanded the number of games to 12 and performed a comprehensive analysis of game characteristics, including action space complexity, visual complexity, average trajectory length, and average steps to the first non-zero reward. In order to further analyse the key factors that impact the disparity in performance between DT and DM, we employ various approaches, including quantifying visual complexity, random forest regression, correlation analysis, and action space simplification strategies. The results indicate that the performance gap between DT and DM is affected by the complex interaction of multiple factors, with the complexity of the action space and visual complexity (particularly evaluated by compression ratio) being the primary determining factors. DM performs well in environments with simple action and visual elements, while DT shows an advantage in games with higher action and visual complexity. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of how the game characteristics affect the performance difference in sequential modelling reinforcement learning, potentially guiding the development of future model design and applications for diverse and complex environments.</description>

      <title>Free and Customizable Code Documentation with LLMs: A Fine-Tuning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automated documentation of programming source code is a challenging task with significant practical and scientific implications for the developer community. We present a large language model (LLM)-based application that developers can use as a support tool to generate basic documentation for any publicly available repository. Over the last decade, several papers have been written on generating documentation for source code using neural network architectures. With the recent advancements in LLM technology, some open-source applications have been developed to address this problem. However, these applications typically rely on the OpenAI APIs, which incur substantial financial costs, particularly for large repositories. Moreover, none of these open-source applications offer a fine-tuned model or features to enable users to fine-tune. Additionally, finding suitable data for fine-tuning is often challenging. Our application addresses these issues which is available at https://pypi.org/project/readme-ready/.</description>

      <title>A Cross-Scene Benchmark for Open-World Drone Active Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Drone Visual Active Tracking aims to autonomously follow a target object by controlling the motion system based on visual observations, providing a more practical solution for effective tracking in dynamic environments. However, accurate Drone Visual Active Tracking using reinforcement learning remains challenging due to the absence of a unified benchmark, the complexity of open-world environments with frequent interference, and the diverse motion behavior of dynamic targets. To address these issues, we propose a unified cross-scene cross-domain benchmark for open-world drone active tracking called DAT. The DAT benchmark provides 24 visually complex environments to assess the algorithms' cross-scene and cross-domain generalization abilities, and high-fidelity modeling of realistic robot dynamics. Additionally, we propose a reinforcement learning-based drone tracking method called R-VAT, which aims to improve the performance of drone tracking targets in complex scenarios. Specifically, inspired by curriculum learning, we introduce a Curriculum-Based Training strategy that progressively enhances the agent tracking performance in vast environments with complex interference. We design a goal-centered reward function to provide precise feedback to the drone agent, preventing targets farther from the center of view from receiving higher rewards than closer ones. This allows the drone to adapt to the diverse motion behavior of open-world targets. Experiments demonstrate that the R-VAT has about 400% improvement over the SOTA method in terms of the cumulative reward metric.</description>

      <title>MERLIN: Multi-stagE query performance prediction for dynamic paRallel oLap pIpeliNe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-performance OLAP database technology has emerged with the growing demand for massive data analysis. To achieve much higher performance, many DBMSs adopt sophisticated designs including SIMD operators, parallel execution, and dynamic pipeline modification. However, such advanced OLAP query execution mechanisms still lack targeted Query Performance Prediction (QPP) methods because most existing methods target conventional tree-shaped query plans and static serial executors. To address this problem, in this paper, we proposed MERLIN a multi-stage query performance prediction method for high-performance OLAP DBMSs. MERLIN first establishes resource cost models for each physical operator. Then, it constructs a DAG that consists of a data-flow tree backbone and resource competition relationships among concurrent operators. After using a GAT with an extra attention mechanism to calibrate the cost, the cost vector tree is extracted and summarized by a TCN, ultimately enabling effective query performance prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that MERLIN yields higher performance prediction precision than existing methods.</description>

      <title>CtrlNeRF: The Generative Neural Radiation Fields for the Controllable Synthesis of High-fidelity 3D-Aware Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The neural radiance field (NERF) advocates learning the continuous representation of 3D geometry through a multilayer perceptron (MLP). By integrating this into a generative model, the generative neural radiance field (GRAF) is capable of producing images from random noise z without 3D supervision. In practice, the shape and appearance are modeled by z_s and z_a, respectively, to manipulate them separately during inference. However, it is challenging to represent multiple scenes using a solitary MLP and precisely control the generation of 3D geometry in terms of shape and appearance. In this paper, we introduce a controllable generative model (i.e. \textbf{CtrlNeRF}) that uses a single MLP network to represent multiple scenes with shared weights. Consequently, we manipulated the shape and appearance codes to realize the controllable generation of high-fidelity images with 3D consistency. Moreover, the model enables the synthesis of novel views that do not exist in the training sets via camera pose alteration and feature interpolation. Extensive experiments were conducted to demonstrate its superiority in 3D-aware image generation compared to its counterparts.</description>

      <title>Automating Feedback Analysis in Surgical Training: Detection, Categorization, and Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work introduces the first framework for reconstructing surgical dialogue from unstructured real-world recordings, which is crucial for characterizing teaching tasks. In surgical training, the formative verbal feedback that trainers provide to trainees during live surgeries is crucial for ensuring safety, correcting behavior immediately, and facilitating long-term skill acquisition. However, analyzing and quantifying this feedback is challenging due to its unstructured and specialized nature. Automated systems are essential to manage these complexities at scale, allowing for the creation of structured datasets that enhance feedback analysis and improve surgical education. Our framework integrates voice activity detection, speaker diarization, and automated speech recaognition, with a novel enhancement that 1) removes hallucinations (non-existent utterances generated during speech recognition fueled by noise in the operating room) and 2) separates speech from trainers and trainees using few-shot voice samples. These aspects are vital for reconstructing accurate surgical dialogues and understanding the roles of operating room participants. Using data from 33 real-world surgeries, we demonstrated the system's capability to reconstruct surgical teaching dialogues and detect feedback instances effectively (F1 score of 0.79+/-0.07). Moreover, our hallucination removal step improves feedback detection performance by ~14%. Evaluation on downstream clinically relevant tasks of predicting Behavioral Adjustment of trainees and classifying Technical feedback, showed performances comparable to manual annotations with F1 scores of 0.82+/0.03 and 0.81+/0.03 respectively. These results highlight the effectiveness of our framework in supporting clinically relevant tasks and improving over manual methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine unlearning is gaining increasing attention as a way to remove adversarial data poisoning attacks from already trained models and to comply with privacy and AI regulations. The objective is to unlearn the effect of undesired data from a trained model while maintaining performance on the remaining data. This paper introduces HyperForget, a novel machine unlearning framework that leverages hypernetworks - neural networks that generate parameters for other networks - to dynamically sample models that lack knowledge of targeted data while preserving essential capabilities. Leveraging diffusion models, we implement two Diffusion HyperForget Networks and used them to sample unlearned models in Proof-of-Concept experiments. The unlearned models obtained zero accuracy on the forget set, while preserving good accuracy on the retain sets, highlighting the potential of HyperForget for dynamic targeted data removal and a promising direction for developing adaptive machine unlearning algorithms.</description>

      <title>PGSO: Prompt-based Generative Sequence Optimization Network for Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, generative pre-training based models have demonstrated remarkable results on Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) task. However, previous works overemphasize crafting various templates to paraphrase training targets for enhanced decoding, ignoring the internal optimizations on generative models. Despite notable results achieved by these target-oriented optimization methods, they struggle with the complicated long texts since the implicit long-distance relation, e.g., aspect-opinion relation, is difficult to extract under the position embedding mechanism in generative models. Thus, in this paper, we first clarify the causes of the problem and introduce two sequence optimization strategies: the rule-based static optimization and the score-based dynamic optimization. The rule-based approach relies on handcraft priority of dependency relation to reorder the context, while the score-based algorithm dynamically regulates the contextual sequence by calculating word position scores using neural network. Based on the dynamic optimization structure, we further propose a unified Prompt-based Generative Sequence Optimization network (named PGSO), which jointly optimizes the training target as well as the generative model. Specifically, PGSO contains two components, namely, prompt construction and sequence regulator. The former constructs a task-specific prompt based on unsupervised training objects to fully utilize the pre-trained model. The latter jointly leverages semantic, syntactic and original-sequence information to dynamically regulate contextual sequence. Our experiments conducted on four ABSA tasks across multiple benchmarks indicate that PGSO outperforms state-of-the-art methods, with an average improvement of 3.52% in F1 score.</description>

      <title>SelfPrompt: Autonomously Evaluating LLM Robustness via Domain-Constrained Knowledge Guidelines and Refined Adversarial Prompts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional methods for evaluating the robustness of large language models (LLMs) often rely on standardized benchmarks, which can escalate costs and limit evaluations across varied domains. This paper introduces a novel framework designed to autonomously evaluate the robustness of LLMs by incorporating refined adversarial prompts and domain-constrained knowledge guidelines in the form of knowledge graphs. Our method systematically generates descriptive sentences from domain-constrained knowledge graph triplets to formulate adversarial prompts, enhancing the relevance and challenge of the evaluation. These prompts, generated by the LLM itself and tailored to evaluate its own robustness, undergo a rigorous filtering and refinement process, ensuring that only those with high textual fluency and semantic fidelity are used. This self-evaluation mechanism allows the LLM to evaluate its robustness without the need for external benchmarks. We assess the effectiveness of our framework through extensive testing on both proprietary models like ChatGPT and open-source models such as Llama-3.1, Phi-3, and Mistral. Results confirm that our approach not only reduces dependency on conventional data but also provides a targeted and efficient means of evaluating LLM robustness in constrained domains.</description>

      <title>A Wave is Worth 100 Words: Investigating Cross-Domain Transferability in Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time series analysis is a fundamental data mining task that supervised training methods based on empirical risk minimization have proven their effectiveness on specific tasks and datasets. However, the acquisition of well-annotated data is costly and a large amount of unlabeled series data is under-utilized. Due to distributional shifts across various domains and different patterns of interest across multiple tasks. The problem of cross-domain multi-task migration of time series remains a significant challenge. To address these problems, this paper proposes a novel cross-domain pretraining method based on Wave Quantization (termed as WQ4TS), which can be combined with any advanced time series model and applied to multiple downstream tasks. Specifically, we transfer the time series data from different domains into a common spectral latent space, and enable the model to learn the temporal pattern knowledge of different domains directly from the common space and utilize it for the inference of downstream tasks, thereby mitigating the challenge of heterogeneous cross-domains migration. The establishment of spectral latent space brings at least three benefits, cross-domain migration capability thus adapting to zero- and few-shot scenarios without relying on priori knowledge of the dataset, general compatible cross-domain migration framework without changing the existing model structure, and robust modeling capability thus achieving SOTA results in multiple downstream tasks. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we conduct extensive experiments including three important tasks: forecasting, imputation, and classification. And three common real-world data scenarios are simulated: full-data, few-shot, and zero-shot. The proposed WQ4TS achieves the best performance on 87.5% of all tasks, and the average improvement of the metrics on all the tasks is up to 34.7%.</description>

      <title>DIVD: Deblurring with Improved Video Diffusion Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Video deblurring presents a considerable challenge owing to the complexity of blur, which frequently results from a combination of camera shakes, and object motions. In the field of video deblurring, many previous works have primarily concentrated on distortion-based metrics, such as PSNR. However, this approach often results in a weak correlation with human perception and yields reconstructions that lack realism. Diffusion models and video diffusion models have respectively excelled in the fields of image and video generation, particularly achieving remarkable results in terms of image authenticity and realistic perception. However, due to the computational complexity and challenges inherent in adapting diffusion models, there is still uncertainty regarding the potential of video diffusion models in video deblurring tasks. To explore the viability of video diffusion models in the task of video deblurring, we introduce a diffusion model specifically for this purpose. In this field, leveraging highly correlated information between adjacent frames and addressing the challenge of temporal misalignment are crucial research directions. To tackle these challenges, many improvements based on the video diffusion model are introduced in this work. As a result, our model outperforms existing models and achieves state-of-the-art results on a range of perceptual metrics. Our model preserves a significant amount of detail in the images while maintaining competitive distortion metrics. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first time the diffusion model has been applied in video deblurring to overcome the limitations mentioned above.</description>

      <title>Local vs. Global: Local Land-Use and Land-Cover Models Deliver Higher Quality Maps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Approximately 20% of Africa's population suffered from undernourishment, and 868 million people experienced moderate to severe food insecurity in 2022. Land-use and land-cover maps provide crucial insights for addressing food insecurity, e.g., by mapping croplands. The development of global land-cover maps has been facilitated by the increasing availability of earth observation data and advancements in geospatial machine learning. However, these global maps exhibit lower accuracy and inconsistencies in Africa, partly due to the lack of representative training data. To address this issue, we propose a data-centric framework with a teacher-student model setup, which uses diverse data sources of satellite images and label examples to produce local land-cover maps. Our method trains a high-resolution teacher model on images with a resolution of 0.331 m/pixel and a low-resolution student model on publicly available images with a resolution of 10 m/pixel. The student model also utilizes the teacher model's output as its weak label examples through knowledge distillation. We evaluated our framework using Murang'a County, Kenya, as a use case and achieved significant improvements, i.e., 0.14 in the F1 score and 0.21 in Intersection-over-Union, compared to the best global map. Our evaluation also revealed inconsistencies in existing global maps, with a maximum agreement rate of 0.30 among themselves. Insights obtained from our cross-collaborative work can provide valuable guidance to local and national policymakers in making informed decisions to improve resource utilization and food security.</description>

      <title>TSUBF-Net: Trans-Spatial UNet-like Network with Bi-direction Fusion for Segmentation of Adenoid Hypertrophy in CT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adenoid hypertrophy stands as a common cause of obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome in children. It is characterized by snoring, nasal congestion, and growth disorders. Computed Tomography (CT) emerges as a pivotal medical imaging modality, utilizing X-rays and advanced computational techniques to generate detailed cross-sectional images. Within the realm of pediatric airway assessments, CT imaging provides an insightful perspective on the shape and volume of enlarged adenoids. Despite the advances of deep learning methods for medical imaging analysis, there remains an emptiness in the segmentation of adenoid hypertrophy in CT scans. To address this research gap, we introduce TSUBF-Nett (Trans-Spatial UNet-like Network based on Bi-direction Fusion), a 3D medical image segmentation framework. TSUBF-Net is engineered to effectively discern intricate 3D spatial interlayer features in CT scans and enhance the extraction of boundary-blurring features. Notably, we propose two innovative modules within the U-shaped network architecture:the Trans-Spatial Perception module (TSP) and the Bi-directional Sampling Collaborated Fusion module (BSCF).These two modules are in charge of operating during the sampling process and strategically fusing down-sampled and up-sampled features, respectively. Furthermore, we introduce the Sobel loss term, which optimizes the smoothness of the segmentation results and enhances model accuracy. Extensive 3D segmentation experiments are conducted on several datasets. TSUBF-Net is superior to the state-of-the-art methods with the lowest HD95: 7.03, IoU:85.63, and DSC: 92.26 on our own AHSD dataset. The results in the other two public datasets also demonstrate that our methods can robustly and effectively address the challenges of 3D segmentation in CT scans.</description>

      <title>A Cognac shot to forget bad memories: Corrective Unlearning in GNNs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are increasingly being used for a variety of ML applications on graph data. As graph data does not follow the independently and identically distributed (i.i.d) assumption, adversarial manipulations or incorrect data can propagate to other data points through message passing, deteriorating the model's performance. To allow model developers to remove the adverse effects of manipulated entities from a trained GNN, we study the recently formulated problem of Corrective Unlearning. We find that current graph unlearning methods fail to unlearn the effect of manipulations even when the whole manipulated set is known. We introduce a new graph unlearning method, Cognac, which can unlearn the effect of the manipulation set even when only 5% of it is identified. It recovers most of the performance of a strong oracle with fully corrected training data, even beating retraining from scratch without the deletion set while being 8x more efficient. We hope our work guides GNN developers in fixing harmful effects due to issues in real-world data post-training.</description>

      <title>Generative Model for Synthesizing Ionizable Lipids: A Monte Carlo Tree Search Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ionizable lipids are essential in developing lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) for effective messenger RNA (mRNA) delivery. While traditional methods for designing new ionizable lipids are typically time-consuming, deep generative models have emerged as a powerful solution, significantly accelerating the molecular discovery process. However, a practical challenge arises as the molecular structures generated can often be difficult or infeasible to synthesize. This project explores Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS)-based generative models for synthesizable ionizable lipids. Leveraging a synthetically accessible lipid building block dataset and two specialized predictors to guide the search through chemical space, we introduce a policy network guided MCTS generative model capable of producing new ionizable lipids with available synthesis pathways.</description>

      <title>AlignMamba: Enhancing Multimodal Mamba with Local and Global Cross-modal Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cross-modal alignment is crucial for multimodal representation fusion due to the inherent heterogeneity between modalities. While Transformer-based methods have shown promising results in modeling inter-modal relationships, their quadratic computational complexity limits their applicability to long-sequence or large-scale data. Although recent Mamba-based approaches achieve linear complexity, their sequential scanning mechanism poses fundamental challenges in comprehensively modeling cross-modal relationships. To address this limitation, we propose AlignMamba, an efficient and effective method for multimodal fusion. Specifically, grounded in Optimal Transport, we introduce a local cross-modal alignment module that explicitly learns token-level correspondences between different modalities. Moreover, we propose a global cross-modal alignment loss based on Maximum Mean Discrepancy to implicitly enforce the consistency between different modal distributions. Finally, the unimodal representations after local and global alignment are passed to the Mamba backbone for further cross-modal interaction and multimodal fusion. Extensive experiments on complete and incomplete multimodal fusion tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to formalise the task of continual semi-supervised anomaly detection (CSAD), with the aim of highlighting the importance of such a problem formulation which assumes as close to real-world conditions as possible. After an overview of the relevant definitions of continual semi-supervised learning, its components, anomaly detection extension, and the training protocols; the paper introduces a baseline model of a variational autoencoder (VAE) to work with semi-supervised data along with a continual learning method of deep generative replay with outlier rejection. The results show that such a use of extreme value theory (EVT) applied to anomaly detection can provide promising results even in comparison to an upper baseline of joint training. The results explore the effects of how much labelled and unlabelled data is present, of which class, and where it is located in the data stream. Outlier rejection shows promising initial results where it often surpasses a baseline method of Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC). A baseline for CSAD is put forward along with the specific dataset setups used for reproducability and testability for other practitioners. Future research directions include other CSAD settings and further research into efficient continual hyperparameter tuning.</description>

      <title>Explicit and data-Efficient Encoding via Gradient Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The autoencoder model typically uses an encoder to map data to a lower dimensional latent space and a decoder to reconstruct it. However, relying on an encoder for inversion can lead to suboptimal representations, particularly limiting in physical sciences where precision is key. We introduce a decoder-only method using gradient flow to directly encode data into the latent space, defined by ordinary differential equations (ODEs). This approach eliminates the need for approximate encoder inversion. We train the decoder via the adjoint method and show that costly integrals can be avoided with minimal accuracy loss. Additionally, we propose a $2^{nd}$ order ODE variant, approximating Nesterov's accelerated gradient descent for faster convergence. To handle stiff ODEs, we use an adaptive solver that prioritizes loss minimization, improving robustness. Compared to traditional autoencoders, our method demonstrates explicit encoding and superior data efficiency, which is crucial for data-scarce scenarios in the physical sciences. Furthermore, this work paves the way for integrating machine learning into scientific workflows, where precise and efficient encoding is critical. \footnote{The code for this work is available at \url{https://github.com/k-flouris/gfe}.}</description>

      <title>Exploring the Abilities of Large Language Models to Solve Proportional Analogies via Knowledge-Enhanced Prompting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Making analogies is fundamental to cognition. Proportional analogies, which consist of four terms, are often used to assess linguistic and cognitive abilities. For instance, completing analogies like "Oxygen is to Gas as &lt;blank&gt; is to &lt;blank&gt;" requires identifying the semantic relationship (e.g., "type of") between the first pair of terms ("Oxygen" and "Gas") and finding a second pair that shares the same relationship (e.g., "Aluminum" and "Metal"). In this work, we introduce a 15K Multiple-Choice Question Answering (MCQA) dataset for proportional analogy completion and evaluate the performance of contemporary Large Language Models (LLMs) in various knowledge-enhanced prompt settings. Specifically, we augment prompts with three types of knowledge: exemplar, structured, and targeted. Our results show that despite extensive training data, solving proportional analogies remains challenging for current LLMs, with the best model achieving an accuracy of 55%. Notably, we find that providing targeted knowledge can better assist models in completing proportional analogies compared to providing exemplars or collections of structured knowledge.</description>

      <title>Dynamic-LLaVA: Efficient Multimodal Large Language Models via Dynamic Vision-language Context Sparsification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable success in vision understanding, reasoning, and interaction. However, the inference computation and memory increase progressively with the generation of output tokens during decoding, directly affecting the efficacy of MLLMs. Existing methods attempt to reduce the vision context redundancy to achieve efficient MLLMs. Unfortunately, the efficiency benefits of the vision context reduction in the prefill stage gradually diminish during the decoding stage. To address this problem, we proposed a dynamic vision-language context sparsification framework Dynamic-LLaVA, which dynamically reduces the redundancy of vision context in the prefill stage and decreases the memory and computation overhead of the generated language context during decoding. Dynamic-LLaVA designs a tailored sparsification inference scheme for different inference modes, i.e., prefill, decoding with and without KV cache, to achieve efficient inference of MLLMs. In practice, Dynamic-LLaVA can reduce computation consumption by $\sim$75\% in the prefill stage. Meanwhile, throughout the entire generation process of MLLMs, Dynamic-LLaVA reduces the $\sim$50\% computation consumption under decoding without KV cache, while saving $\sim$50\% GPU memory overhead when decoding with KV cache, due to the vision-language context sparsification. Extensive experiments also demonstrate that Dynamic-LLaVA achieves efficient inference for MLLMs with negligible understanding and generation ability degradation or even performance gains compared to the full-context inference baselines.

      <title>A Deep Generative Model for the Design of Synthesizable Ionizable Lipids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are vital in modern biomedicine, enabling the effective delivery of mRNA for vaccines and therapies by protecting it from rapid degradation. Among the components of LNPs, ionizable lipids play a key role in RNA protection and facilitate its delivery into the cytoplasm. However, designing ionizable lipids is complex. Deep generative models can accelerate this process and explore a larger candidate space compared to traditional methods. Due to the structural differences between lipids and small molecules, existing generative models used for small molecule generation are unsuitable for lipid generation. To address this, we developed a deep generative model specifically tailored for the discovery of ionizable lipids. Our model generates novel ionizable lipid structures and provides synthesis paths using synthetically accessible building blocks, addressing synthesizability. This advancement holds promise for streamlining the development of lipid-based delivery systems, potentially accelerating the deployment of new therapeutic agents, including mRNA vaccines and gene therapies.</description>

      <title>Bilinear Convolution Decomposition for Causal RL Interpretability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efforts to interpret reinforcement learning (RL) models often rely on high-level techniques such as attribution or probing, which provide only correlational insights and coarse causal control. This work proposes replacing nonlinearities in convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) with bilinear variants, to produce a class of models for which these limitations can be addressed. We show bilinear model variants perform comparably in model-free reinforcement learning settings, and give a side by side comparison on ProcGen environments. Bilinear layers' analytic structure enables weight-based decomposition. Previous work has shown bilinearity enables quantifying functional importance through eigendecomposition, to identify interpretable low rank structure. We show how to adapt the decomposition to convolution layers by applying singular value decomposition to vectors of interest, to separate the channel and spatial dimensions. Finally, we propose a methodology for causally validating concept-based probes, and illustrate its utility by studying a maze-solving agent's ability to track a cheese object.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, the STEVE-1 approach has been introduced as a method for training generative agents to follow instructions in the form of latent CLIP embeddings. In this work, we present a methodology to extend the control modalities by learning a mapping from new input modalities to the latent goal space of the agent. We apply our approach to the challenging Minecraft domain, and extend the goal conditioning to include the audio modality. The resulting audio-conditioned agent is able to perform on a comparable level to the original text-conditioned and visual-conditioned agents. Specifically, we create an Audio-Video CLIP foundation model for Minecraft and an audio prior network which together map audio samples to the latent goal space of the STEVE-1 policy. Additionally, we highlight the tradeoffs that occur when conditioning on different modalities. Our training code, evaluation code, and Audio-Video CLIP foundation model for Minecraft are made open-source to help foster further research into multi-modal generalist sequential decision-making agents.</description>

Abstract: Traditional language models have been extensively evaluated for software engineering domain, however the potential of ChatGPT and Gemini have not been fully explored. To fulfill this gap, the paper in hand presents a comprehensive case study to investigate the potential of both language models for development of diverse types of requirement engineering applications. It deeply explores impact of varying levels of expert knowledge prompts on the prediction accuracies of both language models. Across 4 different public benchmark datasets of requirement engineering tasks, it compares performance of both language models with existing task specific machine/deep learning predictors and traditional language models. Specifically, the paper utilizes 4 benchmark datasets; Pure (7,445 samples, requirements extraction),PROMISE (622 samples, requirements classification), REQuestA (300 question answer (QA) pairs) and Aerospace datasets (6347 words, requirements NER tagging). Our experiments reveal that, in comparison to ChatGPT, Gemini requires more careful prompt engineering to provide accurate predictions. Moreover, across requirement extraction benchmark dataset the state-of-the-art F1-score is 0.86 while ChatGPT and Gemini achieved 0.76 and 0.77,respectively. The State-of-the-art F1-score on requirements classification dataset is 0.96 and both language models 0.78. In name entity recognition (NER) task the state-of-the-art F1-score is 0.92 and ChatGPT managed to produce 0.36, and Gemini 0.25. Similarly, across question answering dataset the state-of-the-art F1-score is 0.90 and ChatGPT and Gemini managed to produce 0.91 and 0.88 respectively. Our experiments show that Gemini requires more precise prompt engineering than ChatGPT. Except for question-answering, both models under-perform compared to current state-of-the-art predictors across other tasks.</description>

      <title>DSSRNN: Decomposition-Enhanced State-Space Recurrent Neural Network for Time-Series Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time series forecasting is a crucial yet challenging task in machine learning, requiring domain-specific knowledge due to its wide-ranging applications. While recent Transformer models have improved forecasting capabilities, they come with high computational costs. Linear-based models have shown better accuracy than Transformers but still fall short of ideal performance. To address these challenges, we introduce the Decomposition State-Space Recurrent Neural Network (DSSRNN), a novel framework designed for both long-term and short-term time series forecasting. DSSRNN uniquely combines decomposition analysis to capture seasonal and trend components with state-space models and physics-based equations. We evaluate DSSRNN's performance on indoor air quality datasets, focusing on CO2 concentration prediction across various forecasting horizons. Results demonstrate that DSSRNN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models, including transformer-based architectures, in terms of both Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). For example, at the shortest horizon (T=96) in Office 1, DSSRNN achieved an MSE of 0.378 and an MAE of 0.401, significantly lower than competing models. Additionally, DSSRNN exhibits superior computational efficiency compared to more complex models. While not as lightweight as the DLinear model, DSSRNN achieves a balance between performance and efficiency, with only 0.11G MACs and 437MiB memory usage, and an inference time of 0.58ms for long-term forecasting. This work not only showcases DSSRNN's success but also establishes a new benchmark for physics-informed machine learning in environmental forecasting and potentially other domains.</description>

      <title>Detecting Memorization in Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive results in natural language processing but are prone to memorizing portions of their training data, which can compromise evaluation metrics, raise privacy concerns, and limit generalization. Traditional methods for detecting memorization rely on output probabilities or loss functions, often lacking precision due to confounding factors like common language patterns. In this paper, we introduce an analytical method that precisely detects memorization by examining neuron activations within the LLM. By identifying specific activation patterns that differentiate between memorized and not memorized tokens, we train classification probes that achieve near-perfect accuracy. The approach can also be applied to other mechanisms, such as repetition, as demonstrated in this study, highlighting its versatility. Intervening on these activations allows us to suppress memorization without degrading overall performance, enhancing evaluation integrity by ensuring metrics reflect genuine generalization. Additionally, our method supports large-scale labeling of tokens and sequences, crucial for next-generation AI models, improving training efficiency and results. Our findings contribute to model interpretability and offer practical tools for analyzing and controlling internal mechanisms in LLMs.</description>

Their complex architecture poses challenges throughout the entire AI lifecycle, from data collection to deployment and monitoring \cite{OECD_AIlifecycle}. Addressing critical AI system challenges, such as explainability, corrigibility, interpretability, and hallucination, necessitates a systematic methodology and rigorous benchmarking \cite{guldimann2024complai}. To effectively improve AI systems, we must precisely identify systemic vulnerabilities through quantitative evaluation, bolstering system trustworthiness. The enactment of the EU AI Act \cite{EUAIAct} by the European Parliament on March 13, 2024, establishing the first comprehensive EU-wide requirements for the development, deployment, and use of AI systems, further underscores the importance of tools and methodologies such as Z-Inspection. It highlights the need to enrich this methodology with practical benchmarks to effectively address the technical challenges posed by AI systems. To this end, we have launched a project that is part of the AI Safety Bulgaria initiatives \cite{AI_Safety_Bulgaria}, aimed at collecting and categorizing AI benchmarks. This will enable practitioners to identify and utilize these benchmarks throughout the AI system lifecycle.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Automated Radiology Report Quality through Fine-Grained Phrasal Grounding of Clinical Findings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Several evaluation metrics have been developed recently to automatically assess the quality of generative AI reports for chest radiographs based only on textual information using lexical, semantic, or clinical named entity recognition methods. In this paper, we develop a new method of report quality evaluation by first extracting fine-grained finding patterns capturing the location, laterality, and severity of a large number of clinical findings. We then performed phrasal grounding to localize their associated anatomical regions on chest radiograph images. The textual and visual measures are then combined to rate the quality of the generated reports. We present results that compare this evaluation metric with other textual metrics on a gold standard dataset derived from the MIMIC collection and show its robustness and sensitivity to factual errors.</description>

      <title>FLOAT: Generative Motion Latent Flow Matching for Audio-driven Talking Portrait</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of diffusion-based generative models, portrait image animation has achieved remarkable results. However, it still faces challenges in temporally consistent video generation and fast sampling due to its iterative sampling nature. This paper presents FLOAT, an audio-driven talking portrait video generation method based on flow matching generative model. We shift the generative modeling from the pixel-based latent space to a learned motion latent space, enabling efficient design of temporally consistent motion. To achieve this, we introduce a transformer-based vector field predictor with a simple yet effective frame-wise conditioning mechanism. Additionally, our method supports speech-driven emotion enhancement, enabling a natural incorporation of expressive motions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art audio-driven talking portrait methods in terms of visual quality, motion fidelity, and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Lookahead Counterfactual Fairness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As machine learning (ML) algorithms are used in applications that involve humans, concerns have arisen that these algorithms may be biased against certain social groups. \textit{Counterfactual fairness} (CF) is a fairness notion proposed in Kusner et al. (2017) that measures the unfairness of ML predictions; it requires that the prediction perceived by an individual in the real world has the same marginal distribution as it would be in a counterfactual world, in which the individual belongs to a different group. Although CF ensures fair ML predictions, it fails to consider the downstream effects of ML predictions on individuals. Since humans are strategic and often adapt their behaviors in response to the ML system, predictions that satisfy CF may not lead to a fair future outcome for the individuals. In this paper, we introduce \textit{lookahead counterfactual fairness} (LCF), a fairness notion accounting for the downstream effects of ML models which requires the individual \textit{future status} to be counterfactually fair. We theoretically identify conditions under which LCF can be satisfied and propose an algorithm based on the theorems. We also extend the concept to path-dependent fairness. Experiments on both synthetic and real data validate the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning for Distributed and Autonomous Platoon Coordination via Speed-regulation over Large-scale Transportation Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Truck platooning technology enables a group of trucks to travel closely together, with which the platoon can save fuel, improve traffic flow efficiency, and improve safety. In this paper, we consider the platoon coordination problem in a large-scale transportation network, to promote cooperation among trucks and optimize the overall efficiency. Involving the regulation of both speed and departure times at hubs, we formulate the coordination problem as a complicated dynamic stochastic integer programming under network and information constraints. To get an autonomous, distributed, and robust platoon coordination policy, we formulate the problem into a model of the Decentralized-Partial Observable Markov Decision Process. Then, we propose a Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning framework named Trcuk Attention-QMIX (TA-QMIX) to train an efficient online decision policy. TA-QMIX utilizes the attention mechanism to enhance the representation of truck fuel gains and delay times, and provides explicit truck cooperation information during the training process, promoting trucks' willingness to cooperate. The training framework adopts centralized training and distributed execution, thus training a policy for trucks to make decisions online using only nearby information. Hence, the policy can be autonomously executed on a large-scale network. Finally, we perform comparison experiments and ablation experiments in the transportation network of the Yangtze River Delta region in China to verify the effectiveness of the proposed framework. In a repeated comparative experiment with 5,000 trucks, our method average saves 19.17\% of fuel with an average delay of only 9.57 minutes per truck and a decision time of 0.001 seconds.</description>

      <title>Advancing Speech Language Models by Scaling Supervised Fine-Tuning with Over 60,000 Hours of Synthetic Speech Dialogue Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The GPT-4o represents a significant milestone in enabling real-time interaction with large language models (LLMs) through speech, its remarkable low latency and high fluency not only capture attention but also stimulate research interest in the field. This real-time speech interaction is particularly valuable in scenarios requiring rapid feedback and immediate responses, dramatically enhancing user experience. However, there is a notable lack of research focused on real-time large speech language models, particularly for Chinese. In this work, we present KE-Omni, a seamless large speech language model built upon Ke-SpeechChat, a large-scale high-quality synthetic speech interaction dataset consisting of 7 million Chinese and English conversations, featuring 42,002 speakers, and totaling over 60,000 hours, This contributes significantly to the advancement of research and development in this field. The model, dataset, code and demo can be accessed at \url{https://huggingface.co/spaces/KE-Team/KE-Omni}.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Evolutionary Approach for Multi Robot Coordinated Planning at Intersections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coordinated multi-robot motion planning at intersections is key for safe mobility in roads, factories and warehouses. The rapidly exploring random tree (RRT) algorithms are popular in multi-robot motion planning. However, generating the graph configuration space and searching in the composite tensor configuration space is computationally expensive for large number of sample points. In this paper, we propose a new evolutionary-based algorithm using a parametric lattice-based configuration and the discrete-based RRT for collision-free multi-robot planning at intersections. Our computational experiments using complex planning intersection scenarios have shown the feasibility and the superiority of the proposed algorithm compared to seven other related approaches. Our results offer new sampling and representation mechanisms to render optimization-based approaches for multi-robot navigation.</description>

      <title>Object Tracking in a $360^o$ View: A Novel Perspective on Bridging the Gap to Biomedical Advancements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Object tracking is a fundamental tool in modern innovation, with applications in defense systems, autonomous vehicles, and biomedical research. It enables precise identification, monitoring, and spatiotemporal analysis of objects across sequential frames, providing insights into dynamic behaviors. In cell biology, object tracking is vital for uncovering cellular mechanisms, such as migration, interactions, and responses to drugs or pathogens. These insights drive breakthroughs in understanding disease progression and therapeutic interventions.
  Over time, object tracking methods have evolved from traditional feature-based approaches to advanced machine learning and deep learning frameworks. While classical methods are reliable in controlled settings, they struggle in complex environments with occlusions, variable lighting, and high object density. Deep learning models address these challenges by delivering greater accuracy, adaptability, and robustness.
  This review categorizes object tracking techniques into traditional, statistical, feature-based, and machine learning paradigms, with a focus on biomedical applications. These methods are essential for tracking cells and subcellular structures, advancing our understanding of health and disease. Key performance metrics, including accuracy, efficiency, and adaptability, are discussed. The paper explores limitations of current methods and highlights emerging trends to guide the development of next-generation tracking systems for biomedical research and broader scientific domains.</description>

      <title>RILQ: Rank-Insensitive LoRA-based Quantization Error Compensation for Boosting 2-bit Large Language Model Accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) has become the dominant method for parameter-efficient LLM fine-tuning, with LoRA-based quantization error compensation (LQEC) emerging as a powerful tool for recovering accuracy in compressed LLMs. However, LQEC has underperformed in sub-4-bit scenarios, with no prior investigation into understanding this limitation. We propose RILQ (Rank-Insensitive LoRA-based Quantization Error Compensation) to understand fundamental limitation and boost 2-bit LLM accuracy. Based on rank analysis revealing model-wise activation discrepancy loss's rank-insensitive nature, RILQ employs this loss to adjust adapters cooperatively across layers, enabling robust error compensation with low-rank adapters. Evaluations on LLaMA-2 and LLaMA-3 demonstrate RILQ's consistent improvements in 2-bit quantized inference across various state-of-the-art quantizers and enhanced accuracy in task-specific fine-tuning. RILQ maintains computational efficiency comparable to existing LoRA methods, enabling adapter-merged weight-quantized LLM inference with significantly enhanced accuracy, making it a promising approach for boosting 2-bit LLM performance.</description>

      <title>Representation Learning for Time-Domain High-Energy Astrophysics: Discovery of Extragalactic Fast X-ray Transient XRT 200515</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel representation learning method for downstream tasks such as anomaly detection and unsupervised transient classification in high-energy datasets. This approach enabled the discovery of a new fast X-ray transient (FXT) in the Chandra archive, XRT 200515, a needle-in-the-haystack event and the first Chandra FXT of its kind. Recent serendipitous breakthroughs in X-ray astronomy, including FXTs from binary neutron star mergers and an extragalactic planetary transit candidate, highlight the need for systematic transient searches in X-ray archives. We introduce new event file representations, E-t Maps and E-t-dt Cubes, designed to capture both temporal and spectral information, effectively addressing the challenges posed by variable-length event file time series in machine learning applications. Our pipeline extracts low-dimensional, informative features from these representations using principal component analysis or sparse autoencoders, followed by clustering in the embedding space with DBSCAN. New transients are identified within transient-dominant clusters or through nearest-neighbor searches around known transients, producing a catalog of 3,539 candidates (3,427 flares and 112 dips). XRT 200515 exhibits unique temporal and spectral variability, including an intense, hard &lt;10 s initial burst followed by spectral softening in an ~800 s oscillating tail. We interpret XRT 200515 as either the first giant magnetar flare observed at low X-ray energies or the first extragalactic Type I X-ray burst from a faint LMXB in the LMC. Our method extends to datasets from other observatories such as XMM-Newton, Swift-XRT, eROSITA, Einstein Probe, and upcoming missions like AXIS.</description>

      <title>R.I.P.: A Simple Black-box Attack on Continual Test-time Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) has emerged as a promising solution to tackle the continual domain shift in machine learning by allowing model parameters to change at test time, via self-supervised learning on unlabeled testing data. At the same time, it unfortunately opens the door to unforeseen vulnerabilities for degradation over time. Through a simple theoretical continual TTA model, we successfully identify a risk in the sampling process of testing data that could easily degrade the performance of a continual TTA model. We name this risk as Reusing of Incorrect Prediction (RIP) that TTA attackers can employ or as a result of the unintended query from general TTA users. The risk posed by RIP is also highly realistic, as it does not require prior knowledge of model parameters or modification of testing samples. This simple requirement makes RIP as the first black-box TTA attack algorithm that stands out from existing white-box attempts. We extensively benchmark the performance of the most recent continual TTA approaches when facing the RIP attack, providing insights on its success, and laying out potential roadmaps that could enhance the resilience of future continual TTA systems.</description>

      <title>Object Agnostic 3D Lifting in Space and Time</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a spatio-temporal perspective on category-agnostic 3D lifting of 2D keypoints over a temporal sequence. Our approach differs from existing state-of-the-art methods that are either: (i) object agnostic, but can only operate on individual frames, or (ii) can model space-time dependencies, but are only designed to work with a single object category. Our approach is grounded in two core principles. First, when there is a lack of data about an object, general information from similar objects can be leveraged for better performance. Second, while temporal information is important, the most critical information is in immediate temporal proximity. These two principles allow us to outperform current state-of-the-art methods on per-frame and per-sequence metrics for a variety of objects. Lastly, we release a new synthetic dataset containing 3D skeletons and motion sequences of a diverse set animals. Dataset and code will be made publicly available.</description>

      <title>OBI-Bench: Can LMMs Aid in Study of Ancient Script on Oracle Bones?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce OBI-Bench, a holistic benchmark crafted to systematically evaluate large multi-modal models (LMMs) on whole-process oracle bone inscriptions (OBI) processing tasks demanding expert-level domain knowledge and deliberate cognition. OBI-Bench includes 5,523 meticulously collected diverse-sourced images, covering five key domain problems: recognition, rejoining, classification, retrieval, and deciphering. These images span centuries of archaeological findings and years of research by front-line scholars, comprising multi-stage font appearances from excavation to synthesis, such as original oracle bone, inked rubbings, oracle bone fragments, cropped single character, and handprinted character. Unlike existing benchmarks, OBI-Bench focuses on advanced visual perception and reasoning with OBI-specific knowledge, challenging LMMs to perform tasks akin to those faced by experts. The evaluation of 6 proprietary LMMs as well as 17 open-source LMMs highlights the substantial challenges and demands posed by OBI-Bench. Even the latest versions of GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Qwen-VL-Max are still far from public-level humans in some fine-grained perception tasks. However, they perform at a level comparable to untrained humans in deciphering task, indicating remarkable capabilities in offering new interpretative perspectives and generating creative guesses. We hope OBI-Bench can facilitate the community to develop domain-specific multi-modal foundation models towards ancient language research and delve deeper to discover and enhance these untapped potentials of LMMs.</description>

      <title>Training Stiff Neural Ordinary Differential Equations with Explicit Exponential Integration Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stiff ordinary differential equations (ODEs) are common in many science and engineering fields, but standard neural ODE approaches struggle to accurately learn these stiff systems, posing a significant barrier to widespread adoption of neural ODEs. In our earlier work, we addressed this challenge by utilizing single-step implicit methods for solving stiff neural ODEs. While effective, these implicit methods are computationally costly and can be complex to implement. This paper expands on our earlier work by exploring explicit exponential integration methods as a more efficient alternative. We evaluate the potential of these explicit methods to handle stiff dynamics in neural ODEs, aiming to enhance their applicability to a broader range of scientific and engineering problems. We found the integrating factor Euler (IF Euler) method to excel in stability and efficiency. While implicit schemes failed to train the stiff Van der Pol oscillator, the IF Euler method succeeded, even with large step sizes. However, IF Euler's first-order accuracy limits its use, leaving the development of higher-order methods for stiff neural ODEs an open research problem.</description>

Abstract: 3D semantic maps have played an increasingly important role in high-precision robot localization and scene understanding. However, real-time construction of semantic maps requires mobile edge devices with extremely high computing power, which are expensive and limit the widespread application of semantic mapping. In order to address this limitation, inspired by cloud-edge collaborative computing and the high transmission efficiency of semantic communication, this paper proposes a method to achieve real-time semantic mapping tasks with limited-resource mobile devices. Specifically, we design an encoding-decoding semantic communication framework for real-time semantic mapping tasks under limited-resource situations. In addition, considering the impact of different channel conditions on communication, this paper designs a module based on the attention mechanism to achieve stable data transmission under various channel conditions. In terms of simulation experiments, based on the TUM dataset, it was verified that the system has an error of less than 0.1% compared to the groundtruth in mapping and localization accuracy and is superior to some novel semantic communication algorithms in real-time performance and channel adaptation. Besides, we implement a prototype system to verify the effectiveness of the proposed framework and designed module in real indoor scenarios. The results show that our system can complete real-time semantic mapping tasks for common indoor objects (chairs, computers, people, etc.) with a limited-resource device, and the mapping update time is less than 1 second.</description>

      <title>Memory-Efficient Training for Deep Speaker Embedding Learning in Speaker Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent speaker verification (SV) systems have shown a trend toward adopting deeper speaker embedding extractors. Although deeper and larger neural networks can significantly improve performance, their substantial memory requirements hinder training on consumer GPUs. In this paper, we explore a memory-efficient training strategy for deep speaker embedding learning in resource-constrained scenarios. Firstly, we conduct a systematic analysis of GPU memory allocation during SV system training. Empirical observations show that activations and optimizer states are the main sources of memory consumption. For activations, we design two types of reversible neural networks which eliminate the need to store intermediate activations during back-propagation, thereby significantly reducing memory usage without performance loss. For optimizer states, we introduce a dynamic quantization approach that replaces the original 32-bit floating-point values with a dynamic tree-based 8-bit data type. Experimental results on VoxCeleb demonstrate that the reversible variants of ResNets and DF-ResNets can perform training without the need to cache activations in GPU memory. In addition, the 8-bit versions of SGD and Adam save 75% of memory costs while maintaining performance compared to their 32-bit counterparts. Finally, a detailed comparison of memory usage and performance indicates that our proposed models achieve up to 16.2x memory savings, with nearly identical parameters and performance compared to the vanilla systems. In contrast to the previous need for multiple high-end GPUs such as the A100, we can effectively train deep speaker embedding extractors with just one or two consumer-level 2080Ti GPUs.</description>

      <title>InstantSwap: Fast Customized Concept Swapping across Sharp Shape Differences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in Customized Concept Swapping (CCS) enable a text-to-image model to swap a concept in the source image with a customized target concept. However, the existing methods still face the challenges of **inconsistency** and **inefficiency**. They struggle to maintain consistency in both the foreground and background during concept swapping, especially when the shape difference is large between objects. Additionally, they either require time-consuming training processes or involve redundant calculations during inference. To tackle these issues, we introduce InstantSwap, a new CCS method that aims to handle sharp shape disparity at speed. Specifically, we first extract the bbox of the object in the source image *automatically* based on attention map analysis and leverage the bbox to achieve both foreground and background consistency. For background consistency, we remove the gradient outside the bbox during the swapping process so that the background is free from being modified. For foreground consistency, we employ a cross-attention mechanism to inject semantic information into both source and target concepts inside the box. This helps learn semantic-enhanced representations that encourage the swapping process to focus on the foreground objects. To improve swapping speed, we avoid computing gradients at each timestep but instead calculate them periodically to reduce the number of forward passes, which improves efficiency a lot with a little sacrifice on performance. Finally, we establish a benchmark dataset to facilitate comprehensive evaluation. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the superiority and versatility of InstantSwap.Project Page: https://instantswap.github.io/</description>

      <title>TinyFusion: Diffusion Transformers Learned Shallow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion Transformers have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in image generation but often come with excessive parameterization, resulting in considerable inference overhead in real-world applications. In this work, we present TinyFusion, a depth pruning method designed to remove redundant layers from diffusion transformers via end-to-end learning. The core principle of our approach is to create a pruned model with high recoverability, allowing it to regain strong performance after fine-tuning. To accomplish this, we introduce a differentiable sampling technique to make pruning learnable, paired with a co-optimized parameter to simulate future fine-tuning. While prior works focus on minimizing loss or error after pruning, our method explicitly models and optimizes the post-fine-tuning performance of pruned models. Experimental results indicate that this learnable paradigm offers substantial benefits for layer pruning of diffusion transformers, surpassing existing importance-based and error-based methods. Additionally, TinyFusion exhibits strong generalization across diverse architectures, such as DiTs, MARs, and SiTs. Experiments with DiT-XL show that TinyFusion can craft a shallow diffusion transformer at less than 7% of the pre-training cost, achieving a 2$\times$ speedup with an FID score of 2.86, outperforming competitors with comparable efficiency.

      <title>Neuron Abandoning Attention Flow: Visual Explanation of Dynamics inside CNN Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a Neuron Abandoning Attention Flow (NAFlow) method to address the open problem of visually explaining the attention evolution dynamics inside CNNs when making their classification decisions. A novel cascading neuron abandoning back-propagation algorithm is designed to trace neurons in all layers of a CNN that involve in making its prediction to address the problem of significant interference from abandoned neurons. Firstly, a Neuron Abandoning Back-Propagation (NA-BP) module is proposed to generate Back-Propagated Feature Maps (BPFM) by using the inverse function of the intermediate layers of CNN models, on which the neurons not used for decision-making are abandoned. Meanwhile, the cascading NA-BP modules calculate the tensors of importance coefficients which are linearly combined with the tensors of BPFMs to form the NAFlow. Secondly, to be able to visualize attention flow for similarity metric-based CNN models, a new channel contribution weights module is proposed to calculate the importance coefficients via Jacobian Matrix. The effectiveness of the proposed NAFlow is validated on nine widely-used CNN models for various tasks of general image classification, contrastive learning classification, few-shot image classification, and image retrieval.</description>

      <title>PainterNet: Adaptive Image Inpainting with Actual-Token Attention and Diverse Mask Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, diffusion models have exhibited superior performance in the area of image inpainting. Inpainting methods based on diffusion models can usually generate realistic, high-quality image content for masked areas. However, due to the limitations of diffusion models, existing methods typically encounter problems in terms of semantic consistency between images and text, and the editing habits of users. To address these issues, we present PainterNet, a plugin that can be flexibly embedded into various diffusion models. To generate image content in the masked areas that highly aligns with the user input prompt, we proposed local prompt input, Attention Control Points (ACP), and Actual-Token Attention Loss (ATAL) to enhance the model's focus on local areas. Additionally, we redesigned the MASK generation algorithm in training and testing dataset to simulate the user's habit of applying MASK, and introduced a customized new training dataset, PainterData, and a benchmark dataset, PainterBench. Our extensive experimental analysis exhibits that PainterNet surpasses existing state-of-the-art models in key metrics including image quality and global/local text consistency.</description>

      <title>Schedule On the Fly: Diffusion Time Prediction for Faster and Better Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion and flow models have achieved remarkable successes in various applications such as text-to-image generation. However, these models typically rely on the same predetermined denoising schedules during inference for each prompt, which potentially limits the inference efficiency as well as the flexibility when handling different prompts. In this paper, we argue that the optimal noise schedule should adapt to each inference instance, and introduce the Time Prediction Diffusion Model (TPDM) to accomplish this. TPDM employs a plug-and-play Time Prediction Module (TPM) that predicts the next noise level based on current latent features at each denoising step. We train the TPM using reinforcement learning, aiming to maximize a reward that discounts the final image quality by the number of denoising steps. With such an adaptive scheduler, TPDM not only generates high-quality images that are aligned closely with human preferences but also adjusts the number of denoising steps and time on the fly, enhancing both performance and efficiency. We train TPDMs on multiple diffusion model benchmarks. With Stable Diffusion 3 Medium architecture, TPDM achieves an aesthetic score of 5.44 and a human preference score (HPS) of 29.59, while using around 50% fewer denoising steps to achieve better performance. We will release our best model alongside this paper.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Generative Policies: A Simpler Reinforcement Learning Algorithmic Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative models, particularly diffusion models, have achieved remarkable success in density estimation for multimodal data, drawing significant interest from the reinforcement learning (RL) community, especially in policy modeling in continuous action spaces. However, existing works exhibit significant variations in training schemes and RL optimization objectives, and some methods are only applicable to diffusion models. In this study, we compare and analyze various generative policy training and deployment techniques, identifying and validating effective designs for generative policy algorithms. Specifically, we revisit existing training objectives and classify them into two categories, each linked to a simpler approach. The first approach, Generative Model Policy Optimization (GMPO), employs a native advantage-weighted regression formulation as the training objective, which is significantly simpler than previous methods. The second approach, Generative Model Policy Gradient (GMPG), offers a numerically stable implementation of the native policy gradient method. We introduce a standardized experimental framework named GenerativeRL. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed methods achieve state-of-the-art performance on various offline-RL datasets, offering a unified and practical guideline for training and deploying generative policies.</description>

      <title>Yi-Lightning Technical Report</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This technical report presents Yi-Lightning, our latest flagship large language model (LLM). It achieves exceptional performance, ranking 6th overall on Chatbot Arena, with particularly strong results (2nd to 4th place) in specialized categories including Chinese, Math, Coding, and Hard Prompts. Yi-Lightning leverages an enhanced Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, featuring advanced expert segmentation and routing mechanisms coupled with optimized KV-caching techniques. Our development process encompasses comprehensive pre-training, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), where we devise deliberate strategies for multi-stage training, synthetic data construction, and reward modeling. Furthermore, we implement RAISE (Responsible AI Safety Engine), a four-component framework to address safety issues across pre-training, post-training, and serving phases. Empowered by our scalable super-computing infrastructure, all these innovations substantially reduce training, deployment and inference costs while maintaining high-performance standards. With further evaluations on public academic benchmarks, Yi-Lightning demonstrates competitive performance against top-tier LLMs, while we observe a notable disparity between traditional, static benchmark results and real-world, dynamic human preferences. This observation prompts a critical reassessment of conventional benchmarks' utility in guiding the development of more intelligent and powerful AI systems for practical applications. Yi-Lightning is now available through our developer platform at https://platform.lingyiwanwu.com.</description>

      <title>Do Large Language Models with Reasoning and Acting Meet the Needs of Task-Oriented Dialogue?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) gained immense popularity due to their impressive capabilities in unstructured conversations. However, they underperform compared to previous approaches in task-oriented dialogue (TOD), wherein reasoning and accessing external information are crucial. Empowering LLMs with advanced prompting strategies such as reasoning and acting (ReAct) has shown promise in solving complex tasks traditionally requiring reinforcement learning. In this work, we apply the ReAct strategy to guide LLMs performing TOD. We evaluate ReAct-based LLMs (ReAct-LLMs) both in simulation and with real users. While ReAct-LLMs seem to underperform state-of-the-art approaches in simulation, human evaluation indicates higher user satisfaction rate compared to handcrafted systems despite having a lower success rate.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we design indices of economic fluctuation narratives derived from economic surveys. Companies, governments, and investors rely on key metrics like GDP and industrial production indices to predict economic trends. However, they have yet to effectively leverage the wealth of information contained in economic text, such as causal relationships, in their economic forecasting. Therefore, we design indices of economic fluctuation from economic surveys by using our previously proposed narrative framework. From the evaluation results, it is observed that the proposed indices had a stronger correlation with cumulative lagging diffusion index than other types of diffusion indices.</description>

      <title>MuLan: Adapting Multilingual Diffusion Models for Hundreds of Languages with Negligible Cost</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01271v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we explore a cost-effective framework for multilingual image generation. We find that, unlike models tuned on high-quality images with multilingual annotations, leveraging text encoders pre-trained on widely available, noisy Internet image-text pairs significantly enhances data efficiency in text-to-image (T2I) generation across multiple languages. Based on this insight, we introduce MuLan, Multi-Language adapter, a lightweight language adapter with fewer than 20M parameters, trained alongside a frozen text encoder and image diffusion model. Compared to previous multilingual T2I models, this framework offers: (1) Cost efficiency. Using readily accessible English data and off-the-shelf multilingual text encoders minimizes the training cost; (2) High performance. Achieving comparable generation capabilities in over 110 languages with CLIP similarity scores nearly matching those in English (38.61 for English vs. 37.61 for other languages); and (3) Broad applicability. Seamlessly integrating with compatible community tools like LoRA, LCM, ControlNet, and IP-Adapter, expanding its potential use cases.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty-Aware Artificial Intelligence for Gear Fault Diagnosis in Motor Drives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to quantify the uncertainties in fault diagnosis of motor drives using Bayesian neural networks (BNN). Conventional data-driven approaches used for fault diagnosis often rely on point-estimate neural networks, which merely provide deterministic outputs and fail to capture the uncertainty associated with the inference process. In contrast, BNNs offer a principled framework to model uncertainty by treating network weights as probability distributions rather than fixed values. It offers several advantages: (a) improved robustness to noisy data, (b) enhanced interpretability of model predictions, and (c) the ability to quantify uncertainty in the decision-making processes. To test the robustness of the proposed BNN, it has been tested under a conservative dataset of gear fault data from an experimental prototype of three fault types at first, and is then incrementally trained on new fault classes and datasets to explore its uncertainty quantification features and model interpretability under noisy data and unseen fault scenarios.</description>

      <title>Align-KD: Distilling Cross-Modal Alignment Knowledge for Mobile Vision-Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) bring powerful understanding and reasoning capabilities to multimodal tasks. Meanwhile, the great need for capable aritificial intelligence on mobile devices also arises, such as the AI assistant software. Some efforts try to migrate VLMs to edge devices to expand their application scope. Simplifying the model structure is a common method, but as the model shrinks, the trade-off between performance and size becomes more and more difficult. Knowledge distillation (KD) can help models improve comprehensive capabilities without increasing size or data volume. However, most of the existing large model distillation techniques only consider applications on single-modal LLMs, or only use teachers to create new data environments for students. None of these methods take into account the distillation of the most important cross-modal alignment knowledge in VLMs. We propose a method called Align-KD to guide the student model to learn the cross-modal matching that occurs at the shallow layer. The teacher also helps student learn the projection of vision token into text embedding space based on the focus of text. Under the guidance of Align-KD, the 1.7B MobileVLM V2 model can learn rich knowledge from the 7B teacher model with light design of training loss, and achieve an average score improvement of 2.0 across 6 benchmarks under two training subsets respectively. Code is available at: https://github.com/fqhank/Align-KD.</description>

Abstract: Text-to-image generation models have become transformative tools. However, diffusion-based vision language models still lack the ability to precisely control the shape, appearance, and positional placement of objects in generated images using text guidance alone. Global image editing models typically achieve global layout control by relying on additional masks or images as guidance, which often require model training. Although local object-editing models enable modification of object shapes, they do not provide control over the positional placement of these objects. To address these limitations, we propose the MFTF model, which enables precise control over object positioning without requiring additional masks or images. The MFTF model supports both single-object and multi-object positional control (such as translation, rotation, etc.) and allows for concurrent layout control and object semantic editing. This is achieved by controlling the denoising process of the diffusion model through parallel denoising. Attention masks are dynamically generated from the cross-attention layers of the source diffusion model and applied to queries from the self-attention layers to isolate objects. These queries are then modified according to layout control parameters and injected back into the self-attention layers of the target diffusion model to enable precise positional control.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Perception Capabilities of Multimodal LLMs with Training-free Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01289v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) equip language models with visual capabilities by aligning vision encoders with language models. Existing methods to enhance the visual perception of MLLMs often involve designing more powerful vision encoders, which requires exploring a vast design space and re-aligning each potential encoder with the language model, resulting in prohibitively high training costs. In this paper, we introduce VisionFuse, a novel integration framework that efficiently utilizes multiple vision encoders from off-the-shelf MLLMs to enhance visual perception without requiring additional training. Our approach is motivated by the observation that different MLLMs tend to focus on distinct regions given the same query and image. Moreover, we find that the feature distributions of vision encoders within an MLLM family, a group of MLLMs sharing the same pretrained LLM, are highly aligned. Building on these insights, VisionFuse enriches the visual context by concatenating the tokens generated by the vision encoders of selected MLLMs within a family. By merging the parameters of language models from these MLLMs, VisionFuse allows a single language model to align with various vision encoders, significantly reducing deployment overhead. We conduct comprehensive evaluations across multiple multimodal benchmarks using various MLLM combinations, demonstrating substantial improvements in multimodal tasks. Notably, when integrating MiniGemini-8B and SLIME-8B, VisionFuse achieves an average performance increase of over 4%.</description>

      <title>Learning Smooth Distance Functions via Queries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the problem of learning distance functions within the query-based learning framework, where a learner is able to pose triplet queries of the form: ``Is $x_i$ closer to $x_j$ or $x_k$?'' We establish formal guarantees on the query complexity required to learn smooth, but otherwise general, distance functions under two notions of approximation: $\omega$-additive approximation and $(1 + \omega)$-multiplicative approximation. For the additive approximation, we propose a global method whose query complexity is quadratic in the size of a finite cover of the sample space. For the (stronger) multiplicative approximation, we introduce a method that combines global and local approaches, utilizing multiple Mahalanobis distance functions to capture local geometry. This method has a query complexity that scales quadratically with both the size of the cover and the ambient space dimension of the sample space.</description>

      <title>FedAH: Aggregated Head for Personalized Federated Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, Federated Learning (FL) has gained popularity for its privacy-preserving and collaborative learning capabilities. Personalized Federated Learning (PFL), building upon FL, aims to address the issue of statistical heterogeneity and achieve personalization. Personalized-head-based PFL is a common and effective PFL method that splits the model into a feature extractor and a head, where the feature extractor is collaboratively trained and shared, while the head is locally trained and not shared. However, retaining the head locally, although achieving personalization, prevents the model from learning global knowledge in the head, thus affecting the performance of the personalized model. To solve this problem, we propose a novel PFL method called Federated Learning with Aggregated Head (FedAH), which initializes the head with an Aggregated Head at each iteration. The key feature of FedAH is to perform element-level aggregation between the local model head and the global model head to introduce global information from the global model head. To evaluate the effectiveness of FedAH, we conduct extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets in the fields of computer vision and natural language processing. FedAH outperforms ten state-of-the-art FL methods in terms of test accuracy by 2.87%. Additionally, FedAH maintains its advantage even in scenarios where some clients drop out unexpectedly. Our code is open-accessed at https://github.com/heyuepeng/FedAH.</description>

      <title>RL2: Reinforce Large Language Model to Assist Safe Reinforcement Learning for Energy Management of Active Distribution Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As large-scale distributed energy resources are integrated into the active distribution networks (ADNs), effective energy management in ADNs becomes increasingly prominent compared to traditional distribution networks. Although advanced reinforcement learning (RL) methods, which alleviate the burden of complicated modelling and optimization, have greatly improved the efficiency of energy management in ADNs, safety becomes a critical concern for RL applications in real-world problems. Since the design and adjustment of penalty functions, which correspond to operational safety constraints, requires extensive domain knowledge in RL and power system operation, the emerging ADN operators call for a more flexible and customized approach to address the penalty functions so that the operational safety and efficiency can be further enhanced. Empowered with strong comprehension, reasoning, and in-context learning capabilities, large language models (LLMs) provide a promising way to assist safe RL for energy management in ADNs. In this paper, we introduce the LLM to comprehend operational safety requirements in ADNs and generate corresponding penalty functions. In addition, we propose an RL2 mechanism to refine the generated functions iteratively and adaptively through multi-round dialogues, in which the LLM agent adjusts the functions' pattern and parameters based on training and test performance of the downstream RL agent. The proposed method significantly reduces the intervention of the ADN operators. Comprehensive test results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Long Video Diffusion Generation with Segmented Cross-Attention and Content-Rich Video Data Curation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Presto, a novel video diffusion model designed to generate 15-second videos with long-range coherence and rich content. Extending video generation methods to maintain scenario diversity over long durations presents significant challenges. To address this, we propose a Segmented Cross-Attention (SCA) strategy, which splits hidden states into segments along the temporal dimension, allowing each segment to cross-attend to a corresponding sub-caption. SCA requires no additional parameters, enabling seamless incorporation into current DiT-based architectures. To facilitate high-quality long video generation, we build the LongTake-HD dataset, consisting of 261k content-rich videos with scenario coherence, annotated with an overall video caption and five progressive sub-captions. Experiments show that our Presto achieves 78.5% on the VBench Semantic Score and 100% on the Dynamic Degree, outperforming existing state-of-the-art video generation methods. This demonstrates that our proposed Presto significantly enhances content richness, maintains long-range coherence, and captures intricate textual details. More details are displayed on our project page: https://presto-video.github.io/.</description>

      <title>Explainable fault and severity classification for rolling element bearings using Kolmogorov-Arnold networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rolling element bearings are critical components of rotating machinery, with their performance directly influencing the efficiency and reliability of industrial systems. At the same time, bearing faults are a leading cause of machinery failures, often resulting in costly downtime, reduced productivity, and, in extreme cases, catastrophic damage. This study presents a methodology that utilizes Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks to address these challenges through automatic feature selection, hyperparameter tuning and interpretable fault analysis within a unified framework. By training shallow network architectures and minimizing the number of selected features, the framework produces lightweight models that deliver explainable results through feature attribution and symbolic representations of their activation functions. Validated on two widely recognized datasets for bearing fault diagnosis, the framework achieved perfect F1-Scores for fault detection and high performance in fault and severity classification tasks, including 100\% F1-Scores in most cases. Notably, it demonstrated adaptability by handling diverse fault types, such as imbalance and misalignment, within the same dataset. The symbolic representations enhanced model interpretability, while feature attribution offered insights into the optimal feature types or signals for each studied task. These results highlight the framework's potential for practical applications, such as real-time machinery monitoring, and for scientific research requiring efficient and explainable models.</description>

      <title>The "LLM World of Words" English free association norms generated by large language models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Free associations have been extensively used in cognitive psychology and linguistics for studying how conceptual knowledge is organized. Recently, the potential of applying a similar approach for investigating the knowledge encoded in LLMs has emerged, specifically as a method for investigating LLM biases. However, the absence of large-scale LLM-generated free association norms that are comparable with human-generated norms is an obstacle to this new research direction. To address this limitation, we create a new dataset of LLM-generated free association norms modeled after the "Small World of Words" (SWOW) human-generated norms consisting of approximately 12,000 cue words. We prompt three LLMs, namely Mistral, Llama3, and Haiku, with the same cues as those in the SWOW norms to generate three novel comparable datasets, the "LLM World of Words" (LWOW). Using both SWOW and LWOW norms, we construct cognitive network models of semantic memory that represent the conceptual knowledge possessed by humans and LLMs. We demonstrate how these datasets can be used for investigating implicit biases in humans and LLMs, such as the harmful gender stereotypes that are prevalent both in society and LLM outputs.</description>

      <title>Negative Token Merging: Image-based Adversarial Feature Guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text-based adversarial guidance using a negative prompt has emerged as a widely adopted approach to push the output features away from undesired concepts. While useful, performing adversarial guidance using text alone can be insufficient to capture complex visual concepts and avoid undesired visual elements like copyrighted characters. In this paper, for the first time we explore an alternate modality in this direction by performing adversarial guidance directly using visual features from a reference image or other images in a batch. In particular, we introduce negative token merging (NegToMe), a simple but effective training-free approach which performs adversarial guidance by selectively pushing apart matching semantic features (between reference and output generation) during the reverse diffusion process. When used w.r.t. other images in the same batch, we observe that NegToMe significantly increases output diversity (racial, gender, visual) without sacrificing output image quality. Similarly, when used w.r.t. a reference copyrighted asset, NegToMe helps reduce visual similarity with copyrighted content by 34.57%. NegToMe is simple to implement using just few-lines of code, uses only marginally higher (&lt;4%) inference times and generalizes to different diffusion architectures like Flux, which do not natively support the use of a separate negative prompt.

      <description>arXiv:2412.01348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an online planning framework for solving multi-object rearrangement problems in partially observable, multi-room environments. Current object rearrangement solutions, primarily based on Reinforcement Learning or hand-coded planning methods, often lack adaptability to diverse challenges. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel Hierarchical Object-Oriented Partially Observed Markov Decision Process (HOO-POMDP) planning approach. This approach comprises of (a) an object-oriented POMDP planner generating sub-goals, (b) a set of low-level policies for sub-goal achievement, and (c) an abstraction system converting the continuous low-level world into a representation suitable for abstract planning. We evaluate our system on varying numbers of objects, rooms, and problem types in AI2-THOR simulated environments with promising results.</description>

      <title>A multi-criteria decision support system to evaluate the effectiveness of training courses on citizens' employability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01351v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study examines the impact of lifelong learning on the professional lives of employed and unemployed individuals. Lifelong learning is a crucial factor in securing employment or enhancing one's existing career prospects. To achieve this objective, this study proposes the implementation of a multi-criteria decision support system for the evaluation of training courses in accordance with their capacity to enhance the employability of the students. The methodology is delineated in four stages. Firstly, a `working life curve' was defined to provide a quantitative description of an individual's working life. Secondly, an analysis based on K-medoids clustering defined a control group for each individual for comparison. Thirdly, the performance of a course according to each of the four predefined criteria was calculated using a t-test to determine the mean performance value of those who took the course. Ultimately, the unweighted TOPSIS method was used to evaluate the efficacy of the various training courses in relation to the four criteria. This approach effectively addresses the challenge of using extensive datasets within a system while facilitating the application of a multi-criteria unweighted TOPSIS method. The results of the multi-criteria TOPSIS method indicated that training courses related to the professional fields of administration and management, hostel and tourism and community and sociocultural services have positive impact on employability and improving the working conditions of citizens. However, courses that demonstrate the greatest effectiveness in ranking are the least demanded by citizens. The results will help policymakers evaluate the effectiveness of each training course offered by the regional government.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent times, more and more people are posting about their mental states across various social media platforms. Leveraging this data, AI-based systems can be developed that help in assessing the mental health of individuals, such as suicide risk. This paper is a study done on suicidal risk assessments using Reddit data leveraging Base language models to identify patterns from social media posts. We have demonstrated that using smaller language models, i.e., less than 500M parameters, can also be effective in contrast to LLMs with greater than 500M parameters. We propose Su-RoBERTa, a fine-tuned RoBERTa on suicide risk prediction task that utilized both the labeled and unlabeled Reddit data and tackled class imbalance by data augmentation using GPT-2 model. Our Su-RoBERTa model attained a 69.84% weighted F1 score during the Final evaluation. This paper demonstrates the effectiveness of Base language models for the analysis of the risk factors related to mental health with an efficient computation pipeline</description>

      <title>Integrative CAM: Adaptive Layer Fusion for Comprehensive Interpretation of CNNs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the growing demand for interpretable deep learning models, this paper introduces Integrative CAM, an advanced Class Activation Mapping (CAM) technique aimed at providing a holistic view of feature importance across Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Traditional gradient-based CAM methods, such as Grad-CAM and Grad-CAM++, primarily use final layer activations to highlight regions of interest, often neglecting critical features derived from intermediate layers. Integrative CAM addresses this limitation by fusing insights across all network layers, leveraging both gradient and activation scores to adaptively weight layer contributions, thus yielding a comprehensive interpretation of the model's internal representation. Our approach includes a novel bias term in the saliency map calculation, a factor frequently omitted in existing CAM techniques, but essential for capturing a more complete feature importance landscape, as modern CNNs rely on both weighted activations and biases to make predictions. Additionally, we generalize the alpha term from Grad-CAM++ to apply to any smooth function, expanding CAM applicability across a wider range of models. Through extensive experiments on diverse and complex datasets, Integrative CAM demonstrates superior fidelity in feature importance mapping, effectively enhancing interpretability for intricate fusion scenarios and complex decision-making tasks. By advancing interpretability methods to capture multi-layered model insights, Integrative CAM provides a valuable tool for fusion-driven applications, promoting the trustworthy and insightful deployment of deep learning models.</description>

      <title>Explaining the Unexplained: Revealing Hidden Correlations for Better Interpretability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning has achieved remarkable success in processing and managing unstructured data. However, its "black box" nature imposes significant limitations, particularly in sensitive application domains. While existing interpretable machine learning methods address some of these issues, they often fail to adequately consider feature correlations and provide insufficient evaluation of model decision paths. To overcome these challenges, this paper introduces Real Explainer (RealExp), an interpretability computation method that decouples the Shapley Value into individual feature importance and feature correlation importance. By incorporating feature similarity computations, RealExp enhances interpretability by precisely quantifying both individual feature contributions and their interactions, leading to more reliable and nuanced explanations. Additionally, this paper proposes a novel interpretability evaluation criterion focused on elucidating the decision paths of deep learning models, going beyond traditional accuracy-based metrics. Experimental validations on two unstructured data tasks -- image classification and text sentiment analysis -- demonstrate that RealExp significantly outperforms existing methods in interpretability. Case studies further illustrate its practical value: in image classification, RealExp aids in selecting suitable pre-trained models for specific tasks from an interpretability perspective; in text classification, it enables the optimization of models and approximates the performance of a fine-tuned GPT-Ada model using traditional bag-of-words approaches.</description>

      <title>Behavior Backdoor for Deep Learning Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The various post-processing methods for deep-learning-based models, such as quantification, pruning, and fine-tuning, play an increasingly important role in artificial intelligence technology, with pre-train large models as one of the main development directions. However, this popular series of post-processing behaviors targeting pre-training deep models has become a breeding ground for new adversarial security issues. In this study, we take the first step towards ``behavioral backdoor'' attack, which is defined as a behavior-triggered backdoor model training procedure, to reveal a new paradigm of backdoor attacks. In practice, we propose the first pipeline of implementing behavior backdoor, i.e., the Quantification Backdoor (QB) attack, upon exploiting model quantification method as the set trigger. Specifically, to adapt the optimization goal of behavior backdoor, we introduce the behavior-driven backdoor object optimizing method by a bi-target behavior backdoor training loss, thus we could guide the poisoned model optimization direction. To update the parameters across multiple models, we adopt the address-shared backdoor model training, thereby the gradient information could be utilized for multimodel collaborative optimization. Extensive experiments have been conducted on different models, datasets, and tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of this novel backdoor attack and its potential application threats.</description>

Abstract: This article provides a mathematically rigorous introduction to denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs), sometimes also referred to as diffusion probabilistic models or diffusion models, for generative artificial intelligence. We provide a detailed basic mathematical framework for DDPMs and explain the main ideas behind training and generation procedures.

      <title>Second FRCSyn-onGoing: Winning Solutions and Post-Challenge Analysis to Improve Face Recognition with Synthetic Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synthetic data is gaining increasing popularity for face recognition technologies, mainly due to the privacy concerns and challenges associated with obtaining real data, including diverse scenarios, quality, and demographic groups, among others. It also offers some advantages over real data, such as the large amount of data that can be generated or the ability to customize it to adapt to specific problem-solving needs. To effectively use such data, face recognition models should also be specifically designed to exploit synthetic data to its fullest potential. In order to promote the proposal of novel Generative AI methods and synthetic data, and investigate the application of synthetic data to better train face recognition systems, we introduce the 2nd FRCSyn-onGoing challenge, based on the 2nd Face Recognition Challenge in the Era of Synthetic Data (FRCSyn), originally launched at CVPR 2024. This is an ongoing challenge that provides researchers with an accessible platform to benchmark i) the proposal of novel Generative AI methods and synthetic data, and ii) novel face recognition systems that are specifically proposed to take advantage of synthetic data. We focus on exploring the use of synthetic data both individually and in combination with real data to solve current challenges in face recognition such as demographic bias, domain adaptation, and performance constraints in demanding situations, such as age disparities between training and testing, changes in the pose, or occlusions. Very interesting findings are obtained in this second edition, including a direct comparison with the first one, in which synthetic databases were restricted to DCFace and GANDiffFace.</description>

      <title>Fire-Image-DenseNet (FIDN) for predicting wildfire burnt area using remote sensing data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting the extent of massive wildfires once ignited is essential to reduce the subsequent socioeconomic losses and environmental damage, but challenging because of the complexity of fire behaviour. Existing physics-based models are limited in predicting large or long-duration wildfire events. Here, we develop a deep-learning-based predictive model, Fire-Image-DenseNet (FIDN), that uses spatial features derived from both near real-time and reanalysis data on the environmental and meteorological drivers of wildfire. We trained and tested this model using more than 300 individual wildfires that occurred between 2012 and 2019 in the western US. In contrast to existing models, the performance of FIDN does not degrade with fire size or duration. Furthermore, it predicts final burnt area accurately even in very heterogeneous landscapes in terms of fuel density and flammability. The FIDN model showed higher accuracy, with a mean squared error (MSE) about 82% and 67% lower than those of the predictive models based on cellular automata (CA) and the minimum travel time (MTT) approaches, respectively. Its structural similarity index measure (SSIM) averages 97%, outperforming the CA and FlamMap MTT models by 6% and 2%, respectively. Additionally, FIDN is approximately three orders of magnitude faster than both CA and MTT models. The enhanced computational efficiency and accuracy advancements offer vital insights for strategic planning and resource allocation for firefighting operations.</description>

      <title>MambaU-Lite: A Lightweight Model based on Mamba and Integrated Channel-Spatial Attention for Skin Lesion Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Early detection of skin abnormalities plays a crucial role in diagnosing and treating skin cancer. Segmentation of affected skin regions using AI-powered devices is relatively common and supports the diagnostic process. However, achieving high performance remains a significant challenge due to the need for high-resolution images and the often unclear boundaries of individual lesions. At the same time, medical devices require segmentation models to have a small memory foot-print and low computational cost. Based on these requirements, we introduce a novel lightweight model called MambaU-Lite, which combines the strengths of Mamba and CNN architectures, featuring just over 400K parameters and a computational cost of more than 1G flops. To enhance both global context and local feature extraction, we propose the P-Mamba block, a novel component that incorporates VSS blocks along-side multiple pooling layers, enabling the model to effectively learn multiscale features and enhance segmentation performance. We evaluate the model's performance on two skin datasets, ISIC2018 and PH2, yielding promising results. Our source code will be made publicly available at: https://github.com/nqnguyen812/MambaU-Lite.</description>

      <title>Towards Cross-Lingual Audio Abuse Detection in Low-Resource Settings with Few-Shot Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Online abusive content detection, particularly in low-resource settings and within the audio modality, remains underexplored. We investigate the potential of pre-trained audio representations for detecting abusive language in low-resource languages, in this case, in Indian languages using Few Shot Learning (FSL). Leveraging powerful representations from models such as Wav2Vec and Whisper, we explore cross-lingual abuse detection using the ADIMA dataset with FSL. Our approach integrates these representations within the Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) framework to classify abusive language in 10 languages. We experiment with various shot sizes (50-200) evaluating the impact of limited data on performance. Additionally, a feature visualization study was conducted to better understand model behaviour. This study highlights the generalization ability of pre-trained models in low-resource scenarios and offers valuable insights into detecting abusive language in multilingual contexts.</description>

      <title>Learning Elementary Cellular Automata with Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models demonstrate remarkable mathematical capabilities but at the same time struggle with abstract reasoning and planning. In this study, we explore whether Transformers can learn to abstract and generalize the rules governing Elementary Cellular Automata. By training Transformers on state sequences generated with random initial conditions and local rules, we show that they can generalize across different Boolean functions of fixed arity, effectively abstracting the underlying rules. While the models achieve high accuracy in next-state prediction, their performance declines sharply in multi-step planning tasks without intermediate context. Our analysis reveals that including future states or rule prediction in the training loss enhances the models' ability to form internal representations of the rules, leading to improved performance in longer planning horizons and autoregressive generation. Furthermore, we confirm that increasing the model's depth plays a crucial role in extended sequential computations required for complex reasoning tasks. This highlights the potential to improve LLM with inclusion of longer horizons in loss function, as well as incorporating recurrence and adaptive computation time for dynamic control of model depth.</description>

      <title>CSP-AIT-Net: A contrastive learning-enhanced spatiotemporal graph attention framework for short-term metro OD flow prediction with asynchronous inflow tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate origin-destination (OD) passenger flow prediction is crucial for enhancing metro system efficiency, optimizing scheduling, and improving passenger experiences. However, current models often fail to effectively capture the asynchronous departure characteristics of OD flows and underutilize the inflow and outflow data, which limits their prediction accuracy. To address these issues, we propose CSP-AIT-Net, a novel spatiotemporal graph attention framework designed to enhance OD flow prediction by incorporating asynchronous inflow tracking and advanced station semantics representation. Our framework restructures the OD flow prediction paradigm by first predicting outflows and then decomposing OD flows using a spatiotemporal graph attention mechanism. To enhance computational efficiency, we introduce a masking mechanism and propose asynchronous passenger flow graphs that integrate inflow and OD flow with conservation constraints. Furthermore, we employ contrastive learning to extract high-dimensional land use semantics of metro stations, enriching the contextual understanding of passenger mobility patterns. Validation of the Shanghai metro system demonstrates improvement in short-term OD flow prediction accuracy over state-of-the-art methods. This work contributes to enhancing metro operational efficiency, scheduling precision, and overall system safety.</description>

      <title>Reject Threshold Adaptation for Open-Set Model Attribution of Deepfake Audio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Open environment oriented open set model attribution of deepfake audio is an emerging research topic, aiming to identify the generation models of deepfake audio. Most previous work requires manually setting a rejection threshold for unknown classes to compare with predicted probabilities. However, models often overfit training instances and generate overly confident predictions. Moreover, thresholds that effectively distinguish unknown categories in the current dataset may not be suitable for identifying known and unknown categories in another data distribution. To address the issues, we propose a novel framework for open set model attribution of deepfake audio with rejection threshold adaptation (ReTA). Specifically, the reconstruction error learning module trains by combining the representation of system fingerprints with labels corresponding to either the target class or a randomly chosen other class label. This process generates matching and non-matching reconstructed samples, establishing the reconstruction error distributions for each class and laying the foundation for the reject threshold calculation module. The reject threshold calculation module utilizes gaussian probability estimation to fit the distributions of matching and non-matching reconstruction errors. It then computes adaptive reject thresholds for all classes through probability minimization criteria. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of ReTA in improving the open set model attributes of deepfake audio.</description>

      <title>MVImgNet2.0: A Larger-scale Dataset of Multi-view Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: MVImgNet is a large-scale dataset that contains multi-view images of ~220k real-world objects in 238 classes. As a counterpart of ImageNet, it introduces 3D visual signals via multi-view shooting, making a soft bridge between 2D and 3D vision. This paper constructs the MVImgNet2.0 dataset that expands MVImgNet into a total of ~520k objects and 515 categories, which derives a 3D dataset with a larger scale that is more comparable to ones in the 2D domain. In addition to the expanded dataset scale and category range, MVImgNet2.0 is of a higher quality than MVImgNet owing to four new features: (i) most shoots capture 360-degree views of the objects, which can support the learning of object reconstruction with completeness; (ii) the segmentation manner is advanced to produce foreground object masks of higher accuracy; (iii) a more powerful structure-from-motion method is adopted to derive the camera pose for each frame of a lower estimation error; (iv) higher-quality dense point clouds are reconstructed via advanced methods for objects captured in 360-degree views, which can serve for downstream applications. Extensive experiments confirm the value of the proposed MVImgNet2.0 in boosting the performance of large 3D reconstruction models. MVImgNet2.0 will be public at luyues.github.io/mvimgnet2, including multi-view images of all 520k objects, the reconstructed high-quality point clouds, and data annotation codes, hoping to inspire the broader vision community.</description>

      <title>Multi-Facet Blending for Faceted Query-by-Example Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01443v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the growing demand to fit fine-grained user intents, faceted query-by-example (QBE), which retrieves similar documents conditioned on specific facets, has gained recent attention. However, prior approaches mainly depend on document-level comparisons using basic indicators like citations due to the lack of facet-level relevance datasets; yet, this limits their use to citation-based domains and fails to capture the intricacies of facet constraints. In this paper, we propose a multi-facet blending (FaBle) augmentation method, which exploits modularity by decomposing and recomposing to explicitly synthesize facet-specific training sets. We automatically decompose documents into facet units and generate (ir)relevant pairs by leveraging LLMs' intrinsic distinguishing capabilities; then, dynamically recomposing the units leads to facet-wise relevance-informed document pairs. Our modularization eliminates the need for pre-defined facet knowledge or labels. Further, to prove the FaBle's efficacy in a new domain beyond citation-based scientific paper retrieval, we release a benchmark dataset for educational exam item QBE. FaBle augmentation on 1K documents remarkably assists training in obtaining facet conditional embeddings.</description>

      <title>PLD+: Accelerating LLM inference by leveraging Language Model Artifacts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To reduce the latency associated with autoretrogressive LLM inference, speculative decoding has emerged as a novel decoding paradigm, where future tokens are drafted and verified in parallel. However, the practical deployment of speculative decoding is hindered by its requirements for additional computational resources and fine-tuning, which limits its out-of-the-box usability. To address these challenges, we present PLD+, a suite of novel algorithms developed to accelerate the inference process of LLMs, particularly for input-guided tasks. These tasks, which include code editing, text editing, summarization, etc., often feature outputs with substantial overlap with their inputs-an attribute PLD+ is designed to exploit. PLD+ also leverages the artifacts (attention and hidden states) generated during inference to accelerate inference speed. We test our approach on five input-guided tasks and through extensive experiments we find that PLD+ outperforms all tuning-free approaches. In the greedy setting, it even outperforms the state-of-the-art tuning-dependent approach EAGLE on four of the tasks. (by a margin of upto 2.31 in terms of avg. speedup). Our approach is tuning free, does not require any additional compute and can easily be used for accelerating inference of any LLM.</description>

      <title>Misalignments in AI Perception: Quantitative Findings and Visual Mapping of How Experts and the Public Differ in Expectations and Risks, Benefits, and Value Judgments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming diverse societal domains, raising critical questions about its risks and benefits and the misalignments between public expectations and academic visions. This study examines how the general public (N=1110) -- people using or being affected by AI -- and academic AI experts (N=119) -- people shaping AI development -- perceive AI's capabilities and impact across 71 scenarios, including sustainability, healthcare, job performance, societal divides, art, and warfare. Participants evaluated each scenario on four dimensions: expected probability, perceived risk and benefit, and overall sentiment (or value). The findings reveal significant quantitative differences: experts anticipate higher probabilities, perceive lower risks, report greater utility, and express more favorable sentiment toward AI compared to the non-experts. Notably, risk-benefit tradeoffs differ: the public assigns risk half the weight of benefits, while experts assign it only a third. Visual maps of these evaluations highlight areas of convergence and divergence, identifying potential sources of public concern. These insights offer actionable guidance for researchers and policymakers to align AI development with societal values, fostering public trust and informed governance.</description>

However, these approaches respectively lack statistical resolution and parametric controllability, both essential to discovering physical relationships underlying the complex stochastic dynamics of crowds. Here, we establish an investigation paradigm that offers laboratory-like controllability, while ensuring the statistical resolution of large-scale real-world datasets. Using our data-driven neural crowd simulator (\modelname{}), which we train on large-scale data and validate against key statistical features of crowd dynamics, we show that we can perform effective surrogate crowd dynamics experiments without training on specific scenarios. We not only reproduce known experimental results on pairwise avoidance, but also uncover the vision-guided and topologic nature of N-body interactions. These findings show how virtual experiments based on neural simulation enable data-driven scientific discovery.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Attacks on Hyperbolic Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As hyperbolic deep learning grows in popularity, so does the need for adversarial robustness in the context of such a non-Euclidean geometry. To this end, this paper proposes hyperbolic alternatives to the commonly used FGM and PGD adversarial attacks. Through interpretable synthetic benchmarks and experiments on existing datasets, we show how the existing and newly proposed attacks differ. Moreover, we investigate the differences in adversarial robustness between Euclidean and fully hyperbolic networks. We find that these networks suffer from different types of vulnerabilities and that the newly proposed hyperbolic attacks cannot address these differences. Therefore, we conclude that the shifts in adversarial robustness are due to the models learning distinct patterns resulting from their different geometries.</description>

      <title>Addressing Data Leakage in HumanEval Using Combinatorial Test Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The use of large language models (LLMs) is widespread across many domains, including Software Engineering, where they have been used to automate tasks such as program generation and test classification. As LLM-based methods continue to evolve, it is important that we define clear and robust methods that fairly evaluate performance. Benchmarks are a common approach to assess LLMs with respect to their ability to solve problem-specific tasks as well as assess different versions of an LLM to solve tasks over time. For example, the HumanEval benchmark is composed of 164 hand-crafted tasks and has become an important tool in assessing LLM-based program generation. However, a major barrier to a fair evaluation of LLMs using benchmarks like HumanEval is data contamination resulting from data leakage of benchmark tasks and solutions into the training data set. This barrier is compounded by the black-box nature of LLM training data which makes it difficult to even know if data leakage has occurred. To address the data leakage problem, we propose a new benchmark construction method where a benchmark is composed of template tasks that can be instantiated into new concrete tasks using combinatorial test design. Concrete tasks for the same template task must be different enough that data leakage has minimal impact and similar enough that the tasks are interchangeable with respect to performance evaluation. To assess our benchmark construction method, we propose HumanEval_T, an alternative benchmark to HumanEval that was constructed using template tasks and combinatorial test design.</description>

      <title>Effectiveness of L2 Regularization in Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning as a service have become the status quo for many industries, leading to the widespread deployment of models that handle sensitive data. Well-performing models, the industry seeks, usually rely on a large volume of training data. However, the use of such data raises serious privacy concerns due to the potential risks of leaks of highly sensitive information. One prominent threat is the Membership Inference Attack, where adversaries attempt to deduce whether a specific data point was used in a model's training process. An adversary's ability to determine an individual's presence represents a significant privacy threat, especially when related to a group of users sharing sensitive information. Hence, well-designed privacy-preserving machine learning solutions are critically needed in the industry. In this work, we compare the effectiveness of L2 regularization and differential privacy in mitigating Membership Inference Attack risks. Even though regularization techniques like L2 regularization are commonly employed to reduce overfitting, a condition that enhances the effectiveness of Membership Inference Attacks, their impact on mitigating these attacks has not been systematically explored.</description>

Abstract: With computing now ubiquitous across government, industry, and education, cybersecurity has become a critical component for every organization on the planet. Due to this ubiquity of computing, cyber threats have continued to grow year over year, leading to labor shortages and a skills gap in cybersecurity. As a result, many cybersecurity product vendors and security organizations have looked to artificial intelligence to shore up their defenses. This work considers how to characterize attackers and defenders in one approach to the automation of cyber defense -- the application of reinforcement learning. Specifically, we characterize the types of attackers and defenders in the sense of Bayesian games and, using reinforcement learning, derive empirical findings about how to best train agents that defend against multiple types of attackers.</description>

      <title>Improved Large Language Model Jailbreak Detection via Pretrained Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The adoption of large language models (LLMs) in many applications, from customer service chat bots and software development assistants to more capable agentic systems necessitates research into how to secure these systems. Attacks like prompt injection and jailbreaking attempt to elicit responses and actions from these models that are not compliant with the safety, privacy, or content policies of organizations using the model in their application. In order to counter abuse of LLMs for generating potentially harmful replies or taking undesirable actions, LLM owners must apply safeguards during training and integrate additional tools to block the LLM from generating text that abuses the model. Jailbreaking prompts play a vital role in convincing an LLM to generate potentially harmful content, making it important to identify jailbreaking attempts to block any further steps. In this work, we propose a novel approach to detect jailbreak prompts based on pairing text embeddings well-suited for retrieval with traditional machine learning classification algorithms. Our approach outperforms all publicly available methods from open source LLM security applications.</description>

      <title>SeqAfford: Sequential 3D Affordance Reasoning via Multimodal Large Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 3D affordance segmentation aims to link human instructions to touchable regions of 3D objects for embodied manipulations. Existing efforts typically adhere to single-object, single-affordance paradigms, where each affordance type or explicit instruction strictly corresponds to a specific affordance region and are unable to handle long-horizon tasks. Such a paradigm cannot actively reason about complex user intentions that often imply sequential affordances. In this paper, we introduce the Sequential 3D Affordance Reasoning task, which extends the traditional paradigm by reasoning from cumbersome user intentions and then decomposing them into a series of segmentation maps. Toward this, we construct the first instruction-based affordance segmentation benchmark that includes reasoning over both single and sequential affordances, comprising 180K instruction-point cloud pairs. Based on the benchmark, we propose our model, SeqAfford, to unlock the 3D multi-modal large language model with additional affordance segmentation abilities, which ensures reasoning with world knowledge and fine-grained affordance grounding in a cohesive framework. We further introduce a multi-granular language-point integration module to endow 3D dense prediction. Extensive experimental evaluations show that our model excels over well-established methods and exhibits open-world generalization with sequential reasoning abilities.</description>

      <title>VideoLights: Feature Refinement and Cross-Task Alignment Transformer for Joint Video Highlight Detection and Moment Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Video Highlight Detection and Moment Retrieval (HD/MR) are essential in video analysis. Recent joint prediction transformer models often overlook their cross-task dynamics and video-text alignment and refinement. Moreover, most models typically use limited, uni-directional attention mechanisms, resulting in weakly integrated representations and suboptimal performance in capturing the interdependence between video and text modalities. Although large-language and vision-language models (LLM/LVLMs) have gained prominence across various domains, their application in this field remains relatively underexplored. Here we propose VideoLights, a novel HD/MR framework addressing these limitations through (i) Convolutional Projection and Feature Refinement modules with an alignment loss for better video-text feature alignment, (ii) Bi-Directional Cross-Modal Fusion network for strongly coupled query-aware clip representations, and (iii) Uni-directional joint-task feedback mechanism enhancing both tasks through correlation. In addition, (iv) we introduce hard positive/negative losses for adaptive error penalization and improved learning, and (v) leverage LVLMs like BLIP-2 for enhanced multimodal feature integration and intelligent pretraining using synthetic data generated from LVLMs. Comprehensive experiments on QVHighlights, TVSum, and Charades-STA benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. Codes and models are available at https://github.com/dpaul06/VideoLights .</description>

      <title>NCDD: Nearest Centroid Distance Deficit for Out-Of-Distribution Detection in Gastrointestinal Vision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of deep learning tools in gastrointestinal vision holds the potential for significant advancements in diagnosis, treatment, and overall patient care. A major challenge, however, is these tools' tendency to make overconfident predictions, even when encountering unseen or newly emerging disease patterns, undermining their reliability.
  We address this critical issue of reliability by framing it as an out-of-distribution (OOD) detection problem, where previously unseen and emerging diseases are identified as OOD examples. However, gastrointestinal images pose a unique challenge due to the overlapping feature representations between in- Distribution (ID) and OOD examples. Existing approaches often overlook this characteristic, as they are primarily developed for natural image datasets, where feature distinctions are more apparent. Despite the overlap, we hypothesize that the features of an in-distribution example will cluster closer to the centroids of their ground truth class, resulting in a shorter distance to the nearest centroid. In contrast, OOD examples maintain an equal distance from all class centroids. Based on this observation, we propose a novel nearest-centroid distance deficit (NCCD) score in the feature space for gastrointestinal OOD detection.
  Evaluations across multiple deep learning architectures and two publicly available benchmarks, Kvasir2 and Gastrovision, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach compared to several state-of-the-art methods. The code and implementation details are publicly available at: https://github.com/bhattarailab/NCDD</description>

      <title>Medchain: Bridging the Gap Between LLM Agents and Clinical Practice through Interactive Sequential Benchmarking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Clinical decision making (CDM) is a complex, dynamic process crucial to healthcare delivery, yet it remains a significant challenge for artificial intelligence systems. While Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have been tested on general medical knowledge using licensing exams and knowledge question-answering tasks, their performance in the CDM in real-world scenarios is limited due to the lack of comprehensive testing datasets that mirror actual medical practice. To address this gap, we present MedChain, a dataset of 12,163 clinical cases that covers five key stages of clinical workflow. MedChain distinguishes itself from existing benchmarks with three key features of real-world clinical practice: personalization, interactivity, and sequentiality. Further, to tackle real-world CDM challenges, we also propose MedChain-Agent, an AI system that integrates a feedback mechanism and a MCase-RAG module to learn from previous cases and adapt its responses. MedChain-Agent demonstrates remarkable adaptability in gathering information dynamically and handling sequential clinical tasks, significantly outperforming existing approaches. The relevant dataset and code will be released upon acceptance of this paper.</description>

      <title>Optimizing LoRa for Edge Computing with TinyML Pipeline for Channel Hopping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose to integrate long-distance LongRange (LoRa) communication solution for sending the data from IoT to the edge computing system, by taking advantage of its unlicensed nature and the potential for open source implementations that are common in edge computing. We propose a channel hoping optimization model and apply TinyML-based channel hoping model based for LoRa transmissions, as well as experimentally study a fast predictive algorithm to find free channels between edge and IoT devices. In the open source experimental setup that includes LoRa, TinyML and IoT-edge-cloud continuum, we integrate a novel application workflow and cloud-friendly protocol solutions in a case study of plant recommender application that combines concepts of microfarming and urban computing. In a LoRa-optimized edge computing setup, we engineer the application workflow, and apply collaborative filtering and various machine learning algorithms on application data collected to identify and recommend the planting schedule for a specific microfarm in an urban area. In the LoRa experiments, we measure the occurrence of packet loss, RSSI, and SNR, using a random channel hoping scheme to compare with our proposed TinyML method. The results show that it is feasible to use TinyML in microcontrollers for channel hopping, while proving the effectiveness of TinyML in learning to predict the best channel to select for LoRa transmission, and by improving the RSSI by up to 63 %, SNR by up to 44 % in comparison with a random hopping mechanism.</description>

      <title>If Eleanor Rigby Had Met ChatGPT: A Study on Loneliness in a Post-LLM World</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Loneliness, or the lack of fulfilling relationships, significantly impacts a person's mental and physical well-being and is prevalent worldwide. Previous research suggests that large language models (LLMs) may help mitigate loneliness. However, we argue that the use of widespread LLMs like ChatGPT is more prevalent--and riskier, as they are not designed for this purpose. To explore this, we analysed user interactions with ChatGPT, particularly those outside of its marketed use as task-oriented assistant. In dialogues classified as lonely, users frequently (37%) sought advice or validation, and received good engagement. However, ChatGPT failed in sensitive scenarios, like responding appropriately to suicidal ideation or trauma. We also observed a 35% higher incidence of toxic content, with women being 22 times more likely to be targeted than men. Our findings underscore ethical and legal questions about this technology, and note risks like radicalisation or further isolation. We conclude with recommendations for research and industry to address loneliness.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance on various benchmarks, yet their ability to engage in deliberate reasoning remains questionable. We present NYT-Connections, a collection of 358 simple word classification puzzles derived from the New York Times Connections game. This benchmark is designed to penalize quick, intuitive "System 1" thinking, isolating fundamental reasoning skills. We evaluated six recent LLMs, a simple machine learning heuristic, and humans across three configurations: single-attempt, multiple attempts without hints, and multiple attempts with contextual hints. Our findings reveal a significant performance gap: even top-performing LLMs like GPT-4 fall short of human performance by nearly 30%. Notably, advanced prompting techniques such as Chain-of-Thought and Self-Consistency show diminishing returns as task difficulty increases. NYT-Connections uniquely combines linguistic isolation, resistance to intuitive shortcuts, and regular updates to mitigate data leakage, offering a novel tool for assessing LLM reasoning capabilities.</description>

      <title>Image Forgery Localization via Guided Noise and Multi-Scale Feature Aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Image Forgery Localization (IFL) technology aims to detect and locate the forged areas in an image, which is very important in the field of digital forensics. However, existing IFL methods suffer from feature degradation during training using multi-layer convolutions or the self-attention mechanism, and perform poorly in detecting small forged regions and in robustness against post-processing. To tackle these, we propose a guided and multi-scale feature aggregated network for IFL. Spectifically, in order to comprehensively learn the noise feature under different types of forgery, we develop an effective noise extraction module in a guided way. Then, we design a Feature Aggregation Module (FAM) that uses dynamic convolution to adaptively aggregate RGB and noise features over multiple scales. Moreover, we propose an Atrous Residual Pyramid Module (ARPM) to enhance features representation and capture both global and local features using different receptive fields to improve the accuracy and robustness of forgery localization. Expensive experiments on 5 public datasets have shown that our proposed model outperforms several the state-of-the-art methods, specially on small region forged image.</description>

      <title>Concept Based Continuous Prompts for Interpretable Text Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Continuous prompts have become widely adopted for augmenting performance across a wide range of natural language tasks. However, the underlying mechanism of this enhancement remains obscure. Previous studies rely on individual words for interpreting continuous prompts, which lacks comprehensive semantic understanding. Drawing inspiration from Concept Bottleneck Models, we propose a framework for interpreting continuous prompts by decomposing them into human-readable concepts. Specifically, to ensure the feasibility of the decomposition, we demonstrate that a corresponding concept embedding matrix and a coefficient matrix can always be found to replace the prompt embedding matrix. Then, we employ GPT-4o to generate a concept pool and choose potential candidate concepts that are discriminative and representative using a novel submodular optimization algorithm. Experiments demonstrate that our framework can achieve similar results as the original P-tuning and word-based approaches using only a few concepts while providing more plausible results.

      <title>Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning via Homomorphic Adversarial Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Privacy-preserving federated learning (PPFL) aims to train a global model for multiple clients while maintaining their data privacy. However, current PPFL protocols exhibit one or more of the following insufficiencies: considerable degradation in accuracy, the requirement for sharing keys, and cooperation during the key generation or decryption processes. As a mitigation, we develop the first protocol that utilizes neural networks to implement PPFL, as well as incorporating an Aggregatable Hybrid Encryption scheme tailored to the needs of PPFL. We name these networks as Homomorphic Adversarial Networks (HANs) which demonstrate that neural networks are capable of performing tasks similar to multi-key homomorphic encryption (MK-HE) while solving the problems of key distribution and collaborative decryption. Our experiments show that HANs are robust against privacy attacks. Compared with non-private federated learning, experiments conducted on multiple datasets demonstrate that HANs exhibit a negligible accuracy loss (at most 1.35%). Compared to traditional MK-HE schemes, HANs increase encryption aggregation speed by 6,075 times while incurring a 29.2 times increase in communication overhead.</description>

      <title>PassionNet: An Innovative Framework for Duplicate and Conflicting Requirements Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Early detection and resolution of duplicate and conflicting requirements can significantly enhance project efficiency and overall software quality. Researchers have developed various computational predictors by leveraging Artificial Intelligence (AI) potential to detect duplicate and conflicting requirements. However, these predictors lack in performance and requires more effective approaches to empower software development processes. Following the need of a unique predictor that can accurately identify duplicate and conflicting requirements, this research offers a comprehensive framework that facilitate development of 3 different types of predictive pipelines: language models based, multi-model similarity knowledge-driven and large language models (LLMs) context + multi-model similarity knowledge-driven. Within first type predictive pipelines landscape, framework facilitates conflicting/duplicate requirements identification by leveraging 8 distinct types of LLMs. In second type, framework supports development of predictive pipelines that leverage multi-scale and multi-model similarity knowledge, ranging from traditional similarity computation methods to advanced similarity vectors generated by LLMs. In the third type, the framework synthesizes predictive pipelines by integrating contextual insights from LLMs with multi-model similarity knowledge. Across 6 public benchmark datasets, extensive testing of 760 distinct predictive pipelines demonstrates that hybrid predictive pipelines consistently outperforms other two types predictive pipelines in accurately identifying duplicate and conflicting requirements. This predictive pipeline outperformed existing state-of-the-art predictors performance with an overall performance margin of 13% in terms of F1-score</description>

      <title>R-Bot: An LLM-based Query Rewrite System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Query rewrite is essential for optimizing SQL queries to improve their execution efficiency without changing their results. Traditionally, this task has been tackled through heuristic and learning-based methods, each with its limitations in terms of inferior quality and low robustness. Recent advancements in LLMs offer a new paradigm by leveraging their superior natural language and code comprehension abilities. Despite their potential, directly applying LLMs like GPT-4 has faced challenges due to problems such as hallucinations, where the model might generate inaccurate or irrelevant results. To address this, we propose R-Bot, an LLM-based query rewrite system with a systematic approach. We first design a multi-source rewrite evidence preparation pipeline to generate query rewrite evidences for guiding LLMs to avoid hallucinations. We then propose a hybrid structure-semantics retrieval method that combines structural and semantic analysis to retrieve the most relevant rewrite evidences for effectively answering an online query. We next propose a step-by-step LLM rewrite method that iteratively leverages the retrieved evidences to select and arrange rewrite rules with self-reflection. We conduct comprehensive experiments on widely used benchmarks, and demonstrate the superior performance of our system, R-Bot, surpassing state-of-the-art query rewrite methods.</description>

Abstract: Causal discovery is essential across various scientific fields to uncover causal structures within data. Traditional methods relying on observational data have limitations due to confounding variables. This paper presents an optimization-based approach using integer programming (IP) to design minimal intervention sets that ensure causal structure identifiability.

      <title>Deep Guess acceleration for explainable image reconstruction in sparse-view CT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sparse-view Computed Tomography (CT) is an emerging protocol designed to reduce X-ray dose radiation in medical imaging. Traditional Filtered Back Projection algorithm reconstructions suffer from severe artifacts due to sparse data. In contrast, Model-Based Iterative Reconstruction (MBIR) algorithms, though better at mitigating noise through regularization, are too computationally costly for clinical use. This paper introduces a novel technique, denoted as the Deep Guess acceleration scheme, using a trained neural network both to quicken the regularized MBIR and to enhance the reconstruction accuracy. We integrate state-of-the-art deep learning tools to initialize a clever starting guess for a proximal algorithm solving a non-convex model and thus computing an interpretable solution image in a few iterations. Experimental results on real CT images demonstrate the Deep Guess effectiveness in (very) sparse tomographic protocols, where it overcomes its mere variational counterpart and many data-driven approaches at the state of the art. We also consider a ground truth-free implementation and test the robustness of the proposed framework to noise.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty-Aware Regularization for Image-to-Image Translation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The importance of quantifying uncertainty in deep networks has become paramount for reliable real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a method to improve uncertainty estimation in medical Image-to-Image (I2I) translation. Our model integrates aleatoric uncertainty and employs Uncertainty-Aware Regularization (UAR) inspired by simple priors to refine uncertainty estimates and enhance reconstruction quality. We show that by leveraging simple priors on parameters, our approach captures more robust uncertainty maps, effectively refining them to indicate precisely where the network encounters difficulties, while being less affected by noise. Our experiments demonstrate that UAR not only improves translation performance, but also provides better uncertainty estimations, particularly in the presence of noise and artifacts. We validate our approach using two medical imaging datasets, showcasing its effectiveness in maintaining high confidence in familiar regions while accurately identifying areas of uncertainty in novel/ambiguous scenarios.</description>

      <title>Are We There Yet? Revealing the Risks of Utilizing Large Language Models in Scholarly Peer Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scholarly peer review is a cornerstone of scientific advancement, but the system is under strain due to increasing manuscript submissions and the labor-intensive nature of the process. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have led to their integration into peer review, with promising results such as substantial overlaps between LLM- and human-generated reviews. However, the unchecked adoption of LLMs poses significant risks to the integrity of the peer review system. In this study, we comprehensively analyze the vulnerabilities of LLM-generated reviews by focusing on manipulation and inherent flaws. Our experiments show that injecting covert deliberate content into manuscripts allows authors to explicitly manipulate LLM reviews, leading to inflated ratings and reduced alignment with human reviews. In a simulation, we find that manipulating 5% of the reviews could potentially cause 12% of the papers to lose their position in the top 30% rankings. Implicit manipulation, where authors strategically highlight minor limitations in their papers, further demonstrates LLMs' susceptibility compared to human reviewers, with a 4.5 times higher consistency with disclosed limitations. Additionally, LLMs exhibit inherent flaws, such as potentially assigning higher ratings to incomplete papers compared to full papers and favoring well-known authors in single-blind review process. These findings highlight the risks of over-reliance on LLMs in peer review, underscoring that we are not yet ready for widespread adoption and emphasizing the need for robust safeguards.</description>

      <title>Commit0: Library Generation from Scratch</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the goal of benchmarking generative systems beyond expert software development ability, we introduce Commit0, a benchmark that challenges AI agents to write libraries from scratch. Agents are provided with a specification document outlining the library's API as well as a suite of interactive unit tests, with the goal of producing an implementation of this API accordingly. The implementation is validated through running these unit tests. As a benchmark, Commit0 is designed to move beyond static one-shot code generation towards agents that must process long-form natural language specifications, adapt to multi-stage feedback, and generate code with complex dependencies. Commit0 also offers an interactive environment where models receive static analysis and execution feedback on the code they generate. Our experiments demonstrate that while current agents can pass some unit tests, none can yet fully reproduce full libraries. Results also show that interactive feedback is quite useful for models to generate code that passes more unit tests, validating the benchmarks that facilitate its use.</description>

      <title>Robot Learning with Super-Linear Scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01770v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scaling robot learning requires data collection pipelines that scale favorably with human effort. In this work, we propose Crowdsourcing and Amortizing Human Effort for Real-to-Sim-to-Real(CASHER), a pipeline for scaling up data collection and learning in simulation where the performance scales superlinearly with human effort. The key idea is to crowdsource digital twins of real-world scenes using 3D reconstruction and collect large-scale data in simulation, rather than the real-world. Data collection in simulation is initially driven by RL, bootstrapped with human demonstrations. As the training of a generalist policy progresses across environments, its generalization capabilities can be used to replace human effort with model generated demonstrations. This results in a pipeline where behavioral data is collected in simulation with continually reducing human effort. We show that CASHER demonstrates zero-shot and few-shot scaling laws on three real-world tasks across diverse scenarios. We show that CASHER enables fine-tuning of pre-trained policies to a target scenario using a video scan without any additional human effort.

      <description>arXiv:2412.01778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce HackSynth, a novel Large Language Model (LLM)-based agent capable of autonomous penetration testing. HackSynth's dual-module architecture includes a Planner and a Summarizer, which enable it to generate commands and process feedback iteratively. To benchmark HackSynth, we propose two new Capture The Flag (CTF)-based benchmark sets utilizing the popular platforms PicoCTF and OverTheWire. These benchmarks include two hundred challenges across diverse domains and difficulties, providing a standardized framework for evaluating LLM-based penetration testing agents. Based on these benchmarks, extensive experiments are presented, analyzing the core parameters of HackSynth, including creativity (temperature and top-p) and token utilization. Multiple open source and proprietary LLMs were used to measure the agent's capabilities. The experiments show that the agent performed best with the GPT-4o model, better than what the GPT-4o's system card suggests. We also discuss the safety and predictability of HackSynth's actions. Our findings indicate the potential of LLM-based agents in advancing autonomous penetration testing and the importance of robust safeguards. HackSynth and the benchmarks are publicly available to foster research on autonomous cybersecurity solutions.</description>

      <title>Identifying Reliable Predictions in Detection Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: DEtection TRansformer (DETR) has emerged as a promising architecture for object detection, offering an end-to-end prediction pipeline. In practice, however, DETR generates hundreds of predictions that far outnumber the actual number of objects present in an image. This raises the question: can we trust and use all of these predictions? Addressing this concern, we present empirical evidence highlighting how different predictions within the same image play distinct roles, resulting in varying reliability levels across those predictions. More specifically, while multiple predictions are often made for a single object, our findings show that most often one such prediction is well-calibrated, and the others are poorly calibrated. Based on these insights, we demonstrate identifying a reliable subset of DETR's predictions is crucial for accurately assessing the reliability of the model at both object and image levels.
  Building on this viewpoint, we first tackle the shortcomings of widely used performance and calibration metrics, such as average precision and various forms of expected calibration error. Specifically, they are inadequate for determining which subset of DETR's predictions should be trusted and utilized. In response, we present Object-level Calibration Error (OCE), which is capable of assessing the calibration quality both across different models and among various configurations within a specific model. As a final contribution, we introduce a post hoc Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) framework that predicts the accuracy of the model on a per-image basis. By contrasting the average confidence scores of positive (i.e., likely to be matched) and negative predictions determined by OCE, the framework assesses the reliability of the DETR model for each test image.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent generative models based on score matching and flow matching have significantly advanced generation tasks, but their potential in discriminative tasks remains underexplored. Previous approaches, such as generative classifiers, have not fully leveraged the capabilities of these models for discriminative tasks due to their intricate designs. We propose Pretrained Reversible Generation (PRG), which extracts unsupervised representations by reversing the generative process of a pretrained continuous flow model. PRG effectively reuses unsupervised generative models, leveraging their high capacity to serve as robust and generalizable feature extractors for downstream tasks. Our method consistently outperforms prior approaches across multiple benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art performance among generative model-based methods, including 78\% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet. Extensive ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Spectral Graph Convolutional Networks (SpecGCNs) have led to state-of-the-art performance in various graph representation learning tasks. To exploit the potential of SpecGCNs, we analyze corresponding graph filters via polynomial interpolation, the cornerstone of graph signal processing. Different polynomial bases, such as Bernstein, Chebyshev, and monomial basis, have various convergence rates that will affect the error in polynomial interpolation. Although adopting Chebyshev basis for interpolation can minimize maximum error, the performance of ChebNet is still weaker than GPR-GNN and BernNet. \textbf{We point out it is caused by the Gibbs phenomenon, which occurs when the graph frequency response function approximates the target function.} It reduces the approximation ability of a truncated polynomial interpolation. In order to mitigate the Gibbs phenomenon, we propose to add the Gibbs damping factor with each term of Chebyshev polynomials on ChebNet. As a result, our lightweight approach leads to a significant performance boost. Afterwards, we reorganize ChebNet via decoupling feature propagation and transformation. We name this variant as \textbf{ChebGibbsNet}. Our experiments indicate that ChebGibbsNet is superior to other advanced SpecGCNs, such as GPR-GNN and BernNet, in both homogeneous graphs and heterogeneous graphs.</description>

      <title>IQA-Adapter: Exploring Knowledge Transfer from Image Quality Assessment to Diffusion-based Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion-based models have recently transformed conditional image generation, achieving unprecedented fidelity in generating photorealistic and semantically accurate images. However, consistently generating high-quality images remains challenging, partly due to the lack of mechanisms for conditioning outputs on perceptual quality. In this work, we propose methods to integrate image quality assessment (IQA) models into diffusion-based generators, enabling quality-aware image generation. First, we experiment with gradient-based guidance to optimize image quality directly and show this approach has limited generalizability. To address this, we introduce IQA-Adapter, a novel architecture that conditions generation on target quality levels by learning the relationship between images and quality scores. When conditioned on high target quality, IQA-Adapter shifts the distribution of generated images towards a higher-quality subdomain. This approach achieves up to a 10% improvement across multiple objective metrics, as confirmed by a subjective study, while preserving generative diversity and content. Additionally, IQA-Adapter can be used inversely as a degradation model, generating progressively more distorted images when conditioned on lower quality scores. Our quality-aware methods also provide insights into the adversarial robustness of IQA models, underscoring the potential of quality conditioning in generative modeling and the importance of robust IQA methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rise of intelligent autonomous systems, especially in robotics and autonomous agents, has created a critical need for robust communication middleware that can ensure real-time processing of extensive sensor data. Current robotics middleware like Robot Operating System (ROS) 2 faces challenges with nondeterminism and high communication latency when dealing with large data across multiple subscribers on a multi-core compute platform. To address these issues, we present High-Performance Robotic Middleware (HPRM), built on top of the deterministic coordination language Lingua Franca (LF). HPRM employs optimizations including an in-memory object store for efficient zero-copy transfer of large payloads, adaptive serialization to minimize serialization overhead, and an eager protocol with real-time sockets to reduce handshake latency. Benchmarks show HPRM achieves up to 173x lower latency than ROS2 when broadcasting large messages to multiple nodes. We then demonstrate the benefits of HPRM by integrating it with the CARLA simulator and running reinforcement learning agents along with object detection workloads. In the CARLA autonomous driving application, HPRM attains 91.1% lower latency than ROS2. The deterministic coordination semantics of HPRM, combined with its optimized IPC mechanisms, enable efficient and predictable real-time communication for intelligent autonomous systems.</description>

      <title>Random Tree Model of Meaningful Memory</title>

Abstract: Traditional studies of memory for meaningful narratives focus on specific stories and their semantic structures but do not address common quantitative features of recall across different narratives. We introduce a statistical ensemble of random trees to represent narratives as hierarchies of key points, where each node is a compressed representation of its descendant leaves, which are the original narrative segments. Recall is modeled as constrained by working memory capacity from this hierarchical structure. Our analytical solution aligns with observations from large-scale narrative recall experiments. Specifically, our model explains that (1) average recall length increases sublinearly with narrative length, and (2) individuals summarize increasingly longer narrative segments in each recall sentence. Additionally, the theory predicts that for sufficiently long narratives, a universal, scale-invariant limit emerges, where the fraction of a narrative summarized by a single recall sentence follows a distribution independent of narrative length.</description>

      <title>COSMOS: Cross-Modality Self-Distillation for Vision Language Pre-training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) trained with contrastive loss have achieved significant advancements in various vision and language tasks. However, the global nature of contrastive loss makes VLMs focus predominantly on foreground objects, neglecting other crucial information in the image, which limits their effectiveness in downstream tasks. To address these challenges, we propose COSMOS: CrOSs-MOdality Self-distillation for vision-language pre-training that integrates a novel text-cropping strategy and cross-attention module into a self-supervised learning framework. We create global and local views of images and texts (i.e., multi-modal augmentations), which are essential for self-distillation in VLMs. We further introduce a cross-attention module, enabling COSMOS to learn comprehensive cross-modal representations optimized via a cross-modality self-distillation loss. COSMOS consistently outperforms previous strong baselines on various zero-shot downstream tasks, including retrieval, classification, and semantic segmentation. Additionally, it surpasses CLIP-based models trained on larger datasets in visual perception and contextual understanding tasks.</description>

      <title>[CLS] Attention is All You Need for Training-Free Visual Token Pruning: Make VLM Inference Faster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) often rely on a substantial number of visual tokens when interacting with large language models (LLMs), which has proven to be inefficient. Recent efforts have aimed to accelerate VLM inference by pruning visual tokens. Most existing methods assess the importance of visual tokens based on the text-visual cross-attentions in LLMs. In this study, we find that the cross-attentions between text and visual tokens in LLMs are inaccurate. Pruning tokens based on these inaccurate attentions leads to significant performance degradation, especially at high reduction ratios. To this end, we introduce FasterVLM, a simple yet effective training-free visual token pruning method that evaluates the importance of visual tokens more accurately by utilizing attentions between the [CLS] token and image tokens from the visual encoder. Since FasterVLM eliminates redundant visual tokens immediately after the visual encoder, ensuring they do not interact with LLMs and resulting in faster VLM inference. It is worth noting that, benefiting from the accuracy of [CLS] cross-attentions, FasterVLM can prune 95\% of visual tokens while maintaining 90\% of the performance of LLaVA-1.5-7B. We apply FasterVLM to various VLMs, including LLaVA-1.5, LLaVA-NeXT, and Video-LLaVA, to demonstrate its effectiveness. Experimental results show that our FasterVLM maintains strong performance across various VLM architectures and reduction ratios, significantly outperforming existing text-visual attention-based methods.

      <title>X-Prompt: Towards Universal In-Context Image Generation in Auto-Regressive Vision Language Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In-context generation is a key component of large language models' (LLMs) open-task generalization capability. By leveraging a few examples as context, LLMs can perform both in-domain and out-of-domain tasks. Recent advancements in auto-regressive vision-language models (VLMs) built upon LLMs have showcased impressive performance in text-to-image generation. However, the potential of in-context learning for general image generation tasks remains largely unexplored. To address this, we introduce X-Prompt, a purely auto-regressive large-vision language model designed to deliver competitive performance across a wide range of both seen and unseen image generation tasks, all within a unified in-context learning framework. X-Prompt incorporates a specialized design that efficiently compresses valuable features from in-context examples, supporting longer in-context token sequences and improving its ability to generalize to unseen tasks. A unified training task for both text and image prediction enables X-Prompt to handle general image generation with enhanced task awareness from in-context examples. Extensive experiments validate the model's performance across diverse seen image generation tasks and its capacity to generalize to previously unseen tasks.</description>

      <title>RandAR: Decoder-only Autoregressive Visual Generation in Random Orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01827v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce RandAR, a decoder-only visual autoregressive (AR) model capable of generating images in arbitrary token orders. Unlike previous decoder-only AR models that rely on a predefined generation order, RandAR removes this inductive bias, unlocking new capabilities in decoder-only generation. Our essential design enables random order by inserting a "position instruction token" before each image token to be predicted, representing the spatial location of the next image token. Trained on randomly permuted token sequences -- a more challenging task than fixed-order generation, RandAR achieves comparable performance to its conventional raster-order counterpart. More importantly, decoder-only transformers trained from random orders acquire new capabilities. For the efficiency bottleneck of AR models, RandAR adopts parallel decoding with KV-Cache at inference time, enjoying 2.5x acceleration without sacrificing generation quality. Additionally, RandAR supports inpainting, outpainting and resolution extrapolation in a zero-shot manner. We hope RandAR inspires new directions for decoder-only visual generation models and broadens their applications across diverse scenarios.

Abstract: This report surveys the landscape of potential security threats from malicious uses of AI, and proposes ways to better forecast, prevent, and mitigate these threats. After analyzing the ways in which AI may influence the threat landscape in the digital, physical, and political domains, we make four high-level recommendations for AI researchers and other stakeholders. We also suggest several promising areas for further research that could expand the portfolio of defenses, or make attacks less effective or harder to execute. Finally, we discuss, but do not conclusively resolve, the long-term equilibrium of attackers and defenders.</description>

      <title>MM-Vet: Evaluating Large Multimodal Models for Integrated Capabilities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.02490v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose MM-Vet, an evaluation benchmark that examines large multimodal models (LMMs) on complicated multimodal tasks. Recent LMMs have shown various intriguing abilities, such as solving math problems written on the blackboard, reasoning about events and celebrities in news images, and explaining visual jokes. Rapid model advancements pose challenges to evaluation benchmark development. Problems include: (1) How to systematically structure and evaluate the complicated multimodal tasks; (2) How to design evaluation metrics that work well across question and answer types; and (3) How to give model insights beyond a simple performance ranking. To this end, we present MM-Vet, designed based on the insight that the intriguing ability to solve complicated tasks is often achieved by a generalist model being able to integrate different core vision-language (VL) capabilities. MM-Vet defines 6 core VL capabilities and examines the 16 integrations of interest derived from the capability combination. For evaluation metrics, we propose an LLM-based evaluator for open-ended outputs. The evaluator enables the evaluation across different question types and answer styles, resulting in a unified scoring metric. We evaluate representative LMMs on MM-Vet, providing insights into the capabilities of different LMM system paradigms and models.</description>

      <title>NoisyNN: Exploring the Impact of Information Entropy Change in Learning Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.10625v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of entropy change in deep learning systems by noise injection at different levels, including the embedding space and the image. The series of models that employ our methodology are collectively known as Noisy Neural Networks (NoisyNN), with examples such as NoisyViT and NoisyCNN. Noise is conventionally viewed as a harmful perturbation in various deep learning architectures, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs), as well as different learning tasks like image classification and transfer learning. However, this work shows noise can be an effective way to change the entropy of the learning system. We demonstrate that specific noise can boost the performance of various deep models under certain conditions. We theoretically prove the enhancement gained from positive noise by reducing the task complexity defined by information entropy and experimentally show the significant performance gain in large image datasets, such as the ImageNet. Herein, we use the information entropy to define the complexity of the task. We categorize the noise into two types, positive noise (PN) and harmful noise (HN), based on whether the noise can help reduce the task complexity. Extensive experiments of CNNs and ViTs have shown performance improvements by proactively injecting positive noise, where we achieved an unprecedented top 1 accuracy of 95$\%$ on ImageNet. Both theoretical analysis and empirical evidence have confirmed that the presence of positive noise, can benefit the learning process, while the traditionally perceived harmful noise indeed impairs deep learning models. The different roles of noise offer new explanations for deep models on specific tasks and provide a new paradigm for improving model performance. Moreover, it reminds us that we can influence the performance of learning systems via information entropy change.</description>

      <title>Learning Reward and Policy Jointly from Demonstration and Preference Improves Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06874v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Aligning human preference and value is an important requirement for building contemporary foundation models and embodied AI. However, popular approaches such as reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) break down the task into successive stages, such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT), reward modeling (RM), and reinforcement learning (RL), each performing one specific learning task. Such a sequential approach results in serious issues such as significant under-utilization of data and distribution mismatch between the learned reward model and generated policy, which eventually lead to poor alignment performance. We develop a single stage approach named Alignment with Integrated Human Feedback (AIHF), capable of integrating both human preference and demonstration to train reward models and the policy. The proposed approach admits a suite of efficient algorithms, which can easily reduce to, and leverage, popular alignment algorithms such as RLHF and Directly Policy Optimization (DPO), and only requires minor changes to the existing alignment pipelines. We demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed solutions with extensive experiments involving alignment problems in LLMs and robotic control problems in MuJoCo. We observe that the proposed solutions outperform the existing alignment algorithms such as RLHF and DPO by large margins, especially when the amount of high-quality preference data is relatively limited.</description>

      <title>Atari-GPT: Benchmarking Multimodal Large Language Models as Low-Level Policies in Atari Games</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15950v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have expanded their capabilities beyond traditional text-based tasks to multimodal domains, integrating visual, auditory, and textual data. While multimodal LLMs have been extensively explored for high-level planning in domains like robotics and games, their potential as low-level controllers remains largely untapped. In this paper, we introduce a novel benchmark aimed at testing the emergent capabilities of multimodal LLMs as low-level policies in Atari games. Unlike traditional reinforcement learning (RL) methods that require training for each new environment and reward function specification, these LLMs utilize pre-existing multimodal knowledge to directly engage with game environments. Our study assesses the performances of multiple multimodal LLMs against traditional RL agents, human players, and random agents, focusing on their ability to understand and interact with complex visual scenes and formulate strategic responses. Our results show that these multimodal LLMs are not yet capable of being zero-shot low-level policies. Furthermore, we see that this is, in part, due to their visual and spatial reasoning. Additional results and videos are available on our project webpage: https://dev1nw.github.io/atari-gpt/.</description>

      <title>MLLM-LLaVA-FL: Multimodal Large Language Model Assisted Federated Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06067v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Previous studies on federated learning (FL) often encounter performance degradation due to data heterogeneity among different clients. In light of the recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), such as GPT-4v and LLaVA, which demonstrate their exceptional proficiency in multimodal tasks, such as image captioning and multimodal question answering. We introduce a novel federated learning framework, named Multimodal Large Language Model Assisted Federated Learning (MLLM-LLaVA-FL), which employs powerful MLLMs at the server end to address the heterogeneous and long-tailed challenges. Owing to the advanced cross-modality representation capabilities and the extensive open-vocabulary prior knowledge of MLLMs, our framework is adept at harnessing the extensive, yet previously underexploited, open-source data accessible from websites and powerful server-side computational resources. Hence, the MLLM-LLaVA-FL not only enhances the performance but also avoids increasing the risk of privacy leakage and the computational burden on local devices, distinguishing it from prior methodologies. Our framework has three key stages. Initially, we conduct global visual-text pretraining of the model. This pretraining is facilitated by utilizing the extensive open-source data available online, with the assistance of MLLMs. Subsequently, the pretrained model is distributed among various clients for local training. Finally, once the locally trained models are transmitted back to the server, a global alignment is carried out under the supervision of MLLMs to further enhance the performance. Experimental evaluations on established benchmarks, show that our framework delivers promising performance in the typical scenarios with data heterogeneity and long-tail distribution across different clients in FL.</description>

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated promising capabilities across various tasks by integrating textual and visual information to achieve visual understanding in complex scenarios. Despite the availability of several benchmarks aims to evaluating MLLMs in tasks from visual question answering to complex problem-solving, most focus predominantly on mathematics or general visual understanding tasks. This reveals a critical gap in current benchmarks, which often overlook the inclusion of other key scientific disciplines such as physics and chemistry. To address this gap, we meticulously construct a comprehensive benchmark, named VisScience, which is utilized to assess the multi-modal scientific reasoning across the three disciplines of mathematics, physics, and chemistry. This benchmark comprises 3,000 questions drawn from K12 education - spanning elementary school through high school - equally distributed across three disciplines, with 1,000 questions per discipline. The questions within VisScience span 21 distinct subjects and are categorized into five difficulty levels, offering a broad spectrum of topics within each discipline. With VisScience, we present a detailed evaluation of the performance of 25 representative MLLMs in scientific reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate that closed-source MLLMs generally outperform open-source models. The best performance observed include a 53.4\% accuracy in mathematics by Claude3.5-Sonnet, 38.2\% in physics by GPT-4o, and 47.0\% in chemistry by Gemini-1.5-Pro. These results underscore the strengths and limitations of MLLMs, suggesting areas for future improvement and highlighting the importance of developing models that can effectively handle the diverse demands of multi-modal scientific reasoning.</description>

      <title>A Survey on Large Language Model-empowered Autonomous Driving</title>

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) plays a crucial role in autonomous driving (AD) research, propelling its development towards intelligence and efficiency. Currently, the development of AD technology follows two main technical paths: modularization and end-to-end. Modularization decompose the driving task into modules such as perception, prediction, planning, and control, and train them separately. Due to the inconsistency of training objectives between modules, the integrated effect suffers from bias. End-to-end attempts to address this issue by utilizing a single model that directly maps from sensor data to control signals. This path has limited learning capabilities in a comprehensive set of features and struggles to handle unpredictable long-tail events and complex urban traffic scenarios. In the face of challenges encountered in both paths, many researchers believe that large language models (LLMs) with powerful reasoning capabilities and extensive knowledge understanding may be the solution, expecting LLMs to provide AD systems with deeper levels of understanding and decision-making capabilities. In light of the challenges faced by both paths, many researchers believe that LLMs, with their powerful reasoning abilities and extensive knowledge, could offer a solution. To understand if LLMs could enhance AD, this paper conducts a thorough analysis of the potential applications of LLMs in AD systems, including exploring their optimization strategies in both modular and end-to-end approaches, with a particular focus on how LLMs can tackle the problems and challenges present in current solutions. Furthermore, we discuss an important question: Can LLM-based artificial general intelligence (AGI) be a key to achieve high-level AD? We further analyze the potential limitations and challenges that LLMs may encounter in promoting the development of AD technology.</description>

      <title>Enriching Ontologies with Disjointness Axioms using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03235v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ontologies often lack explicit disjointness declarations between classes, despite their usefulness for sophisticated reasoning and consistency checking in Knowledge Graphs. In this study, we explore the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to enrich ontologies by identifying and asserting class disjointness axioms. Our approach aims at leveraging the implicit knowledge embedded in LLMs, using prompt engineering to elicit this knowledge for classifying ontological disjointness. We validate our methodology on the DBpedia ontology, focusing on open-source LLMs. Our findings suggest that LLMs, when guided by effective prompt strategies, can reliably identify disjoint class relationships, thus streamlining the process of ontology completion without extensive manual input. For comprehensive disjointness enrichment, we propose a process that takes logical relationships between disjointness and subclass statements into account in order to maintain satisfiability and reduce the number of calls to the LLM. This work provides a foundation for future applications of LLMs in automated ontology enhancement and offers insights into optimizing LLM performance through strategic prompt design. Our code is publicly available on GitHub at https://github.com/n28div/llm-disjointness.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05285v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various domains, gaining extensive attention from academia and industry. However, these agents raise significant concerns on AI safety due to their autonomous and non-deterministic behavior, as well as continuous evolving nature . From a DevOps perspective, enabling observability in agents is necessary to ensuring AI safety, as stakeholders can gain insights into the agents' inner workings, allowing them to proactively understand the agents, detect anomalies, and prevent potential failures. Therefore, in this paper, we present a comprehensive taxonomy of AgentOps, identifying the artifacts and associated data that should be traced throughout the entire lifecycle of agents to achieve effective observability. The taxonomy is developed based on a systematic mapping study of existing AgentOps tools. Our taxonomy serves as a reference template for developers to design and implement AgentOps infrastructure that supports monitoring, logging, and analytics. thereby ensuring AI safety.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17912v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) increasingly integrate into vehicle navigation systems, understanding their path-planning capability is crucial. We tested three LLMs through six real-world path-planning scenarios in various settings and with various difficulties. Our experiments showed that all LLMs made numerous errors in all scenarios, revealing that they are unreliable path planners. We suggest that future work focus on implementing mechanisms for reality checks, enhancing model transparency, and developing smaller models.</description>

      <title>DUET: A Tuning-Free Device-Cloud Collaborative Parameters Generation Framework for Efficient Device Model Generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.05227v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Device Model Generalization (DMG) is a practical yet under-investigated research topic for on-device machine learning applications. It aims to improve the generalization ability of pre-trained models when deployed on resource-constrained devices, such as improving the performance of pre-trained cloud models on smart mobiles. While quite a lot of works have investigated the data distribution shift across clouds and devices, most of them focus on model fine-tuning on personalized data for individual devices to facilitate DMG. Despite their promising, these approaches require on-device re-training, which is practically infeasible due to the overfitting problem and high time delay when performing gradient calculation on real-time data. In this paper, we argue that the computational cost brought by fine-tuning can be rather unnecessary. We consequently present a novel perspective to improving DMG without increasing computational cost, i.e., device-specific parameter generation which directly maps data distribution to parameters. Specifically, we propose an efficient Device-cloUd collaborative parametErs generaTion framework DUET. DUET is deployed on a powerful cloud server that only requires the low cost of forwarding propagation and low time delay of data transmission between the device and the cloud. By doing so, DUET can rehearse the device-specific model weight realizations conditioned on the personalized real-time data for an individual device. Importantly, our DUET elegantly connects the cloud and device as a 'duet' collaboration, frees the DMG from fine-tuning, and enables a faster and more accurate DMG paradigm. We conduct an extensive experimental study of DUET on three public datasets, and the experimental results confirm our framework's effectiveness and generalisability for different DMG tasks.</description>

      <title>MetaFormer Baselines for Vision</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.13452v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: MetaFormer, the abstracted architecture of Transformer, has been found to play a significant role in achieving competitive performance. In this paper, we further explore the capacity of MetaFormer, again, without focusing on token mixer design: we introduce several baseline models under MetaFormer using the most basic or common mixers, and summarize our observations as follows: (1) MetaFormer ensures solid lower bound of performance. By merely adopting identity mapping as the token mixer, the MetaFormer model, termed IdentityFormer, achieves &gt;80% accuracy on ImageNet-1K. (2) MetaFormer works well with arbitrary token mixers. When specifying the token mixer as even a random matrix to mix tokens, the resulting model RandFormer yields an accuracy of &gt;81%, outperforming IdentityFormer. Rest assured of MetaFormer's results when new token mixers are adopted. (3) MetaFormer effortlessly offers state-of-the-art results. With just conventional token mixers dated back five years ago, the models instantiated from MetaFormer already beat state of the art. (a) ConvFormer outperforms ConvNeXt. Taking the common depthwise separable convolutions as the token mixer, the model termed ConvFormer, which can be regarded as pure CNNs, outperforms the strong CNN model ConvNeXt. (b) CAFormer sets new record on ImageNet-1K. By simply applying depthwise separable convolutions as token mixer in the bottom stages and vanilla self-attention in the top stages, the resulting model CAFormer sets a new record on ImageNet-1K: it achieves an accuracy of 85.5% at 224x224 resolution, under normal supervised training without external data or distillation. In our expedition to probe MetaFormer, we also find that a new activation, StarReLU, reduces 71% FLOPs of activation compared with GELU yet achieves better performance. We expect StarReLU to find great potential in MetaFormer-like models alongside other neural networks.</description>

      <title>Intelligent Model Update Strategy for Sequential Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.07335v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern online platforms are increasingly employing recommendation systems to address information overload and improve user engagement. There is an evolving paradigm in this research field that recommendation network learning occurs both on the cloud and on edges with knowledge transfer in between (i.e., edge-cloud collaboration). Recent works push this field further by enabling edge-specific context-aware adaptivity, where model parameters are updated in real-time based on incoming on-edge data. However, we argue that frequent data exchanges between the cloud and edges often lead to inefficiency and waste of communication/computation resources, as considerable parameter updates might be redundant. To investigate this problem, we introduce Intelligent Edge-Cloud Parameter Request Model, abbreviated as IntellectReq.
  IntellectReq is designed to operate on edge, evaluating the cost-benefit landscape of parameter requests with minimal computation and communication overhead. We formulate this as a novel learning task, aimed at the detection of out-of-distribution data, thereby fine-tuning adaptive communication strategies. Further, we employ statistical mapping techniques to convert real-time user behavior into a normal distribution, thereby employing multi-sample outputs to quantify the model's uncertainty and thus its generalization capabilities. Rigorous empirical validation on four widely-adopted benchmarks evaluates our approach, evidencing a marked improvement in the efficiency and generalizability of edge-cloud collaborative and dynamic recommendation systems.</description>

      <title>Rotation Invariant Quantization for Model Compression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.03106v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Post-training Neural Network (NN) model compression is an attractive approach for deploying large, memory-consuming models on devices with limited memory resources. In this study, we investigate the rate-distortion tradeoff for NN model compression. First, we suggest a Rotation-Invariant Quantization (RIQ) technique that utilizes a single parameter to quantize the entire NN model, yielding a different rate at each layer, i.e., mixed-precision quantization. Then, we prove that our rotation-invariant approach is optimal in terms of compression. We rigorously evaluate RIQ and demonstrate its capabilities on various models and tasks. For example, RIQ facilitates $\times 19.4$ and $\times 52.9$ compression ratios on pre-trained VGG dense and pruned models, respectively, with $&lt;0.4\%$ accuracy degradation. Code is available in \href{https://github.com/ehaleva/RIQ}{github.com/ehaleva/RIQ}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.16668v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current defense mechanisms against model poisoning attacks in federated learning (FL) systems have proven effective up to a certain threshold of malicious clients. In this work, we introduce FLANDERS, a novel pre-aggregation filter for FL resilient to large-scale model poisoning attacks, i.e., when malicious clients far exceed legitimate participants. FLANDERS treats the sequence of local models sent by clients in each FL round as a matrix-valued time series. Then, it identifies malicious client updates as outliers in this time series by comparing actual observations with estimates generated by a matrix autoregressive forecasting model maintained by the server. Experiments conducted in several non-iid FL setups show that FLANDERS significantly improves robustness across a wide spectrum of attacks when paired with standard and robust existing aggregation methods.</description>

      <title>Estimating Continuous Muscle Fatigue For Multi-Muscle Coordinated Exercise: A Pilot Study on Walking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.17614v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Assessing the progression of muscle fatigue for daily exercises provides vital indicators for precise rehabilitation, personalized training dose, especially under the context of Metaverse. Assessing fatigue of multi-muscle coordination-involved daily exercises requires the neuromuscular features that represent the fatigue-induced characteristics of spatiotemporal adaptions of multiple muscles and the estimator that captures the time-evolving progression of fatigue. In this paper, we propose to depict fatigue by the features of muscle compensation and spinal module activation changes and estimate continuous fatigue by a physiological rationale model. First, we extract muscle synergy fractionation and the variance of spinal module spikings as features inspired by the prior of fatigue-induced neuromuscular adaptations. Second, we treat the features as observations and develop a Bayesian Gaussian process to capture the time-evolving progression. Third, we solve the issue of lacking supervision information by mathematically formulating the time-evolving characteristics of fatigue as the loss function. Finally, we adapt the metrics that follow the physiological principles of fatigue to quantitatively evaluate the performance. Our extensive experiments present a 0.99 similarity between days, a over 0.7 similarity with other views of fatigue and a nearly 1 weak monotonicity, which outperform other methods. This study would aim the objective assessment of muscle fatigue.</description>

Abstract: Language-queried audio source separation (LASS) is a new paradigm for computational auditory scene analysis (CASA). LASS aims to separate a target sound from an audio mixture given a natural language query, which provides a natural and scalable interface for digital audio applications. Recent works on LASS, despite attaining promising separation performance on specific sources (e.g., musical instruments, limited classes of audio events), are unable to separate audio concepts in the open domain. In this work, we introduce AudioSep, a foundation model for open-domain audio source separation with natural language queries. We train AudioSep on large-scale multimodal datasets and extensively evaluate its capabilities on numerous tasks including audio event separation, musical instrument separation, and speech enhancement. AudioSep demonstrates strong separation performance and impressive zero-shot generalization ability using audio captions or text labels as queries, substantially outperforming previous audio-queried and language-queried sound separation models. For reproducibility of this work, we will release the source code, evaluation benchmark and pre-trained model at: https://github.com/Audio-AGI/AudioSep.</description>

      <title>Support-Set Context Matters for Bongard Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.03468v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current machine learning methods struggle to solve Bongard problems, which are a type of IQ test that requires deriving an abstract "concept" from a set of positive and negative "support" images, and then classifying whether or not a new query image depicts the key concept. On Bongard-HOI, a benchmark for natural-image Bongard problems, most existing methods have reached at best 69% accuracy (where chance is 50%). Low accuracy is often attributed to neural nets' lack of ability to find human-like symbolic rules. In this work, we point out that many existing methods are forfeiting accuracy due to a much simpler problem: they do not adapt image features given information contained in the support set as a whole, and rely instead on information extracted from individual supports. This is a critical issue, because the "key concept" in a typical Bongard problem can often only be distinguished using multiple positives and multiple negatives. We explore simple methods to incorporate this context and show substantial gains over prior works, leading to new state-of-the-art accuracy on Bongard-LOGO (75.3%) and Bongard-HOI (76.4%) compared to methods with equivalent vision backbone architectures and strong performance on the original Bongard problem set (60.8%).</description>

      <title>Batch Calibration: Rethinking Calibration for In-Context Learning and Prompt Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17249</link>

Abstract: Prompting and in-context learning (ICL) have become efficient learning paradigms for large language models (LLMs). However, LLMs suffer from prompt brittleness and various bias factors in the prompt, including but not limited to the formatting, the choice verbalizers, and the ICL examples. To address this problem that results in unexpected performance degradation, calibration methods have been developed to mitigate the effects of these biases while recovering LLM performance. In this work, we first conduct a systematic analysis of the existing calibration methods, where we both provide a unified view and reveal the failure cases. Inspired by these analyses, we propose Batch Calibration (BC), a simple yet intuitive method that controls the contextual bias from the batched input, unifies various prior approaches, and effectively addresses the aforementioned issues. BC is zero-shot, inference-only, and incurs negligible additional costs. In the few-shot setup, we further extend BC to allow it to learn the contextual bias from labeled data. We validate the effectiveness of BC with PaLM 2-(S, M, L) and CLIP models and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance over previous calibration baselines across more than 10 natural language understanding and image classification tasks.</description>

      <title>Topology Only Pre-Training: Towards Generalised Multi-Domain Graph Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.03976v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The principal benefit of unsupervised representation learning is that a pre-trained model can be fine-tuned where data or labels are scarce. Existing approaches for graph representation learning are domain specific, maintaining consistent node and edge features across the pre-training and target datasets. This has precluded transfer to multiple domains. We present Topology Only Pre-Training (ToP), a graph pre-training method based on node and edge feature exclusion. We show positive transfer on evaluation datasets from multiple domains, including domains not present in pre-training data, running directly contrary to assumptions made in contemporary works. On 75% of experiments, ToP models perform significantly $p \leq 0.01$ better than a supervised baseline. Performance is significantly positive on 85.7% of tasks when node and edge features are used in fine-tuning. We further show that out-of-domain topologies can produce more useful pre-training than in-domain. Under ToP we show better transfer from non-molecule pre-training, compared to molecule pre-training, on 79% of molecular benchmarks. Against the limited set of other generalist graph models ToP performs strongly, including against models with many orders of magnitude larger. These findings show that ToP opens broad areas of research in both transfer learning on scarcely populated graph domains and in graph foundation models.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive framework for evaluation of deep neural networks in detection and quantification of lymphoma from PET/CT images: clinical insights, pitfalls, and observer agreement analyses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09614v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study addresses critical gaps in automated lymphoma segmentation from PET/CT images, focusing on issues often overlooked in existing literature. While deep learning has been applied for lymphoma lesion segmentation, few studies incorporate out-of-distribution testing, raising concerns about model generalizability across diverse imaging conditions and patient populations. We highlight the need to compare model performance with expert human annotators, including intra- and inter-observer variability, to understand task difficulty better. Most approaches focus on overall segmentation accuracy but overlook lesion-specific metrics important for precise lesion detection and disease quantification.To address these gaps, we propose a clinically-relevant framework for evaluating deep neural networks. Using this lesion-specific evaluation, we assess the performance of four deep segmentation networks (ResUNet, SegResNet, DynUNet, and SwinUNETR) across 611 cases from multi-institutional datasets, covering various lymphoma subtypes and lesion characteristics. Beyond standard metrics like the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), we evaluate clinical lesion measures and their prediction errors. We also introduce detection criteria for lesion localization and propose a new detection Criterion 3 based on metabolic characteristics. We show that networks perform better on large, intense lesions with higher metabolic activity.Finally, we compare network performance to expert human observers via intra- and inter-observer variability analyses, demonstrating that network errors closely resemble those made by experts. Some small, faint lesions remain challenging for both humans and networks. This study aims to improve automated lesion segmentation's clinical relevance, supporting better treatment decisions for lymphoma patients.

      <description>arXiv:2311.18328v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern artificial intelligence offers a novel and transformative approach to creating digital art across diverse styles and modalities like images, videos and 3D data, unleashing the power of creativity and revolutionizing the way that we perceive and interact with visual content. This paper reports on recent advances in stylized 3D asset creation and manipulation with the expressive power of neural networks. We establish a taxonomy for neural stylization, considering crucial design choices such as scene representation, guidance data, optimization strategies, and output styles. Building on such taxonomy, our survey first revisits the background of neural stylization on 2D images, and then presents in-depth discussions on recent neural stylization methods for 3D data, accompanied by a benchmark evaluating selected mesh and neural field stylization methods. Based on the insights gained from the survey, we highlight the practical significance, open challenges, future research, and potential impacts of neural stylization, which facilitates researchers and practitioners to navigate the rapidly evolving landscape of 3D content creation using modern artificial intelligence.</description>

      <title>MASP: Scalable GNN-based Planning for Multi-Agent Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02522v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate multi-agent navigation tasks, where multiple agents need to reach initially unassigned goals in a limited time. Classical planning-based methods suffer from expensive computation overhead at each step and offer limited expressiveness for complex cooperation strategies. In contrast, reinforcement learning (RL) has recently become a popular approach for addressing this issue. However, RL struggles with low data efficiency and cooperation when directly exploring (nearly) optimal policies in a large exploration space, especially with an increased number of agents(e.g., 10+ agents) or in complex environments (e.g., 3-D simulators). In this paper, we propose the Multi-Agent Scalable Graph-based Planner (MASP), a goal-conditioned hierarchical planner for navigation tasks with a substantial number of agents in the decentralized setting. MASP employs a hierarchical framework to reduce space complexity by decomposing a large exploration space into multiple goal-conditioned subspaces, where a high-level policy assigns agents goals, and a low-level policy navigates agents toward designated goals. For agent cooperation and the adaptation to varying team sizes, we model agents and goals as graphs to better capture their relationship. The high-level policy, the Goal Matcher, leverages a graph-based Self-Encoder and Cross-Encoder to optimize goal assignment by updating the agent and the goal graphs. The low-level policy, the Coordinated Action Executor, introduces the Group Information Fusion to facilitate group division and extract agent relationships across groups, enhancing training efficiency for agent cooperation. The results demonstrate that MASP outperforms RL and planning-based baselines in task efficiency.</description>

      <title>Deep Dynamics: Vehicle Dynamics Modeling with a Physics-Constrained Neural Network for Autonomous Racing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04374v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autonomous racing is a critical research area for autonomous driving, presenting significant challenges in vehicle dynamics modeling, such as balancing model precision and computational efficiency at high speeds (&gt;280km/h), where minor errors in modeling have severe consequences. Existing physics-based models for vehicle dynamics require elaborate testing setups and tuning, which are hard to implement, time-intensive, and cost-prohibitive. Conversely, purely data-driven approaches do not generalize well and cannot adequately ensure physical constraints on predictions. This paper introduces Deep Dynamics, a physics-constrained neural network (PCNN) for vehicle dynamics modeling of an autonomous racecar. It combines physics coefficient estimation and dynamical equations to accurately predict vehicle states at high speeds and includes a unique Physics Guard layer to ensure internal coefficient estimates remain within their nominal physical ranges. Open-loop and closed-loop performance assessments, using a physics-based simulator and full-scale autonomous Indy racecar data, highlight Deep Dynamics as a promising approach for modeling racecar vehicle dynamics.</description>

      <title>On Meta-Prompting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.06562v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern generative language models are capable of interpreting input strings as instructions, or prompts, and carry out tasks based on them. Many approaches to prompting and pre-training these models involve the automated generation of these prompts: meta-prompting, or prompting to obtain prompts. We propose a theoretical framework based on category theory to generalize and describe them. This framework is flexible enough to account for stochasticity, and allows us to obtain formal results around task agnosticity and equivalence of various meta-prompting approaches. Experimentally, we test our framework in two active areas of model research: creativity and ideation. We find that user preference strongly favors (p &lt; 0.01) the prompts generated under meta-prompting, as well as their corresponding outputs, over a series of hardcoded baseline prompts that include the original task definition. Using our framework, we argue that meta-prompting is more effective than basic prompting at generating desirable outputs.</description>

      <title>Corn Yield Prediction Model with Deep Neural Networks for Smallholder Farmer Decision Support System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03768v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Crop yield prediction has been modeled on the assumption that there is no interaction between weather and soil variables. However, this paper argues that an interaction exists, and it can be finely modelled using the Kendall Correlation coefficient. Given the nonlinearity of the interaction between weather and soil variables, a deep neural network regressor (DNNR) is carefully designed with consideration to the depth, number of neurons of the hidden layers, and the hyperparameters with their optimizations. Additionally, a new metric, the average of absolute root squared error (ARSE) is proposed to combine the strengths of root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE). With the ARSE metric, the proposed DNNR(s), optimised random forest regressor (RFR) and the extreme gradient boosting regressor (XGBR) achieved impressively small yield errors, 0.0172 t/ha, and 0.0243 t/ha, 0.0001 t/ha, and 0.001 t/ha, respectively. However, the DNNR(s), with changes to the explanatory variables to ensure generalizability to unforeseen data, DNNR(s) performed best. Further analysis reveals that a strong interaction does exist between weather and soil variables. Precisely, yield is observed to increase when precipitation is reduced and silt increased, and vice-versa. However, the degree of decrease or increase is not quantified in this paper. Contrary to existing yield models targeted towards agricultural policies and global food security, the goal of the proposed corn yield model is to empower the smallholder farmer to farm smartly and intelligently, thus the prediction model is integrated into a mobile application that includes education, and a farmer-to-market access module.</description>

      <title>End-to-End Supervised Hierarchical Graph Clustering for Speaker Diarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12850v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Speaker diarization, the task of segmenting an audio recording based on speaker identity, constitutes an important speech pre-processing step for several downstream applications.The conventional approach to diarization involves multiple steps of embedding extraction and clustering, which are often optimized in an isolated fashion. While end-to-end diarization systems attempt to learn a single model for the task, they are often cumbersome to train and require large supervised datasets. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end supervised hierarchical clustering algorithm based on graph neural networks (GNN), called End-to-end Supervised HierARchical Clustering (E-SHARC). The embedding extractor is initialized using a pre-trained x-vector model while the GNN model is trained initially using the x-vector embeddings from the pre-trained model. Finally, the E-SHARC model uses the front-end mel-filterbank features as input and jointly optimizes the embedding extractor and the GNN clustering module, performing representation learning, metric learning, and clustering with end-to-end optimization. Further, with additional inputs from an external overlap detector, the E-SHARC approach is capable of predicting the speakers in the overlapping speech regions. The experimental evaluation on benchmark datasets like AMI, Voxconverse and DISPLACE, illustrates that the proposed E-SHARC framework provides competitive diarization results using graph based clustering methods.</description>

      <title>SongBsAb: A Dual Prevention Approach against Singing Voice Conversion based Illegal Song Covers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17133v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Singing voice conversion (SVC) automates song covers by converting a source singing voice from a source singer into a new singing voice with the same lyrics and melody as the source, but sounds like being covered by the target singer of some given target singing voices. However, it raises serious concerns about copyright and civil right infringements. We propose SongBsAb, the first proactive approach to tackle SVC-based illegal song covers. SongBsAb adds perturbations to singing voices before releasing them, so that when they are used, the process of SVC will be interfered, leading to unexpected singing voices. Perturbations are carefully crafted to (1) provide a dual prevention, i.e., preventing the singing voice from being used as the source and target singing voice in SVC, by proposing a gender-transformation loss and a high/low hierarchy multi-target loss, respectively; and (2) be harmless, i.e., no side-effect on the enjoyment of protected songs, by refining a psychoacoustic model-based loss with the backing track as an additional masker, a unique accompanying element for singing voices compared to ordinary speech voices. We also adopt a frame-level interaction reduction-based loss and encoder ensemble to enhance the transferability of SongBsAb to unknown SVC models. We demonstrate the prevention effectiveness, harmlessness, and robustness of SongBsAb on five diverse and promising SVC models, using both English and Chinese datasets, and both objective and human study-based subjective metrics. Our work fosters an emerging research direction for mitigating illegal automated song covers.</description>

      <title>Exploring Homogeneous and Heterogeneous Consistent Label Associations for Unsupervised Visible-Infrared Person ReID</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00672v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unsupervised visible-infrared person re-identification (USL-VI-ReID) endeavors to retrieve pedestrian images of the same identity from different modalities without annotations. While prior work focuses on establishing cross-modality pseudo-label associations to bridge the modality-gap, they ignore maintaining the instance-level homogeneous and heterogeneous consistency between the feature space and the pseudo-label space, resulting in coarse associations. In response, we introduce a Modality-Unified Label Transfer (MULT) module that simultaneously accounts for both homogeneous and heterogeneous fine-grained instance-level structures, yielding high-quality cross-modality label associations. It models both homogeneous and heterogeneous affinities, leveraging them to quantify the inconsistency between the pseudo-label space and the feature space, subsequently minimizing it. The proposed MULT ensures that the generated pseudo-labels maintain alignment across modalities while upholding structural consistency within intra-modality. Additionally, a straightforward plug-and-play Online Cross-memory Label Refinement (OCLR) module is proposed to further mitigate the side effects of noisy pseudo-labels while simultaneously aligning different modalities, coupled with an Alternative Modality-Invariant Representation Learning (AMIRL) framework. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art USL-VI-ReID methods, highlighting the superiority of our MULT in comparison to other cross-modality association methods.

      <title>An Information Theoretic Approach to Machine Unlearning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01401v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To comply with AI and data regulations, the need to forget private or copyrighted information from trained machine learning models is increasingly important. The key challenge in unlearning is forgetting the necessary data in a timely manner, while preserving model performance. In this work, we address the zero-shot unlearning scenario, whereby an unlearning algorithm must be able to remove data given only a trained model and the data to be forgotten. We explore unlearning from an information theoretic perspective, connecting the influence of a sample to the information gain a model receives by observing it. From this, we derive a simple but principled zero-shot unlearning method based on the geometry of the model. Our approach takes the form of minimising the gradient of a learned function with respect to a small neighbourhood around a target forget point. This induces a smoothing effect, causing forgetting by moving the boundary of the classifier. We explore the intuition behind why this approach can jointly unlearn forget samples while preserving general model performance through a series of low-dimensional experiments. We perform extensive empirical evaluation of our method over a range of contemporary benchmarks, verifying that our method is competitive with state-of-the-art performance under the strict constraints of zero-shot unlearning.

      <title>Towards Neural Scaling Laws on Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02054v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep graph models (e.g., graph neural networks and graph transformers) have become important techniques for leveraging knowledge across various types of graphs. Yet, the neural scaling laws on graphs, i.e., how the performance of deep graph models changes with model and dataset sizes, have not been systematically investigated, casting doubts on the feasibility of achieving large graph models. To fill this gap, we benchmark many graph datasets from different tasks and make an attempt to establish the neural scaling laws on graphs from both model and data perspectives. The model size we investigated is up to 100 million parameters, and the dataset size investigated is up to 50 million samples. We first verify the validity of such laws on graphs, establishing proper formulations to describe the scaling behaviors. For model scaling, we identify that despite the parameter numbers, the model depth also plays an important role in affecting the model scaling behaviors, which differs from observations in other domains such as CV and NLP. For data scaling, we suggest that the number of graphs can not effectively measure the graph data volume in scaling law since the sizes of different graphs are highly irregular. Instead, we reform the data scaling law with the number of nodes or edges as the metric to address the irregular graph sizes. We further demonstrate that the reformed law offers a unified view of the data scaling behaviors for various fundamental graph tasks including node classification, link prediction, and graph classification. This work provides valuable insights into neural scaling laws on graphs, which can serve as an important tool for collecting new graph data and developing large graph models.</description>

      <title>Differentially Private Zeroth-Order Methods for Scalable Large Language Model Finetuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07818v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fine-tuning on task-specific datasets is a widely-embraced paradigm of harnessing the powerful capability of pretrained LLMs for various downstream tasks. Due to the popularity of LLMs fine-tuning and its accompanying privacy concerns, differentially private (DP) fine-tuning of pretrained LLMs has been widely used to safeguarding the privacy of task-specific datasets. Lying at the design core of DP LLM fine-tuning methods is the satisfactory tradeoff among privacy, utility, and scalability. Most existing methods build upon the seminal work of DP-SGD. Despite pushing the scalability of DP-SGD to its limit, DP-SGD-based fine-tuning methods are unfortunately limited by the inherent inefficiency of SGD.
  In this paper, we investigate the potential of DP zeroth-order methods for LLM pretraining, which avoids the scalability bottleneck of SGD by approximating the gradient with the more efficient zeroth-order gradient. Rather than treating the zeroth-order method as a drop-in replacement for SGD, this paper presents a comprehensive study both theoretically and empirically. First, we propose the stagewise DP zeroth-order method (DP-ZOSO) that dynamically schedules key hyperparameters. This design is grounded on the synergy between DP random perturbation and the gradient approximation error of the zeroth-order method, and its effect on fine-tuning trajectory.
  We provide theoretical analysis for both proposed methods. We conduct extensive empirical analysis on both encoder-only masked language model and decoder-only autoregressive language model, achieving impressive results in terms of scalability and utility regardless of the class of tasks (compared with DPZero, DP-ZOPO improves $4.5\%$ on SST-5, $5.5\%$ on MNLI with RoBERTa-Large and 9.2\% on CB, 3.9\% on BoolQ with OPT-2.7b when $\epsilon=4$, demonstrates more significant enhancement in performance on more complicated tasks).</description>

      <title>DoorINet: Door Heading Prediction through Inertial Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09427v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inertial sensors are widely used in a variety of applications. A common task is orientation estimation. To tackle such a task, attitude and heading reference system algorithms are applied. Relying on the gyroscope readings, the accelerometer measurements are used to update the attitude angles, and magnetometer measurements are utilized to update the heading angle. In indoor environments, magnetometers suffer from interference that degrades their performance resulting in poor heading angle estimation. Therefore, applications that estimate the heading angle of moving objects, such as walking pedestrians, closets, and refrigerators, are prone to error. To circumvent such situations, we propose DoorINet, an end-to-end deep-learning framework to calculate the heading angle from door-mounted, low-cost inertial sensors without using magnetometers. To evaluate our approach, we record a unique dataset containing 391 minutes of accelerometer and gyroscope measurements and corresponding ground-truth heading angle. We show that our proposed approach outperforms commonly used, model based approaches and data-driven methods.</description>

      <title>The Edge-of-Reach Problem in Offline Model-Based Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12527v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning aims to train agents from pre-collected datasets. However, this comes with the added challenge of estimating the value of behaviors not covered in the dataset. Model-based methods offer a potential solution by training an approximate dynamics model, which then allows collection of additional synthetic data via rollouts in this model. The prevailing theory treats this approach as online RL in an approximate dynamics model, and any remaining performance gap is therefore understood as being due to dynamics model errors. In this paper, we analyze this assumption and investigate how popular algorithms perform as the learned dynamics model is improved. In contrast to both intuition and theory, if the learned dynamics model is replaced by the true error-free dynamics, existing model-based methods completely fail. This reveals a key oversight: The theoretical foundations assume sampling of full horizon rollouts in the learned dynamics model; however, in practice, the number of model-rollout steps is aggressively reduced to prevent accumulating errors. We show that this truncation of rollouts results in a set of edge-of-reach states at which we are effectively ``bootstrapping from the void.'' This triggers pathological value overestimation and complete performance collapse. We term this the edge-of-reach problem. Based on this new insight, we fill important gaps in existing theory, and reveal how prior model-based methods are primarily addressing the edge-of-reach problem, rather than model-inaccuracy as claimed. Finally, we propose Reach-Aware Value Learning (RAVL), a simple and robust method that directly addresses the edge-of-reach problem and hence - unlike existing methods - does not fail as the dynamics model is improved.

      <title>Noise-powered Multi-modal Knowledge Graph Representation Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06832v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rise of Multi-modal Pre-training highlights the necessity for a unified Multi-Modal Knowledge Graph (MMKG) representation learning framework. Such a framework is essential for embedding structured knowledge into multi-modal Large Language Models effectively, alleviating issues like knowledge misconceptions and multi-modal hallucinations. In this work, we explore the efficacy of models in accurately embedding entities within MMKGs through two pivotal tasks: Multi-modal Knowledge Graph Completion (MKGC) and Multi-modal Entity Alignment (MMEA). Building on this foundation, we propose a novel SNAG method that utilizes a Transformer-based architecture equipped with modality-level noise masking to robustly integrate multi-modal entity features in KGs. By incorporating specific training objectives for both MKGC and MMEA, our approach achieves SOTA performance across a total of ten datasets, demonstrating its versatility. Moreover, SNAG can not only function as a standalone model but also enhance other existing methods, providing stable performance improvements.

      <title>From Pixels to Insights: A Survey on Automatic Chart Understanding in the Era of Large Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12027v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data visualization in the form of charts plays a pivotal role in data analysis, offering critical insights and aiding in informed decision-making. Automatic chart understanding has witnessed significant advancements with the rise of large foundation models in recent years. Foundation models, such as large language models, have revolutionized various natural language processing tasks and are increasingly being applied to chart understanding tasks. This survey paper provides a comprehensive overview of the recent developments, challenges, and future directions in chart understanding within the context of these foundation models. We review fundamental building blocks crucial for studying chart understanding tasks. Additionally, we explore various tasks and their evaluation metrics and sources of both charts and textual inputs. Various modeling strategies are then examined, encompassing both classification-based and generation-based approaches, along with tool augmentation techniques that enhance chart understanding performance. Furthermore, we discuss the state-of-the-art performance of each task and discuss how we can improve the performance. Challenges and future directions are addressed, highlighting the importance of several topics, such as domain-specific charts, lack of efforts in developing evaluation metrics, and agent-oriented settings. This survey paper serves as a comprehensive resource for researchers and practitioners in the fields of natural language processing, computer vision, and data analysis, providing valuable insights and directions for future research in chart understanding leveraging large foundation models.

      <title>Dual-Personalizing Adapter for Federated Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19211v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, foundation models, particularly large language models (LLMs), have demonstrated an impressive ability to adapt to various tasks by fine-tuning diverse instruction data. Notably, federated foundation models (FedFM) emerge as a privacy preservation method to fine-tune models collaboratively under federated learning (FL) settings by leveraging many distributed datasets with non-IID data. To alleviate communication and computation overhead, parameter-efficient methods are introduced for efficiency, and some research adapted personalization methods to FedFM for better user preferences alignment. However, a critical gap in existing research is the neglect of test-time distribution shifts in real-world applications, and conventional methods for test-time distribution shifts in personalized FL are less effective for FedFM due to their failure to adapt to complex distribution shift scenarios and the requirement to train all parameters. To bridge this gap, we refine the setting in FedFM, termed test-time personalization, which aims to learn personalized federated foundation models on clients while effectively handling test-time distribution shifts simultaneously. To address challenges in this setting, we explore a simple yet effective solution, a Federated Dual-Personalizing Adapter (FedDPA) architecture. By co-working with a foundation model, a global adapter and a local adapter jointly tackle the test-time distribution shifts and client-specific personalization. Additionally, we introduce an instance-wise dynamic weighting mechanism that dynamically integrates the global and local adapters for each test instance during inference, facilitating effective test-time personalization. The effectiveness of the proposed method has been evaluated on benchmark datasets across different NLP tasks.</description>

      <title>Exploring Concept Depth: How Large Language Models Acquire Knowledge at Different Layers?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07066v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performances across a wide range of tasks. However, the mechanisms by which these models encode tasks of varying complexities remain poorly understood. In this paper, we explore the hypothesis that LLMs process concepts of varying complexities in different layers, introducing the idea of "Concept Depth" to suggest that more complex concepts are typically acquired in deeper layers. Specifically, we categorize concepts based on their level of abstraction, defining them in the order of increasing complexity within factual, emotional, and inferential tasks. We conduct extensive probing experiments using layer-wise representations across various LLM families (Gemma, LLaMA, Qwen) on various datasets spanning the three domains of tasks. Our findings reveal that models could efficiently conduct probing for simpler tasks in shallow layers, and more complex tasks typically necessitate deeper layers for accurate understanding. Additionally, we examine how external factors, such as adding noise to the input and quantizing the model weights, might affect layer-wise representations. Our findings suggest that these factors can impede the development of a conceptual understanding of LLMs until deeper layers are explored. We hope that our proposed concept and experimental insights will enhance the understanding of the mechanisms underlying LLMs. Our codes are available at \url{https://github.com/Luckfort/CD}.</description>

      <title>Stock Recommendations for Individual Investors: A Temporal Graph Network Approach with Mean-Variance Efficient Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07223v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recommender systems can be helpful for individuals to make well-informed decisions in complex financial markets. While many studies have focused on predicting stock prices, even advanced models fall short of accurately forecasting them. Additionally, previous studies indicate that individual investors often disregard established investment theories, favoring their personal preferences instead. This presents a challenge for stock recommendation systems, which must not only provide strong investment performance but also respect these individual preferences. To create effective stock recommender systems, three critical elements must be incorporated: 1) individual preferences, 2) portfolio diversification, and 3) the temporal dynamics of the first two. In response, we propose a new model, Portfolio Temporal Graph Network Recommender PfoTGNRec, which can handle time-varying collaborative signals and incorporates diversification-enhancing sampling. On real-world individual trading data, our approach demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines, including cutting-edge dynamic embedding models and existing stock recommendation models. Indeed, we show that PfoTGNRec is an effective solution that can balance customer preferences with the need to suggest portfolios with high Return-on-Investment. The source code and data are available at https://github.com/youngandbin/PfoTGNRec.</description>

      <title>Voice Attribute Editing with Text Prompt</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08857v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite recent advancements in speech generation with text prompt providing control over speech style, voice attributes in synthesized speech remain elusive and challenging to control. This paper introduces a novel task: voice attribute editing with text prompt, with the goal of making relative modifications to voice attributes according to the actions described in the text prompt. To solve this task, VoxEditor, an end-to-end generative model, is proposed. In VoxEditor, addressing the insufficiency of text prompt, a Residual Memory (ResMem) block is designed, that efficiently maps voice attributes and these descriptors into the shared feature space. Additionally, the ResMem block is enhanced with a voice attribute degree prediction (VADP) block to align voice attributes with corresponding descriptors, addressing the imprecision of text prompt caused by non-quantitative descriptions of voice attributes. We also establish the open-source VCTK-RVA dataset, which leads the way in manual annotations detailing voice characteristic differences among different speakers. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our proposed method in terms of both objective and subjective metrics. The dataset and audio samples are available on the website.</description>

      <title>A Conditional Independence Test in the Presence of Discretization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17644v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Testing conditional independence has many applications, such as in Bayesian network learning and causal discovery. Different test methods have been proposed. However, existing methods generally can not work when only discretized observations are available. Specifically, consider $X_1$, $\tilde{X}_2$ and $X_3$ are observed variables, where $\tilde{X}_2$ is a discretization of latent variables $X_2$. Applying existing test methods to the observations of $X_1$, $\tilde{X}_2$ and $X_3$ can lead to a false conclusion about the underlying conditional independence of variables $X_1$, $X_2$ and $X_3$. Motivated by this, we propose a conditional independence test specifically designed to accommodate the presence of such discretization. To achieve this, we design the bridge equations to recover the parameter reflecting the statistical information of the underlying latent continuous variables. An appropriate test statistic and its asymptotic distribution under the null hypothesis of conditional independence have also been derived. Both theoretical results and empirical validation have been provided, demonstrating the effectiveness of our test methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02326v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated capabilities for producing code in Hardware Description Languages (HDLs). However, most of the focus remains on their abilities to write functional code, not test code. The hardware design process consists of both design and test, and so eschewing validation and verification leaves considerable potential benefit unexplored, given that a design and test framework may allow for progress towards full automation of the digital design pipeline. In this work, we perform one of the first studies exploring how a LLM can both design and test hardware modules from provided specifications. Using a suite of 8 representative benchmarks, we examined the capabilities and limitations of the state-of-the-art conversational LLMs when producing Verilog for functional and verification purposes. We taped out the benchmarks on a Skywater 130nm shuttle and received the functional chip.</description>

      <title>Continual Learning in the Presence of Repetition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04101v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Continual learning (CL) provides a framework for training models in ever-evolving environments. Although re-occurrence of previously seen objects or tasks is common in real-world problems, the concept of repetition in the data stream is not often considered in standard benchmarks for CL. Unlike with the rehearsal mechanism in buffer-based strategies, where sample repetition is controlled by the strategy, repetition in the data stream naturally stems from the environment. This report provides a summary of the CLVision challenge at CVPR 2023, which focused on the topic of repetition in class-incremental learning. The report initially outlines the challenge objective and then describes three solutions proposed by finalist teams that aim to effectively exploit the repetition in the stream to learn continually. The experimental results from the challenge highlight the effectiveness of ensemble-based solutions that employ multiple versions of similar modules, each trained on different but overlapping subsets of classes. This report underscores the transformative potential of taking a different perspective in CL by employing repetition in the data stream to foster innovative strategy design.</description>

      <title>Alternators For Sequence Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11848v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces alternators, a novel family of non-Markovian dynamical models for sequences. An alternator features two neural networks: the observation trajectory network (OTN) and the feature trajectory network (FTN). The OTN and the FTN work in conjunction, alternating between outputting samples in the observation space and some feature space, respectively, over a cycle. The parameters of the OTN and the FTN are not time-dependent and are learned via a minimum cross-entropy criterion over the trajectories. Alternators are versatile. They can be used as dynamical latent-variable generative models or as sequence-to-sequence predictors. Alternators can uncover the latent dynamics underlying complex sequential data, accurately forecast and impute missing data, and sample new trajectories. We showcase the capabilities of alternators in three applications. We first used alternators to model the Lorenz equations, often used to describe chaotic behavior. We then applied alternators to Neuroscience, to map brain activity to physical activity. Finally, we applied alternators to Climate Science, focusing on sea-surface temperature forecasting. In all our experiments, we found alternators are stable to train, fast to sample from, yield high-quality generated samples and latent variables, and often outperform strong baselines such as Mambas, neural ODEs, and diffusion models in the domains we studied.</description>

      <title>CoMERA: Computing- and Memory-Efficient Training via Rank-Adaptive Tensor Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14377v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Training large AI models such as LLMs and DLRMs costs massive GPUs and computing time. The high training cost has become only affordable to big tech companies, meanwhile also causing increasing concerns about the environmental impact. This paper presents CoMERA, a Computing- and Memory-Efficient training method via Rank-Adaptive tensor optimization. CoMERA achieves rank-adaptive tensor-compressed (pre)-training via a multi-objective optimization formulation and improves the training to provide both a high compression ratio and excellent accuracy in the training process. Our optimized numerical computation (e.g., optimized tensorized embedding and tensor-network contractions) and GPU implementation eliminate part of the run-time overhead in the tensorized training on GPU. This leads to, for the first time, $2-3\times$ speedup per training epoch compared with standard training. CoMERA also outperforms the recent GaLore in terms of both memory and computing efficiency. Specifically, CoMERA is $2\times$ faster per training epoch and $9\times$ more memory-efficient than GaLore on a tested six-encoder transformer with single-batch training. Our method also shows $\sim 2\times$ speedup than standard pre-training on a BERT-like code-generation LLM while achieving $4.23\times$ compression ratio in pre-training. With further HPC optimization, CoMERA may reduce the pre-training cost of many other LLMs. An implementation of CoMERA is available at https://github.com/ziyangjoy/CoMERA.</description>

      <title>Potential Field Based Deep Metric Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18560v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep metric learning (DML) involves training a network to learn a semantically meaningful representation space. Many current approaches mine n-tuples of examples and model interactions within each tuplets. We present a novel, compositional DML model, inspired by electrostatic fields in physics that, instead of in tuples, represents the influence of each example (embedding) by a continuous potential field, and superposes the fields to obtain their combined global potential field. We use attractive/repulsive potential fields to represent interactions among embeddings from images of the same/different classes. Contrary to typical learning methods, where mutual influence of samples is proportional to their distance, we enforce reduction in such influence with distance, leading to a decaying field. We show that such decay helps improve performance on real world datasets with large intra-class variations and label noise. Like other proxy-based methods, we also use proxies to succinctly represent sub-populations of examples. We evaluate our method on three standard DML benchmarks- Cars-196, CUB-200-2011, and SOP datasets where it outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.</description>

      <title>FedMKT: Federated Mutual Knowledge Transfer for Large and Small Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02224v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent research in federated large language models (LLMs) has primarily focused on enabling clients to fine-tune their locally deployed homogeneous LLMs collaboratively or on transferring knowledge from server-based LLMs to small language models (SLMs) at downstream clients. However, a significant gap remains in the simultaneous mutual enhancement of both the server's LLM and clients' SLMs. To bridge this gap, we propose FedMKT, a parameter-efficient federated mutual knowledge transfer framework for large and small language models. This framework is designed to adaptively transfer knowledge from the server's LLM to clients' SLMs while concurrently enriching the LLM with clients' unique domain insights. We facilitate token alignment using minimum edit distance (MinED) and then selective mutual knowledge transfer between client-side SLMs and a server-side LLM, aiming to collectively enhance their performance. Through extensive experiments across three distinct scenarios, we evaluate the effectiveness of FedMKT using various public LLMs and SLMs on a range of NLP text generation tasks. Empirical results demonstrate that FedMKT simultaneously boosts the performance of both LLMs and SLMs.</description>

      <title>Stock Movement Prediction with Multimodal Stable Fusion via Gated Cross-Attention Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06594v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The accurate prediction of stock movements is crucial for investment strategies. Stock prices are subject to the influence of various forms of information, including financial indicators, sentiment analysis, news documents, and relational structures. Predominant analytical approaches, however, tend to address only unimodal or bimodal sources, neglecting the complexity of multimodal data. Further complicating the landscape are the issues of data sparsity and semantic conflicts between these modalities, which are frequently overlooked by current models, leading to unstable performance and limiting practical applicability. To address these shortcomings, this study introduces a novel architecture, named Multimodal Stable Fusion with Gated Cross-Attention (MSGCA), designed to robustly integrate multimodal input for stock movement prediction. The MSGCA framework consists of three integral components: (1) a trimodal encoding module, responsible for processing indicator sequences, dynamic documents, and a relational graph, and standardizing their feature representations; (2) a cross-feature fusion module, where primary and consistent features guide the multimodal fusion of the three modalities via a pair of gated cross-attention networks; and (3) a prediction module, which refines the fused features through temporal and dimensional reduction to execute precise movement forecasting. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that the MSGCA framework exceeds current leading methods, achieving performance gains of 8.1%, 6.1%, 21.7% and 31.6% on four multimodal datasets, respectively, attributed to its enhanced multimodal fusion stability.</description>

      <title>A Concept-Based Explainability Framework for Large Multimodal Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08074v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) combine unimodal encoders and large language models (LLMs) to perform multimodal tasks. Despite recent advancements towards the interpretability of these models, understanding internal representations of LMMs remains largely a mystery. In this paper, we present a novel framework for the interpretation of LMMs. We propose a dictionary learning based approach, applied to the representation of tokens. The elements of the learned dictionary correspond to our proposed concepts. We show that these concepts are well semantically grounded in both vision and text. Thus we refer to these as ``multi-modal concepts''. We qualitatively and quantitatively evaluate the results of the learnt concepts. We show that the extracted multimodal concepts are useful to interpret representations of test samples. Finally, we evaluate the disentanglement between different concepts and the quality of grounding concepts visually and textually.

      <title>Imagination Policy: Using Generative Point Cloud Models for Learning Manipulation Policies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11740v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Humans can imagine goal states during planning and perform actions to match those goals. In this work, we propose Imagination Policy, a novel multi-task key-frame policy network for solving high-precision pick and place tasks. Instead of learning actions directly, Imagination Policy generates point clouds to imagine desired states which are then translated to actions using rigid action estimation. This transforms action inference into a local generative task. We leverage pick and place symmetries underlying the tasks in the generation process and achieve extremely high sample efficiency and generalizability to unseen configurations. Finally, we demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across various tasks on the RLbench benchmark compared with several strong baselines and validate our approach on a real robot.</description>

      <title>Job-SDF: A Multi-Granularity Dataset for Job Skill Demand Forecasting and Benchmarking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11920v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a rapidly evolving job market, skill demand forecasting is crucial as it enables policymakers and businesses to anticipate and adapt to changes, ensuring that workforce skills align with market needs, thereby enhancing productivity and competitiveness. Additionally, by identifying emerging skill requirements, it directs individuals towards relevant training and education opportunities, promoting continuous self-learning and development. However, the absence of comprehensive datasets presents a significant challenge, impeding research and the advancement of this field. To bridge this gap, we present Job-SDF, a dataset designed to train and benchmark job-skill demand forecasting models. Based on 10.35 million public job advertisements collected from major online recruitment platforms in China between 2021 and 2023, this dataset encompasses monthly recruitment demand for 2,324 types of skills across 521 companies. Our dataset uniquely enables evaluating skill demand forecasting models at various granularities, including occupation, company, and regional levels. We benchmark a range of models on this dataset, evaluating their performance in standard scenarios, in predictions focused on lower value ranges, and in the presence of structural breaks, providing new insights for further research. Our code and dataset are publicly accessible via the https://github.com/Job-SDF/benchmark.</description>

      <title>Towards Understanding Domain Adapted Sentence Embeddings for Document Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12336v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A plethora of sentence embedding models makes it challenging to choose one, especially for technical domains rich with specialized vocabulary. In this work, we domain adapt embeddings using telecom, health and science datasets for question answering. We evaluate embeddings obtained from publicly available models and their domain-adapted variants, on both point retrieval accuracies, as well as their (95\%) confidence intervals. We establish a systematic method to obtain thresholds for similarity scores for different embeddings. As expected, we observe that fine-tuning improves mean bootstrapped accuracies. We also observe that it results in tighter confidence intervals, which further improve when pre-training is preceded by fine-tuning. We introduce metrics which measure the distributional overlaps of top-$K$, correct and random document similarities with the question. Further, we show that these metrics are correlated with retrieval accuracy and similarity thresholds. Recent literature shows conflicting effects of isotropy on retrieval accuracies. Our experiments establish that the isotropy of embeddings (as measured by two independent state-of-the-art isotropy metric definitions) is poorly correlated with retrieval performance. We show that embeddings for domain-specific sentences have little overlap with those for domain-agnostic ones, and fine-tuning moves them further apart. Based on our results, we provide recommendations for use of our methodology and metrics by researchers and practitioners.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Prompting Taxonomy: A Universal Evaluation Framework for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12644v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Assessing the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) in performing different tasks is crucial for understanding their strengths and weaknesses. This paper presents the Hierarchical Prompting Taxonomy (HPT), grounded on human cognitive principles and designed to assess LLMs by examining the cognitive demands of various tasks. The HPT uses the Hierarchical Prompting Framework (HPF), a prompt selection framework that organizes five distinct prompting strategies by their cognitive load on LLMs. This study introduces the Hierarchical Prompting Index (HPI) to measure task complexity, which demonstrates LLMs' abilities across different datasets and serves as a universal metric for task complexity. The HPT offers a reliable method for evaluating LLMs' problem-solving skills in diverse scenarios, leading to clearer conclusions. Extensive experiments with multiple datasets and LLMs show that the HPF enhances LLM performance by 2\% to 63\% compared to standard benchmark datasets, confirming the effectiveness of the HPT. To support future research in this domain, the implementations of HPT and HPF are publicly available</description>

      <title>SEDMamba: Enhancing Selective State Space Modelling with Bottleneck Mechanism and Fine-to-Coarse Temporal Fusion for Efficient Error Detection in Robot-Assisted Surgery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15920v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Automated detection of surgical errors can improve robotic-assisted surgery. Despite promising progress, existing methods still face challenges in capturing rich temporal context to establish long-term dependencies while maintaining computational efficiency. In this paper, we propose a novel hierarchical model named SEDMamba, which incorporates the selective state space model (SSM) into surgical error detection, facilitating efficient long sequence modelling with linear complexity. SEDMamba enhances selective SSM with a bottleneck mechanism and fine-to-coarse temporal fusion (FCTF) to detect and temporally localize surgical errors in long videos. The bottleneck mechanism compresses and restores features within their spatial dimension, thereby reducing computational complexity. FCTF utilizes multiple dilated 1D convolutional layers to merge temporal information across diverse scale ranges, accommodating errors of varying duration. Our work also contributes the first-of-its-kind, frame-level, in-vivo surgical error dataset to support error detection in real surgical cases. Specifically, we deploy the clinically validated observational clinical human reliability assessment tool (OCHRA) to annotate the errors during suturing tasks in an open-source radical prostatectomy dataset (SAR-RARP50). Experimental results demonstrate that our SEDMamba outperforms state-of-the-art methods with at least 1.82% AUC and 3.80% AP performance gains with significantly reduced computational complexity. The corresponding error annotations, code and models are released at https://github.com/wzjialang/SEDMamba.</description>

      <title>Inducing Group Fairness in Prompt-Based Language Model Decisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16738v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Classifiers are used throughout industry to enforce policies, ranging from the detection of toxic content to age-appropriate content filtering. While these classifiers serve important functions, it is also essential that they are built in ways that minimize unfair biases for users.
  One such fairness consideration is called group fairness, which desires that different sub-population of users receive equal treatment. This is a well-studied problem in the context of 'classical' classifiers. However, the emergence of prompt-based language model (LM) decision making has created new opportunities to solve text-based classification tasks, and the fairness properties of these new classifiers are not yet well understood. Further, the `remediation toolkit' is incomplete for LM-based decision makers and little is understood about how to improve decision maker group fairness while maintaining classifier performance.
  This work sets out to add more tools to that toolbox. We introduce adaptations of existing effective approaches from the classical classifier fairness to the prompt-based classifier space. We also devise simple methods that take advantage of the new structure of prompt-based decision makers and operate at the prompt level. We compare these approaches empirically on real data. Our results suggest that adaptations of approaches that are effective for classical classifiers remain effective in the LM-based classifier environment. However, there is room for further exploration of prompt-based remediation methods (and other remediation methods that take advantage of LM structure).</description>

      <title>BiCo-Fusion: Bidirectional Complementary LiDAR-Camera Fusion for Semantic- and Spatial-Aware 3D Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19048v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: 3D object detection is an important task that has been widely applied in autonomous driving. To perform this task, a new trend is to fuse multi-modal inputs, i.e., LiDAR and camera. Under such a trend, recent methods fuse these two modalities by unifying them in the same 3D space. However, during direct fusion in a unified space, the drawbacks of both modalities (LiDAR features struggle with detailed semantic information and the camera lacks accurate 3D spatial information) are also preserved, diluting semantic and spatial awareness of the final unified representation. To address the issue, this letter proposes a novel bidirectional complementary LiDAR-camera fusion framework, called BiCo-Fusion that can achieve robust semantic- and spatial-aware 3D object detection. The key insight is to fuse LiDAR and camera features in a bidirectional complementary way to enhance the semantic awareness of the LiDAR and the 3D spatial awareness of the camera. The enhanced features from both modalities are then adaptively fused to build a semantic- and spatial-aware unified representation. Specifically, we introduce Pre-Fusion consisting of a Voxel Enhancement Module (VEM) to enhance the semantic awareness of voxel features from 2D camera features and Image Enhancement Module (IEM) to enhance the 3D spatial awareness of camera features from 3D voxel features. We then introduce Unified Fusion (U-Fusion) to adaptively fuse the enhanced features from the last stage to build a unified representation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our BiCo-Fusion against the prior arts. Project page: https://t-ys.github.io/BiCo-Fusion/.</description>

      <title>Strategic Demand-Planning in Wireless Networks: Can Generative-AI Save Spectrum and Energy?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02292v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative-AI (GenAI), a novel technology capable of producing various types of outputs, including text, images, and videos, offers significant potential for wireless communications. This article introduces the concept of strategic demand-planning through demand-labeling, demand-shaping, and demand-rescheduling. Accordingly, GenAI is proposed as a powerful tool to facilitate demand-shaping in wireless networks. More specifically, GenAI is used to compress and convert the content of various types (e.g., from a higher bandwidth mode to a lower one, such as from a video to text), which subsequently enhances performance of wireless networks in various usage scenarios, such as cell-switching, user association and load balancing, interference management, as well as disasters and unusual gatherings. Therefore, GenAI can serve a function in saving energy and spectrum in wireless networks. With recent advancements in AI, including sophisticated algorithms like large language models and the development of more powerful hardware built exclusively for AI tasks, such as AI accelerators, the concept of demand-planning, particularly demand-shaping through GenAI, becomes increasingly relevant. Furthermore, recent efforts to make GenAI accessible on devices, such as user terminals, make the implementation of this concept even more straightforward and feasible.</description>

      <title>Query-Guided Self-Supervised Summarization of Nursing Notes</title>

Abstract: Nursing notes, an important part of Electronic Health Records (EHRs), track a patient's health during a care episode. Summarizing key information in nursing notes can help clinicians quickly understand patients' conditions. However, existing summarization methods in the clinical setting, especially abstractive methods, have overlooked nursing notes and require reference summaries for training. We introduce QGSumm, a novel query-guided self-supervised domain adaptation approach for abstractive nursing note summarization. The method uses patient-related clinical queries for guidance, and hence does not need reference summaries for training. Through automatic experiments and manual evaluation by an expert clinician, we study our approach and other state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) for nursing note summarization. Our experiments show: 1) GPT-4 is competitive in maintaining information in the original nursing notes, 2) QGSumm can generate high-quality summaries with a good balance between recall of the original content and hallucination rate lower than other top methods. Ultimately, our work offers a new perspective on conditional text summarization, tailored to clinical applications.</description>

      <title>Depression Detection and Analysis using Large Language Models on Textual and Audio-Visual Modalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06125</link>

Abstract: Depression has proven to be a significant public health issue, profoundly affecting the psychological well-being of individuals. If it remains undiagnosed, depression can lead to severe health issues, which can manifest physically and even lead to suicide. Generally, Diagnosing depression or any other mental disorder involves conducting semi-structured interviews alongside supplementary questionnaires, including variants of the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) by Clinicians and mental health professionals. This approach places significant reliance on the experience and judgment of trained physicians, making the diagnosis susceptible to personal biases. Given that the underlying mechanisms causing depression are still being actively researched, physicians often face challenges in diagnosing and treating the condition, particularly in its early stages of clinical presentation. Recently, significant strides have been made in Artificial neural computing to solve problems involving text, image, and speech in various domains. Our analysis has aimed to leverage these state-of-the-art (SOTA) models in our experiments to achieve optimal outcomes leveraging multiple modalities. The experiments were performed on the Extended Distress Analysis Interview Corpus Wizard of Oz dataset (E-DAIC) corpus presented in the Audio/Visual Emotion Challenge (AVEC) 2019 Challenge. The proposed solutions demonstrate better results achieved by Proprietary and Open-source Large Language Models (LLMs), which achieved a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) score of 3.98 on Textual Modality, beating the AVEC 2019 challenge baseline results and current SOTA regression analysis architectures. Additionally, the proposed solution achieved an accuracy of 71.43% in the classification task. The paper also includes a novel audio-visual multi-modal network that predicts PHQ-8 scores with an RMSE of 6.51.</description>

      <title>Provable Privacy Advantages of Decentralized Federated Learning via Distributed Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09324v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) emerged as a paradigm designed to improve data privacy by enabling data to reside at its source, thus embedding privacy as a core consideration in FL architectures, whether centralized or decentralized. Contrasting with recent findings by Pasquini et al., which suggest that decentralized FL does not empirically offer any additional privacy or security benefits over centralized models, our study provides compelling evidence to the contrary. We demonstrate that decentralized FL, when deploying distributed optimization, provides enhanced privacy protection - both theoretically and empirically - compared to centralized approaches. The challenge of quantifying privacy loss through iterative processes has traditionally constrained the theoretical exploration of FL protocols. We overcome this by conducting a pioneering in-depth information-theoretical privacy analysis for both frameworks. Our analysis, considering both eavesdropping and passive adversary models, successfully establishes bounds on privacy leakage. We show information theoretically that the privacy loss in decentralized FL is upper bounded by the loss in centralized FL. Compared to the centralized case where local gradients of individual participants are directly revealed, a key distinction of optimization-based decentralized FL is that the relevant information includes differences of local gradients over successive iterations and the aggregated sum of different nodes' gradients over the network. This information complicates the adversary's attempt to infer private data. To bridge our theoretical insights with practical applications, we present detailed case studies involving logistic regression and deep neural networks. These examples demonstrate that while privacy leakage remains comparable in simpler models, complex models like deep neural networks exhibit lower privacy risks under decentralized FL.</description>

      <title>Is Behavior Cloning All You Need? Understanding Horizon in Imitation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15007v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Imitation learning (IL) aims to mimic the behavior of an expert in a sequential decision making task by learning from demonstrations, and has been widely applied to robotics, autonomous driving, and autoregressive text generation. The simplest approach to IL, behavior cloning (BC), is thought to incur sample complexity with unfavorable quadratic dependence on the problem horizon, motivating a variety of different online algorithms that attain improved linear horizon dependence under stronger assumptions on the data and the learner's access to the expert.
  We revisit the apparent gap between offline and online IL from a learning-theoretic perspective, with a focus on the realizable/well-specified setting with general policy classes up to and including deep neural networks. Through a new analysis of behavior cloning with the logarithmic loss, we show that it is possible to achieve horizon-independent sample complexity in offline IL whenever (i) the range of the cumulative payoffs is controlled, and (ii) an appropriate notion of supervised learning complexity for the policy class is controlled. Specializing our results to deterministic, stationary policies, we show that the gap between offline and online IL is smaller than previously thought: (i) it is possible to achieve linear dependence on horizon in offline IL under dense rewards (matching what was previously only known to be achievable in online IL); and (ii) without further assumptions on the policy class, online IL cannot improve over offline IL with the logarithmic loss, even in benign MDPs. We complement our theoretical results with experiments on standard RL tasks and autoregressive language generation to validate the practical relevance of our findings.</description>

      <title>CREW: Facilitating Human-AI Teaming Research</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00170v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the increasing deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, the potential of humans working with AI agents has been growing at a great speed. Human-AI teaming is an important paradigm for studying various aspects when humans and AI agents work together. The unique aspect of Human-AI teaming research is the need to jointly study humans and AI agents, demanding multidisciplinary research efforts from machine learning to human-computer interaction, robotics, cognitive science, neuroscience, psychology, social science, and complex systems. However, existing platforms for Human-AI teaming research are limited, often supporting oversimplified scenarios and a single task, or specifically focusing on either human-teaming research or multi-agent AI algorithms. We introduce CREW, a platform to facilitate Human-AI teaming research in real-time decision-making scenarios and engage collaborations from multiple scientific disciplines, with a strong emphasis on human involvement. It includes pre-built tasks for cognitive studies and Human-AI teaming with expandable potentials from our modular design. Following conventional cognitive neuroscience research, CREW also supports multimodal human physiological signal recording for behavior analysis. Moreover, CREW benchmarks real-time human-guided reinforcement learning agents using state-of-the-art algorithms and well-tuned baselines. With CREW, we were able to conduct 50 human subject studies within a week to verify the effectiveness of our benchmark.</description>

      <title>MM-Vet v2: A Challenging Benchmark to Evaluate Large Multimodal Models for Integrated Capabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00765v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: MM-Vet, with open-ended vision-language questions targeting at evaluating integrated capabilities, has become one of the most popular benchmarks for large multimodal model evaluation. MM-Vet assesses six core vision-language (VL) capabilities: recognition, knowledge, spatial awareness, language generation, OCR, and math. However, its question format is restricted to single image-text pairs, lacking the interleaved image and text sequences prevalent in real-world scenarios. To address this limitation, we introduce MM-Vet v2, which includes a new VL capability called "image-text sequence understanding", evaluating models' ability to process VL sequences. Furthermore, we maintain the high quality of evaluation samples while further expanding the evaluation set size. Using MM-Vet v2 to benchmark large multimodal models, we found that Claude 3.5 Sonnet is the best model with a score of 71.8, slightly outperforming GPT-4o which scored 71.0. Among open-weight models, InternVL2-Llama3-76B leads with a score of 68.4. The code, data, and leaderboard are accessible at https://github.com/yuweihao/MM-Vet.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01444v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are playing a pivotal role in deploying strategic use cases across a range of organizations, from large pan-continental companies to emerging startups. The issues and challenges involved in the successful utilization of LLMs can vary significantly depending on the size of the organization. It is important to study and discuss these pertinent issues of LLM adaptation with a focus on the scale of the industrial concerns and brainstorm possible solutions and prospective directions. Such a study has not been prominently featured in the current research literature. In this study, we adopt a threefold strategy: first, we conduct a case study with industry practitioners to formulate the key research questions; second, we examine existing industrial publications to address these questions; and finally, we provide a practical guide for industries to utilize LLMs more efficiently. We release the GitHub\footnote{\url{https://github.com/vinayakcse/IndustrialLLMsPapers}} repository with the most recent papers in the field.</description>

      <title>MeshAnything V2: Artist-Created Mesh Generation With Adjacent Mesh Tokenization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02555v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Meshes are the de facto 3D representation in the industry but are labor-intensive to produce. Recently, a line of research has focused on autoregressively generating meshes. This approach processes meshes into a sequence composed of vertices and then generates them vertex by vertex, similar to how a language model generates text. These methods have achieved some success but still struggle to generate complex meshes. One primary reason for this limitation is their inefficient tokenization methods. To address this issue, we introduce MeshAnything V2, an advanced mesh generation model designed to create Artist-Created Meshes that align precisely with specified shapes. A key innovation behind MeshAnything V2 is our novel Adjacent Mesh Tokenization (AMT) method. Unlike traditional approaches that represent each face using three vertices, AMT optimizes this by employing a single vertex wherever feasible, effectively reducing the token sequence length by about half on average. This not only streamlines the tokenization process but also results in more compact and well-structured sequences, enhancing the efficiency of mesh generation. With these improvements, MeshAnything V2 effectively doubles the face limit compared to previous models, delivering superior performance without increasing computational costs. We will make our code and models publicly available. Project Page: https://buaacyw.github.io/meshanything-v2/</description>

Abstract: Deep Learning (DL) in neuroimaging has become increasingly relevant for detecting neurological conditions and neurodegenerative disorders. One of the most predominant biomarkers in neuroimaging is represented by brain age, which has been shown to be a good indicator for different conditions, such as Alzheimer's Disease. Using brain age for weakly supervised pre-training of DL models in transfer learning settings has also recently shown promising results, especially when dealing with data scarcity of different conditions. On the other hand, anatomical information of brain MRIs (e.g. cortical thickness) can provide important information for learning good representations that can be transferred to many downstream tasks. In this work, we propose AnatCL, an anatomical foundation model for brain MRIs that i.) leverages anatomical information in a weakly contrastive learning approach, and ii.) achieves state-of-the-art performances across many different downstream tasks. To validate our approach we consider 12 different downstream tasks for the diagnosis of different conditions such as Alzheimer's Disease, autism spectrum disorder, and schizophrenia. Furthermore, we also target the prediction of 10 different clinical assessment scores using structural MRI data. Our findings show that incorporating anatomical information during pre-training leads to more robust and generalizable representations. Pre-trained models can be found at: https://github.com/EIDOSLAB/AnatCL.</description>

      <title>Nl2Hltl2Plan: Scaling Up Natural Language Understanding for Multi-Robots Through Hierarchical Temporal Logic Task Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08188v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To enable non-experts to specify long-horizon, multi-robot collaborative tasks, language models are increasingly used to translate natural language commands into formal specifications. However, because translation can occur in multiple ways, such translations may lack accuracy or lead to inefficient multi-robot planning. Our key insight is that concise hierarchical specifications can simplify planning while remaining straightforward to derive from human instructions. We propose~\acronym{}, a framework that translates natural language commands into hierarchical Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) and solves the corresponding planning problem. The translation involves two steps leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs). First, an LLM transforms instructions into a Hierarchical Task Tree, capturing logical and temporal relations. Next, a fine-tuned LLM converts sub-tasks into flat LTL formulas, which are aggregated into hierarchical specifications, with the lowest level corresponding to ordered robot actions. These specifications are then used with off-the-shelf planners. Our~\acronym{} demonstrates the potential of LLMs in hierarchical reasoning for multi-robot task planning. Evaluations in simulation and real-world experiments with human participants show that~\acronym{} outperforms existing methods, handling more complex instructions while achieving higher success rates and lower costs in task allocation and planning.

      <title>LLM Pruning and Distillation in Practice: The Minitron Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11796v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive report on compressing the Llama 3.1 8B and Mistral NeMo 12B models to 4B and 8B parameters, respectively, using pruning and distillation. We explore two distinct pruning strategies: (1) depth pruning and (2) joint hidden/attention/MLP (width) pruning, and evaluate the results on common benchmarks from the LM Evaluation Harness. The models are then aligned with NeMo Aligner and tested in instruct-tuned versions. This approach produces a compelling 4B model from Llama 3.1 8B and a state-of-the-art Mistral-NeMo-Minitron-8B (MN-Minitron-8B for brevity) model from Mistral NeMo 12B. We found that with no access to the original data, it is beneficial to slightly fine-tune teacher models on the distillation dataset. We open-source our base model weights on Hugging Face with a permissive license.</description>

      <title>ReconX: Reconstruct Any Scene from Sparse Views with Video Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16767v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Advancements in 3D scene reconstruction have transformed 2D images from the real world into 3D models, producing realistic 3D results from hundreds of input photos. Despite great success in dense-view reconstruction scenarios, rendering a detailed scene from insufficient captured views is still an ill-posed optimization problem, often resulting in artifacts and distortions in unseen areas. In this paper, we propose ReconX, a novel 3D scene reconstruction paradigm that reframes the ambiguous reconstruction challenge as a temporal generation task. The key insight is to unleash the strong generative prior of large pre-trained video diffusion models for sparse-view reconstruction. However, 3D view consistency struggles to be accurately preserved in directly generated video frames from pre-trained models. To address this, given limited input views, the proposed ReconX first constructs a global point cloud and encodes it into a contextual space as the 3D structure condition. Guided by the condition, the video diffusion model then synthesizes video frames that are both detail-preserved and exhibit a high degree of 3D consistency, ensuring the coherence of the scene from various perspectives. Finally, we recover the 3D scene from the generated video through a confidence-aware 3D Gaussian Splatting optimization scheme. Extensive experiments on various real-world datasets show the superiority of our ReconX over state-of-the-art methods in terms of quality and generalizability.</description>

      <title>Self-Adaptive Quantum Kernel Principal Components Analysis for Compact Readout of Chemiresistive Sensor Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00115v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid growth of Internet of Things (IoT) devices necessitates efficient data compression techniques to handle the vast amounts of data generated by these devices. Chemiresistive sensor arrays (CSAs), a simple-to-fabricate but crucial component in IoT systems, generate large volumes of data due to their simultaneous multi-sensor operations. Classical principal component analysis (cPCA) methods, a common solution to the data compression challenge, face limitations in preserving critical information during dimensionality reduction. In this study, we present self-adaptive quantum kernel (SAQK) PCA as a superior alternative to enhance information retention. Our findings demonstrate that SAQK PCA outperforms cPCA in various back-end machine-learning tasks, especially in low-dimensional scenarios where access to quantum bits is limited. These results highlight the potential of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers to revolutionize data processing in real-world IoT applications by improving the efficiency and reliability of CSA data compression and readout, despite the current constraints on qubit availability.</description>

      <title>Language Models Benefit from Preparation with Elicited Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01345v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The zero-shot chain of thought (CoT) approach is often used in question answering (QA) by language models (LMs) for tasks that require multiple reasoning steps. However, some QA tasks hinge more on accessing relevant knowledge than on chaining reasoning steps. We introduce a simple prompting technique, called PREP, that involves using two instances of LMs: the first (LM1) generates relevant information, and the second (LM2) receives the information from the user and answers the question. This design is intended to make better use of the LM's instruction-following capability. PREP is applicable across various QA tasks without domain-specific prompt engineering. PREP is developed on a dataset of 100 QA questions, derived from an extensive schematic dataset specifying artifact parts and material composition. These questions ask which of two artifacts is less likely to share materials with another artifact. Such questions probe the LM's knowledge of shared materials in the part structure of different artifacts. We test our method on our parts-and-materials dataset and three published commonsense reasoning datasets. The average accuracy of our method is consistently higher than that of all the other tested methods across all the tested datasets.</description>

      <title>Solving Video Inverse Problems Using Image Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02574v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, diffusion model-based inverse problem solvers (DIS) have emerged as state-of-the-art approaches for addressing inverse problems, including image super-resolution, deblurring, inpainting, etc. However, their application to video inverse problems arising from spatio-temporal degradation remains largely unexplored due to the challenges in training video diffusion models. To address this issue, here we introduce an innovative video inverse solver that leverages only image diffusion models. Specifically, by drawing inspiration from the success of the recent decomposed diffusion sampler (DDS), our method treats the time dimension of a video as the batch dimension of image diffusion models and solves spatio-temporal optimization problems within denoised spatio-temporal batches derived from each image diffusion model. Moreover, we introduce a batch-consistent diffusion sampling strategy that encourages consistency across batches by synchronizing the stochastic noise components in image diffusion models. Our approach synergistically combines batch-consistent sampling with simultaneous optimization of denoised spatio-temporal batches at each reverse diffusion step, resulting in a novel and efficient diffusion sampling strategy for video inverse problems. Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively addresses various spatio-temporal degradations in video inverse problems, achieving state-of-the-art reconstructions.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized artificial intelligence and machine learning through their advanced text processing and generating capabilities. However, their widespread deployment has raised significant safety and reliability concerns. Established vulnerabilities in deep neural networks, coupled with emerging threat models, may compromise security evaluations and create a false sense of security. Given the extensive research in the field of LLM security, we believe that summarizing the current state of affairs will help the research community better understand the present landscape and inform future developments. This paper reviews current research on LLM vulnerabilities and threats, and evaluates the effectiveness of contemporary defense mechanisms. We analyze recent studies on attack vectors and model weaknesses, providing insights into attack mechanisms and the evolving threat landscape. We also examine current defense strategies, highlighting their strengths and limitations. By contrasting advancements in attack and defense methodologies, we identify research gaps and propose future directions to enhance LLM security. Our goal is to advance the understanding of LLM safety challenges and guide the development of more robust security measures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05677v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Regulatory documents, issued by governmental regulatory bodies, establish rules, guidelines, and standards that organizations must adhere to for legal compliance. These documents, characterized by their length, complexity and frequent updates, are challenging to interpret, requiring significant allocation of time and expertise on the part of organizations to ensure ongoing compliance. Regulatory Natural Language Processing (RegNLP) is a multidisciplinary field aimed at simplifying access to and interpretation of regulatory rules and obligations. We introduce a task of generating question-passages pairs, where questions are automatically created and paired with relevant regulatory passages, facilitating the development of regulatory question-answering systems. We create the ObliQA dataset, containing 27,869 questions derived from the collection of Abu Dhabi Global Markets (ADGM) financial regulation documents, design a baseline Regulatory Information Retrieval and Answer Generation (RIRAG) system and evaluate it with RePASs, a novel evaluation metric that tests whether generated answers accurately capture all relevant obligations while avoiding contradictions.</description>

      <title>Recurrent Aggregators in Neural Algorithmic Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07154v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural algorithmic reasoning (NAR) is an emerging field that seeks to design neural networks that mimic classical algorithmic computations. Today, graph neural networks (GNNs) are widely used in neural algorithmic reasoners due to their message passing framework and permutation equivariance. In this extended abstract, we challenge this design choice, and replace the equivariant aggregation function with a recurrent neural network. While seemingly counter-intuitive, this approach has appropriate grounding when nodes have a natural ordering -- and this is the case frequently in established reasoning benchmarks like CLRS-30. Indeed, our recurrent NAR (RNAR) model performs very strongly on such tasks, while handling many others gracefully. A notable achievement of RNAR is its decisive state-of-the-art result on the Heapsort and Quickselect tasks, both deemed as a significant challenge for contemporary neural algorithmic reasoners -- especially the latter, where RNAR achieves a mean micro-F1 score of 87%.</description>

      <title>InvDesFlow: An AI search engine to explore possible high-temperature superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08065v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The discovery of new superconducting materials, particularly those exhibiting high critical temperature ($T_c$), has been a vibrant area of study within the field of condensed matter physics. Conventional approaches primarily rely on physical intuition to search for potential superconductors within the existing databases. However, the known materials only scratch the surface of the extensive array of possibilities within the realm of materials. Here, we develop InvDesFlow, an AI search engine that integrates deep model pre-training and fine-tuning techniques, diffusion models, and physics-based approaches (e.g., first-principles electronic structure calculation) for the discovery of high-$T_c$ superconductors. Utilizing InvDesFlow, we have obtained 74 dynamically stable materials with critical temperatures predicted by the AI model to be $T_c \geq$ 15 K based on a very small set of samples. Notably, these materials are not contained in any existing dataset. Furthermore, we analyze trends in our dataset and individual materials including B$_4$CN$_3$ (at 5 GPa) and B$_5$CN$_2$ (at ambient pressure) whose $T_c$s are 24.08 K and 15.93 K, respectively. We demonstrate that AI technique can discover a set of new high-$T_c$ superconductors, outline its potential for accelerating discovery of the materials with targeted properties.</description>

      <title>PINNfluence: Influence Functions for Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08958v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have emerged as a flexible and promising application of deep learning to partial differential equations in the physical sciences. While offering strong performance and competitive inference speeds on forward and inverse problems, their black-box nature limits interpretability, particularly regarding alignment with expected physical behavior. In the present work, we explore the application of influence functions (IFs) to validate and debug PINNs post-hoc. Specifically, we apply variations of IF-based indicators to gauge the influence of different types of collocation points on the prediction of PINNs applied to a 2D Navier-Stokes fluid flow problem. Our results demonstrate how IFs can be adapted to PINNs to reveal the potential for further studies. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/aleks-krasowski/PINNfluence.</description>

      <title>Learning Transferable Features for Implicit Neural Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09566v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Implicit neural representations (INRs) have demonstrated success in a variety of applications, including inverse problems and neural rendering. An INR is typically trained to capture one signal of interest, resulting in learned neural features that are highly attuned to that signal. Assumed to be less generalizable, we explore the aspect of transferability of such learned neural features for fitting similar signals. We introduce a new INR training framework, STRAINER that learns transferrable features for fitting INRs to new signals from a given distribution, faster and with better reconstruction quality. Owing to the sequential layer-wise affine operations in an INR, we propose to learn transferable representations by sharing initial encoder layers across multiple INRs with independent decoder layers. At test time, the learned encoder representations are transferred as initialization for an otherwise randomly initialized INR. We find STRAINER to yield extremely powerful initialization for fitting images from the same domain and allow for $\approx +10dB$ gain in signal quality early on compared to an untrained INR itself. STRAINER also provides a simple way to encode data-driven priors in INRs. We evaluate STRAINER on multiple in-domain and out-of-domain signal fitting tasks and inverse problems and further provide detailed analysis and discussion on the transferability of STRAINER's features.

      <title>Unveiling and Mitigating Bias in Large Language Model Recommendations: A Path to Fairness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10825v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: excel in delivering comprehensive suggestions by deeply analyzing content and user behavior. However, they often inherit biases from skewed training data, favoring mainstream content while underrepresenting diverse or non-traditional options. This study explores the interplay between bias and LLM-based recommendation systems, focusing on music, song, and book recommendations across diverse demographic and cultural groups. This paper analyzes bias in LLM-based recommendation systems across multiple models (GPT, LLaMA, and Gemini), revealing its deep and pervasive impact on outcomes. Intersecting identities and contextual factors, like socioeconomic status, further amplify biases, complicating fair recommendations across diverse groups. Our findings reveal that bias in these systems is deeply ingrained, yet even simple interventions like prompt engineering can significantly reduce it. We further propose a retrieval-augmented generation strategy to mitigate bias more effectively. Numerical experiments validate these strategies, demonstrating both the pervasive nature of bias and the impact of the proposed solutions.</description>

      <title>MathGLM-Vision: Solving Mathematical Problems with Multi-Modal Large Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13729v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant capabilities in mathematical reasoning, particularly with text-based mathematical problems. However, current multi-modal large language models (MLLMs), especially those specialized in mathematics, tend to focus predominantly on solving geometric problems but ignore the diversity of visual information available in other areas of mathematics. Moreover, the geometric information for these specialized mathematical MLLMs is derived from several public datasets, which are typically limited in diversity and complexity. To address these limitations, we aim to construct a fine-tuning dataset named MathVL, and develop a series of specialized mathematical MLLMs termed MathGLM-Vision by conducting Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on MathVL with various parameter-scale backbones. To extensively evaluate the effectiveness of MathGLM-Vision, we conduct experiments on several public benchmarks and our curated MathVL-test consisting of 2,000 problems. Experimental results demonstrate that MathGLM-Vision achieves significant improvements compared with some existing models, including backbone models and open-source mathematical MLLMs. These findings indicate the importance of diversity dataset in enhancing the mathematical reasoning abilities of MLLMs.</description>

      <title>Test Time Learning for Time Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14012v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time-series forecasting has seen significant advancements with the introduction of token prediction mechanisms such as multi-head attention. However, these methods often struggle to achieve the same performance as in language modeling, primarily due to the quadratic computational cost and the complexity of capturing long-range dependencies in time-series data. State-space models (SSMs), such as Mamba, have shown promise in addressing these challenges by offering efficient solutions with linear RNNs capable of modeling long sequences with larger context windows. However, there remains room for improvement in accuracy and scalability.
  We propose the use of Test-Time Training (TTT) modules in a parallel architecture to enhance performance in long-term time series forecasting. Through extensive experiments on standard benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that TTT modules consistently outperform state-of-the-art models, including the Mamba-based TimeMachine, particularly in scenarios involving extended sequence and prediction lengths. Our results show significant improvements in Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE), especially on larger datasets such as Electricity, Traffic, and Weather, underscoring the effectiveness of TTT in capturing long-range dependencies. Additionally, we explore various convolutional architectures within the TTT framework, showing that even simple configurations like 1D convolution with small filters can achieve competitive results. This work sets a new benchmark for time-series forecasting and lays the groundwork for future research in scalable, high-performance forecasting models.</description>

      <title>Robust Federated Learning Over the Air: Combating Heavy-Tailed Noise with Median Anchored Clipping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15100v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Leveraging over-the-air computations for model aggregation is an effective approach to cope with the communication bottleneck in federated edge learning. By exploiting the superposition properties of multi-access channels, this approach facilitates an integrated design of communication and computation, thereby enhancing system privacy while reducing implementation costs. However, the inherent electromagnetic interference in radio channels often exhibits heavy-tailed distributions, giving rise to exceptionally strong noise in globally aggregated gradients that can significantly deteriorate the training performance. To address this issue, we propose a novel gradient clipping method, termed Median Anchored Clipping (MAC), to combat the detrimental effects of heavy-tailed noise. We also derive analytical expressions for the convergence rate of model training with analog over-the-air federated learning under MAC, which quantitatively demonstrates the effect of MAC on training performance. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed MAC algorithm effectively mitigates the impact of heavy-tailed noise, hence substantially enhancing system robustness.</description>

      <title>Kalahi: A handcrafted, grassroots cultural LLM evaluation suite for Filipino</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15380v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multilingual large language models (LLMs) today may not necessarily provide culturally appropriate and relevant responses to its Filipino users. We introduce Kalahi, a cultural LLM evaluation suite collaboratively created by native Filipino speakers. It is composed of 150 high-quality, handcrafted and nuanced prompts that test LLMs for generations that are relevant to shared Filipino cultural knowledge and values. Strong LLM performance in Kalahi indicates a model's ability to generate responses similar to what an average Filipino would say or do in a given situation. We conducted experiments on LLMs with multilingual and Filipino language support. Results show that Kalahi, while trivial for Filipinos, is challenging for LLMs, with the best model answering only 46.0% of the questions correctly compared to native Filipino performance of 89.10%. Thus, Kalahi can be used to accurately and reliably evaluate Filipino cultural representation in LLMs.</description>

      <title>Strongly-polynomial time and validation analysis of policy gradient methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19437v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel termination criterion, termed the advantage gap function, for finite state and action Markov decision processes (MDP) and reinforcement learning (RL). By incorporating this advantage gap function into the design of step size rules and deriving a new linear rate of convergence that is independent of the stationary state distribution of the optimal policy, we demonstrate that policy gradient methods can solve MDPs in strongly-polynomial time. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that such strong convergence properties have been established for policy gradient methods. Moreover, in the stochastic setting, where only stochastic estimates of policy gradients are available, we show that the advantage gap function provides close approximations of the optimality gap for each individual state and exhibits a sublinear rate of convergence at every state. The advantage gap function can be easily estimated in the stochastic case, and when coupled with easily computable upper bounds on policy values, they provide a convenient way to validate the solutions generated by policy gradient methods. Therefore, our developments offer a principled and computable measure of optimality for RL, whereas current practice tends to rely on algorithm-to-algorithm or baselines comparisons with no certificate of optimality.</description>

Abstract: Forecasts of future events are essential inputs into informed decision-making. Machine learning (ML) systems have the potential to deliver forecasts at scale, but there is no framework for evaluating the accuracy of ML systems on a standardized set of forecasting questions. To address this gap, we introduce ForecastBench: a dynamic benchmark that evaluates the accuracy of ML systems on an automatically generated and regularly updated set of 1,000 forecasting questions. To avoid any possibility of data leakage, ForecastBench is comprised solely of questions about future events that have no known answer at the time of submission. We quantify the capabilities of current ML systems by collecting forecasts from expert (human) forecasters, the general public, and LLMs on a random subset of questions from the benchmark ($N=200$). While LLMs have achieved super-human performance on many benchmarks, they perform less well here: expert forecasters outperform the top-performing LLM (p-value $&lt;0.01$). We display system and human scores in a public leaderboard at www.forecastbench.org.</description>

      <title>Knowledge Entropy Decay during Language Model Pretraining Hinders New Knowledge Acquisition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01380v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate how a model's tendency to broadly integrate its parametric knowledge evolves throughout pretraining, and how this behavior affects overall performance, particularly in terms of knowledge acquisition and forgetting. We introduce the concept of knowledge entropy, which quantifies the range of memory sources the model engages with; high knowledge entropy indicates that the model utilizes a wide range of memory sources, while low knowledge entropy suggests reliance on specific sources with greater certainty. Our analysis reveals a consistent decline in knowledge entropy as pretraining advances. We also find that the decline is closely associated with a reduction in the model's ability to acquire and retain knowledge, leading us to conclude that diminishing knowledge entropy (smaller number of active memory sources) impairs the model's knowledge acquisition and retention capabilities. We find further support for this by demonstrating that increasing the activity of inactive memory sources enhances the model's capacity for knowledge acquisition and retention.</description>

      <title>Moral Alignment for LLM Agents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01639v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Decision-making agents based on pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being deployed across various domains of human activity. While their applications are currently rather specialized, several research efforts are under way to develop more generalist agents. As LLM-based systems become more agentic, their influence on human activity will grow and the transparency of this will decrease. Consequently, developing effective methods for aligning them to human values is vital.
  The prevailing practice in alignment often relies on human preference data (e.g., in RLHF or DPO), in which values are implicit and are essentially deduced from relative preferences over different model outputs. In this work, instead of relying on human feedback, we introduce the design of reward functions that explicitly encode core human values for Reinforcement Learning-based fine-tuning of foundation agent models. Specifically, we use intrinsic rewards for the moral alignment of LLM agents.
  We evaluate our approach using the traditional philosophical frameworks of Deontological Ethics and Utilitarianism, quantifying moral rewards for agents in terms of actions and consequences on the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma (IPD) environment. We also show how moral fine-tuning can be deployed to enable an agent to unlearn a previously developed selfish strategy. Finally, we find that certain moral strategies learned on the IPD game generalize to several other matrix game environments. In summary, we demonstrate that fine-tuning with intrinsic rewards is a promising general solution for aligning LLM agents to human values, and it might represent a more transparent and cost-effective alternative to currently predominant alignment techniques.</description>

      <title>ViBiDSampler: Enhancing Video Interpolation Using Bidirectional Diffusion Sampler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05651v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent progress in large-scale text-to-video (T2V) and image-to-video (I2V) diffusion models has greatly enhanced video generation, especially in terms of keyframe interpolation. However, current image-to-video diffusion models, while powerful in generating videos from a single conditioning frame, need adaptation for two-frame (start &amp; end) conditioned generation, which is essential for effective bounded interpolation. Unfortunately, existing approaches that fuse temporally forward and backward paths in parallel often suffer from off-manifold issues, leading to artifacts or requiring multiple iterative re-noising steps. In this work, we introduce a novel, bidirectional sampling strategy to address these off-manifold issues without requiring extensive re-noising or fine-tuning. Our method employs sequential sampling along both forward and backward paths, conditioned on the start and end frames, respectively, ensuring more coherent and on-manifold generation of intermediate frames. Additionally, we incorporate advanced guidance techniques, CFG++ and DDS, to further enhance the interpolation process. By integrating these, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, efficiently generating high-quality, smooth videos between keyframes. On a single 3090 GPU, our method can interpolate 25 frames at 1024 x 576 resolution in just 195 seconds, establishing it as a leading solution for keyframe interpolation.</description>

      <title>PAR: Prompt-Aware Token Reduction Method for Efficient Large Multimodal Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07278v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) demonstrate strong performance across visual tasks, but their efficiency is hindered by significant computational and memory demands from processing long contexts in multimodal inputs. To address this, we introduce PAR (Prompt-Aware Token Reduction), a novel and plug-and-play approach that reduces visual tokens efficiently without compromising model performance. Unlike previous methods that rely heavily on attention mechanisms and overlooking cross-modal interactions , we uses a prompt-aware strategy to adpative identify and cluster essential visual tokens. PAR categorizes visual context redundancy into two types: external and internal. External redundancy is minimized through semantic retrieval, while internal redundancy is addressed using a token routing mechanism. This method substantially reduces computational load without requiring additional training or complex architectural modifications. \textbf{Experimental results demonstrate that across various visual question answering tasks, PAR reduces FLOPs by 83\% with a compression ratio of 89\%, while retaining 97\% of baseline accuracy.} The adaptive design of PAR achieves a 2x token reduction ratio compared to prior approaches, enabling a better balance between performance and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Masked Generative Priors Improve World Models Sequence Modelling Capabilities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07836v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become the leading approach for creating artificial agents in complex environments. Model-based approaches, which are RL methods with world models that predict environment dynamics, are among the most promising directions for improving data efficiency, forming a critical step toward bridging the gap between research and real-world deployment. In particular, world models enhance sample efficiency by learning in imagination, which involves training a generative sequence model of the environment in a self-supervised manner. Recently, Masked Generative Modelling has emerged as a more efficient and superior inductive bias for modelling and generating token sequences. Building on the Efficient Stochastic Transformer-based World Models (STORM) architecture, we replace the traditional MLP prior with a Masked Generative Prior (e.g., MaskGIT Prior) and introduce GIT-STORM. We evaluate our model on two downstream tasks: reinforcement learning and video prediction. GIT-STORM demonstrates substantial performance gains in RL tasks on the Atari 100k benchmark. Moreover, we apply Transformer-based World Models to continuous action environments for the first time, addressing a significant gap in prior research. To achieve this, we employ a state mixer function that integrates latent state representations with actions, enabling our model to handle continuous control tasks. We validate this approach through qualitative and quantitative analyses on the DeepMind Control Suite, showcasing the effectiveness of Transformer-based World Models in this new domain. Our results highlight the versatility and efficacy of the MaskGIT dynamics prior, paving the way for more accurate world models and effective RL policies.</description>

      <title>Learning General Representation of 12-Lead Electrocardiogram with a Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08559v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) captures the heart's electrical signals, offering valuable information for diagnosing cardiac conditions. However, the scarcity of labeled data makes it challenging to fully leverage supervised learning in medical domain. Self-supervised learning (SSL) offers a promising solution, enabling models to learn from unlabeled data and uncover meaningful patterns. In this paper, we show that masked modeling in the latent space can be a powerful alternative to existing self-supervised methods in the ECG domain. We introduce ECG-JEPA, a SSL model for 12-lead ECG analysis that learns semantic representations of ECG data by predicting in the hidden latent space, bypassing the need to reconstruct raw signals. This approach offers several advantages in the ECG domain: (1) it avoids producing unnecessary details, such as noise, which is common in ECG; and (2) it addresses the limitations of na\"ive L2 loss between raw signals. Another key contribution is the introduction of Cross-Pattern Attention (CroPA), a specialized masked attention mechanism tailored for 12-lead ECG data. ECG-JEPA is trained on the union of several open ECG datasets, totaling approximately 180,000 samples, and achieves state-of-the-art performance in various downstream tasks including ECG classification and feature prediction. Our code is openly available at https://github.com/sehunfromdaegu/ECG_JEPA.</description>

      <title>Burning RED: Unlocking Subtask-Driven Reinforcement Learning and Risk-Awareness in Average-Reward Markov Decision Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10578v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Average-reward Markov decision processes (MDPs) provide a foundational framework for sequential decision-making under uncertainty. However, average-reward MDPs have remained largely unexplored in reinforcement learning (RL) settings, with the majority of RL-based efforts having been allocated to episodic and discounted MDPs. In this work, we study a unique structural property of average-reward MDPs and utilize it to introduce Reward-Extended Differential (or RED) reinforcement learning: a novel RL framework that can be used to effectively and efficiently solve various subtasks simultaneously in the average-reward setting. We introduce a family of RED learning algorithms for prediction and control, including proven-convergent algorithms for the tabular case. We then showcase the power of these algorithms by demonstrating how they can be used to learn a policy that optimizes, for the first time, the well-known conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) risk measure in a fully-online manner, without the use of an explicit bi-level optimization scheme or an augmented state-space.</description>

Abstract: This report presents Sabi\'a-3, our new flagship language model, and Sabiazinho-3, a more cost-effective sibling. The models were trained on a large brazilian-centric corpus. Evaluations across diverse professional and academic benchmarks show a strong performance on Portuguese and Brazil-related tasks. Sabi\'a-3 shows large improvements in comparison to our previous best of model, Sabia-2 Medium, especially in reasoning-intensive tasks. Notably, Sabi\'a-3's average performance matches frontier LLMs, while it is offered at a three to four times lower cost per token, reinforcing the benefits of domain specialization.</description>

      <title>DistRL: An Asynchronous Distributed Reinforcement Learning Framework for On-Device Control Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14803v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: On-device control agents, especially on mobile devices, are responsible for operating mobile devices to fulfill users' requests, enabling seamless and intuitive interactions. Integrating Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) into these agents enhances their ability to understand and execute complex commands, thereby improving user experience. However, fine-tuning MLLMs for on-device control presents significant challenges due to limited data availability and inefficient online training processes. This paper introduces DistRL, a novel framework designed to enhance the efficiency of online RL fine-tuning for mobile device control agents. DistRL employs centralized training and decentralized data acquisition to ensure efficient fine-tuning in the context of dynamic online interactions. Additionally, the framework is backed by our tailor-made RL algorithm, which effectively balances exploration with the prioritized utilization of collected data to ensure stable and robust training. Our experiments show that, on average, DistRL delivers a 3X improvement in training efficiency and enables training data collection 2.4X faster than the leading synchronous multi-machine methods. Notably, after training, DistRL achieves a 20% relative improvement in success rate compared to state-of-the-art methods on general Android tasks from an open benchmark, significantly outperforming existing approaches while maintaining the same training time. These results validate DistRL as a scalable and efficient solution, offering substantial improvements in both training efficiency and agent performance for real-world, in-the-wild device control tasks.</description>

      <title>FlickerFusion: Intra-trajectory Domain Generalizing Multi-Agent RL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15876v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning has demonstrated significant potential in addressing complex cooperative tasks across various real-world applications. However, existing MARL approaches often rely on the restrictive assumption that the number of entities (e.g., agents, obstacles) remains constant between training and inference. This overlooks scenarios where entities are dynamically removed or added during the inference trajectory -- a common occurrence in real-world environments like search and rescue missions and dynamic combat situations. In this paper, we tackle the challenge of intra-trajectory dynamic entity composition under zero-shot out-of-domain (OOD) generalization, where such dynamic changes cannot be anticipated beforehand. Our empirical studies reveal that existing MARL methods suffer significant performance degradation and increased uncertainty in these scenarios. In response, we propose FlickerFusion, a novel OOD generalization method that acts as a universally applicable augmentation technique for MARL backbone methods. FlickerFusion stochastically drops out parts of the observation space, emulating being in-domain when inferenced OOD. The results show that FlickerFusion not only achieves superior inference rewards but also uniquely reduces uncertainty vis-\`a-vis the backbone, compared to existing methods. Benchmarks, implementations, and model weights are organized and open-sourced at flickerfusion305.github.io, accompanied by ample demo video renderings.</description>

      <title>Compute-Constrained Data Selection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16208v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data selection can reduce the amount of training data needed to finetune LLMs; however, the efficacy of data selection scales directly with its compute. Motivated by the practical challenge of compute-constrained finetuning, we consider the setting in which both the cost of selecting data and training are budgeted for. We first formalize the problem of data selection with a cost-aware utility function, and model the data selection problem as trading off initial-selection cost for training gain. We run a comprehensive sweep of experiments across multiple tasks, varying compute budget by scaling finetuning tokens, model sizes, and data selection compute. Interestingly we find that many powerful data selection methods are almost never compute-optimal, and that cheaper data selection alternatives dominate both from a theoretical and empirical perspective. For compute-optimal training, we find that perplexity and gradient data selection require training-to-selection model size ratios of 5x and 10x, respectively.</description>

      <title>Unraveling Movie Genres through Cross-Attention Fusion of Bi-Modal Synergy of Poster</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19764v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Movie posters are not just decorative; they are meticulously designed to capture the essence of a movie, such as its genre, storyline, and tone/vibe. For decades, movie posters have graced cinema walls, billboards, and now our digital screens as a form of digital posters. Movie genre classification plays a pivotal role in film marketing, audience engagement, and recommendation systems. Previous explorations into movie genre classification have been mostly examined in plot summaries, subtitles, trailers and movie scenes. Movie posters provide a pre-release tantalizing glimpse into a film's key aspects, which can ignite public interest. In this paper, we presented the framework that exploits movie posters from a visual and textual perspective to address the multilabel movie genre classification problem. Firstly, we extracted text from movie posters using an OCR and retrieved the relevant embedding. Next, we introduce a cross-attention-based fusion module to allocate attention weights to visual and textual embedding. In validating our framework, we utilized 13882 posters sourced from the Internet Movie Database (IMDb). The outcomes of the experiments indicate that our model exhibited promising performance and outperformed even some prominent contemporary architectures.</description>

      <title>Revisiting MAE pre-training for 3D medical image segmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23132v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) presents an exciting opportunity to unlock the potential of vast, untapped clinical datasets, for various downstream applications that suffer from the scarcity of labeled data. While SSL has revolutionized fields like natural language processing and computer vision, its adoption in 3D medical image computing has been limited by three key pitfalls: Small pre-training dataset sizes, architectures inadequate for 3D medical image analysis, and insufficient evaluation practices. In this paper, we address these issues by i) leveraging a large-scale dataset of 39k 3D brain MRI volumes and ii) using a Residual Encoder U-Net architecture within the state-of-the-art nnU-Net framework. iii) A robust development framework, incorporating 5 development and 8 testing brain MRI segmentation datasets, allowed performance-driven design decisions to optimize the simple concept of Masked Auto Encoders (MAEs) for 3D CNNs. The resulting model not only surpasses previous SSL methods but also outperforms the strong nnU-Net baseline by an average of approximately 3 Dice points setting a new state-of-the-art. Our code and models are made available here.</description>

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into medical applications has sparked widespread interest across the healthcare industry, from drug discovery and development to clinical decision support, assisting telemedicine, medical devices, and healthcare insurance applications. This perspective paper aims to discuss the inner workings of building LLM-powered medical AI applications and introduces a comprehensive framework for their development. We review existing literature and outline the unique challenges of applying LLMs in specialized medical contexts. Additionally, we introduce a three-step framework to organize medical LLM research activities: 1) Modeling: breaking down complex medical workflows into manageable steps for developing medical-specific models; 2) Optimization: optimizing the model performance with crafted prompts and integrating external knowledge and tools, and 3) System engineering: decomposing complex tasks into subtasks and leveraging human expertise for building medical AI applications. Furthermore, we offer a detailed use case playbook that describes various LLM-powered medical AI applications, such as optimizing clinical trial design, enhancing clinical decision support, and advancing medical imaging analysis. Finally, we discuss various challenges and considerations for building medical AI applications with LLMs, such as handling hallucination issues, data ownership and compliance, privacy, intellectual property considerations, compute cost, sustainability issues, and responsible AI requirements.</description>

      <title>GameGen-X: Interactive Open-world Game Video Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00769v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce GameGen-X, the first diffusion transformer model specifically designed for both generating and interactively controlling open-world game videos. This model facilitates high-quality, open-domain generation by simulating an extensive array of game engine features, such as innovative characters, dynamic environments, complex actions, and diverse events. Additionally, it provides interactive controllability, predicting and altering future content based on the current clip, thus allowing for gameplay simulation. To realize this vision, we first collected and built an Open-World Video Game Dataset from scratch. It is the first and largest dataset for open-world game video generation and control, which comprises over a million diverse gameplay video clips sampling from over 150 games with informative captions from GPT-4o. GameGen-X undergoes a two-stage training process, consisting of foundation model pre-training and instruction tuning. Firstly, the model was pre-trained via text-to-video generation and video continuation, endowing it with the capability for long-sequence, high-quality open-domain game video generation. Further, to achieve interactive controllability, we designed InstructNet to incorporate game-related multi-modal control signal experts. This allows the model to adjust latent representations based on user inputs, unifying character interaction and scene content control for the first time in video generation. During instruction tuning, only the InstructNet is updated while the pre-trained foundation model is frozen, enabling the integration of interactive controllability without loss of diversity and quality of generated video content.</description>

      <title>Free-Mask: A Novel Paradigm of Integration Between the Segmentation Diffusion Model and Image Editing to Improve Segmentation Ability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01819v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current semantic segmentation models typically require a substantial amount of manually annotated data, a process that is both time-consuming and resource-intensive. Alternatively, leveraging advanced text-to-image models such as Midjourney and Stable Diffusion has emerged as an efficient strategy, enabling the automatic generation of synthetic data in place of manual annotations. However, previous methods have been limited to generating single-instance images, as the generation of multiple instances with Stable Diffusion has proven unstable. To address this limitation and expand the scope and diversity of synthetic datasets, we propose a framework \textbf{Free-Mask} that combines a Diffusion Model for segmentation with advanced image editing capabilities, allowing for the integration of multiple objects into images via text-to-image models. Our method facilitates the creation of highly realistic datasets that closely emulate open-world environments while generating accurate segmentation masks. It reduces the labor associated with manual annotation and also ensures precise mask generation. Experimental results demonstrate that synthetic data generated by \textbf{Free-Mask} enables segmentation models to outperform those trained on real data, especially in zero-shot settings. Notably, \textbf{Free-Mask} achieves new state-of-the-art results on previously unseen classes in the VOC 2012 benchmark.</description>

      <title>Combining Induction and Transduction for Abstract Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02272v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When learning an input-output mapping from very few examples, is it better to first infer a latent function that explains the examples, or is it better to directly predict new test outputs, e.g. using a neural network? We study this question on ARC by training neural models for induction (inferring latent functions) and transduction (directly predicting the test output for a given test input). We train on synthetically generated variations of Python programs that solve ARC training tasks. We find inductive and transductive models solve different kinds of test problems, despite having the same training problems and sharing the same neural architecture: Inductive program synthesis excels at precise computations, and at composing multiple concepts, while transduction succeeds on fuzzier perceptual concepts. Ensembling them approaches human-level performance on ARC.</description>

      <title>VQA$^2$: Visual Question Answering for Video Quality Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03795v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The advent and proliferation of large multi-modal models (LMMs) have introduced new paradigms to computer vision, transforming various tasks into a unified visual question answering framework. Video Quality Assessment (VQA), a classic field in low-level visual perception, focused initially on quantitative video quality scoring. However, driven by advances in LMMs, it is now progressing toward more holistic visual quality understanding tasks. Recent studies in the image domain have demonstrated that Visual Question Answering (VQA) can markedly enhance low-level visual quality evaluation. Nevertheless, related work has not been explored in the video domain, leaving substantial room for improvement. To address this gap, we introduce the VQA2 Instruction Dataset - the first visual question answering instruction dataset that focuses on video quality assessment. This dataset consists of 3 subsets and covers various video types, containing 157,755 instruction question-answer pairs. Then, leveraging this foundation, we present the VQA2 series models. The VQA2 series models interleave visual and motion tokens to enhance the perception of spatial-temporal quality details in videos. We conduct extensive experiments on video quality scoring and understanding tasks, and results demonstrate that the VQA2series models achieve excellent performance in both tasks. Notably, our final model, the VQA2-Assistant, exceeds the renowned GPT-4o in visual quality understanding tasks while maintaining strong competitiveness in quality scoring tasks. Our work provides a foundation and feasible approach for integrating low-level video quality assessment and understanding with LMMs.</description>

      <title>An Architectural Approach to Enhance Deep Long-Tailed Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06098v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep long-tailed recognition has been widely studied to address the issue of imbalanced data distributions in real-world scenarios. However, there has been insufficient focus on the design of neural architectures, despite empirical evidence suggesting that architecture can significantly impact performance. In this paper, we attempt to mitigate long-tailed issues through architectural improvements. To simplify the design process, we utilize Differential Architecture Search (DARTS) to achieve this goal. Unfortunately, existing DARTS methods struggle to perform well in long-tailed scenarios. To tackle this challenge, we introduce Long-Tailed Differential Architecture Search (LTDAS). Specifically, we conduct extensive experiments to explore architectural components that demonstrate better performance on long-tailed data and propose a new search space based on our observations. This ensures that the architecture obtained through our search process incorporates superior components. Additionally, we propose replacing the learnable linear classifier with an Equiangular Tight Frame (ETF) classifier to further enhance our method. This classifier effectively alleviates the biased search process and prevents performance collapse. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that our approach consistently improves upon existing methods from an orthogonal perspective and achieves state-of-the-art results with simple enhancements.</description>

      <title>Circuit Complexity Bounds for RoPE-based Transformer Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07602v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Characterizing the express power of the Transformer architecture is critical to understanding its capacity limits and scaling law. Recent works provide the circuit complexity bounds to Transformer-like architecture. On the other hand, Rotary Position Embedding ($\mathsf{RoPE}$) has emerged as a crucial technique in modern large language models, offering superior performance in capturing positional information compared to traditional position embeddings, which shows great potential in application prospects, particularly for the long context scenario. Empirical evidence also suggests that $\mathsf{RoPE}$-based Transformer architectures demonstrate greater generalization capabilities compared to conventional Transformer models. In this work, we establish a circuit complexity bound for Transformers with $\mathsf{RoPE}$ attention. Our key contribution is that we show that unless $\mathsf{TC}^0 = \mathsf{NC}^1$, a $\mathsf{RoPE}$-based Transformer with $\mathrm{poly}(n)$-precision, $O(1)$ layers, hidden dimension $d \leq O(n)$ cannot solve the Arithmetic formula evaluation problem or the Boolean formula value problem. This result significantly demonstrates the fundamental limitation of the expressivity of the $\mathsf{RoPE}$-based Transformer architecture, although it achieves giant empirical success. Our theoretical result not only establishes the complexity bound but also may instruct further work on the $\mathsf{RoPE}$-based Transformer.</description>

      <title>Visual Cue Enhancement and Dual Low-Rank Adaptation for Efficient Visual Instruction Fine-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12787v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning multimodal large language models (MLLMs) presents significant challenges, including reliance on high-level visual features that limit fine-grained detail comprehension, and data conflicts that arise from task complexity. To address these issues, we propose an efficient fine-tuning framework with two novel approaches: Vision Cue Enhancement (VCE) and Dual Low-Rank Adaptation (Dual-LoRA). VCE enhances the vision projector by integrating multi-level visual cues, improving the model's ability to capture fine-grained visual features. Dual-LoRA introduces a dual low-rank structure for instruction tuning, decoupling learning into skill and task spaces to enable precise control and efficient adaptation across diverse tasks. Our method simplifies implementation, enhances visual comprehension, and improves adaptability. Experiments on both downstream tasks and general benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Are Large Language Models Memorizing Bug Benchmarks?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13323v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become integral to various software engineering tasks, including code generation, bug detection, and repair. To evaluate model performance in these domains, numerous bug benchmarks containing real-world bugs from software projects have been developed. However, a growing concern within the software engineering community is that these benchmarks may not reliably reflect true LLM performance due to the risk of data leakage. Despite this concern, limited research has been conducted to quantify the impact of potential leakage. In this paper, we systematically evaluate popular LLMs to assess their susceptibility to data leakage from widely used bug benchmarks. To identify potential leakage, we use multiple metrics, including a study of benchmark membership within commonly used training datasets, as well as analyses of negative log-likelihood and n-gram accuracy. Our findings show that certain models, in particular codegen-multi, exhibit significant evidence of memorization in widely used benchmarks like Defects4J, while newer models trained on larger datasets like LLaMa 3.1 exhibit limited signs of leakage. These results highlight the need for careful benchmark selection and the adoption of robust metrics to adequately assess models capabilities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14491v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs) and their capacity to simulate human cognition and behavior has given rise to LLM-based frameworks and tools that are evaluated and applied based on their ability to perform tasks traditionally performed by humans, namely those involving cognition, decision-making, and social interaction. This survey provides a comprehensive examination of such human-centric LLM capabilities, focusing on their performance in both individual tasks (where an LLM acts as a stand-in for a single human) and collective tasks (where multiple LLMs coordinate to mimic group dynamics). We first evaluate LLM competencies across key areas including reasoning, perception, and social cognition, comparing their abilities to human-like skills. Then, we explore real-world applications of LLMs in human-centric domains such as behavioral science, political science, and sociology, assessing their effectiveness in replicating human behaviors and interactions. Finally, we identify challenges and future research directions, such as improving LLM adaptability, emotional intelligence, and cultural sensitivity, while addressing inherent biases and enhancing frameworks for human-AI collaboration. This survey aims to provide a foundational understanding of LLMs from a human-centric perspective, offering insights into their current capabilities and potential for future development.</description>

      <title>G-RAG: Knowledge Expansion in Material Science</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14592v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the field of Material Science, effective information retrieval systems are essential for facilitating research. Traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approaches in Large Language Models (LLMs) often encounter challenges such as outdated information, hallucinations, limited interpretability due to context constraints, and inaccurate retrieval. To address these issues, Graph RAG integrates graph databases to enhance the retrieval process. Our proposed method processes Material Science documents by extracting key entities (referred to as MatIDs) from sentences, which are then utilized to query external Wikipedia knowledge bases (KBs) for additional relevant information. We implement an agent-based parsing technique to achieve a more detailed representation of the documents. Our improved version of Graph RAG called G-RAG further leverages a graph database to capture relationships between these entities, improving both retrieval accuracy and contextual understanding. This enhanced approach demonstrates significant improvements in performance for domains that require precise information retrieval, such as Material Science.</description>

      <title>Understanding LLM Embeddings for Regression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14708v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the rise of large language models (LLMs) for flexibly processing information as strings, a natural application is regression, specifically by preprocessing string representations into LLM embeddings as downstream features for metric prediction. In this paper, we provide one of the first comprehensive investigations into embedding-based regression and demonstrate that LLM embeddings as features can be better for high-dimensional regression tasks than using traditional feature engineering. This regression performance can be explained in part due to LLM embeddings over numeric data inherently preserving Lipschitz continuity over the feature space. Furthermore, we quantify the contribution of different model effects, most notably model size and language understanding, which we find surprisingly do not always improve regression performance.</description>

      <title>OminiControl: Minimal and Universal Control for Diffusion Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15098v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce OminiControl, a highly versatile and parameter-efficient framework that integrates image conditions into pre-trained Diffusion Transformer (DiT) models. At its core, OminiControl leverages a parameter reuse mechanism, enabling the DiT to encode image conditions using itself as a powerful backbone and process them with its flexible multi-modal attention processors. Unlike existing methods, which rely heavily on additional encoder modules with complex architectures, OminiControl (1) effectively and efficiently incorporates injected image conditions with only ~0.1% additional parameters, and (2) addresses a wide range of image conditioning tasks in a unified manner, including subject-driven generation and spatially-aligned conditions such as edges, depth, and more. Remarkably, these capabilities are achieved by training on images generated by the DiT itself, which is particularly beneficial for subject-driven generation. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that OminiControl outperforms existing UNet-based and DiT-adapted models in both subject-driven and spatially-aligned conditional generation. Additionally, we release our training dataset, Subjects200K, a diverse collection of over 200,000 identity-consistent images, along with an efficient data synthesis pipeline to advance research in subject-consistent generation.</description>

      <title>Towards Million-Scale Adversarial Robustness Evaluation With Stronger Individual Attacks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15210v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As deep learning models are increasingly deployed in safety-critical applications, evaluating their vulnerabilities to adversarial perturbations is essential for ensuring their reliability and trustworthiness. Over the past decade, a large number of white-box adversarial robustness evaluation methods (i.e., attacks) have been proposed, ranging from single-step to multi-step methods and from individual to ensemble methods. Despite these advances, challenges remain in conducting meaningful and comprehensive robustness evaluations, particularly when it comes to large-scale testing and ensuring evaluations reflect real-world adversarial risks. In this work, we focus on image classification models and propose a novel individual attack method, Probability Margin Attack (PMA), which defines the adversarial margin in the probability space rather than the logits space. We analyze the relationship between PMA and existing cross-entropy or logits-margin-based attacks, and show that PMA can outperform the current state-of-the-art individual methods. Building on PMA, we propose two types of ensemble attacks that balance effectiveness and efficiency. Furthermore, we create a million-scale dataset, CC1M, derived from the existing CC3M dataset, and use it to conduct the first million-scale white-box adversarial robustness evaluation of adversarially-trained ImageNet models. Our findings provide valuable insights into the robustness gaps between individual versus ensemble attacks and small-scale versus million-scale evaluations.</description>

Abstract: Surgical assessment of liver cancer patients requires identification of the vessel trees from medical images. Specifically, the venous trees - the portal (perfusing) and the hepatic (draining) trees are important for understanding the liver anatomy and disease state, and perform surgery planning. This research aims to improve the 3D segmentation, skeletonization, and subsequent analysis of vessel trees, by creating an automatic pipeline based on deep learning and image processing techniques.
  The first part of this work explores the impact of differentiable skeletonization methods such as ClDice and morphological skeletonization loss, on the overall liver vessel segmentation performance. To this aim, it studies how to improve vessel tree connectivity.
  The second part of this study converts a single class vessel segmentation into multi-class ones, separating the two venous trees. It builds on the previous two-class vessel segmentation model, which vessel tree outputs might be entangled, and on connected components and skeleton analyses of the trees.
  After providing sub-labeling of the specific anatomical branches of each venous tree, these algorithms also enable a morphometric analysis of the vessel trees by extracting various geometrical markers.
  In conclusion, we propose a method that successfully improves current skeletonization methods, for extensive vascular trees that contain vessels of different calibers. The separation algorithm creates a clean multi-class segmentation of the vessels, validated by surgeons to provide low error. A new, publicly shared high-quality liver vessel dataset of 77 cases is thus created. Finally a method to annotate vessel trees according to anatomy is provided, enabling a unique liver vessel morphometry analysis.</description>

      <title>Neuro-Symbolic Evaluation of Text-to-Video Models using Formal Verification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16718v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in text-to-video models such as Sora, Gen-3, MovieGen, and CogVideoX are pushing the boundaries of synthetic video generation, with adoption seen in fields like robotics, autonomous driving, and entertainment. As these models become prevalent, various metrics and benchmarks have emerged to evaluate the quality of the generated videos. However, these metrics emphasize visual quality and smoothness, neglecting temporal fidelity and text-to-video alignment, which are crucial for safety-critical applications. To address this gap, we introduce NeuS-V, a novel synthetic video evaluation metric that rigorously assesses text-to-video alignment using neuro-symbolic formal verification techniques. Our approach first converts the prompt into a formally defined Temporal Logic (TL) specification and translates the generated video into an automaton representation. Then, it evaluates the text-to-video alignment by formally checking the video automaton against the TL specification. Furthermore, we present a dataset of temporally extended prompts to evaluate state-of-the-art video generation models against our benchmark. We find that NeuS-V demonstrates a higher correlation by over 5x with human evaluations when compared to existing metrics. Our evaluation further reveals that current video generation models perform poorly on these temporally complex prompts, highlighting the need for future work in improving text-to-video generation capabilities.</description>

      <title>Steering Away from Harm: An Adaptive Approach to Defending Vision Language Model Against Jailbreaks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16721v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) can produce unintended and harmful content when exposed to adversarial attacks, particularly because their vision capabilities create new vulnerabilities. Existing defenses, such as input preprocessing, adversarial training, and response evaluation-based methods, are often impractical for real-world deployment due to their high costs. To address this challenge, we propose ASTRA, an efficient and effective defense by adaptively steering models away from adversarial feature directions to resist VLM attacks. Our key procedures involve finding transferable steering vectors representing the direction of harmful response and applying adaptive activation steering to remove these directions at inference time. To create effective steering vectors, we randomly ablate the visual tokens from the adversarial images and identify those most strongly associated with jailbreaks. These tokens are then used to construct steering vectors. During inference, we perform the adaptive steering method that involves the projection between the steering vectors and calibrated activation, resulting in little performance drops on benign inputs while strongly avoiding harmful outputs under adversarial inputs. Extensive experiments across multiple models and baselines demonstrate our state-of-the-art performance and high efficiency in mitigating jailbreak risks. Additionally, ASTRA exhibits good transferability, defending against both unseen attacks at design time (i.e., structured-based attacks) and adversarial images from diverse distributions.</description>

      <title>Document Haystacks: Vision-Language Reasoning Over Piles of 1000+ Documents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16740v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have achieved impressive progress in vision-language understanding, yet they face limitations in real-world applications requiring complex reasoning over a large number of images. Existing benchmarks for multi-image question-answering are limited in scope, each question is paired with only up to 30 images, which does not fully capture the demands of large-scale retrieval tasks encountered in the real-world usages. To reduce these gaps, we introduce two document haystack benchmarks, dubbed DocHaystack and InfoHaystack, designed to evaluate LMM performance on large-scale visual document retrieval and understanding. Additionally, we propose V-RAG, a novel, vision-centric retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework that leverages a suite of multimodal vision encoders, each optimized for specific strengths, and a dedicated question-document relevance module. V-RAG sets a new standard, with a 9% and 11% improvement in Recall@1 on the challenging DocHaystack-1000 and InfoHaystack-1000 benchmarks, respectively, compared to the previous best baseline models. Additionally, integrating V-RAG with LMMs enables them to efficiently operate across thousands of images, yielding significant improvements on our DocHaystack and InfoHaystack benchmarks. Our code and datasets are available at https://github.com/Vision-CAIR/dochaystacks</description>

      <title>APT: Architectural Planning and Text-to-Blueprint Construction Using Large Language Models for Open-World Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17255v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present APT, an advanced Large Language Model (LLM)-driven framework that enables autonomous agents to construct complex and creative structures within the Minecraft environment. Unlike previous approaches that primarily concentrate on skill-based open-world tasks or rely on image-based diffusion models for generating voxel-based structures, our method leverages the intrinsic spatial reasoning capabilities of LLMs. By employing chain-of-thought decomposition along with multimodal inputs, the framework generates detailed architectural layouts and blueprints that the agent can execute under zero-shot or few-shot learning scenarios. Our agent incorporates both memory and reflection modules to facilitate lifelong learning, adaptive refinement, and error correction throughout the building process. To rigorously evaluate the agent's performance in this emerging research area, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark consisting of diverse construction tasks designed to test creativity, spatial reasoning, adherence to in-game rules, and the effective integration of multimodal instructions. Experimental results using various GPT-based LLM backends and agent configurations demonstrate the agent's capacity to accurately interpret extensive instructions involving numerous items, their positions, and orientations. The agent successfully produces complex structures complete with internal functionalities such as Redstone-powered systems. A/B testing indicates that the inclusion of a memory module leads to a significant increase in performance, emphasizing its role in enabling continuous learning and the reuse of accumulated experience. Additionally, the agent's unexpected emergence of scaffolding behavior highlights the potential of future LLM-driven agents to utilize subroutine planning and leverage the emergence ability of LLMs to autonomously develop human-like problem-solving techniques.</description>

      <title>Inference Scaling fLaws: The Limits of LLM Resampling with Imperfect Verifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17501v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent research has generated hope that inference scaling could allow weaker language models to match or exceed the accuracy of stronger models, such as by repeatedly sampling solutions to a coding problem until it passes unit tests. The central thesis of this paper is that there is no free lunch for inference scaling: indefinite accuracy improvement through resampling can only be realized if the "verifier" (in this case, a set of unit tests) is perfect. When the verifier is imperfect, as it almost always is in domains such as reasoning or coding (for example, unit tests have imperfect coverage), there is a nonzero probability of false positives: incorrect solutions that pass the verifier. Resampling cannot decrease this probability, so it imposes an upper bound to the accuracy of resampling-based inference scaling even with an infinite compute budget. We find that there is a very strong correlation between the model's single-sample accuracy (i.e. accuracy without unit tests) and its false positive rate on coding benchmarks HumanEval and MBPP, whose unit tests have limited coverage. Therefore, no amount of inference scaling of weaker models can enable them to match the single-sample accuracy of a sufficiently strong model (Fig. 1a). When we consider that false positives have a negative utility compared to abstaining from producing a solution, it bends the inference scaling curve further downward. Empirically, we find that the optimal number of samples can be less than 10 under realistic assumptions (Fig. 1b). Finally, we show that beyond accuracy, false positives may have other undesirable qualities, such as poor adherence to coding style conventions.</description>

      <title>What Differentiates Educational Literature? A Multimodal Fusion Approach of Transformers and Computational Linguistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17593v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The integration of new literature into the English curriculum remains a challenge since educators often lack scalable tools to rapidly evaluate readability and adapt texts for diverse classroom needs. This study proposes to address this gap through a multimodal approach that combines transformer-based text classification with linguistic feature analysis to align texts with UK Key Stages. Eight state-of-the-art Transformers were fine-tuned on segmented text data, with BERT achieving the highest unimodal F1 score of 0.75. In parallel, 500 deep neural network topologies were searched for the classification of linguistic characteristics, achieving an F1 score of 0.392. The fusion of these modalities shows a significant improvement, with every multimodal approach outperforming all unimodal models. In particular, the ELECTRA Transformer fused with the neural network achieved an F1 score of 0.996. Unimodal and multimodal approaches are shown to have statistically significant differences in all validation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score) except for inference time. The proposed approach is finally encapsulated in a stakeholder-facing web application, providing non-technical stakeholder access to real-time insights on text complexity, reading difficulty, curriculum alignment, and recommendations for learning age range. The application empowers data-driven decision making and reduces manual workload by integrating AI-based recommendations into lesson planning for English literature.</description>

      <title>MVBoost: Boost 3D Reconstruction with Multi-View Refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17772v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in 3D object reconstruction have been remarkable, yet most current 3D models rely heavily on existing 3D datasets. The scarcity of diverse 3D datasets results in limited generalization capabilities of 3D reconstruction models. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for boosting 3D reconstruction with multi-view refinement (MVBoost) by generating pseudo-GT data. The key of MVBoost is combining the advantages of the high accuracy of the multi-view generation model and the consistency of the 3D reconstruction model to create a reliable data source. Specifically, given a single-view input image, we employ a multi-view diffusion model to generate multiple views, followed by a large 3D reconstruction model to produce consistent 3D data. MVBoost then adaptively refines these multi-view images, rendered from the consistent 3D data, to build a large-scale multi-view dataset for training a feed-forward 3D reconstruction model. Additionally, the input view optimization is designed to optimize the corresponding viewpoints based on the user's input image, ensuring that the most important viewpoint is accurately tailored to the user's needs. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our method achieves superior reconstruction results and robust generalization compared to prior works.</description>

      <title>Geometric Point Attention Transformer for 3D Shape Reassembly</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17788v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Shape assembly, which aims to reassemble separate parts into a complete object, has gained significant interest in recent years. Existing methods primarily rely on networks to predict the poses of individual parts, but often fail to effectively capture the geometric interactions between the parts and their poses. In this paper, we present the Geometric Point Attention Transformer (GPAT), a network specifically designed to address the challenges of reasoning about geometric relationships. In the geometric point attention module, we integrate both global shape information and local pairwise geometric features, along with poses represented as rotation and translation vectors for each part. To enable iterative updates and dynamic reasoning, we introduce a geometric recycling scheme, where each prediction is fed into the next iteration for refinement. We evaluate our model on both the semantic and geometric assembly tasks, showing that it outperforms previous methods in absolute pose estimation, achieving accurate pose predictions and high alignment accuracy.</description>

      <title>"Give me the code" -- Log Analysis of First-Year CS Students' Interactions With GPT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17855v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The impact of Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-3, GPT-4, and Bard in computer science (CS) education is expected to be profound. Students now have the power to generate code solutions for a wide array of programming assignments. For first-year students, this may be particularly problematic since the foundational skills are still in development and an over-reliance on generative AI tools can hinder their ability to grasp essential programming concepts. This paper analyzes the prompts used by 69 freshmen undergraduate students to solve a certain programming problem within a project assignment, without giving them prior prompt training. We also present the rules of the exercise that motivated the prompts, designed to foster critical thinking skills during the interaction. Despite using unsophisticated prompting techniques, our findings suggest that the majority of students successfully leveraged GPT, incorporating the suggested solutions into their projects. Additionally, half of the students demonstrated the ability to exercise judgment in selecting from multiple GPT-generated solutions, showcasing the development of their critical thinking skills in evaluating AI-generated code.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17931v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While the Web has become a worldwide platform for communication, hackers and hacktivists share their ideology and communicate with members on the "Dark Web"-the reverse of the Web. Currently, the problems of information overload and difficulty to obtain a comprehensive picture of hackers and cyber-attackers hinder the effective analysis of predicting their activities on the Web. Also, there are currently more objects connected to the internet than there are people in the world and this gap will continue to grow as more and more objects gain ability to directly interface with the Internet. Many technical communities are vigorously pursuing research topics that contribute to the Internet of Things (IoT). In this paper I have proposed a novel methodology for collecting and analyzing the Dark Web information to identify websites of hackers from the Web sea, and how this information can help us in predicting IoT vulnerabilities. This methodology incorporates information collection, analysis, visualization techniques, and exploits some of the IoT devices. Through this research I want to contribute to the existing literature on cyber-security that could potentially guide in both policy-making and intelligence research.</description>

      <title>HAAT: Hybrid Attention Aggregation Transformer for Image Super-Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18003v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the research area of image super-resolution, Swin-transformer-based models are favored for their global spatial modeling and shifting window attention mechanism. However, existing methods often limit self-attention to non overlapping windows to cut costs and ignore the useful information that exists across channels. To address this issue, this paper introduces a novel model, the Hybrid Attention Aggregation Transformer (HAAT), designed to better leverage feature information. HAAT is constructed by integrating Swin-Dense-Residual-Connected Blocks (SDRCB) with Hybrid Grid Attention Blocks (HGAB). SDRCB expands the receptive field while maintaining a streamlined architecture, resulting in enhanced performance. HGAB incorporates channel attention, sparse attention, and window attention to improve nonlocal feature fusion and achieve more visually compelling results. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that HAAT surpasses state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets.

      <title>From Open Vocabulary to Open World: Teaching Vision Language Models to Detect Novel Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18207v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traditional object detection methods operate under the closed-set assumption, where models can only detect a fixed number of objects predefined in the training set. Recent works on open vocabulary object detection (OVD) enable the detection of objects defined by an unbounded vocabulary, which reduces the cost of training models for specific tasks. However, OVD heavily relies on accurate prompts provided by an ''oracle'', which limits their use in critical applications such as driving scene perception. OVD models tend to misclassify near-out-of-distribution (NOOD) objects that have similar semantics to known classes, and ignore far-out-of-distribution (FOOD) objects. To address theses limitations, we propose a framework that enables OVD models to operate in open world settings, by identifying and incrementally learning novel objects. To detect FOOD objects, we propose Open World Embedding Learning (OWEL) and introduce the concept of Pseudo Unknown Embedding which infers the location of unknown classes in a continuous semantic space based on the information of known classes. We also propose Multi-Scale Contrastive Anchor Learning (MSCAL), which enables the identification of misclassified unknown objects by promoting the intra-class consistency of object embeddings at different scales. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance in common open world object detection and autonomous driving benchmarks.</description>

      <title>DisCoRD: Discrete Tokens to Continuous Motion via Rectified Flow Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19527v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Human motion, inherently continuous and dynamic, presents significant challenges for generative models. Despite their dominance, discrete quantization methods, such as VQ-VAEs, suffer from inherent limitations, including restricted expressiveness and frame-wise noise artifacts. Continuous approaches, while producing smoother and more natural motions, often falter due to high-dimensional complexity and limited training data. To resolve this "discord" between discrete and continuous representations, we introduce DisCoRD: Discrete Tokens to Continuous Motion via Rectified Flow Decoding, a novel method that decodes discrete motion tokens into continuous motion through rectified flow. By employing an iterative refinement process in the continuous space, DisCoRD captures fine-grained dynamics and ensures smoother and more natural motions. Compatible with any discrete-based framework, our method enhances naturalness without compromising faithfulness to the conditioning signals. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that DisCoRD achieves state-of-the-art performance, with FID of 0.032 on HumanML3D and 0.169 on KIT-ML. These results solidify DisCoRD as a robust solution for bridging the divide between discrete efficiency and continuous realism.

      <title>CantorNet: A Sandbox for Testing Geometrical and Topological Complexity Measures</title>

Abstract: Many natural phenomena are characterized by self-similarity, for example the symmetry of human faces, or a repetitive motif of a song. Studying of such symmetries will allow us to gain deeper insights into the underlying mechanisms of complex systems. Recognizing the importance of understanding these patterns, we propose a geometrically inspired framework to study such phenomena in artificial neural networks. To this end, we introduce \emph{CantorNet}, inspired by the triadic construction of the Cantor set, which was introduced by Georg Cantor in the $19^\text{th}$ century. In mathematics, the Cantor set is a set of points lying on a single line that is self-similar and has a counter intuitive property of being an uncountably infinite null set. Similarly, we introduce CantorNet as a sandbox for studying self-similarity by means of novel topological and geometrical complexity measures. CantorNet constitutes a family of ReLU neural networks that spans the whole spectrum of possible Kolmogorov complexities, including the two opposite descriptions (linear and exponential as measured by the description length). CantorNet's decision boundaries can be arbitrarily ragged, yet are analytically known. Besides serving as a testing ground for complexity measures, our work may serve to illustrate potential pitfalls in geometry-ignorant data augmentation techniques and adversarial attacks.</description>

      <title>LUMIA: Linear probing for Unimodal and MultiModal Membership Inference Attacks leveraging internal LLM states</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in a variety of applications, but concerns around membership inference have grown in parallel. Previous efforts focus on black-to-grey-box models, thus neglecting the potential benefit from internal LLM information. To address this, we propose the use of Linear Probes (LPs) as a method to detect Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) by examining internal activations of LLMs. Our approach, dubbed LUMIA, applies LPs layer-by-layer to get fine-grained data on the model inner workings. We test this method across several model architectures, sizes and datasets, including unimodal and multimodal tasks. In unimodal MIA, LUMIA achieves an average gain of 15.71 % in Area Under the Curve (AUC) over previous techniques. Remarkably, LUMIA reaches AUC&gt;60% in 65.33% of cases -- an increment of 46.80% against the state of the art. Furthermore, our approach reveals key insights, such as the model layers where MIAs are most detectable. In multimodal models, LPs indicate that visual inputs can significantly contribute to detect MIAs -- AUC&gt;60% is reached in 85.90% of experiments.</description>

      <title>Critical Tokens Matter: Token-Level Contrastive Estimation Enhances LLM's Reasoning Capability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19943v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable performance on reasoning tasks. They utilize autoregressive token generation to construct reasoning trajectories, enabling the development of a coherent chain of thought. In this work, we explore the impact of individual tokens on the final outcomes of reasoning tasks. We identify the existence of ``critical tokens'' that lead to incorrect reasoning trajectories in LLMs. Specifically, we find that LLMs tend to produce positive outcomes when forced to decode other tokens instead of critical tokens. Motivated by this observation, we propose a novel approach - cDPO - designed to automatically recognize and conduct token-level rewards for the critical tokens during the alignment process. Specifically, we develop a contrastive estimation approach to automatically identify critical tokens. It is achieved by comparing the generation likelihood of positive and negative models. To achieve this, we separately fine-tune the positive and negative models on various reasoning trajectories, consequently, they are capable of identifying identify critical tokens within incorrect trajectories that contribute to erroneous outcomes. Moreover, to further align the model with the critical token information during the alignment process, we extend the conventional DPO algorithms to token-level DPO and utilize the differential likelihood from the aforementioned positive and negative model as important weight for token-level DPO learning.Experimental results on GSM8K and MATH500 benchmarks with two-widely used models Llama-3 (8B and 70B) and deepseek-math (7B) demonstrate the effectiveness of the propsoed approach cDPO.</description>
