      <title>What is Harm? Baby Don't Hurt Me! On the Impossibility of Complete Harm Specification in AI Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: "First, do no harm" faces a fundamental challenge in artificial intelligence: how can we specify what constitutes harm? While prior work treats harm specification as a technical hurdle to be overcome through better algorithms or more data, we argue this assumption is unsound. Drawing on information theory, we demonstrate that complete harm specification is fundamentally impossible for any system where harm is defined external to its specifications. This impossibility arises from an inescapable information-theoretic gap: the entropy of harm H(O) always exceeds the mutual information I(O;I) between ground truth harm O and a system's specifications I.
  We introduce two novel metrics: semantic entropy H(S) and the safety-capability ratio I(O;I)/H(O), to quantify these limitations. Through a progression of increasingly sophisticated specification attempts, we show why each approach must fail and why the resulting gaps are not mere engineering challenges but fundamental constraints akin to the halting problem. These results suggest a paradigm shift: rather than pursuing complete specifications, AI alignment research should focus on developing systems that can operate safely despite irreducible specification uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Sample-Efficient Behavior Cloning Using General Domain Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Behavior cloning has shown success in many sequential decision-making tasks by learning from expert demonstrations, yet they can be very sample inefficient and fail to generalize to unseen scenarios. One approach to these problems is to introduce general domain knowledge, such that the policy can focus on the essential features and may generalize to unseen states by applying that knowledge. Although this knowledge is easy to acquire from the experts, it is hard to be combined with learning from individual examples due to the lack of semantic structure in neural networks and the time-consuming nature of feature engineering. To enable learning from both general knowledge and specific demonstration trajectories, we use a large language model's coding capability to instantiate a policy structure based on expert domain knowledge expressed in natural language and tune the parameters in the policy with demonstrations. We name this approach the Knowledge Informed Model (KIM) as the structure reflects the semantics of expert knowledge. In our experiments with lunar lander and car racing tasks, our approach learns to solve the tasks with as few as 5 demonstrations and is robust to action noise, outperforming the baseline model without domain knowledge. This indicates that with the help of large language models, we can incorporate domain knowledge into the structure of the policy, increasing sample efficiency for behavior cloning.</description>

      <title>CowPilot: A Framework for Autonomous and Human-Agent Collaborative Web Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While much work on web agents emphasizes the promise of autonomously performing tasks on behalf of users, in reality, agents often fall short on complex tasks in real-world contexts and modeling user preference. This presents an opportunity for humans to collaborate with the agent and leverage the agent's capabilities effectively. We propose CowPilot, a framework supporting autonomous as well as human-agent collaborative web navigation, and evaluation across task success and task efficiency. CowPilot reduces the number of steps humans need to perform by allowing agents to propose next steps, while users are able to pause, reject, or take alternative actions. During execution, users can interleave their actions with the agent by overriding suggestions or resuming agent control when needed. We conducted case studies on five common websites and found that the human-agent collaborative mode achieves the highest success rate of 95% while requiring humans to perform only 15.2% of the total steps. Even with human interventions during task execution, the agent successfully drives up to half of task success on its own. CowPilot can serve as a useful tool for data collection and agent evaluation across websites, which we believe will enable research in how users and agents can work together. Video demonstrations are available at https://oaishi.github.io/cowpilot.html</description>

      <title>VeriFact: Verifying Facts in LLM-Generated Clinical Text with Electronic Health Records</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Methods to ensure factual accuracy of text generated by large language models (LLM) in clinical medicine are lacking. VeriFact is an artificial intelligence system that combines retrieval-augmented generation and LLM-as-a-Judge to verify whether LLM-generated text is factually supported by a patient's medical history based on their electronic health record (EHR). To evaluate this system, we introduce VeriFact-BHC, a new dataset that decomposes Brief Hospital Course narratives from discharge summaries into a set of simple statements with clinician annotations for whether each statement is supported by the patient's EHR clinical notes. Whereas highest agreement between clinicians was 88.5%, VeriFact achieves up to 92.7% agreement when compared to a denoised and adjudicated average human clinican ground truth, suggesting that VeriFact exceeds the average clinician's ability to fact-check text against a patient's medical record. VeriFact may accelerate the development of LLM-based EHR applications by removing current evaluation bottlenecks.</description>

      <title>MACI: Multi-Agent Collaborative Intelligence for Robust Reasoning and Temporal Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence requires deliberate reasoning, temporal awareness, and effective constraint management, capabilities beyond the pattern-matching strengths of LLMs. LLMs struggle with planning tasks because of their reliance on associative reasoning, inability to self-verify, and inconsistent constraint awareness. We propose Multi-Agent Collaborative Intelligence (MACI), a framework centered on a meta-planner (MP) that orchestrates multiple agents to generate planner templates that define roles and constraints. These planners produce actionable workflows of role nodes and dependency constraints, enabling advanced temporal reasoning and adaptability.
  MACI's three-tier architecture includes a meta-planning module for planner construction, common agents for general reasoning, and specialized agents for domain expertise. By decoupling planning from validation, it overcomes key LLM limitations. Evaluations demonstrate MACI's effective constraint satisfaction, conflict detection, and reasoning, positioning it as a robust solution for complex reasoning and planning tasks.</description>

      <title>Agential AI for Integrated Continual Learning, Deliberative Behavior, and Comprehensible Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contemporary machine learning paradigm excels in statistical data analysis, solving problems that classical AI couldn't. However, it faces key limitations, such as a lack of integration with planning, incomprehensible internal structure, and inability to learn continually. We present the initial design for an AI system, Agential AI (AAI), in principle operating independently or on top of statistical methods, designed to overcome these issues. AAI's core is a learning method that models temporal dynamics with guarantees of completeness, minimality, and continual learning, using component-level variation and selection to learn the structure of the environment. It integrates this with a behavior algorithm that plans on a learned model and encapsulates high-level behavior patterns. Preliminary experiments on a simple environment show AAI's effectiveness and potential.</description>

      <title>Instantiation-based Formalization of Logical Reasoning Tasks using Language Models and Logical Solvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robustness of reasoning remains a significant challenge for large language models, and addressing it is essential for the practical applicability of AI-driven reasoning systems. We introduce Semantic Self-Verification (SSV), a novel approach that addresses the key challenge in combining language models with the rigor of logical solvers: to accurately formulate the reasoning problem from natural language to the formal language of the solver. SSV uses a consistency-based approach to produce strong abstract formalizations of problems using concrete instantiations that are generated by the model and verified by the solver. In addition to significantly advancing the overall reasoning accuracy over the state-of-the-art, a key novelty that this approach presents is a feature of verification that has near-perfect precision over a significant coverage of cases, as we demonstrate on open reasoning benchmarks. We propose such *near-certain reasoning* as a new approach to reduce the need for manual verification in many cases, taking us closer to more dependable and autonomous AI reasoning systems.</description>

      <title>Revisit Mixture Models for Multi-Agent Simulation: Experimental Study within a Unified Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulation plays a crucial role in assessing autonomous driving systems, where the generation of realistic multi-agent behaviors is a key aspect. In multi-agent simulation, the primary challenges include behavioral multimodality and closed-loop distributional shifts. In this study, we revisit mixture models for generating multimodal agent behaviors, which can cover the mainstream methods including continuous mixture models and GPT-like discrete models. Furthermore, we introduce a closed-loop sample generation approach tailored for mixture models to mitigate distributional shifts. Within the unified mixture model~(UniMM) framework, we recognize critical configurations from both model and data perspectives. We conduct a systematic examination of various model configurations, including positive component matching, continuous regression, prediction horizon, and the number of components. Moreover, our investigation into the data configuration highlights the pivotal role of closed-loop samples in achieving realistic simulations. To extend the benefits of closed-loop samples across a broader range of mixture models, we further address the shortcut learning and off-policy learning issues. Leveraging insights from our exploration, the distinct variants proposed within the UniMM framework, including discrete, anchor-free, and anchor-based models, all achieve state-of-the-art performance on the WOSAC benchmark.</description>

      <title>SFT Memorizes, RL Generalizes: A Comparative Study of Foundation Model Post-training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) are widely used post-training techniques for foundation models. However, their roles in enhancing model generalization capabilities remain unclear. This paper studies the difference between SFT and RL on generalization and memorization, focusing on text-based rule variants and visual variants. We introduce GeneralPoints, an arithmetic reasoning card game, and adopt V-IRL, a real-world navigation environment, to assess how models trained with SFT and RL generalize to unseen variants in both textual and visual domains. We show that RL, especially when trained with an outcome-based reward, generalizes across both rule-based textual and visual variants. SFT, in contrast, tends to memorize training data and struggles to generalize out-of-distribution scenarios. Further analysis reveals that RL improves the model's underlying visual recognition capabilities, contributing to its enhanced generalization in the visual domain. Despite RL's superior generalization, we show that SFT remains essential for effective RL training; SFT stabilizes the model's output format, enabling subsequent RL to achieve its performance gains. These findings demonstrates the capability of RL for acquiring generalizable knowledge in complex, multi-modal tasks.</description>

      <title>Decoding OTC Government Bond Market Liquidity: An ABM Model for Market Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The over-the-counter (OTC) government bond markets are characterised by their bilateral trading structures, which pose unique challenges to understanding and ensuring market stability and liquidity. In this paper, we develop a bespoke ABM that simulates market-maker interactions within a stylised government bond market. The model focuses on the dynamics of liquidity and stability in the secondary trading of government bonds, particularly in concentrated markets like those found in Australia and the UK. Through this simulation, we test key hypotheses around improving market stability, focusing on the effects of agent diversity, business costs, and client base size. We demonstrate that greater agent diversity enhances market liquidity and that reducing the costs of market-making can improve overall market stability. The model offers insights into computational finance by simulating trading without price transparency, highlighting how micro-structural elements can affect macro-level market outcomes. This research contributes to the evolving field of computational finance by employing computational intelligence techniques to better understand the fundamental mechanics of government bond markets, providing actionable insights for both academics and practitioners.</description>

      <title>Runtime Analysis of Evolutionary Algorithms for Multiparty Multiobjective Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In scenarios where multiple decision-makers operate within a common decision space, each focusing on their own multi-objective optimization problem (e.g., bargaining games), the problem can be modeled as a multi-party multi-objective optimization problem (MPMOP). While numerous evolutionary algorithms have been proposed to solve MPMOPs, most results remain empirical. This paper presents the first theoretical analysis of the expected runtime of evolutionary algorithms on bi-party multi-objective optimization problems (BPMOPs). Our findings demonstrate that employing traditional multi-objective optimization algorithms to solve MPMOPs is both time-consuming and inefficient, as the resulting population contains many solutions that fail to achieve consensus among decision-makers. An alternative approach involves decision-makers individually solving their respective optimization problems and seeking consensus only in the final stage. While feasible for pseudo-Boolean optimization problems, this method may fail to guarantee approximate performance for one party in NP-hard problems. Finally, We propose coevolutionary multi-party multi-objective optimizers (CoEMPMO) for pseudo-Boolean optimization and shortest path problems within a multi-party multi-objective context, which maintains a common solution set among all parties through coevolution. Theoretical and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed \( \text{CoEMPMO}_{\text{random}} \) outperforms previous algorithms in terms of the expected lower bound on runtime for pseudo-Boolean optimization problems. Additionally, \( \text{CoEMPMO}_{\text{cons}}^{\text{SP}} \) achieves better efficiency and precision in solving shortest path problems compared to existing algorithms.</description>

      <title>Explore Activation Sparsity in Recurrent LLMs for Energy-Efficient Neuromorphic Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized the deep learning field. However, the desire to deploy LLMs on edge devices introduces energy efficiency and latency challenges. Recurrent LLM (R-LLM) architectures have proven effective in mitigating the quadratic complexity of self-attention, making them a potential paradigm for computing on-edge neuromorphic processors. In this work, we propose a low-cost, training-free algorithm to sparsify R-LLMs' activations to enhance energy efficiency on neuromorphic hardware. Our approach capitalizes on the inherent structure of these models, rendering them well-suited for energy-constrained environments. Although primarily designed for R-LLMs, this method can be generalized to other LLM architectures, such as transformers, as demonstrated on the OPT model, achieving comparable sparsity and efficiency improvements. Empirical studies illustrate that our method significantly reduces computational demands while maintaining competitive accuracy across multiple zero-shot learning benchmarks. Additionally, hardware simulations with the SENECA neuromorphic processor underscore notable energy savings and latency improvements. These results pave the way for low-power, real-time neuromorphic deployment of LLMs and demonstrate the feasibility of training-free on-chip adaptation using activation sparsity.</description>

      <title>WhiSPA: Semantically and Psychologically Aligned Whisper with Self-Supervised Contrastive and Student-Teacher Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current speech encoding pipelines often rely on separate processing pipelines between text and audio, not fully leveraging the inherent overlap between these modalities for understanding human communication. Language models excel at capturing semantic meaning from text that can complement the additional prosodic, emotional, and acoustic cues from speech. This work bridges the gap by proposing WhiSPA (Whisper with Semantic-Psychological Alignment), a novel audio encoder trained with a contrastive student-teacher learning objective. Using over 500k speech segments from mental health audio interviews, we evaluate the utility of aligning Whisper audio embeddings with text representations from an SBERT encoder and text-based assessments of psychological dimensions: emotion and personality. Over self-supervised and downstream mental health tasks, WhiSPA surpasses state-of-the-art speech models, achieving an average error reduction of 73.4% on the segment-level self-supervised objective and 83.8% on 11 psychological downstream tasks. WhiSPA demonstrates that cross-modal alignment can increase the amount of text-semantic and psychological information captured in audio-only encoder models.</description>

      <title>Self-Clustering Graph Transformer Approach to Model Resting-State Functional Brain Activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) offers valuable insights into the human brain's functional organization and is a powerful tool for investigating the relationship between brain function and cognitive processes, as it allows for the functional organization of the brain to be captured without relying on a specific task or stimuli. In this study, we introduce a novel attention mechanism for graphs with subnetworks, named Self-Clustering Graph Transformer (SCGT), designed to handle the issue of uniform node updates in graph transformers. By using static functional connectivity (FC) correlation features as input to the transformer model, SCGT effectively captures the sub-network structure of the brain by performing cluster-specific updates to the nodes, unlike uniform node updates in vanilla graph transformers, further allowing us to learn and interpret the subclusters. We validate our approach on the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) dataset, comprising 7,957 participants, for the prediction of total cognitive score and gender classification. Our results demonstrate that SCGT outperforms the vanilla graph transformer method and other recent models, offering a promising tool for modeling brain functional connectivity and interpreting the underlying subnetwork structures.</description>

      <title>Self-supervised Graph Transformer with Contrastive Learning for Brain Connectivity Analysis towards Improving Autism Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) provides useful insights into the brain function both during task or rest. Representing fMRI data using correlation matrices is found to be a reliable method of analyzing the inherent connectivity of the brain in the resting and active states. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been widely used for brain network analysis due to their inherent explainability capability. In this work, we introduce a novel framework using contrastive self-supervised learning graph transformers, incorporating a brain network transformer encoder with random graph alterations. The proposed network leverages both contrastive learning and graph alterations to effectively train the graph transformer for autism detection. Our approach, tested on Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) data, demonstrates superior autism detection, achieving an AUROC of 82.6 and an accuracy of 74%, surpassing current state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Identification of Hardware Trojan Locations in Gate-Level Netlist using Nearest Neighbour Approach integrated with Machine Learning Technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the evolving landscape of integrated circuit design, detecting Hardware Trojans (HTs) within a multi entity based design cycle presents significant challenges. This research proposes an innovative machine learning-based methodology for identifying malicious logic gates in gate-level netlists. By focusing on path retrace algorithms. The methodology is validated across three distinct cases, each employing different machine learning models to classify HTs. Case I utilizes a decision tree algorithm for node-to-node comparisons, significantly improving detection accuracy through the integration of Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Case II introduces a graph-to-graph classification using a Graph Neural Network (GNN) model, enabling the differentiation between normal and Trojan-infected circuit designs. Case III applies GNN-based node classification to identify individual compromised nodes and its location. Additionally, nearest neighbor (NN) method has been combined with GNN graph-to-graph in Case II and GNN node-to-node in Case III. Despite the potential of GNN model graph-to-graph classification, NN approach demonstrated superior performance, with the first nearest neighbor (1st NN) achieving 73.2% accuracy and the second nearest neighbor (2nd NN) method reaching 97.7%. In comparison, the GNN model achieved an accuracy of 62.8%. Similarly, GNN model node-to-node classification, NN approach demonstrated superior performance, with the 1st NN achieving 93% accuracy and the 2nd NN method reaching 97.7%. In comparison, the GNN model achieved an accuracy of 79.8%. However, higher and higher NN will lead to large code coverage for the identification of HTs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence-Generated Content, a subset of Generative Artificial Intelligence, holds significant potential for advancing the e-health sector by generating diverse forms of data. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end class-conditioned framework that addresses the challenge of data scarcity in health applications by generating synthetic medical images and text data, evaluating on practical applications such as retinopathy detection, skin infections and mental health assessments. Our framework integrates Diffusion and Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate data that closely match real-world patterns, which is essential for improving downstream task performance and model robustness in e-health applications. Experimental results demonstrate that the synthetic images produced by the proposed diffusion model outperform traditional GAN architectures. Similarly, in the text modality, data generated by uncensored LLM achieves significantly better alignment with real-world data than censored models in replicating the authentic tone.</description>

      <title>Risk-Informed Diffusion Transformer for Long-Tail Trajectory Prediction in the Crash Scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Trajectory prediction methods have been widely applied in autonomous driving technologies. Although the overall performance accuracy of trajectory prediction is relatively high, the lack of trajectory data in critical scenarios in the training data leads to the long-tail phenomenon. Normally, the trajectories of the tail data are more critical and more difficult to predict and may include rare scenarios such as crashes. To solve this problem, we extracted the trajectory data from real-world crash scenarios, which contain more long-tail data. Meanwhile, based on the trajectory data in this scenario, we integrated graph-based risk information and diffusion with transformer and proposed the Risk-Informed Diffusion Transformer (RI-DiT) trajectory prediction method. Extensive experiments were conducted on trajectory data in the real-world crash scenario, and the results show that the algorithm we proposed has good performance. When predicting the data of the tail 10\% (Top 10\%), the minADE and minFDE indicators are 0.016/2.667 m. At the same time, we showed the trajectory conditions of different long-tail distributions. The distribution of trajectory data is closer to the tail, the less smooth the trajectory is. Through the trajectory data in real-world crash scenarios, Our work expands the methods to overcome the long-tail challenges in trajectory prediction. Our method, RI-DiT, integrates inverse time to collision (ITTC) and the feature of traffic flow, which can predict long-tail trajectories more accurately and improve the safety of autonomous driving systems.</description>

      <title>A Method for Multi-Hop Question Answering on Persian Knowledge Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Question answering systems are the latest evolution in information retrieval technology, designed to accept complex queries in natural language and provide accurate answers using both unstructured and structured knowledge sources. Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) systems fulfill users' information needs by utilizing structured data, representing a vast number of facts as a graph. However, despite significant advancements, major challenges persist in answering multi-hop complex questions, particularly in Persian. One of the main challenges is the accurate understanding and transformation of these multi-hop complex questions into semantically equivalent SPARQL queries, which allows for precise answer retrieval from knowledge graphs. In this study, to address this issue, a dataset of 5,600 Persian multi-hop complex questions was developed, along with their decomposed forms based on the semantic representation of the questions. Following this, Persian language models were trained using this dataset, and an architecture was proposed for answering complex questions using a Persian knowledge graph. Finally, the proposed method was evaluated against similar systems on the PeCoQ dataset. The results demonstrated the superiority of our approach, with an improvement of 12.57% in F1-score and 12.06% in accuracy compared to the best comparable method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the era of big data arrives, traditional artificial intelligence algorithms have difficulty processing the demands of massive and diverse data. Mixture of experts (MoE) has shown excellent performance and broad application prospects. This paper provides an in-depth review and analysis of the latest progress in this field from multiple perspectives, including the basic principles, algorithmic models, key technical challenges, and application practices of MoE. First, we introduce the basic concept of MoE and its core idea and elaborate on its advantages over traditional single models. Then, we discuss the basic architecture of MoE and its main components, including the gating network, expert networks, and learning algorithms. Next, we review the applications of MoE in addressing key technical issues in big data. For each challenge, we provide specific MoE solutions and their innovations. Furthermore, we summarize the typical use cases of MoE in various application domains. This fully demonstrates the powerful capability of MoE in big data processing. We also analyze the advantages of MoE in big data environments. Finally, we explore the future development trends of MoE. We believe that MoE will become an important paradigm of artificial intelligence in the era of big data. In summary, this paper systematically elaborates on the principles, techniques, and applications of MoE in big data processing, providing theoretical and practical references to further promote the application of MoE in real scenarios.</description>

      <title>Synthetic Data Generation by Supervised Neural Gas Network for Physiological Emotion Recognition Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data scarcity remains a significant challenge in the field of emotion recognition using physiological signals, as acquiring comprehensive and diverse datasets is often prevented by privacy concerns and logistical constraints. This limitation restricts the development and generalization of robust emotion recognition models, making the need for effective synthetic data generation methods more critical. Emotion recognition from physiological signals such as EEG, ECG, and GSR plays a pivotal role in enhancing human-computer interaction and understanding human affective states. Utilizing these signals, this study introduces an innovative approach to synthetic data generation using a Supervised Neural Gas (SNG) network, which has demonstrated noteworthy speed advantages over established models like Conditional VAE, Conditional GAN, diffusion model, and Variational LSTM. The Neural Gas network, known for its adaptability in organizing data based on topological and feature-space proximity, provides a robust framework for generating real-world-like synthetic datasets that preserve the intrinsic patterns of physiological emotion data. Our implementation of the SNG efficiently processes the input data, creating synthetic instances that closely mimic the original data distributions, as demonstrated through comparative accuracy assessments. In experiments, while our approach did not universally outperform all models, it achieved superior performance against most of the evaluated models and offered significant improvements in processing time. These outcomes underscore the potential of using SNG networks for fast, efficient, and effective synthetic data generation in emotion recognition applications.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Hoeffding Tree with Transfer Learning for Streaming Synchrophasor Data Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synchrophasor technology or phasor measurement units (PMUs) are known to detect multiple type of oscillations or faults better than Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems, but the volume of Bigdata (e.g., 30-120 samples per second on a single PMU) generated by these sensors at the aggregator level (e.g., several PMUs) requires special handling. Conventional machine learning or data mining methods are not suitable to handle such larger streaming realtime data. This is primarily due to latencies associated with cloud environments (e.g., at an aggregator or PDC level), and thus necessitates the need for local computing to move the data on the edge (or locally at the PMU level) for processing. This requires faster real-time streaming algorithms to be processed at the local level (e.g., typically by a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) based controllers). This paper proposes a transfer learning-based hoeffding tree with ADWIN (THAT) method to detect anomalous synchrophasor signatures. The proposed algorithm is trained and tested with the OzaBag method. The preliminary results with transfer learning indicate that a computational time saving of 0.7ms is achieved with THAT algorithm (0.34ms) over Ozabag (1.04ms), while the accuracy of both methods in detecting fault events remains at 94% for four signatures.</description>

      <title>How Strategic Agents Respond: Comparing Analytical Models with LLM-Generated Responses in Strategic Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When machine learning (ML) algorithms are used to automate human-related decisions, human agents may gain knowledge of the decision policy and behave strategically to obtain desirable outcomes. Strategic Classification (SC) has been proposed to address the interplay between agents and decision-makers. Prior work on SC has relied on assumptions that agents are perfectly or approximately rational, responding to decision policies by maximizing their utilities. Verifying these assumptions is challenging due to the difficulty of collecting real-world agent responses. Meanwhile, the growing adoption of large language models (LLMs) makes it increasingly likely that human agents in SC settings will seek advice from these tools. We propose using strategic advice generated by LLMs to simulate human agent responses in SC. Specifically, we examine five critical SC scenarios -- hiring, loan applications, school admissions, personal income, and public assistance programs -- and simulate how human agents with diverse profiles seek advice from LLMs. We then compare the resulting agent responses with the best responses generated by existing theoretical models. Our findings reveal that: (i) LLMs and theoretical models generally lead to agent score or qualification changes in the same direction across most settings, with both achieving similar levels of fairness; (ii) state-of-the-art commercial LLMs (e.g., GPT-3.5, GPT-4) consistently provide helpful suggestions, though these suggestions typically do not result in maximal score or qualification improvements; and (iii) LLMs tend to produce more diverse agent responses, often favoring more balanced effort allocation strategies. These results suggest that theoretical models align with LLMs to some extent and that leveraging LLMs to simulate more realistic agent responses offers a promising approach to designing trustworthy ML systems.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Binary Decision Biases in Large Language Models: Implications for Fair Agent-Based Financial Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being used to simulate human-like decision making in agent-based financial market models (ABMs). As models become more powerful and accessible, researchers can now incorporate individual LLM decisions into ABM environments. However, integration may introduce inherent biases that need careful evaluation. In this paper we test three state-of-the-art GPT models for bias using two model sampling approaches: one-shot and few-shot API queries. We observe significant variations in distributions of outputs between specific models, and model sub versions, with GPT-4o-Mini-2024-07-18 showing notably better performance (32-43% yes responses) compared to GPT-4-0125-preview's extreme bias (98-99% yes responses). We show that sampling methods and model sub-versions significantly impact results: repeated independent API calls produce different distributions compared to batch sampling within a single call. While no current GPT model can simultaneously achieve a uniform distribution and Markovian properties in one-shot testing, few-shot sampling can approach uniform distributions under certain conditions. We explore the Temperature parameter, providing a definition and comparative results. We further compare our results to true random binary series and test specifically for the common human bias of Negative Recency - finding LLMs have a mixed ability to 'beat' humans in this one regard. These findings emphasise the critical importance of careful LLM integration into ABMs for financial markets and more broadly.</description>

      <title>EVolutionary Independent DEtermiNistiC Explanation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The widespread use of artificial intelligence deep neural networks in fields such as medicine and engineering necessitates understanding their decision-making processes. Current explainability methods often produce inconsistent results and struggle to highlight essential signals influencing model inferences. This paper introduces the Evolutionary Independent Deterministic Explanation (EVIDENCE) theory, a novel approach offering a deterministic, model-independent method for extracting significant signals from black-box models. EVIDENCE theory, grounded in robust mathematical formalization, is validated through empirical tests on diverse datasets, including COVID-19 audio diagnostics, Parkinson's disease voice recordings, and the George Tzanetakis music classification dataset (GTZAN). Practical applications of EVIDENCE include improving diagnostic accuracy in healthcare and enhancing audio signal analysis. For instance, in the COVID-19 use case, EVIDENCE-filtered spectrograms fed into a frozen Residual Network with 50 layers improved precision by 32% for positive cases and increased the area under the curve (AUC) by 16% compared to baseline models. For Parkinson's disease classification, EVIDENCE achieved near-perfect precision and sensitivity, with a macro average F1-Score of 0.997. In the GTZAN, EVIDENCE maintained a high AUC of 0.996, demonstrating its efficacy in filtering relevant features for accurate genre classification. EVIDENCE outperformed other Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods such as LIME, SHAP, and GradCAM in almost all metrics. These findings indicate that EVIDENCE not only improves classification accuracy but also provides a transparent and reproducible explanation mechanism, crucial for advancing the trustworthiness and applicability of AI systems in real-world settings.</description>

      <title>Momentum Contrastive Learning with Enhanced Negative Sampling and Hard Negative Filtering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contrastive learning has become pivotal in unsupervised representation learning, with frameworks like Momentum Contrast (MoCo) effectively utilizing large negative sample sets to extract discriminative features. However, traditional approaches often overlook the full potential of key embeddings and are susceptible to performance degradation from noisy negative samples in the memory bank. This study addresses these challenges by proposing an enhanced contrastive learning framework that incorporates two key innovations. First, we introduce a dual-view loss function, which ensures balanced optimization of both query and key embeddings, improving representation quality. Second, we develop a selective negative sampling strategy that emphasizes the most challenging negatives based on cosine similarity, mitigating the impact of noise and enhancing feature discrimination. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves superior performance on downstream tasks, delivering robust and well-structured representations. These results highlight the potential of optimized contrastive mechanisms to advance unsupervised learning and extend its applicability across domains such as computer vision and natural language processing</description>

      <title>Large Language Models Meet Graph Neural Networks for Text-Numeric Graph Reasoning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In real-world scientific discovery, human beings always make use of the accumulated prior knowledge with imagination pick select one or a few most promising hypotheses from large and noisy data analysis results. In this study, we introduce a new type of graph structure, the text-numeric graph (TNG), which is defined as graph entities and associations have both text-attributed information and numeric information. The TNG is an ideal data structure model for novel scientific discovery via graph reasoning because it integrates human-understandable textual annotations or prior knowledge, with numeric values that represent the observed or activation levels of graph entities or associations in different samples. Together both the textual information and numeric values determine the importance of graph entities and associations in graph reasoning for novel scientific knowledge discovery. We further propose integrating large language models (LLMs) and graph neural networks (GNNs) to analyze the TNGs for graph understanding and reasoning. To demonstrate the utility, we generated the text-omic(numeric) signaling graphs (TOSG), as one type of TNGs, in which all graphs have the same entities, associations and annotations, but have sample-specific entity numeric (omic) values using single cell RNAseq (scRNAseq) datasets of different diseases. We proposed joint LLM-GNN models for key entity mining and signaling pathway mining on the TOSGs. The evaluation results showed the LLM-GNN and TNGs models significantly improve classification accuracy and network inference. In conclusion, the TNGs and joint LLM-GNN models are important approaches for scientific discovery.</description>

      <title>Multivariate Time Series Anomaly Detection by Capturing Coarse-Grained Intra- and Inter-Variate Dependencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multivariate time series anomaly detection is essential for failure management in web application operations, as it directly influences the effectiveness and timeliness of implementing remedial or preventive measures. This task is often framed as a semi-supervised learning problem, where only normal data are available for model training, primarily due to the labor-intensive nature of data labeling and the scarcity of anomalous data. Existing semi-supervised methods often detect anomalies by capturing intra-variate temporal dependencies and/or inter-variate relationships to learn normal patterns, flagging timestamps that deviate from these patterns as anomalies. However, these approaches often fail to capture salient intra-variate temporal and inter-variate dependencies in time series due to their focus on excessively fine granularity, leading to suboptimal performance. In this study, we introduce MtsCID, a novel semi-supervised multivariate time series anomaly detection method. MtsCID employs a dual network architecture: one network operates on the attention maps of multi-scale intra-variate patches for coarse-grained temporal dependency learning, while the other works on variates to capture coarse-grained inter-variate relationships through convolution and interaction with sinusoidal prototypes. This design enhances the ability to capture the patterns from both intra-variate temporal dependencies and inter-variate relationships, resulting in improved performance. Extensive experiments across seven widely used datasets demonstrate that MtsCID achieves performance comparable or superior to state-of-the-art benchmark methods.</description>

      <title>CAND: Cross-Domain Ambiguity Inference for Early Detecting Nuanced Illness Deterioration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Early detection of patient deterioration is essential for timely treatment, with vital signs like heart rates being key health indicators. Existing methods tend to solely analyze vital sign waveforms, ignoring transition relationships of waveforms within each vital sign and the correlation strengths among various vital signs. Such studies often overlook nuanced illness deterioration, which is the early sign of worsening health but is difficult to detect. In this paper, we introduce CAND, a novel method that organizes the transition relationships and the correlations within and among vital signs as domain-specific and cross-domain knowledge. CAND jointly models these knowledge in a unified representation space, considerably enhancing the early detection of nuanced illness deterioration. In addition, CAND integrates a Bayesian inference method that utilizes augmented knowledge from domain-specific and cross-domain knowledge to address the ambiguities in correlation strengths. With this architecture, the correlation strengths can be effectively inferred to guide joint modeling and enhance representations of vital signs. This allows a more holistic and accurate interpretation of patient health. Our experiments on a real-world ICU dataset demonstrate that CAND significantly outperforms existing methods in both effectiveness and earliness in detecting nuanced illness deterioration. Moreover, we conduct a case study for the interpretable detection process to showcase the practicality of CAND.</description>

      <title>Foundation Models for CPS-IoT: Opportunities and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Methods from machine learning (ML) have transformed the implementation of Perception-Cognition-Communication-Action loops in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) and the Internet of Things (IoT), replacing mechanistic and basic statistical models with those derived from data. However, the first generation of ML approaches, which depend on supervised learning with annotated data to create task-specific models, faces significant limitations in scaling to the diverse sensor modalities, deployment configurations, application tasks, and operating dynamics characterizing real-world CPS-IoT systems. The success of task-agnostic foundation models (FMs), including multimodal large language models (LLMs), in addressing similar challenges across natural language, computer vision, and human speech has generated considerable enthusiasm for and exploration of FMs and LLMs as flexible building blocks in CPS-IoT analytics pipelines, promising to reduce the need for costly task-specific engineering.
  Nonetheless, a significant gap persists between the current capabilities of FMs and LLMs in the CPS-IoT domain and the requirements they must meet to be viable for CPS-IoT applications. In this paper, we analyze and characterize this gap through a thorough examination of the state of the art and our research, which extends beyond it in various dimensions. Based on the results of our analysis and research, we identify essential desiderata that CPS-IoT domain-specific FMs and LLMs must satisfy to bridge this gap. We also propose actions by CPS-IoT researchers to collaborate in developing key community resources necessary for establishing FMs and LLMs as foundational tools for the next generation of CPS-IoT systems.</description>

      <title>Blockchain-based Crowdsourced Deep Reinforcement Learning as a Service</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for solving complex problems. However, its full potential remains inaccessible to a broader audience due to its complexity, which requires expertise in training and designing DRL solutions, high computational capabilities, and sometimes access to pre-trained models. This necessitates the need for hassle-free services that increase the availability of DRL solutions to a variety of users. To enhance the accessibility to DRL services, this paper proposes a novel blockchain-based crowdsourced DRL as a Service (DRLaaS) framework. The framework provides DRL-related services to users, covering two types of tasks: DRL training and model sharing. Through crowdsourcing, users could benefit from the expertise and computational capabilities of workers to train DRL solutions. Model sharing could help users gain access to pre-trained models, shared by workers in return for incentives, which can help train new DRL solutions using methods in knowledge transfer. The DRLaaS framework is built on top of a Consortium Blockchain to enable traceable and autonomous execution. Smart Contracts are designed to manage worker and model allocation, which are stored using the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) to ensure tamper-proof data distribution. The framework is tested on several DRL applications, proving its efficacy.</description>

      <title>Advanced Physics-Informed Neural Network with Residuals for Solving Complex Integral Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present the Residual Integral Solver Network (RISN), a novel neural network architecture designed to solve a wide range of integral and integro-differential equations, including one-dimensional, multi-dimensional, ordinary and partial integro-differential, systems, and fractional types. RISN integrates residual connections with high-accurate numerical methods such as Gaussian quadrature and fractional derivative operational matrices, enabling it to achieve higher accuracy and stability than traditional Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN). The residual connections help mitigate vanishing gradient issues, allowing RISN to handle deeper networks and more complex kernels, particularly in multi-dimensional problems. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that RISN consistently outperforms PINN, achieving significantly lower Mean Absolute Errors (MAE) across various types of equations. The results highlight RISN's robustness and efficiency in solving challenging integral and integro-differential problems, making it a valuable tool for real-world applications where traditional methods often struggle.</description>

      <title>Which Optimizer Works Best for Physics-Informed Neural Networks and Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have revolutionized the computation of PDE solutions by integrating partial differential equations (PDEs) into the neural network's training process as soft constraints, becoming an important component of the scientific machine learning (SciML) ecosystem. In its current implementation, PINNs are mainly optimized using first-order methods like Adam, as well as quasi-Newton methods such as BFGS and its low-memory variant, L-BFGS. However, these optimizers often struggle with highly non-linear and non-convex loss landscapes, leading to challenges such as slow convergence, local minima entrapment, and (non)degenerate saddle points. In this study, we investigate the performance of Self-Scaled Broyden (SSBroyden) methods and other advanced quasi-Newton schemes, including BFGS and L-BFGS with different line search strategies approaches. These methods dynamically rescale updates based on historical gradient information, thus enhancing training efficiency and accuracy. We systematically compare these optimizers on key challenging linear, stiff, multi-scale and non-linear PDEs benchmarks, including the Burgers, Allen-Cahn, Kuramoto-Sivashinsky, and Ginzburg-Landau equations, and extend our study to Physics-Informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (PIKANs) representation. Our findings provide insights into the effectiveness of second-order optimization strategies in improving the convergence and accurate generalization of PINNs for complex PDEs by orders of magnitude compared to the state-of-the-art.</description>

      <title>Low-Rank Adapters Meet Neural Architecture Search for LLM Compression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid expansion of Large Language Models (LLMs) has posed significant challenges regarding the computational resources required for fine-tuning and deployment. Recent advancements in low-rank adapters have demonstrated their efficacy in parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) of these models. This retrospective paper comprehensively discusses innovative approaches that synergize low-rank representations with Neural Architecture Search (NAS) techniques, particularly weight-sharing super-networks. Robust solutions for compressing and fine-tuning large pre-trained models are developed by integrating these methodologies. Our analysis highlights the potential of these combined strategies to democratize the use of LLMs, making them more accessible for deployment in resource-constrained environments. The resulting models exhibit reduced memory footprints and faster inference times, paving the way for more practical and scalable applications of LLMs. Models and code are available at https://github.com/IntelLabs/Hardware-Aware-Automated-Machine-Learning.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Discrete Clues: Superior Healthcare Predictions for Rare Diseases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate healthcare prediction is essential for improving patient outcomes. Existing work primarily leverages advanced frameworks like attention or graph networks to capture the intricate collaborative (CO) signals in electronic health records. However, prediction for rare diseases remains challenging due to limited co-occurrence and inadequately tailored approaches. To address this issue, this paper proposes UDC, a novel method that unveils discrete clues to bridge consistent textual knowledge and CO signals within a unified semantic space, thereby enriching the representation semantics of rare diseases. Specifically, we focus on addressing two key sub-problems: (1) acquiring distinguishable discrete encodings for precise disease representation and (2) achieving semantic alignment between textual knowledge and the CO signals at the code level. For the first sub-problem, we refine the standard vector quantized process to include condition awareness. Additionally, we develop an advanced contrastive approach in the decoding stage, leveraging synthetic and mixed-domain targets as hard negatives to enrich the perceptibility of the reconstructed representation for downstream tasks. For the second sub-problem, we introduce a novel codebook update strategy using co-teacher distillation. This approach facilitates bidirectional supervision between textual knowledge and CO signals, thereby aligning semantically equivalent information in a shared discrete latent space. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate our superiority.</description>

      <title>SAFR: Neuron Redistribution for Interpretability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superposition refers to encoding representations of multiple features within a single neuron, which is common in transformers. This property allows neurons to combine and represent multiple features, enabling the model to capture intricate information and handle complex tasks. Despite promising performance, the model's interpretability has been diminished. This paper presents a novel approach to enhance transformer interpretability by regularizing feature superposition. We introduce SAFR, which simply applies regularizations to the loss function to promote monosemantic representations for important tokens while encouraging polysemanticity for correlated token pairs, where important tokens and correlated token pairs are identified via VMASK and attention weights. With a transformer model on two classification tasks, SAFR improves interpretability without compromising prediction performance. Given an input to the model, SAFR provides an explanation by visualizing the neuron allocation and interaction within the MLP layers.</description>

      <title>On Storage Neural Network Augmented Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large-scale approximate nearest neighbor search (ANN) has been gaining attention along with the latest machine learning researches employing ANNs. If the data is too large to fit in memory, it is necessary to search for the most similar vectors to a given query vector from the data stored in storage devices, not from that in memory. The storage device such as NAND flash memory has larger capacity than the memory device such as DRAM, but they also have larger latency to read data. Therefore, ANN methods for storage require completely different approaches from conventional in-memory ANN methods. Since the approximation that the time required for search is determined only by the amount of data fetched from storage holds under reasonable assumptions, our goal is to minimize it while maximizing recall. For partitioning-based ANNs, vectors are partitioned into clusters in the index building phase. In the search phase, some of the clusters are chosen, the vectors in the chosen clusters are fetched from storage, and the nearest vector is retrieved from the fetched vectors. Thus, the key point is to accurately select the clusters containing the ground truth nearest neighbor vectors. We accomplish this by proposing a method to predict the correct clusters by means of a neural network that is gradually refined by alternating supervised learning and duplicated cluster assignment. Compared to state-of-the-art SPANN and an exhaustive method using k-means clustering and linear search, the proposed method achieves 90% recall on SIFT1M with 80% and 58% less data fetched from storage, respectively.</description>

      <title>HWPQ: Hessian-free Weight Pruning-Quantization For LLM Compression And Acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across numerous domains. However, the high time complexity of existing pruning and quantization methods significantly hinders their effective deployment on resource-constrained consumer or edge devices. In this study, we propose a novel Hessian-free Weight Pruning-Quantization (HWPQ) method. HWPQ eliminates the need for computationally intensive Hessian matrix calculations by introducing a contribution-based weight metric, which evaluates the importance of weights without relying on second-order derivatives. Additionally, we employ the Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) technique to bypass weight sorting, enabling the selection of weights that contribute most to LLM accuracy and further reducing time complexity. Our approach is extended to support 2:4 structured sparsity pruning, facilitating efficient execution on modern hardware accelerators. Experimental results demonstrate that HWPQ significantly enhances the compression performance of LLaMA2. Compared to state-of-the-art quantization and pruning frameworks, HWPQ achieves average speedups of 5.97x (up to 20.75x) in quantization time and 12.29x (up to 56.02x) in pruning time, while largely preserving model accuracy. Furthermore, we observe a 1.50x inference speedup compared to the baseline.</description>

      <title>Optimal Signal Decomposition-based Multi-Stage Learning for Battery Health Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Battery health estimation is fundamental to ensure battery safety and reduce cost. However, achieving accurate estimation has been challenging due to the batteries' complex nonlinear aging patterns and capacity regeneration phenomena. In this paper, we propose OSL, an optimal signal decomposition-based multi-stage machine learning for battery health estimation. OSL treats battery signals optimally. It uses optimized variational mode decomposition to extract decomposed signals capturing different frequency bands of the original battery signals. It also incorporates a multi-stage learning process to analyze both spatial and temporal battery features effectively. An experimental study is conducted with a public battery aging dataset. OSL demonstrates exceptional performance with a mean error of just 0.26%. It significantly outperforms comparison algorithms, both those without and those with suboptimal signal decomposition and analysis. OSL considers practical battery challenges and can be integrated into real-world battery management systems, offering a good impact on battery monitoring and optimization.</description>

      <title>Internal Activation Revision: Safeguarding Vision Language Models Without Parameter Update</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) demonstrate strong multimodal capabilities but have been found to be more susceptible to generating harmful content compared to their backbone large language models (LLMs). Our investigation reveals that the integration of images significantly shifts the model's internal activations during the forward pass, diverging from those triggered by textual input. Moreover, the safety alignments of LLMs embedded within VLMs are not sufficiently robust to handle the activations discrepancies, making the models vulnerable to even the simplest jailbreaking attacks. To address this issue, we propose an \textbf{internal activation revision} approach that efficiently revises activations during generation, steering the model toward safer outputs. Our framework incorporates revisions at both the layer and head levels, offering control over the model's generation at varying levels of granularity. In addition, we explore three strategies for constructing positive and negative samples and two approaches for extracting revision vectors, resulting in different variants of our method. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the internal activation revision method significantly improves the safety of widely used VLMs, reducing attack success rates by an average of 48.94\%, 34.34\%, 43.92\%, and 52.98\% on SafeBench, Safe-Unsafe, Unsafe, and MM-SafetyBench, respectively, while minimally impacting model helpfulness.</description>

      <title>FedAGHN: Personalized Federated Learning with Attentive Graph HyperNetworks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) aims to address the statistical heterogeneity of data across clients by learning the personalized model for each client. Among various PFL approaches, the personalized aggregation-based approach conducts parameter aggregation in the server-side aggregation phase to generate personalized models, and focuses on learning appropriate collaborative relationships among clients for aggregation. However, the collaborative relationships vary in different scenarios and even at different stages of the FL process. To this end, we propose Personalized Federated Learning with Attentive Graph HyperNetworks (FedAGHN), which employs Attentive Graph HyperNetworks (AGHNs) to dynamically capture fine-grained collaborative relationships and generate client-specific personalized initial models. Specifically, AGHNs empower graphs to explicitly model the client-specific collaborative relationships, construct collaboration graphs, and introduce tunable attentive mechanism to derive the collaboration weights, so that the personalized initial models can be obtained by aggregating parameters over the collaboration graphs. Extensive experiments can demonstrate the superiority of FedAGHN. Moreover, a series of visualizations are presented to explore the effectiveness of collaboration graphs learned by FedAGHN.</description>

      <title>UDiTQC: U-Net-Style Diffusion Transformer for Quantum Circuit Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing is a transformative technology with wide-ranging applications, and efficient quantum circuit generation is crucial for unlocking its full potential. Current diffusion model approaches based on U-Net architectures, while promising, encounter challenges related to computational efficiency and modeling global context. To address these issues, we propose UDiT,a novel U-Net-style Diffusion Transformer architecture, which combines U-Net's strengths in multi-scale feature extraction with the Transformer's ability to model global context. We demonstrate the framework's effectiveness on two tasks: entanglement generation and unitary compilation, where UDiTQC consistently outperforms existing methods. Additionally, our framework supports tasks such as masking and editing circuits to meet specific physical property requirements. This dual advancement, improving quantum circuit synthesis and refining generative model architectures, marks a significant milestone in the convergence of quantum computing and machine learning research.</description>

      <title>GraPPI: A Retrieve-Divide-Solve GraphRAG Framework for Large-scale Protein-protein Interaction Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Drug discovery (DD) has tremendously contributed to maintaining and improving public health. Hypothesizing that inhibiting protein misfolding can slow disease progression, researchers focus on target identification (Target ID) to find protein structures for drug binding. While Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) frameworks have accelerated drug discovery, integrating models into cohesive workflows remains challenging. We conducted a user study with drug discovery researchers to identify the applicability of LLMs and RAGs in Target ID. We identified two main findings: 1) an LLM should provide multiple Protein-Protein Interactions (PPIs) based on an initial protein and protein candidates that have a therapeutic impact; 2) the model must provide the PPI and relevant explanations for better understanding. Based on these observations, we identified three limitations in previous approaches for Target ID: 1) semantic ambiguity, 2) lack of explainability, and 3) short retrieval units. To address these issues, we propose GraPPI, a large-scale knowledge graph (KG)-based retrieve-divide-solve agent pipeline RAG framework to support large-scale PPI signaling pathway exploration in understanding therapeutic impacts by decomposing the analysis of entire PPI pathways into sub-tasks focused on the analysis of PPI edges.</description>

      <title>RotateKV: Accurate and Robust 2-Bit KV Cache Quantization for LLMs via Outlier-Aware Adaptive Rotations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Key-Value (KV) cache facilitates efficient large language models (LLMs) inference by avoiding recomputation of past KVs. As the batch size and context length increase, the oversized KV caches become a significant memory bottleneck, highlighting the need for efficient compression. Existing KV quantization rely on fine-grained quantization or the retention of a significant portion of high bit-widths caches, both of which compromise compression ratio and often fail to maintain robustness at extremely low average bit-widths. In this work, we explore the potential of rotation technique for 2-bit KV quantization and propose RotateKV, which achieves accurate and robust performance through the following innovations: (i) Outlier-Aware Rotation, which utilizes channel-reordering to adapt the rotations to varying channel-wise outlier distributions without sacrificing the computational efficiency of the fast Walsh-Hadamard transform (FWHT); (ii) Pre-RoPE Grouped-Head Rotation, which mitigates the impact of rotary position embedding (RoPE) on proposed outlier-aware rotation and further smooths outliers across heads; (iii) Attention-Sink-Aware Quantization, which leverages the massive activations to precisely identify and protect attention sinks. RotateKV achieves less than 0.3 perplexity (PPL) degradation with 2-bit quantization on WikiText-2 using LLaMA-2-13B, maintains strong CoT reasoning and long-context capabilities, with less than 1.7\% degradation on GSM8K, outperforming existing methods even at lower average bit-widths. RotateKV also showcases a 3.97x reduction in peak memory usage, supports 5.75x larger batch sizes, and achieves a 2.32x speedup in decoding stage.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Induced Transferable Binding Principles for Associative Prediction of Novel Drug-Target Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Significant differences in protein structures hinder the generalization of existing drug-target interaction (DTI) models, which often rely heavily on pre-learned binding principles or detailed annotations. In contrast, BioBridge designs an Inductive-Associative pipeline inspired by the workflow of scientists who base their accumulated expertise on drawing insights into novel drug-target pairs from weakly related references. BioBridge predicts novel drug-target interactions using limited sequence data, incorporating multi-level encoders with adversarial training to accumulate transferable binding principles. On these principles basis, BioBridge employs a dynamic prototype meta-learning framework to associate insights from weakly related annotations, enabling robust predictions for previously unseen drug-target pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BioBridge surpasses existing models, especially for unseen proteins. Notably, when only homologous protein binding data is available, BioBridge proves effective for virtual screening of the epidermal growth factor receptor and adenosine receptor, underscoring its potential in drug discovery.</description>

      <title>Is Open Source the Future of AI? A Data-Driven Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become central in academia and industry, raising concerns about privacy, transparency, and misuse. A key issue is the trustworthiness of proprietary models, with open-sourcing often proposed as a solution. However, open-sourcing presents challenges, including potential misuse, financial disincentives, and intellectual property concerns. Proprietary models, backed by private sector resources, are better positioned for return on investment.
  There are also other approaches that lie somewhere on the spectrum between completely open-source and proprietary. These can largely be categorised into open-source usage limitations protected by licensing, partially open-source (open weights) models, hybrid approaches where obsolete model versions are open-sourced, while competitive versions with market value remain proprietary.
  Currently, discussions on where on the spectrum future models should fall on remains unbacked and mostly opinionated where industry leaders are weighing in on the discussion. In this paper, we present a data-driven approach by compiling data on open-source development of LLMs, and their contributions in terms of improvements, modifications, and methods. Our goal is to avoid supporting either extreme but rather present data that will support future discussions both by industry experts as well as policy makers.
  Our findings indicate that open-source contributions can enhance model performance, with trends such as reduced model size and manageable accuracy loss. We also identify positive community engagement patterns and architectures that benefit most from open contributions.</description>

      <title>DynaPrompt: Dynamic Test-Time Prompt Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Test-time prompt tuning enhances zero-shot generalization of vision-language models but tends to ignore the relatedness among test samples during inference. Online test-time prompt tuning provides a simple way to leverage the information in previous test samples, albeit with the risk of prompt collapse due to error accumulation. To enhance test-time prompt tuning, we propose DynaPrompt, short for dynamic test-time prompt tuning, exploiting relevant data distribution information while reducing error accumulation. Built on an online prompt buffer, DynaPrompt adaptively selects and optimizes the relevant prompts for each test sample during tuning. Specifically, we introduce a dynamic prompt selection strategy based on two metrics: prediction entropy and probability difference. For unseen test data information, we develop dynamic prompt appending, which allows the buffer to append new prompts and delete the inactive ones. By doing so, the prompts are optimized to exploit beneficial information on specific test data, while alleviating error accumulation. Experiments on fourteen datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of dynamic test-time prompt tuning.</description>

      <title>Classification of Mild Cognitive Impairment Based on Dynamic Functional Connectivity Using Spatio-Temporal Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) is an advanced technique for capturing the dynamic changes of neural activities, and can be very useful in the studies of brain diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Yet, existing studies have not fully leveraged the sequential information embedded within dFC that can potentially provide valuable information when identifying brain conditions. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that jointly learns the embedding of both spatial and temporal information within dFC based on the transformer architecture. Specifically, we first construct dFC networks from rs-fMRI data through a sliding window strategy. Then, we simultaneously employ a temporal block and a spatial block to capture higher-order representations of dynamic spatio-temporal dependencies, via mapping them into an efficient fused feature representation. To further enhance the robustness of these feature representations by reducing the dependency on labeled data, we also introduce a contrastive learning strategy to manipulate different brain states. Experimental results on 345 subjects with 570 scans from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method for MCI (Mild Cognitive Impairment, the prodromal stage of AD) prediction, highlighting its potential for early identification of AD.</description>

      <title>PhysBench: Benchmarking and Enhancing Vision-Language Models for Physical World Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the physical world is a fundamental challenge in embodied AI, critical for enabling agents to perform complex tasks and operate safely in real-world environments. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown great promise in reasoning and task planning for embodied agents, their ability to comprehend physical phenomena remains extremely limited. To close this gap, we introduce PhysBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate VLMs' physical world understanding capability across a diverse set of tasks. PhysBench contains 100,000 entries of interleaved video-image-text data, categorized into four major domains: physical object properties, physical object relationships, physical scene understanding, and physics-based dynamics, further divided into 19 subclasses and 8 distinct capability dimensions. Our extensive experiments, conducted on 75 representative VLMs, reveal that while these models excel in common-sense reasoning, they struggle with understanding the physical world -- likely due to the absence of physical knowledge in their training data and the lack of embedded physical priors. To tackle the shortfall, we introduce PhysAgent, a novel framework that combines the generalization strengths of VLMs with the specialized expertise of vision models, significantly enhancing VLMs' physical understanding across a variety of tasks, including an 18.4\% improvement on GPT-4o. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that enhancing VLMs' physical world understanding capabilities can help embodied agents such as MOKA. We believe that PhysBench and PhysAgent offer valuable insights and contribute to bridging the gap between VLMs and physical world understanding.</description>

      <title>360Brew: A Decoder-only Foundation Model for Personalized Ranking and Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ranking and recommendation systems are the foundation for numerous online experiences, ranging from search results to personalized content delivery. These systems have evolved into complex, multilayered architectures that leverage vast datasets and often incorporate thousands of predictive models. The maintenance and enhancement of these models is a labor intensive process that requires extensive feature engineering. This approach not only exacerbates technical debt but also hampers innovation in extending these systems to emerging problem domains. In this report, we present our research to address these challenges by utilizing a large foundation model with a textual interface for ranking and recommendation tasks. We illustrate several key advantages of our approach: (1) a single model can manage multiple predictive tasks involved in ranking and recommendation, (2) decoder models with textual interface due to their comprehension of reasoning capabilities, can generalize to new recommendation surfaces and out-of-domain problems, and (3) by employing natural language interfaces for task definitions and verbalizing member behaviors and their social connections, we eliminate the need for feature engineering and the maintenance of complex directed acyclic graphs of model dependencies. We introduce our research pre-production model, 360Brew V1.0, a 150B parameter, decoder-only model that has been trained and fine-tuned on LinkedIn's data and tasks. This model is capable of solving over 30 predictive tasks across various segments of the LinkedIn platform, achieving performance levels comparable to or exceeding those of current production systems based on offline metrics, without task-specific fine-tuning. Notably, each of these tasks is conventionally addressed by dedicated models that have been developed and maintained over multiple years by teams of a similar or larger size than our own.</description>

      <title>Detecting Zero-Day Attacks in Digital Substations via In-Context Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The occurrences of cyber attacks on the power grids have been increasing every year, with novel attack techniques emerging every year. In this paper, we address the critical challenge of detecting novel/zero-day attacks in digital substations that employ the IEC-61850 communication protocol. While many heuristic and machine learning (ML)-based methods have been proposed for attack detection in IEC-61850 digital substations, generalization to novel or zero-day attacks remains challenging. We propose an approach that leverages the in-context learning (ICL) capability of the transformer architecture, the fundamental building block of large language models. The ICL approach enables the model to detect zero-day attacks and learn from a few examples of that attack without explicit retraining. Our experiments on the IEC-61850 dataset demonstrate that the proposed method achieves more than $85\%$ detection accuracy on zero-day attacks while the existing state-of-the-art baselines fail. This work paves the way for building more secure and resilient digital substations of the future.</description>

      <title>On the Feasibility of Using LLMs to Execute Multistage Network Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: LLMs have shown preliminary promise in some security tasks and CTF challenges. However, it is unclear whether LLMs are able to realize multistage network attacks, which involve executing a wide variety of actions across multiple hosts such as conducting reconnaissance, exploiting vulnerabilities to gain initial access, leveraging internal hosts to move laterally, and using multiple compromised hosts to exfiltrate data. We evaluate LLMs across 10 multistage networks and find that popular LLMs are unable to realize these attacks. To enable LLMs to realize these attacks, we introduce Incalmo, an LLM-agnostic high-level attack abstraction layer that sits between an LLM and the environment. Rather than LLMs issuing low-level command-line instructions, which can lead to incorrect implementations, Incalmo allows LLMs to specify high-level tasks (e.g., infect a host, scan a network), which are then carried out by Incalmo. Incalmo realizes these tasks by translating them into low-level primitives (e.g., commands to exploit tools). Incalmo also provides an environment state service and an attack graph service to provide structure to LLMs in selecting actions relevant to a multistage attack. Across 9 out of 10 realistic emulated networks (from 25 to 50 hosts), LLMs using Incalmo can successfully autonomously execute multistage attacks. We also conduct an ablation analysis to show the key role the high-level abstractions play. For instance, we find that both Incalmo's high-level tasks and services are crucial. Furthermore, even smaller-parameter LLMs with Incalmo can fully succeed in 5 of 10 environments, while larger-parameter LLMs without Incalmo do not fully succeed in any.</description>

      <title>SIM: Surface-based fMRI Analysis for Inter-Subject Multimodal Decoding from Movie-Watching Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current AI frameworks for brain decoding and encoding, typically train and test models within the same datasets. This limits their utility for brain computer interfaces (BCI) or neurofeedback, for which it would be useful to pool experiences across individuals to better simulate stimuli not sampled during training. A key obstacle to model generalisation is the degree of variability of inter-subject cortical organisation, which makes it difficult to align or compare cortical signals across participants. In this paper we address this through the use of surface vision transformers, which build a generalisable model of cortical functional dynamics, through encoding the topography of cortical networks and their interactions as a moving image across a surface. This is then combined with tri-modal self-supervised contrastive (CLIP) alignment of audio, video, and fMRI modalities to enable the retrieval of visual and auditory stimuli from patterns of cortical activity (and vice-versa). We validate our approach on 7T task-fMRI data from 174 healthy participants engaged in the movie-watching experiment from the Human Connectome Project (HCP). Results show that it is possible to detect which movie clips an individual is watching purely from their brain activity, even for individuals and movies not seen during training. Further analysis of attention maps reveals that our model captures individual patterns of brain activity that reflect semantic and visual systems. This opens the door to future personalised simulations of brain function.

      <title>Towards Robust Stability Prediction in Smart Grids: GAN-based Approach under Data Constraints and Adversarial Challenges</title>

Abstract: Smart grids are critical for addressing the growing energy demand due to global population growth and urbanization. They enhance efficiency, reliability, and sustainability by integrating renewable energy. Ensuring their availability and safety requires advanced operational control and safety measures. Researchers employ AI and machine learning to assess grid stability, but challenges like the lack of datasets and cybersecurity threats, including adversarial attacks, persist. In particular, data scarcity is a key issue: obtaining grid instability instances is tough due to the need for significant expertise, resources, and time. However, they are essential to test novel research advancements and security mitigations. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework to detect instability in smart grids by employing only stable data. It relies on a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) where the generator is trained to create instability data that are used along with stable data to train the discriminator. Moreover, we include a new adversarial training layer to improve robustness against adversarial attacks. Our solution, tested on a dataset composed of real-world stable and unstable samples, achieve accuracy up to 97.5\% in predicting grid stability and up to 98.9\% in detecting adversarial attacks. Moreover, we implemented our model in a single-board computer demonstrating efficient real-time decision-making with an average response time of less than 7ms. Our solution improves prediction accuracy and resilience while addressing data scarcity in smart grid management.</description>

      <title>Smoothed Embeddings for Robust Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Improving the safety and reliability of large language models (LLMs) is a crucial aspect of realizing trustworthy AI systems. Although alignment methods aim to suppress harmful content generation, LLMs are often still vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks that employ adversarial inputs that subvert alignment and induce harmful outputs. We propose the Randomized Embedding Smoothing and Token Aggregation (RESTA) defense, which adds random noise to the embedding vectors and performs aggregation during the generation of each output token, with the aim of better preserving semantic information. Our experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves superior robustness versus utility tradeoffs compared to the baseline defenses.</description>

      <title>Digital Twin Enabled Site Specific Channel Precoding: Over the Air CIR Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the significance of designing a reliable, intelligent, and true physical environment-aware precoding scheme by leveraging an accurately designed channel twin model to obtain realistic channel state information (CSI) for cellular communication systems. Specifically, we propose a fine-tuned multi-step channel twin design process that can render CSI very close to the CSI of the actual environment. After generating a precise CSI, we execute precoding using the obtained CSI at the transmitter end. We demonstrate a two-step parameters' tuning approach to design channel twin by ray tracing (RT) emulation, then further fine-tuning of CSI by employing an artificial intelligence (AI) based algorithm can significantly reduce the gap between actual CSI and the fine-tuned digital twin (DT) rendered CSI. The simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed novel approach in designing a true physical environment-aware channel twin model.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Network Structure of Anti-Trans Actors on TikTok</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent proliferation of short form video social media sites such as TikTok has been effectively utilized for increased visibility, communication, and community connection amongst trans/nonbinary creators online. However, these same platforms have also been exploited by right-wing actors targeting trans/nonbinary people, enabling such anti-trans actors to efficiently spread hate speech and propaganda. Given these divergent groups, what are the differences in network structure between anti-trans and pro-trans communities on TikTok, and to what extent do they amplify the effects of anti-trans content? In this paper, we collect a sample of TikTok videos containing pro and anti-trans content, and develop a taxonomy of trans related sentiment to enable the classification of content on TikTok, and ultimately analyze the reply network structures of pro-trans and anti-trans communities. In order to accomplish this, we worked with hired expert data annotators from the trans/nonbinary community in order to generate a sample of highly accurately labeled data. From this subset, we utilized a novel classification pipeline leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with annotated examples and taxonomy definitions to classify content into pro-trans, anti-trans, or neutral categories. We find that incorporating our taxonomy and its logics into our classification engine results in improved ability to differentiate trans related content, and that Results from network analysis indicate many interactions between posters of pro-trans and anti-trans content exist, further demonstrating targeting of trans individuals, and demonstrating the need for better content moderation tools</description>

Abstract: Quantum computing promises advantages over classical computing. The manufacturing of quantum hardware is in the infancy stage, called the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era. A major challenge is automated quantum circuit design that map a quantum circuit to gates in a universal gate set. In this paper, we present a generic MDP modeling and employ Q-learning and DQN algorithms for quantum circuit design. By leveraging the power of deep reinforcement learning, we aim to provide an automatic and scalable approach over traditional hand-crafted heuristic methods.</description>

      <title>Decrypting the temperature field in flow boiling with latent diffusion models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an innovative method using Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) to generate temperature fields from phase indicator maps. By leveraging the BubbleML dataset from numerical simulations, the LDM translates phase field data into corresponding temperature distributions through a two-stage training process involving a vector-quantized variational autoencoder (VQVAE) and a denoising autoencoder. The resulting model effectively reconstructs complex temperature fields at interfaces. Spectral analysis indicates a high degree of agreement with ground truth data in the low to mid wavenumber ranges, even though some inconsistencies are observed at higher wavenumbers, suggesting areas for further enhancement. This machine learning approach significantly reduces the computational burden of traditional simulations and improves the precision of experimental calibration methods. Future work will focus on refining the model's ability to represent small-scale turbulence and expanding its applicability to a broader range of boiling conditions.</description>

      <title>How well can LLMs Grade Essays in Arabic?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This research assesses the effectiveness of state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs), including ChatGPT, Llama, Aya, Jais, and ACEGPT, in the task of Arabic automated essay scoring (AES) using the AR-AES dataset. It explores various evaluation methodologies, including zero-shot, few-shot in-context learning, and fine-tuning, and examines the influence of instruction-following capabilities through the inclusion of marking guidelines within the prompts. A mixed-language prompting strategy, integrating English prompts with Arabic content, was implemented to improve model comprehension and performance. Among the models tested, ACEGPT demonstrated the strongest performance across the dataset, achieving a Quadratic Weighted Kappa (QWK) of 0.67, but was outperformed by a smaller BERT-based model with a QWK of 0.88. The study identifies challenges faced by LLMs in processing Arabic, including tokenization complexities and higher computational demands. Performance variation across different courses underscores the need for adaptive models capable of handling diverse assessment formats and highlights the positive impact of effective prompt engineering on improving LLM outputs. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to empirically evaluate the performance of multiple generative Large Language Models (LLMs) on Arabic essays using authentic student data.</description>

      <title>Multi-Objective Deep-Learning-based Biomechanical Deformable Image Registration with MOREA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When choosing a deformable image registration (DIR) approach for images with large deformations and content mismatch, the realism of found transformations often needs to be traded off against the required runtime. DIR approaches using deep learning (DL) techniques have shown remarkable promise in instantly predicting a transformation. However, on difficult registration problems, the realism of these transformations can fall short. DIR approaches using biomechanical, finite element modeling (FEM) techniques can find more realistic transformations, but tend to require much longer runtimes. This work proposes the first hybrid approach to combine them, with the aim of getting the best of both worlds. This hybrid approach, called DL-MOREA, combines a recently introduced multi-objective DL-based DIR approach which leverages the VoxelMorph framework, called DL-MODIR, with MOREA, an evolutionary algorithm-based, multi-objective DIR approach in which a FEM-like biomechanical mesh transformation model is used. In our proposed hybrid approach, the DL results are used to smartly initialize MOREA, with the aim of more efficiently optimizing its mesh transformation model. We empirically compare DL-MOREA against its components, DL-MODIR and MOREA, on CT scan pairs capturing large bladder filling differences of 15 cervical cancer patients. While MOREA requires a median runtime of 45 minutes, DL-MOREA can already find high-quality transformations after 5 minutes. Compared to the DL-MODIR transformations, the transformations found by DL-MOREA exhibit far less folding and improve or preserve the bladder contour distance error.</description>

      <title>Targeting Alignment: Extracting Safety Classifiers of Aligned LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Alignment in large language models (LLMs) is used to enforce guidelines such as safety. Yet, alignment fails in the face of jailbreak attacks that modify inputs to induce unsafe outputs. In this paper, we present and evaluate a method to assess the robustness of LLM alignment. We observe that alignment embeds a safety classifier in the target model that is responsible for deciding between refusal and compliance. We seek to extract an approximation of this classifier, called a surrogate classifier, from the LLM. We develop an algorithm for identifying candidate classifiers from subsets of the LLM model. We evaluate the degree to which the candidate classifiers approximate the model's embedded classifier in benign (F1 score) and adversarial (using surrogates in a white-box attack) settings. Our evaluation shows that the best candidates achieve accurate agreement (an F1 score above 80%) using as little as 20% of the model architecture. Further, we find attacks mounted on the surrogate models can be transferred with high accuracy. For example, a surrogate using only 50% of the Llama 2 model achieved an attack success rate (ASR) of 70%, a substantial improvement over attacking the LLM directly, where we only observed a 22% ASR. These results show that extracting surrogate classifiers is a viable (and highly effective) means for modeling (and therein addressing) the vulnerability of aligned models to jailbreaking attacks.</description>

Abstract: We present a novel mission-planning strategy for heterogeneous multi-robot teams, taking into account the specific constraints and capabilities of each robot. Our approach employs hierarchical trees to systematically break down complex missions into manageable sub-tasks. We develop specialized APIs and tools, which are utilized by Large Language Models (LLMs) to efficiently construct these hierarchical trees. Once the hierarchical tree is generated, it is further decomposed to create optimized schedules for each robot, ensuring adherence to their individual constraints and capabilities. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework through detailed examples covering a wide range of missions, showcasing its flexibility and scalability.</description>

      <title>PackDiT: Joint Human Motion and Text Generation via Mutual Prompting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human motion generation has advanced markedly with the advent of diffusion models. Most recent studies have concentrated on generating motion sequences based on text prompts, commonly referred to as text-to-motion generation. However, the bidirectional generation of motion and text, enabling tasks such as motion-to-text alongside text-to-motion, has been largely unexplored. This capability is essential for aligning diverse modalities and supports unconditional generation. In this paper, we introduce PackDiT, the first diffusion-based generative model capable of performing various tasks simultaneously, including motion generation, motion prediction, text generation, text-to-motion, motion-to-text, and joint motion-text generation. Our core innovation leverages mutual blocks to integrate multiple diffusion transformers (DiTs) across different modalities seamlessly. We train PackDiT on the HumanML3D dataset, achieving state-of-the-art text-to-motion performance with an FID score of 0.106, along with superior results in motion prediction and in-between tasks. Our experiments further demonstrate that diffusion models are effective for motion-to-text generation, achieving performance comparable to that of autoregressive models.</description>

      <title>Efficient Object Detection of Marine Debris using Pruned YOLO Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Marine debris poses significant harm to marine life due to substances like microplastics, polychlorinated biphenyls, and pesticides, which damage habitats and poison organisms. Human-based solutions, such as diving, are increasingly ineffective in addressing this issue. Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are being developed for efficient sea garbage collection, with the choice of object detection architecture being critical. This research employs the YOLOv4 model for real-time detection of marine debris using the Trash-ICRA 19 dataset, consisting of 7683 images at 480x320 pixels. Various modifications-pretrained models, training from scratch, mosaic augmentation, layer freezing, YOLOv4-tiny, and channel pruning-are compared to enhance architecture efficiency. Channel pruning significantly improves detection speed, increasing the base YOLOv4 frame rate from 15.19 FPS to 19.4 FPS, with only a 1.2% drop in mean Average Precision, from 97.6% to 96.4%.</description>

Abstract: Generative AI could enhance scientific discovery by supporting knowledge workers in science organizations. However, the real-world applications and perceived concerns of generative AI use in these organizations are uncertain. In this paper, we report on a collaborative study with a US national laboratory with employees spanning Science and Operations about their use of generative AI tools. We surveyed 66 employees, interviewed a subset (N=22), and measured early adoption of an internal generative AI interface called Argo lab-wide. We have four findings: (1) Argo usage data shows small but increasing use by Science and Operations employees; Common current and envisioned use cases for generative AI in this context conceptually fall into either a (2) copilot or (3) workflow agent modality; and (4) Concerns include sensitive data security, academic publishing, and job impacts. Based on our findings, we make recommendations for generative AI use in science and other organizations.</description>

      <title>Applying Ensemble Models based on Graph Neural Network and Reinforcement Learning for Wind Power Forecasting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately predicting the wind power output of a wind farm across various time scales utilizing Wind Power Forecasting (WPF) is a critical issue in wind power trading and utilization. The WPF problem remains unresolved due to numerous influencing variables, such as wind speed, temperature, latitude, and longitude. Furthermore, achieving high prediction accuracy is crucial for maintaining electric grid stability and ensuring supply security. In this paper, we model all wind turbines within a wind farm as graph nodes in a graph built by their geographical locations. Accordingly, we propose an ensemble model based on graph neural networks and reinforcement learning (EMGRL) for WPF. Our approach includes: (1) applying graph neural networks to capture the time-series data from neighboring wind farms relevant to the target wind farm; (2) establishing a general state embedding that integrates the target wind farm's data with the historical performance of base models on the target wind farm; (3) ensembling and leveraging the advantages of all base models through an actor-critic reinforcement learning framework for WPF.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metadata management plays a critical role in data governance, resource discovery, and decision-making in the data-driven era. While traditional metadata approaches have primarily focused on organization, classification, and resource reuse, the integration of modern artificial intelligence (AI) technologies has significantly transformed these processes. This paper investigates both traditional and AI-driven metadata approaches by examining open-source solutions, commercial tools, and research initiatives. A comparative analysis of traditional and AI-driven metadata management methods is provided, highlighting existing challenges and their impact on next-generation datasets. The paper also presents an innovative AI-assisted metadata management framework designed to address these challenges. This framework leverages more advanced modern AI technologies to automate metadata generation, enhance governance, and improve the accessibility and usability of modern datasets. Finally, the paper outlines future directions for research and development, proposing opportunities to further advance metadata management in the context of AI-driven innovation and complex datasets.</description>

      <title>Governing the Agent-to-Agent Economy of Trust via Progressive Decentralization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current approaches to AI governance often fall short in anticipating a future where AI agents manage critical tasks, such as financial operations, administrative functions, and beyond. As AI agents may eventually delegate tasks among themselves to optimize efficiency, understanding the foundational principles of human value exchange could offer insights into how AI-driven economies might operate. Just as trust and value exchange are central to human interactions in open marketplaces, they may also be critical for enabling secure and efficient interactions among AI agents. While cryptocurrencies could serve as the foundation for monetizing value exchange in a collaboration and delegation dynamic among AI agents, a critical question remains: how can these agents reliably determine whom to trust, and how can humans ensure meaningful oversight and control as an economy of AI agents scales and evolves? This paper is a call for a collective exploration of cryptoeconomic incentives, which can help design decentralized governance systems that allow AI agents to autonomously interact and exchange value while ensuring human oversight via progressive decentralization. Toward this end, I propose a research agenda to address the question of agent-to-agent trust using AgentBound Tokens, which are non-transferable, non-fungible tokens uniquely tied to individual AI agents, akin to Soulbound tokens for humans in Web3. By staking ABTs as collateral for autonomous actions within an agent-to-agent network via a proof-of-stake mechanism, agents may be incentivized towards ethical behavior, and penalties for misconduct are automatically enforced.</description>

      <title>MCTS-SQL: An Effective Framework for Text-to-SQL with Monte Carlo Tree Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text-to-SQL is a fundamental and longstanding problem in the NLP area, aiming at converting natural language queries into SQL, enabling non-expert users to operate databases. Recent advances in LLM have greatly improved text-to-SQL performance. However, challenges persist, especially when dealing with complex user queries. Current approaches (e.g., COT prompting and multi-agent frameworks) rely on the ability of models to plan and generate SQL autonomously, but controlling performance remains difficult. In addition, LLMs are still prone to hallucinations. To alleviate these challenges, we designed a novel MCTS-SQL to guide SQL generation iteratively. The approach generates SQL queries through Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and a heuristic self-refinement mechanism are used to enhance accuracy and reliability. Key components include a schema selector for extracting relevant information and an MCTS-based generator for iterative query refinement. Experimental results from the SPIDER and BIRD benchmarks show that MCTS-SQL achieves state-of-the-art performance. Specifically, on the BIRD development dataset, MCTS-SQL achieves an Execution (EX) accuracy of 69.40% using GPT-4o as the base model and a significant improvement when dealing with challenging tasks, with an EX of 51.48%, which is 3.41% higher than the existing method.</description>

      <title>Safe Reinforcement Learning for Real-World Engine Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work introduces a toolchain for applying Reinforcement Learning (RL), specifically the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm, in safety-critical real-world environments. As an exemplary application, transient load control is demonstrated on a single-cylinder internal combustion engine testbench in Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) mode, that offers high thermal efficiency and low emissions. However, HCCI poses challenges for traditional control methods due to its nonlinear, autoregressive, and stochastic nature. RL provides a viable solution, however, safety concerns, such as excessive pressure rise rates, must be addressed when applying to HCCI. A single unsuitable control input can severely damage the engine or cause misfiring and shut down. Additionally, operating limits are not known a priori and must be determined experimentally. To mitigate these risks, real-time safety monitoring based on the k-nearest neighbor algorithm is implemented, enabling safe interaction with the testbench. The feasibility of this approach is demonstrated as the RL agent learns a control policy through interaction with the testbench. A root mean square error of 0.1374 bar is achieved for the indicated mean effective pressure, comparable to neural network-based controllers from the literature. The toolchain's flexibility is further demonstrated by adapting the agent's policy to increase ethanol energy shares, promoting renewable fuel use while maintaining safety. This RL approach addresses the longstanding challenge of applying RL to safety-critical real-world environments. The developed toolchain, with its adaptability and safety mechanisms, paves the way for future applicability of RL in engine testbenches and other safety-critical settings.</description>

      <title>Chinese Stock Prediction Based on a Multi-Modal Transformer Framework: Macro-Micro Information Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes an innovative Multi-Modal Transformer framework (MMF-Trans) designed to significantly improve the prediction accuracy of the Chinese stock market by integrating multi-source heterogeneous information including macroeconomy, micro-market, financial text, and event knowledge. The framework consists of four core modules: (1) A four-channel parallel encoder that processes technical indicators, financial text, macro data, and event knowledge graph respectively for independent feature extraction of multi-modal data; (2) A dynamic gated cross-modal fusion mechanism that adaptively learns the importance of different modalities through differentiable weight allocation for effective information integration; (3) A time-aligned mixed-frequency processing layer that uses an innovative position encoding method to effectively fuse data of different time frequencies and solves the time alignment problem of heterogeneous data; (4) A graph attention-based event impact quantification module that captures the dynamic impact of events on the market through event knowledge graph and quantifies the event impact coefficient. We introduce a hybrid-frequency Transformer and Event2Vec algorithm to effectively fuse data of different frequencies and quantify the event impact. Experimental results show that in the prediction task of CSI 300 constituent stocks, the root mean square error (RMSE) of the MMF-Trans framework is reduced by 23.7% compared to the baseline model, the event response prediction accuracy is improved by 41.2%, and the Sharpe ratio is improved by 32.6%.</description>

      <title>Engaging with AI: How Interface Design Shapes Human-AI Collaboration in High-Stakes Decision-Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As reliance on AI systems for decision-making grows, it becomes critical to ensure that human users can appropriately balance trust in AI suggestions with their own judgment, especially in high-stakes domains like healthcare. However, human + AI teams have been shown to perform worse than AI alone, with evidence indicating automation bias as the reason for poorer performance, particularly because humans tend to follow AI's recommendations even when they are incorrect. In many existing human + AI systems, decision-making support is typically provided in the form of text explanations (XAI) to help users understand the AI's reasoning. Since human decision-making often relies on System 1 thinking, users may ignore or insufficiently engage with the explanations, leading to poor decision-making. Previous research suggests that there is a need for new approaches that encourage users to engage with the explanations and one proposed method is the use of cognitive forcing functions (CFFs). In this work, we examine how various decision-support mechanisms impact user engagement, trust, and human-AI collaborative task performance in a diabetes management decision-making scenario. In a controlled experiment with 108 participants, we evaluated the effects of six decision-support mechanisms split into two categories of explanations (text, visual) and four CFFs. Our findings reveal that mechanisms like AI confidence levels, text explanations, and performance visualizations enhanced human-AI collaborative task performance, and improved trust when AI reasoning clues were provided. Mechanisms like human feedback and AI-driven questions encouraged deeper reflection but often reduced task performance by increasing cognitive effort, which in turn affected trust. Simple mechanisms like visual explanations had little effect on trust, highlighting the importance of striking a balance in CFF and XAI design.</description>

      <title>Towards Resource-Efficient Compound AI Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Compound AI Systems, integrating multiple interacting components like models, retrievers, and external tools, have emerged as essential for addressing complex AI tasks. However, current implementations suffer from inefficient resource utilization due to tight coupling between application logic and execution details, a disconnect between orchestration and resource management layers, and the perceived exclusiveness between efficiency and quality.
  We propose a vision for resource-efficient Compound AI Systems through a \emph{declarative workflow programming model} and an \emph{adaptive runtime system} for dynamic scheduling and resource-aware decision-making. Decoupling application logic from low-level details exposes levers for the runtime to flexibly configure the execution environment and resources, without compromising on quality. Enabling collaboration between the workflow orchestration and cluster manager enables higher efficiency through better scheduling and resource management.
  We are building a prototype system, called \textbf{\textit{Murakkab}}, to realize this vision. Our preliminary evaluation demonstrates speedups up to $\sim 3.4\times$ in workflow completion times while delivering $\sim 4.5\times$ higher energy efficiency, showing promise in optimizing resources and advancing AI system design.</description>

      <title>Why Do We Laugh? Annotation and Taxonomy Generation for Laughable Contexts in Spontaneous Text Conversation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Laughter serves as a multifaceted communicative signal in human interaction, yet its identification within dialogue presents a significant challenge for conversational AI systems. This study addresses this challenge by annotating laughable contexts in Japanese spontaneous text conversation data and developing a taxonomy to classify the underlying reasons for such contexts. Initially, multiple annotators manually labeled laughable contexts using a binary decision (laughable or non-laughable). Subsequently, an LLM was used to generate explanations for the binary annotations of laughable contexts, which were then categorized into a taxonomy comprising ten categories, including "Empathy and Affinity" and "Humor and Surprise," highlighting the diverse range of laughter-inducing scenarios. The study also evaluated GPT-4's performance in recognizing the majority labels of laughable contexts, achieving an F1 score of 43.14%. These findings contribute to the advancement of conversational AI by establishing a foundation for more nuanced recognition and generation of laughter, ultimately fostering more natural and engaging human-AI interactions.</description>

      <title>An LLM Benchmark for Addressee Recognition in Multi-modal Multi-party Dialogue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Handling multi-party dialogues represents a significant step for advancing spoken dialogue systems, necessitating the development of tasks specific to multi-party interactions. To address this challenge, we are constructing a multi-modal multi-party dialogue corpus of triadic (three-participant) discussions. This paper focuses on the task of addressee recognition, identifying who is being addressed to take the next turn, a critical component unique to multi-party dialogue systems. A subset of the corpus was annotated with addressee information, revealing that explicit addressees are indicated in approximately 20% of conversational turns. To evaluate the task's complexity, we benchmarked the performance of a large language model (GPT-4o) on addressee recognition. The results showed that GPT-4o achieved an accuracy only marginally above chance, underscoring the challenges of addressee recognition in multi-party dialogue. These findings highlight the need for further research to enhance the capabilities of large language models in understanding and navigating the intricacies of multi-party conversational dynamics.</description>

      <title>DOCS: Quantifying Weight Similarity for Deeper Insights into Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel index, the Distribution of Cosine Similarity (DOCS), for quantitatively assessing the similarity between weight matrices in Large Language Models (LLMs), aiming to facilitate the analysis of their complex architectures. Leveraging DOCS, our analysis uncovers intriguing patterns in the latest open-source LLMs: adjacent layers frequently exhibit high weight similarity and tend to form clusters, suggesting depth-wise functional specialization. Additionally, we prove that DOCS is theoretically effective in quantifying similarity for orthogonal matrices, a crucial aspect given the prevalence of orthogonal initializations in LLMs. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of LLM architecture and behavior, offering tools with potential implications for developing more efficient and interpretable models.</description>

      <title>Molecular-driven Foundation Model for Oncologic Pathology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Foundation models are reshaping computational pathology by enabling transfer learning, where models pre-trained on vast datasets can be adapted for downstream diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic response tasks. Despite these advances, foundation models are still limited in their ability to encode the entire gigapixel whole-slide images without additional training and often lack complementary multimodal data. Here, we introduce Threads, a slide-level foundation model capable of generating universal representations of whole-slide images of any size. Threads was pre-trained using a multimodal learning approach on a diverse cohort of 47,171 hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E)-stained tissue sections, paired with corresponding genomic and transcriptomic profiles - the largest such paired dataset to be used for foundation model development to date. This unique training paradigm enables Threads to capture the tissue's underlying molecular composition, yielding powerful representations applicable to a wide array of downstream tasks. In extensive benchmarking across 54 oncology tasks, including clinical subtyping, grading, mutation prediction, immunohistochemistry status determination, treatment response prediction, and survival prediction, Threads outperformed all baselines while demonstrating remarkable generalizability and label efficiency. It is particularly well suited for predicting rare events, further emphasizing its clinical utility. We intend to make the model publicly available for the broader community.</description>

      <title>Large Language Model Critics for Execution-Free Evaluation of Code Changes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer a promising way forward for automating software engineering tasks, such as bug fixes, feature additions, etc., via multi-step LLM-based agentic workflows. However, existing metrics for evaluating such workflows, mainly build status and occasionally log analysis, are too sparse and limited in providing the information needed to assess the quality of changes made. In this work, we designed LLM-based critics to derive well-structured and rigorous intermediate/step-level, execution-free evaluation proxies for repo-level code changes. Importantly, we assume access to the gold test patch for the problem (i.e., reference-aware) to assess both semantics and executability of generated patches. With the gold test patch as a reference, we predict executability of all editing locations with an F1 score of 91.6%, aggregating which, we can predict the build status in 84.8% of the instances in SWE-bench. In particular, such an execution-focused LLM critic outperforms other reference-free and reference-aware LLM critics by 38.9% to 72.5%. Moreover, we demonstrate the usefulness of such a reference-aware framework in comparing patches generated by different agentic workflows. Finally, we open-source the library developed for this project, which allows further usage for either other agentic workflows or other benchmarks. The source code is available at https://github.com/amazon-science/code-agent-eval.</description>

      <title>Contextual Reinforcement in Multimodal Token Compression for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effective token compression remains a critical challenge for scaling models to handle increasingly complex and diverse datasets. A novel mechanism based on contextual reinforcement is introduced, dynamically adjusting token importance through interdependencies and semantic relevance. This approach enables substantial reductions in token usage while preserving the quality and coherence of information representation. Incorporating graph-based algorithms and adaptive weighting, the method captures subtle contextual relationships across textual and multimodal data, ensuring robust alignment and performance in downstream tasks. Evaluations across varied domains reveal significant improvements in accuracy and semantic retention, particularly for tasks requiring detailed cross-modal interactions. Memory usage analyses demonstrate improved computational efficiency, with minimal overhead despite the additional reinforcement processes. Performance gains are further validated through error distribution analyses, showing reduced semantic loss and syntactic inconsistencies compared to baseline models. The modular architecture ensures compatibility with a wide range of open-source frameworks, facilitating scalable implementation for real-world applications. These findings highlight the potential of contextual reinforcement in redefining token management strategies and advancing large-scale model design.</description>

      <title>Vision-based autonomous structural damage detection using data-driven methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study addresses the urgent need for efficient and accurate damage detection in wind turbine structures, a crucial component of renewable energy infrastructure. Traditional inspection methods, such as manual assessments and non-destructive testing (NDT), are often costly, time-consuming, and prone to human error. To tackle these challenges, this research investigates advanced deep learning algorithms for vision-based structural health monitoring (SHM). A dataset of wind turbine surface images, featuring various damage types and pollution, was prepared and augmented for enhanced model training. Three algorithms-YOLOv7, its lightweight variant, and Faster R-CNN- were employed to detect and classify surface damage. The models were trained and evaluated on a dataset split into training, testing, and evaluation subsets (80%-10%-10%). Results indicate that YOLOv7 outperformed the others, achieving 82.4% mAP@50 and high processing speed, making it suitable for real-time inspections. By optimizing hyperparameters like learning rate and batch size, the models' accuracy and efficiency improved further. YOLOv7 demonstrated significant advancements in detection precision and execution speed, especially for real-time applications. However, challenges such as dataset limitations and environmental variability were noted, suggesting future work on segmentation methods and larger datasets. This research underscores the potential of vision-based deep learning techniques to transform SHM practices by reducing costs, enhancing safety, and improving reliability, thus contributing to the sustainable maintenance of critical infrastructure and supporting the longevity of wind energy systems.</description>

      <title>Data Duplication: A Novel Multi-Purpose Attack Paradigm in Machine Unlearning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Duplication is a prevalent issue within datasets. Existing research has demonstrated that the presence of duplicated data in training datasets can significantly influence both model performance and data privacy. However, the impact of data duplication on the unlearning process remains largely unexplored. This paper addresses this gap by pioneering a comprehensive investigation into the role of data duplication, not only in standard machine unlearning but also in federated and reinforcement unlearning paradigms. Specifically, we propose an adversary who duplicates a subset of the target model's training set and incorporates it into the training set. After training, the adversary requests the model owner to unlearn this duplicated subset, and analyzes the impact on the unlearned model. For example, the adversary can challenge the model owner by revealing that, despite efforts to unlearn it, the influence of the duplicated subset remains in the model. Moreover, to circumvent detection by de-duplication techniques, we propose three novel near-duplication methods for the adversary, each tailored to a specific unlearning paradigm. We then examine their impacts on the unlearning process when de-duplication techniques are applied. Our findings reveal several crucial insights: 1) the gold standard unlearning method, retraining from scratch, fails to effectively conduct unlearning under certain conditions; 2) unlearning duplicated data can lead to significant model degradation in specific scenarios; and 3) meticulously crafted duplicates can evade detection by de-duplication methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detecting and localizing anomalies in cyber-physical systems (CPS) has become increasingly challenging as systems grow in complexity, particularly due to varying sensor reliability and node failures in distributed environments. While federated learning (FL) provides a foundation for distributed model training, existing approaches often lack mechanisms to address these CPS-specific challenges. This paper introduces an enhanced FL framework with three key innovations: adaptive model aggregation based on sensor reliability, dynamic node selection for resource optimization, and Weibull-based checkpointing for fault tolerance. The proposed framework ensures reliable condition monitoring while tackling the computational and reliability challenges of industrial CPS deployments. Experiments on the NASA Bearing and Hydraulic System datasets demonstrate superior performance compared to state-of-the-art FL methods, achieving 99.5% AUC-ROC in anomaly detection and maintaining accuracy even under node failures. Statistical validation using the Mann-Whitney U test confirms significant improvements, with a p-value less than 0.05, in both detection accuracy and computational efficiency across various operational scenarios.</description>

      <title>Data-Free Model-Related Attacks: Unleashing the Potential of Generative AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative AI technology has become increasingly integrated into our daily lives, offering powerful capabilities to enhance productivity. However, these same capabilities can be exploited by adversaries for malicious purposes. While existing research on adversarial applications of generative AI predominantly focuses on cyberattacks, less attention has been given to attacks targeting deep learning models. In this paper, we introduce the use of generative AI for facilitating model-related attacks, including model extraction, membership inference, and model inversion. Our study reveals that adversaries can launch a variety of model-related attacks against both image and text models in a data-free and black-box manner, achieving comparable performance to baseline methods that have access to the target models' training data and parameters in a white-box manner. This research serves as an important early warning to the community about the potential risks associated with generative AI-powered attacks on deep learning models.</description>

      <title>Improving Interpretability and Accuracy in Neuro-Symbolic Rule Extraction Using Class-Specific Sparse Filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There has been significant focus on creating neuro-symbolic models for interpretable image classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). These methods aim to replace the CNN with a neuro-symbolic model consisting of the CNN, which is used as a feature extractor, and an interpretable rule-set extracted from the CNN itself. While these approaches provide interpretability through the extracted rule-set, they often compromise accuracy compared to the original CNN model. In this paper, we identify the root cause of this accuracy loss as the post-training binarization of filter activations to extract the rule-set. To address this, we propose a novel sparsity loss function that enables class-specific filter binarization during CNN training, thus minimizing information loss when extracting the rule-set. We evaluate several training strategies with our novel sparsity loss, analyzing their effectiveness and providing guidance on their appropriate use. Notably, we set a new benchmark, achieving a 9% improvement in accuracy and a 53% reduction in rule-set size on average, compared to the previous SOTA, while coming within 3% of the original CNN's accuracy. This highlights the significant potential of interpretable neuro-symbolic models as viable alternatives to black-box CNNs.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Code Runtime Performance through Context-Aware Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optimizing software performance through automated code refinement offers a promising avenue for enhancing execution speed and efficiency. Despite recent advancements in LLMs, a significant gap remains in their ability to perform in-depth program analysis. This study introduces AUTOPATCH, an in-context learning approach designed to bridge this gap by enabling LLMs to automatically generate optimized code. Inspired by how programmers learn and apply knowledge to optimize software, AUTOPATCH incorporates three key components: (1) an analogy-driven framework to align LLM optimization with human cognitive processes, (2) a unified approach that integrates historical code examples and CFG analysis for context-aware learning, and (3) an automated pipeline for generating optimized code through in-context prompting. Experimental results demonstrate that AUTOPATCH achieves a 7.3% improvement in execution efficiency over GPT-4o across common generated executable code, highlighting its potential to advance automated program runtime optimization.</description>

      <title>Determining Mosaic Resilience in Sugarcane Plants using Hyperspectral Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sugarcane mosaic disease poses a serious threat to the Australian sugarcane industry, leading to yield losses of up to 30% in susceptible varieties. Existing manual inspection methods for detecting mosaic resilience are inefficient and impractical for large-scale application. This study introduces a novel approach using hyperspectral imaging and machine learning to detect mosaic resilience by leveraging global feature representation from local spectral patches. Hyperspectral data were collected from eight sugarcane varieties under controlled and field conditions. Local spectral patches were analyzed to capture spatial and spectral variations, which were then aggregated into global feature representations using a ResNet18 deep learning architecture. While classical methods like Support Vector Machines struggled to utilize spatial-spectral relationships effectively, the deep learning model achieved high classification accuracy, demonstrating its capacity to identify mosaic resilience from fine-grained hyperspectral data. This approach enhances early detection capabilities, enabling more efficient management of susceptible strains and contributing to sustainable sugarcane production.</description>

      <title>Separate Motion from Appearance: Customizing Motion via Customizing Text-to-Video Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motion customization aims to adapt the diffusion model (DM) to generate videos with the motion specified by a set of video clips with the same motion concept. To realize this goal, the adaptation of DM should be possible to model the specified motion concept, without compromising the ability to generate diverse appearances. Thus, the key to solving this problem lies in how to separate the motion concept from the appearance in the adaptation process of DM. Typical previous works explore different ways to represent and insert a motion concept into large-scale pretrained text-to-video diffusion models, e.g., learning a motion LoRA, using latent noise residuals, etc. While those methods can encode the motion concept, they also inevitably encode the appearance in the reference videos, resulting in weakened appearance generation capability. In this paper, we follow the typical way to learn a motion LoRA to encode the motion concept, but propose two novel strategies to enhance motion-appearance separation, including temporal attention purification (TAP) and appearance highway (AH). Specifically, we assume that in the temporal attention module, the pretrained Value embeddings are sufficient to serve as basic components needed by producing a new motion. Thus, in TAP, we choose only to reshape the temporal attention with motion LoRAs so that Value embeddings can be reorganized to produce a new motion. Further, in AH, we alter the starting point of each skip connection in U-Net from the output of each temporal attention module to the output of each spatial attention module. Extensive experiments demonstrate that compared to previous works, our method can generate videos with appearance more aligned with the text descriptions and motion more consistent with the reference videos.</description>

      <title>One Head Eight Arms: Block Matrix based Low Rank Adaptation for CLIP-based Few-Shot Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in fine-tuning Vision-Language Foundation Models (VLMs) have garnered significant attention for their effectiveness in downstream few-shot learning tasks.While these recent approaches exhibits some performance improvements, they often suffer from excessive training parameters and high computational costs. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Block matrix-based low-rank adaptation framework, called Block-LoRA, for fine-tuning VLMs on downstream few-shot tasks. Inspired by recent work on Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), Block-LoRA partitions the original low-rank decomposition matrix of LoRA into a series of sub-matrices while sharing all down-projection sub-matrices. This structure not only reduces the number of training parameters, but also transforms certain complex matrix multiplication operations into simpler matrix addition, significantly lowering the computational cost of fine-tuning. Notably, Block-LoRA enables fine-tuning CLIP on the ImageNet few-shot benchmark using a single 24GB GPU. We also show that Block-LoRA has the more tighter bound of generalization error than vanilla LoRA. Without bells and whistles, extensive experiments demonstrate that Block-LoRA achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art CLIP-based few-shot methods, while maintaining a low training parameters count and reduced computational overhead.</description>

      <title>Hypergraph Diffusion for High-Order Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recommender systems rely on Collaborative Filtering (CF) to predict user preferences by leveraging patterns in historical user-item interactions. While traditional CF methods primarily focus on learning compact vector embeddings for users and items, graph neural network (GNN)-based approaches have emerged as a powerful alternative, utilizing the structure of user-item interaction graphs to enhance recommendation accuracy. However, existing GNN-based models, such as LightGCN and UltraGCN, often struggle with two major limitations: an inability to fully account for heterophilic interactions, where users engage with diverse item categories, and the over-smoothing problem in multi-layer GNNs, which hinders their ability to model complex, high-order relationships. To address these gaps, we introduce WaveHDNN, an innovative wavelet-enhanced hypergraph diffusion framework. WaveHDNN integrates a Heterophily-aware Collaborative Encoder, designed to capture user-item interactions across diverse categories, with a Multi-scale Group-wise Structure Encoder, which leverages wavelet transforms to effectively model localized graph structures. Additionally, cross-view contrastive learning is employed to maintain robust and consistent representations. Experiments on benchmark datasets validate the efficacy of WaveHDNN, demonstrating its superior ability to capture both heterophilic and localized structural information, leading to improved recommendation performance.</description>

      <title>Bridging Neural Networks and Wireless Systems with MIMO-OFDM Semantic Communications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semantic communications aim to enhance transmission efficiency by jointly optimizing source coding, channel coding, and modulation. While prior research has demonstrated promising performance in simulations, real-world implementations often face significant challenges, including noise variability and nonlinear distortions, leading to performance gaps. This article investigates these challenges in a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) and orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)-based semantic communication system, focusing on the practical impacts of power amplifier (PA) nonlinearity and peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) variations. Our analysis identifies frequency selectivity of the actual channel as a critical factor in performance degradation and demonstrates that targeted mitigation strategies can enable semantic systems to approach theoretical performance. By addressing key limitations in existing designs, we provide actionable insights for advancing semantic communications in practical wireless environments. This work establishes a foundation for bridging the gap between theoretical models and real-world deployment, highlighting essential considerations for system design and optimization.</description>

Abstract: We study the benefits of different sparse architectures for deep reinforcement learning. In particular, we focus on image-based domains where spatially-biased and fully-connected architectures are common. Using these and several other architectures of equal capacity, we show that sparse structure has a significant effect on learning performance. We also observe that choosing the best sparse architecture for a given domain depends on whether the hidden layer weights are fixed or learned.</description>

      <title>Distilling Large Language Models for Network Active Queue Management</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growing complexity of network traffic and demand for ultra-low latency communication require smarter packet traffic management. Existing Deep Learning-based queuing approaches struggle with dynamic network scenarios and demand high engineering effort. We propose AQM-LLM, distilling Large Language Models (LLMs) with few-shot learning, contextual understanding, and pattern recognition to improve Active Queue Management (AQM) [RFC 9330] with minimal manual effort. We consider a specific case where AQM is Low Latency, Low Loss, and Scalable Throughput (L4S) and our design of AQM-LLM builds on speculative decoding and reinforcement-based distilling of LLM by tackling congestion prevention in the L4S architecture using Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) [RFC 9331] and periodic packet dropping. We develop a new open-source experimental platform by executing L4S-AQM on FreeBSD-14, providing interoperable modules to support LLM integration and facilitate IETF recognition through wider testing. Our extensive evaluations show L4S-LLM enhances queue management, prevents congestion, reduces latency, and boosts network performance, showcasing LLMs' adaptability and efficiency in uplifting AQM systems.</description>

      <title>Efficient Knowledge Distillation of SAM for Medical Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Segment Anything Model (SAM) has set a new standard in interactive image segmentation, offering robust performance across various tasks. However, its significant computational requirements limit its deployment in real-time or resource-constrained environments. To address these challenges, we propose a novel knowledge distillation approach, KD SAM, which incorporates both encoder and decoder optimization through a combination of Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Perceptual Loss. This dual-loss framework captures structural and semantic features, enabling the student model to maintain high segmentation accuracy while reducing computational complexity. Based on the model evaluation on datasets, including Kvasir-SEG, ISIC 2017, Fetal Head Ultrasound, and Breast Ultrasound, we demonstrate that KD SAM achieves comparable or superior performance to the baseline models, with significantly fewer parameters. KD SAM effectively balances segmentation accuracy and computational efficiency, making it well-suited for real-time medical image segmentation applications in resource-constrained environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a scalable Anomaly Detection Service with a generalizable API tailored for industrial time-series data, designed to assist Site Reliability Engineers (SREs) in managing cloud infrastructure. The service enables efficient anomaly detection in complex data streams, supporting proactive identification and resolution of issues. Furthermore, it presents an innovative approach to anomaly modeling in cloud infrastructure by utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) to understand key components, their failure modes, and behaviors. A suite of algorithms for detecting anomalies is offered in univariate and multivariate time series data, including regression-based, mixture-model-based, and semi-supervised approaches. We provide insights into the usage patterns of the service, with over 500 users and 200,000 API calls in a year. The service has been successfully applied in various industrial settings, including IoT-based AI applications. We have also evaluated our system on public anomaly benchmarks to show its effectiveness. By leveraging it, SREs can proactively identify potential issues before they escalate, reducing downtime and improving response times to incidents, ultimately enhancing the overall customer experience. We plan to extend the system to include time series foundation models, enabling zero-shot anomaly detection capabilities.</description>

      <title>DebugAgent: Efficient and Interpretable Error Slice Discovery for Comprehensive Model Debugging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the significant success of deep learning models in computer vision, they often exhibit systematic failures on specific data subsets, known as error slices. Identifying and mitigating these error slices is crucial to enhancing model robustness and reliability in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we introduce DebugAgent, an automated framework for error slice discovery and model repair. DebugAgent first generates task-specific visual attributes to highlight instances prone to errors through an interpretable and structured process. It then employs an efficient slice enumeration algorithm to systematically identify error slices, overcoming the combinatorial challenges that arise during slice exploration. Additionally, DebugAgent extends its capabilities by predicting error slices beyond the validation set, addressing a key limitation of prior approaches. Extensive experiments across multiple domains, including image classification, pose estimation, and object detection - show that DebugAgent not only improves the coherence and precision of identified error slices but also significantly enhances the model repair capabilities.</description>

      <title>Overcoming Semantic Dilution in Transformer-Based Next Frame Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Next-frame prediction in videos is crucial for applications such as autonomous driving, object tracking, and motion prediction. The primary challenge in next-frame prediction lies in effectively capturing and processing both spatial and temporal information from previous video sequences. The transformer architecture, known for its prowess in handling sequence data, has made remarkable progress in this domain. However, transformer-based next-frame prediction models face notable issues: (a) The multi-head self-attention (MHSA) mechanism requires the input embedding to be split into $N$ chunks, where $N$ is the number of heads. Each segment captures only a fraction of the original embeddings information, which distorts the representation of the embedding in the latent space, resulting in a semantic dilution problem; (b) These models predict the embeddings of the next frames rather than the frames themselves, but the loss function based on the errors of the reconstructed frames, not the predicted embeddings -- this creates a discrepancy between the training objective and the model output. We propose a Semantic Concentration Multi-Head Self-Attention (SCMHSA) architecture, which effectively mitigates semantic dilution in transformer-based next-frame prediction. Additionally, we introduce a loss function that optimizes SCMHSA in the latent space, aligning the training objective more closely with the model output. Our method demonstrates superior performance compared to the original transformer-based predictors.</description>

      <title>FlexMotion: Lightweight, Physics-Aware, and Controllable Human Motion Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lightweight, controllable, and physically plausible human motion synthesis is crucial for animation, virtual reality, robotics, and human-computer interaction applications. Existing methods often compromise between computational efficiency, physical realism, or spatial controllability. We propose FlexMotion, a novel framework that leverages a computationally lightweight diffusion model operating in the latent space, eliminating the need for physics simulators and enabling fast and efficient training. FlexMotion employs a multimodal pre-trained Transformer encoder-decoder, integrating joint locations, contact forces, joint actuations and muscle activations to ensure the physical plausibility of the generated motions. FlexMotion also introduces a plug-and-play module, which adds spatial controllability over a range of motion parameters (e.g., joint locations, joint actuations, contact forces, and muscle activations). Our framework achieves realistic motion generation with improved efficiency and control, setting a new benchmark for human motion synthesis. We evaluate FlexMotion on extended datasets and demonstrate its superior performance in terms of realism, physical plausibility, and controllability.</description>

      <title>A Stochastic Dynamical Theory of LLM Self-Adversariality: Modeling Severity Drift as a Critical Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a continuous-time stochastic dynamical framework for understanding how large language models (LLMs) may self-amplify latent biases or toxicity through their own chain-of-thought reasoning. The model posits an instantaneous "severity" variable $x(t) \in [0,1]$ evolving under a stochastic differential equation (SDE) with a drift term $\mu(x)$ and diffusion $\sigma(x)$. Crucially, such a process can be consistently analyzed via the Fokker--Planck approach if each incremental step behaves nearly Markovian in severity space. The analysis investigates critical phenomena, showing that certain parameter regimes create phase transitions from subcritical (self-correcting) to supercritical (runaway severity). The paper derives stationary distributions, first-passage times to harmful thresholds, and scaling laws near critical points. Finally, it highlights implications for agents and extended LLM reasoning models: in principle, these equations might serve as a basis for formal verification of whether a model remains stable or propagates bias over repeated inferences.</description>

      <title>DIRIGENt: End-To-End Robotic Imitation of Human Demonstrations Based on a Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There has been substantial progress in humanoid robots, with new skills continuously being taught, ranging from navigation to manipulation. While these abilities may seem impressive, the teaching methods often remain inefficient. To enhance the process of teaching robots, we propose leveraging a mechanism effectively used by humans: teaching by demonstrating. In this paper, we introduce DIRIGENt (DIrect Robotic Imitation GENeration model), a novel end-to-end diffusion approach that directly generates joint values from observing human demonstrations, enabling a robot to imitate these actions without any existing mapping between it and humans. We create a dataset in which humans imitate a robot and then use this collected data to train a diffusion model that enables a robot to imitate humans. The following three aspects are the core of our contribution. First is our novel dataset with natural pairs between human and robot poses, allowing our approach to imitate humans accurately despite the gap between their anatomies. Second, the diffusion input to our model alleviates the challenge of redundant joint configurations, limiting the search space. And finally, our end-to-end architecture from perception to action leads to an improved learning capability. Through our experimental analysis, we show that combining these three aspects allows DIRIGENt to outperform existing state-of-the-art approaches in the field of generating joint values from RGB images.</description>

      <title>Misspellings in Natural Language Processing: A survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This survey provides an overview of the challenges of misspellings in natural language processing (NLP). While often unintentional, misspellings have become ubiquitous in digital communication, especially with the proliferation of Web 2.0, user-generated content, and informal text mediums such as social media, blogs, and forums. Even if humans can generally interpret misspelled text, NLP models frequently struggle to handle it: this causes a decline in performance in common tasks like text classification and machine translation. In this paper, we reconstruct a history of misspellings as a scientific problem. We then discuss the latest advancements to address the challenge of misspellings in NLP. Main strategies to mitigate the effect of misspellings include data augmentation, double step, character-order agnostic, and tuple-based methods, among others. This survey also examines dedicated data challenges and competitions to spur progress in the field. Critical safety and ethical concerns are also examined, for example, the voluntary use of misspellings to inject malicious messages and hate speech on social networks. Furthermore, the survey explores psycholinguistic perspectives on how humans process misspellings, potentially informing innovative computational techniques for text normalization and representation. Finally, the misspelling-related challenges and opportunities associated with modern large language models are also analyzed, including benchmarks, datasets, and performances of the most prominent language models against misspellings. This survey aims to be an exhaustive resource for researchers seeking to mitigate the impact of misspellings in the rapidly evolving landscape of NLP.</description>

      <title>Irony Detection, Reasoning and Understanding in Zero-shot Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16884v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Irony is a powerful figurative language (FL) on social media that can potentially mislead various NLP tasks, such as recommendation systems, misinformation checks, and sentiment analysis. Understanding the implicit meaning of this kind of subtle language is essential to mitigate irony's negative impact on NLP tasks. However, building models to understand irony presents a unique set of challenges, because irony is a complex form of language that often relies on context, tone, and subtle cues to convey meaning that is opposite or different from the literal interpretation. Large language models, such as ChatGPT, are increasingly able to capture implicit and contextual information. In this study, we investigate the generalization, reasoning and understanding ability of ChatGPT on irony detection across six different genre irony detection datasets. Our findings suggest that ChatGPT appears to show an enhanced language understanding and reasoning ability. But it needs to be very careful in prompt engineering design. Thus, we propose a prompt engineering design framework IDADP to achieve higher irony detection accuracy, improved understanding of irony, and more effective explanations compared to other state-of-the-art ChatGPT zero-shot approaches. And ascertain via experiments that the practice generated under the framework is likely to be the promised solution to resolve the generalization issues of LLMs.</description>

      <title>Extending Information Bottleneck Attribution to Video Sequences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce VIBA, a novel approach for explainable video classification by adapting Information Bottlenecks for Attribution (IBA) to video sequences. While most traditional explainability methods are designed for image models, our IBA framework addresses the need for explainability in temporal models used for video analysis. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we apply VIBA to video deepfake detection, testing it on two architectures: the Xception model for spatial features and a VGG11-based model for capturing motion dynamics through optical flow. Using a custom dataset that reflects recent deepfake generation techniques, we adapt IBA to create relevance and optical flow maps, visually highlighting manipulated regions and motion inconsistencies. Our results show that VIBA generates temporally and spatially consistent explanations, which align closely with human annotations, thus providing interpretability for video classification and particularly for deepfake detection.</description>

      <title>RDMM: Fine-Tuned LLM Models for On-Device Robotic Decision Making with Enhanced Contextual Awareness in Specific Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) represent a significant advancement in integrating physical robots with AI-driven systems. We showcase the capabilities of our framework within the context of the real-world household competition. This research introduces a framework that utilizes RDMM (Robotics Decision-Making Models), which possess the capacity for decision-making within domain-specific contexts, as well as an awareness of their personal knowledge and capabilities. The framework leverages information to enhance the autonomous decision-making of the system. In contrast to other approaches, our focus is on real-time, on-device solutions, successfully operating on hardware with as little as 8GB of memory. Our framework incorporates visual perception models equipping robots with understanding of their environment. Additionally, the framework has integrated real-time speech recognition capabilities, thus enhancing the human-robot interaction experience. Experimental results demonstrate that the RDMM framework can plan with an 93\% accuracy. Furthermore, we introduce a new dataset consisting of 27k planning instances, as well as 1.3k text-image annotated samples derived from the competition. The framework, benchmarks, datasets, and models developed in this work are publicly available on our GitHub repository at https://github.com/shadynasrat/RDMM.</description>

      <title>TAID: Temporally Adaptive Interpolated Distillation for Efficient Knowledge Transfer in Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Causal language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, but their size poses significant challenges for deployment in resource-constrained environments. Knowledge distillation, a widely-used technique for transferring knowledge from a large teacher model to a small student model, presents a promising approach for model compression. A significant remaining issue lies in the major differences between teacher and student models, namely the substantial capacity gap, mode averaging, and mode collapse, which pose barriers during distillation. To address these issues, we introduce $\textit{Temporally Adaptive Interpolated Distillation (TAID)}$, a novel knowledge distillation approach that dynamically interpolates student and teacher distributions through an adaptive intermediate distribution, gradually shifting from the student's initial distribution towards the teacher's distribution. We provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating TAID's ability to prevent mode collapse and empirically show its effectiveness in addressing the capacity gap while balancing mode averaging and mode collapse. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate TAID's superior performance across various model sizes and architectures in both instruction tuning and pre-training scenarios. Furthermore, we showcase TAID's practical impact by developing two state-of-the-art compact foundation models: $\texttt{TAID-LLM-1.5B}$ for language tasks and $\texttt{TAID-VLM-2B}$ for vision-language tasks. These results demonstrate TAID's effectiveness in creating high-performing and efficient models, advancing the development of more accessible AI technologies.</description>

      <title>Exact Computation of Any-Order Shapley Interactions for Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Albeit the ubiquitous use of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in machine learning (ML) prediction tasks involving graph-structured data, their interpretability remains challenging. In explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), the Shapley Value (SV) is the predominant method to quantify contributions of individual features to a ML model's output. Addressing the limitations of SVs in complex prediction models, Shapley Interactions (SIs) extend the SV to groups of features. In this work, we explain single graph predictions of GNNs with SIs that quantify node contributions and interactions among multiple nodes. By exploiting the GNN architecture, we show that the structure of interactions in node embeddings are preserved for graph prediction. As a result, the exponential complexity of SIs depends only on the receptive fields, i.e. the message-passing ranges determined by the connectivity of the graph and the number of convolutional layers. Based on our theoretical results, we introduce GraphSHAP-IQ, an efficient approach to compute any-order SIs exactly. GraphSHAP-IQ is applicable to popular message passing techniques in conjunction with a linear global pooling and output layer. We showcase that GraphSHAP-IQ substantially reduces the exponential complexity of computing exact SIs on multiple benchmark datasets. Beyond exact computation, we evaluate GraphSHAP-IQ's approximation of SIs on popular GNN architectures and compare with existing baselines. Lastly, we visualize SIs of real-world water distribution networks and molecule structures using a SI-Graph.</description>

      <title>ToolFactory: Automating Tool Generation by Leveraging LLM to Understand REST API Documentations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: LLM-based tool agents offer natural language interfaces, enabling users to seamlessly interact with computing services. While REST APIs are valuable resources for building such agents, they must first be transformed into AI-compatible tools. Automatically generating AI-compatible tools from REST API documents can greatly streamline tool agent development and minimize user learning curves. However, API documentation often suffers from a lack of standardization, inconsistent schemas, and incomplete information. To address these issues, we developed \textbf{ToolFactory}, an open-source pipeline for automating tool generation from unstructured API documents. To enhance the reliability of the developed tools, we implemented an evaluation method to diagnose errors. Furthermore, we built a knowledge base of verified tools, which we leveraged to infer missing information from poorly documented APIs. We developed the API Extraction Benchmark, comprising 167 API documents and 744 endpoints in various formats, and designed a JSON schema to annotate them. This annotated dataset was utilized to train and validate ToolFactory. The experimental results highlight the effectiveness of ToolFactory. We also demonstrated ToolFactory by creating a domain-specific AI agent for glycomaterials research. ToolFactory exhibits significant potential for facilitating the seamless integration of scientific REST APIs into AI workflows.</description>

      <title>Multiple Abstraction Level Retrieve Augment Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model powered by a large language model (LLM) provides a faster and more cost-effective solution for adapting to new data and knowledge. It also delivers more specialized responses compared to pre-trained LLMs. However, most existing approaches rely on retrieving prefix-sized chunks as references to support question-answering (Q/A). This approach is often deployed to address information needs at a single level of abstraction, as it struggles to generate answers across multiple levels of abstraction. In an RAG setting, while LLMs can summarize and answer questions effectively when provided with sufficient details, retrieving excessive information often leads to the 'lost in the middle' problem and exceeds token limitations. We propose a novel RAG approach that uses chunks of multiple abstraction levels (MAL), including multi-sentence-level, paragraph-level, section-level, and document-level. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated in an under-explored scientific domain of Glycoscience. Compared to traditional single-level RAG approaches, our approach improves AI evaluated answer correctness of Q/A by 25.739\% on Glyco-related papers.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneity-aware Personalized Federated Learning via Adaptive Dual-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) empowers multiple clients to collaboratively train machine learning models without sharing local data, making it highly applicable in heterogeneous Internet of Things (IoT) environments. However, intrinsic heterogeneity in clients' model architectures and computing capabilities often results in model accuracy loss and the intractable straggler problem, which significantly impairs training effectiveness. To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes a novel Heterogeneity-aware Personalized Federated Learning method, named HAPFL, via multi-level Reinforcement Learning (RL) mechanisms. HAPFL optimizes the training process by incorporating three strategic components: 1) An RL-based heterogeneous model allocation mechanism. The parameter server employs a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)-based RL agent to adaptively allocate appropriately sized, differentiated models to clients based on their performance, effectively mitigating performance disparities. 2) An RL-based training intensity adjustment scheme. The parameter server leverages another PPO-based RL agent to dynamically fine-tune the training intensity for each client to further enhance training efficiency and reduce straggling latency. 3) A knowledge distillation-based mutual learning mechanism. Each client deploys both a heterogeneous local model and a homogeneous lightweight model named LiteModel, where these models undergo mutual learning through knowledge distillation. This uniform LiteModel plays a pivotal role in aggregating and sharing global knowledge, significantly enhancing the effectiveness of personalized local training. Experimental results across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that HAPFL not only achieves high accuracy but also substantially reduces the overall training time by 20.9%-40.4% and decreases straggling latency by 19.0%-48.0% compared to existing solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing is entering a transformative phase with the emergence of logical quantum processors, which hold the potential to tackle complex problems beyond classical capabilities. While significant progress has been made, applying quantum algorithms to real-world problems remains challenging. Hybrid quantum-classical techniques have been explored to bridge this gap, but they often face limitations in expressiveness, trainability, or scalability. In this work, we introduce conditional Generative Quantum Eigensolver (conditional-GQE), a context-aware quantum circuit generator powered by an encoder-decoder Transformer. Focusing on combinatorial optimization, we train our generator for solving problems with up to 10 qubits, exhibiting nearly perfect performance on new problems. By leveraging the high expressiveness and flexibility of classical generative models, along with an efficient preference-based training scheme, conditional-GQE provides a generalizable and scalable framework for quantum circuit generation. Our approach advances hybrid quantum-classical computing and contributes to accelerate the transition toward fault-tolerant quantum computing.</description>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in reasoning, alignment, and task-specific performance. However, ensuring harmlessness in these systems remains a critical challenge, particularly in advanced models like DeepSeek-R1. This paper examines the limitations of Reinforcement Learning (RL) as the primary approach for reducing harmful outputs in DeepSeek-R1 and compares it with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). While RL improves reasoning capabilities, it faces challenges such as reward hacking, generalization failures, language mixing, and high computational costs. We propose hybrid training approaches combining RL and SFT to achieve robust harmlessness reduction. Usage recommendations and future directions for deploying DeepSeek-R1 responsibly are also presented.</description>

Abstract: The rapid deployment of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in critical digital infrastructure introduces significant risks, necessitating a robust framework for systematically collecting AI incident data to prevent future incidents. Existing databases lack the granularity as well as the standardized structure required for consistent data collection and analysis, impeding effective incident management. This work proposes a standardized schema and taxonomy for AI incident databases, addressing these challenges by enabling detailed and structured documentation of AI incidents across sectors. Key contributions include developing a unified schema, introducing new fields such as incident severity, causes, and harms caused, and proposing a taxonomy for classifying AI incidents in critical digital infrastructure. The proposed solution facilitates more effective incident data collection and analysis, thus supporting evidence-based policymaking, enhancing industry safety measures, and promoting transparency. This work lays the foundation for a coordinated global response to AI incidents, ensuring trust, safety, and accountability in using AI across regions.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks for Signal Classification in Simulated Gamma-Ray Burst Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study evaluates the use of Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks (QCNNs) for identifying signals resembling Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) within simulated astrophysical datasets in the form of light curves. The task addressed here focuses on distinguishing GRB-like signals from background noise in simulated Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) data, the next-generation astrophysical observatory for very high-energy gamma-ray science. QCNNs, a quantum counterpart of classical Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), leverage quantum principles to process and analyze high-dimensional data efficiently. We implemented a hybrid quantum-classical machine learning technique using the Qiskit framework, with the QCNNs trained on a quantum simulator. Several QCNN architectures were tested, employing different encoding methods such as Data Reuploading and Amplitude encoding. Key findings include that QCNNs achieved accuracy comparable to classical CNNs, often surpassing 90\%, while using fewer parameters, potentially leading to more efficient models in terms of computational resources. A benchmark study further examined how hyperparameters like the number of qubits and encoding methods affected performance, with more qubits and advanced encoding methods generally enhancing accuracy but increasing complexity. QCNNs showed robust performance on time-series datasets, successfully detecting GRB signals with high precision. The research is a pioneering effort in applying QCNNs to astrophysics, offering insights into their potential and limitations. This work sets the stage for future investigations to fully realize the advantages of QCNNs in astrophysical data analysis.</description>

      <title>Synthesizing 3D Abstractions by Inverting Procedural Buildings with Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We generate abstractions of buildings, reflecting the essential aspects of their geometry and structure, by learning to invert procedural models. We first build a dataset of abstract procedural building models paired with simulated point clouds and then learn the inverse mapping through a transformer. Given a point cloud, the trained transformer then infers the corresponding abstracted building in terms of a programmatic language description. This approach leverages expressive procedural models developed for gaming and animation, and thereby retains desirable properties such as efficient rendering of the inferred abstractions and strong priors for regularity and symmetry. Our approach achieves good reconstruction accuracy in terms of geometry and structure, as well as structurally consistent inpainting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces EdgeMLOps, a framework leveraging Cumulocity IoT and thin-edge.io for deploying and managing machine learning models on resource-constrained edge devices. We address the challenges of model optimization, deployment, and lifecycle management in edge environments. The framework's efficacy is demonstrated through a visual quality inspection (VQI) use case where images of assets are processed on edge devices, enabling real-time condition updates within an asset management system. Furthermore, we evaluate the performance benefits of different quantization methods, specifically static and dynamic signed-int8, on a Raspberry Pi 4, demonstrating significant inference time reductions compared to FP32 precision. Our results highlight the potential of EdgeMLOps to enable efficient and scalable AI deployments at the edge for industrial applications.</description>

      <title>Induced Modularity and Community Detection for Functionally Interpretable Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interpretability in reinforcement learning is crucial for ensuring AI systems align with human values and fulfill the diverse related requirements including safety, robustness and fairness. Building on recent approaches to encouraging sparsity and locality in neural networks, we demonstrate how the penalisation of non-local weights leads to the emergence of functionally independent modules in the policy network of a reinforcement learning agent. To illustrate this, we demonstrate the emergence of two parallel modules for assessment of movement along the X and Y axes in a stochastic Minigrid environment. Through the novel application of community detection algorithms, we show how these modules can be automatically identified and their functional roles verified through direct intervention on the network weights prior to inference. This establishes a scalable framework for reinforcement learning interpretability through functional modularity, addressing challenges regarding the trade-off between completeness and cognitive tractability of reinforcement learning explanations.</description>

      <title>Learning Mean Field Control on Sparse Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large agent networks are abundant in applications and nature and pose difficult challenges in the field of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) due to their computational and theoretical complexity. While graphon mean field games and their extensions provide efficient learning algorithms for dense and moderately sparse agent networks, the case of realistic sparser graphs remains largely unsolved. Thus, we propose a novel mean field control model inspired by local weak convergence to include sparse graphs such as power law networks with coefficients above two. Besides a theoretical analysis, we design scalable learning algorithms which apply to the challenging class of graph sequences with finite first moment. We compare our model and algorithms for various examples on synthetic and real world networks with mean field algorithms based on Lp graphons and graphexes. As it turns out, our approach outperforms existing methods in many examples and on various networks due to the special design aiming at an important, but so far hard to solve class of MARL problems.</description>

      <title>Graph Transformers for inverse physics: reconstructing flows around arbitrary 2D airfoils</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a Graph Transformer framework that serves as a general inverse physics engine on meshes, demonstrated through the challenging task of reconstructing aerodynamic flow fields from sparse surface measurements. While deep learning has shown promising results in forward physics simulation, inverse problems remain particularly challenging due to their ill-posed nature and the difficulty of propagating information from limited boundary observations. Our approach addresses these challenges by combining the geometric expressiveness of message-passing neural networks with the global reasoning of Transformers, enabling efficient learning of inverse mappings from boundary conditions to complete states. We evaluate this framework on a comprehensive dataset of steady-state RANS simulations around diverse airfoil geometries, where the task is to reconstruct full pressure and velocity fields from surface pressure measurements alone. The architecture achieves high reconstruction accuracy while maintaining fast inference times. We conduct experiments and provide insights into the relative importance of local geometric processing and global attention mechanisms in mesh-based inverse problems. We also find that the framework is robust to reduced sensor coverage. These results suggest that Graph Transformers can serve as effective inverse physics engines across a broader range of applications where complete system states must be reconstructed from limited boundary observations.</description>

      <title>Mamba-Shedder: Post-Transformer Compression for Efficient Selective Structured State Space Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large pre-trained models have achieved outstanding results in sequence modeling. The Transformer block and its attention mechanism have been the main drivers of the success of these models. Recently, alternative architectures, such as Selective Structured State Space Models (SSMs), have been proposed to address the inefficiencies of Transformers. This paper explores the compression of SSM-based models, particularly Mamba and its hybrids. We study the sensitivity of these models to the removal of selected components at different granularities to reduce the model size and computational overhead, thus improving their efficiency while maintaining accuracy. The proposed solutions, collectively referred to as Mamba-Shedder, achieve a speedup of up to 1.4x during inference, demonstrating that model efficiency can be improved by eliminating several redundancies with minimal impact on the overall model performance.

      <title>Why is the estimation of metaorder impact with public market data so challenging?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estimating market impact and transaction costs of large trades (metaorders) is a very important topic in finance. However, using models of price and trade based on public market data provide average price trajectories which are qualitatively different from what is observed during real metaorder executions: the price increases linearly, rather than in a concave way, during the execution and the amount of reversion after its end is very limited. We claim that this is a generic phenomenon due to the fact that even sophisticated statistical models are unable to correctly describe the origin of the autocorrelation of the order flow. We propose a modified Transient Impact Model which provides more realistic trajectories by assuming that only a fraction of the metaorder trading triggers market order flow. Interestingly, in our model there is a critical condition on the kernels of the price and order flow equations in which market impact becomes permanent.</description>

      <title>COS(M+O)S: Curiosity and RL-Enhanced MCTS for Exploring Story Space via Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present COS(M+O)S, a System 2-inspired framework for open-ended plot development that systematically explores the vast space of possible story expansions, enabling a 3B-parameter language model to approach the plot quality of a 70B model on select short-story tasks. The method accomplishes this by combining Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), guided by a step-level value model that rewards moderate surprisal (curiosity) while penalizing incoherence, and Odds Ratio Preference Optimization (ORPO) to fine-tune the policy on high-value plot expansions. This iterative reinforcement learning loop systematically explores multiple candidate plot branches, backpropagates quality signals, and adapts the policy for faster convergence, notably shifting the policy from puzzle-based Chain-of-Thought to more character-driven storytelling. In small-scale tests with short-story prompts, 67%-77% of participants favored COS(M+O)S's highest-rated expansions over lower-rated ones, suggesting that our learned value function aligns. GPT-4o ratings further show that COS(M+O)S surpasses naive single-pass decoding from Llama 3.2 3B by 0.59 SD, coming within 0.06 SD of Llama 3.1 70B (no significant difference, p=0.93). Pairwise comparisons with o1 place COS(M+O)S 1.5 SD above the 3B baseline and find no statistically significant gap from 70B. Nevertheless, absolute story quality remains modest, constrained by the small model's capacity and limited training data.</description>

      <title>Histoires Morales: A French Dataset for Assessing Moral Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aligning language models with human values is crucial, especially as they become more integrated into everyday life. While models are often adapted to user preferences, it is equally important to ensure they align with moral norms and behaviours in real-world social situations. Despite significant progress in languages like English and Chinese, French has seen little attention in this area, leaving a gap in understanding how LLMs handle moral reasoning in this language. To address this gap, we introduce Histoires Morales, a French dataset derived from Moral Stories, created through translation and subsequently refined with the assistance of native speakers to guarantee grammatical accuracy and adaptation to the French cultural context. We also rely on annotations of the moral values within the dataset to ensure their alignment with French norms. Histoires Morales covers a wide range of social situations, including differences in tipping practices, expressions of honesty in relationships, and responsibilities toward animals. To foster future research, we also conduct preliminary experiments on the alignment of multilingual models on French and English data and the robustness of the alignment. We find that while LLMs are generally aligned with human moral norms by default, they can be easily influenced with user-preference optimization for both moral and immoral data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Prior research on training grounded factuality classification models to detect hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) has relied on public natural language inference (NLI) data and synthetic data. However, conventional NLI datasets are not well-suited for document-level reasoning, which is critical for detecting LLM hallucinations. Recent approaches to document-level synthetic data generation involve iteratively removing sentences from documents and annotating factuality using LLM-based prompts. While effective, this method is computationally expensive for long documents and limited by the LLM's capabilities. In this work, we analyze the differences between existing synthetic training data used in state-of-the-art models and real LLM output claims. Based on our findings, we propose a novel approach for synthetic data generation, CG2C, that leverages multi-hop reasoning on context graphs extracted from documents. Our fact checker model, FactCG, demonstrates improved performance with more connected reasoning, using the same backbone models. Experiments show it even outperforms GPT-4-o on the LLM-Aggrefact benchmark with much smaller model size.</description>

      <title>AxBench: Steering LLMs? Even Simple Baselines Outperform Sparse Autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fine-grained steering of language model outputs is essential for safety and reliability. Prompting and finetuning are widely used to achieve these goals, but interpretability researchers have proposed a variety of representation-based techniques as well, including sparse autoencoders (SAEs), linear artificial tomography, supervised steering vectors, linear probes, and representation finetuning. At present, there is no benchmark for making direct comparisons between these proposals. Therefore, we introduce AxBench, a large-scale benchmark for steering and concept detection, and report experiments on Gemma-2-2B and 9B. For steering, we find that prompting outperforms all existing methods, followed by finetuning. For concept detection, representation-based methods such as difference-in-means, perform the best. On both evaluations, SAEs are not competitive. We introduce a novel weakly-supervised representational method (Rank-1 Representation Finetuning; ReFT-r1), which is competitive on both tasks while providing the interpretability advantages that prompting lacks. Along with AxBench, we train and publicly release SAE-scale feature dictionaries for ReFT-r1 and DiffMean.</description>

      <title>Three-Dimensional Diffusion-Weighted Multi-Slab MRI With Slice Profile Compensation Using Deep Energy Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) multi-slab acquisition is a technique frequently employed in high-resolution diffusion-weighted MRI in order to achieve the best signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) efficiency. However, this technique is limited by slab boundary artifacts that cause intensity fluctuations and aliasing between slabs which reduces the accuracy of anatomical imaging. Addressing this issue is crucial for advancing diffusion MRI quality and making high-resolution imaging more feasible for clinical and research applications. In this work, we propose a regularized slab profile encoding (PEN) method within a Plug-and-Play ADMM framework, incorporating multi-scale energy (MuSE) regularization to effectively improve the slab combined reconstruction. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves image quality compared to non-regularized and TV-regularized PEN approaches. The regularized PEN framework provides a more robust and efficient solution for high-resolution 3D diffusion MRI, potentially enabling clearer, more reliable anatomical imaging across various applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Early detection of COVID-19 is crucial for effective treatment and controlling its spread. This study proposes a novel hybrid deep learning model for detecting COVID-19 from CT scan images, designed to assist overburdened medical professionals. Our proposed model leverages the strengths of VGG16, DenseNet121, and MobileNetV2 to extract features, followed by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction, after which the features are stacked and classified using a Support Vector Classifier (SVC). We conducted comparative analysis between the proposed hybrid model and individual pre-trained CNN models, using a dataset of 2,108 training images and 373 test images comprising both COVID-positive and non-COVID images. Our proposed hybrid model achieved an accuracy of 98.93%, outperforming the individual models in terms of precision, recall, F1 scores, and ROC curve performance.</description>

      <title>Decictor: Towards Evaluating the Robustness of Decision-Making in Autonomous Driving Systems</title>

Abstract: Autonomous Driving System (ADS) testing is crucial in ADS development, with the current primary focus being on safety. However, the evaluation of non-safety-critical performance, particularly the ADS's ability to make optimal decisions and produce optimal paths for autonomous vehicles (AVs), is also vital to ensure the intelligence and reduce risks of AVs. Currently, there is little work dedicated to assessing the robustness of ADSs' path-planning decisions (PPDs), i.e., whether an ADS can maintain the optimal PPD after an insignificant change in the environment. The key challenges include the lack of clear oracles for assessing PPD optimality and the difficulty in searching for scenarios that lead to non-optimal PPDs. To fill this gap, in this paper, we focus on evaluating the robustness of ADSs' PPDs and propose the first method, Decictor, for generating non-optimal decision scenarios (NoDSs), where the ADS does not plan optimal paths for AVs. Decictor comprises three main components: Non-invasive Mutation, Consistency Check, and Feedback. To overcome the oracle challenge, Non-invasive Mutation is devised to implement conservative modifications, ensuring the preservation of the original optimal path in the mutated scenarios. Subsequently, the Consistency Check is applied to determine the presence of non-optimal PPDs by comparing the driving paths in the original and mutated scenarios. To deal with the challenge of large environment space, we design Feedback metrics that integrate spatial and temporal dimensions of the AV's movement. These metrics are crucial for effectively steering the generation of NoDSs. We evaluate Decictor on Baidu Apollo, an open-source and production-grade ADS. The experimental results validate the effectiveness of Decictor in detecting non-optimal PPDs of ADSs.</description>

      <title>AccidentBlip: Agent of Accident Warning based on MA-former</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12149v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In complex transportation systems, accurately sensing the surrounding environment and predicting the risk of potential accidents is crucial. Most existing accident prediction methods are based on temporal neural networks, such as RNN and LSTM. Recent multimodal fusion approaches improve vehicle localization through 3D target detection and assess potential risks by calculating inter-vehicle distances. However, these temporal networks and multimodal fusion methods suffer from limited detection robustness and high economic costs. To address these challenges, we propose AccidentBlip, a vision-only framework that employs our self-designed Motion Accident Transformer (MA-former) to process each frame of video. Unlike conventional self-attention mechanisms, MA-former replaces Q-former's self-attention with temporal attention, allowing the query corresponding to the previous frame to generate the query input for the next frame. Additionally, we introduce a residual module connection between queries of consecutive frames to enhance the model's temporal processing capabilities. For complex V2V and V2X scenarios, AccidentBlip adapts by concatenating queries from multiple cameras, effectively capturing spatial and temporal relationships. In particular, AccidentBlip achieves SOTA performance in both accident detection and prediction tasks on the DeepAccident dataset. It also outperforms current SOTA methods in V2V and V2X scenarios, demonstrating a superior capability to understand complex real-world environments.</description>

      <title>Generative Adversarial Networks in Ultrasound Imaging: Extending Field of View Beyond Conventional Limits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20981v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transthoracic Echocardiography (TTE) is a fundamental, non-invasive diagnostic tool in cardiovascular medicine, enabling detailed visualization of cardiac structures crucial for diagnosing various heart conditions. Despite its widespread use, TTE ultrasound imaging faces inherent limitations, notably the trade-off between field of view (FoV) and resolution. This paper introduces a novel application of conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGANs), specifically designed to extend the FoV in TTE ultrasound imaging while maintaining high resolution. Our proposed cGAN architecture, termed echoGAN, demonstrates the capability to generate realistic anatomical structures through outpainting, effectively broadening the viewable area in medical imaging. This advancement has the potential to enhance both automatic and manual ultrasound navigation, offering a more comprehensive view that could significantly reduce the learning curve associated with ultrasound imaging and aid in more accurate diagnoses. The results confirm that echoGAN reliably reproduce detailed cardiac features, thereby promising a significant step forward in the field of non-invasive cardiac naviagation and diagnostics.</description>

Abstract: This paper introduces the Multiple Greedy Quasi-Newton (MGSR1-SP) method, a novel approach to solving strongly-convex-strongly-concave (SCSC) saddle point problems. Our method enhances the approximation of the squared indefinite Hessian matrix inherent in these problems, significantly improving both stability and efficiency through iterative greedy updates. We provide a thorough theoretical analysis of MGSR1-SP, demonstrating its linear-quadratic convergence rate. Numerical experiments conducted on AUC maximization and adversarial debiasing problems, compared with state-of-the-art algorithms, underscore our method's enhanced convergence rate. These results affirm the potential of MGSR1-SP to improve performance across a broad spectrum of machine learning applications where efficient and accurate Hessian approximations are crucial.</description>

      <title>On the Resilience of LLM-Based Multi-Agent Collaboration with Faulty Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00989v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language model-based multi-agent systems have shown great abilities across various tasks due to the collaboration of expert agents, each focusing on a specific domain. However, the impact of clumsy or even malicious agents, i.e., those who frequently make errors in their tasks, on the overall performance of the system remains underexplored. This paper investigates: (1) What is the resilience of various system structures (e.g., A$\rightarrow$B$\rightarrow$C, A$\leftrightarrow$B$\leftrightarrow$C) under faulty agents, on different downstream tasks? (2) How can we increase system resilience to defend against these agents? To simulate faulty agents, we propose two approaches, AutoTransform and AutoInject, which introduce mistakes into the agents' responses. We select four downstream tasks, including code generation, math problems, translation, and text evaluation. Results suggest that the hierarchical structure, i.e., A$\rightarrow$(B$\leftrightarrow$C), exhibits superior resilience with the lowest performance drop of $9.2\%$, compared to $26.0\%$ and $31.2\%$ of other two structures. Additionally, we improve the system resilience with two methods, introducing a mechanism for each agent to challenge others' outputs, and an additional agent to review and correct messages. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/CUHK-ARISE/MAS-Resilience.</description>

      <title>Root Cause Attribution of Delivery Risks via Causal Discovery with Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05860v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to root cause attribution of delivery risks within supply chains by integrating causal discovery with reinforcement learning. As supply chains become increasingly complex, traditional methods of root cause analysis struggle to capture the intricate interrelationships between various factors, often leading to spurious correlations and suboptimal decision-making. Our approach addresses these challenges by leveraging causal discovery to identify the true causal relationships between operational variables, and reinforcement learning to iteratively refine the causal graph. This method enables the accurate identification of key drivers of late deliveries, such as shipping mode and delivery status, and provides actionable insights for optimizing supply chain performance. We apply our approach to a real-world supply chain dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in uncovering the underlying causes of delivery delays and offering strategies for mitigating these risks. The findings have significant implications for improving operational efficiency, customer satisfaction, and overall profitability within supply chains.</description>

Abstract: Operations research (OR) uses mathematical models to enhance decision-making, but developing these models requires expert knowledge and can be time-consuming. Automated mathematical programming (AMP) has emerged to simplify this process, but existing systems have limitations. This paper introduces a novel methodology that uses recent advances in Large Language Model (LLM) to create and edit OR solutions from non-expert user queries expressed using Natural Language. This reduces the need for domain expertise and the time to formulate a problem. The paper presents an end-to-end pipeline, named NL2OR, that generates solutions to OR problems from natural language input, and shares experimental results on several important OR problems.</description>

      <title>A Methodology for Incompleteness-Tolerant and Modular Gradual Semantics for Argumentative Statement Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22209v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gradual semantics (GS) have demonstrated great potential in argumentation, in particular for deploying quantitative bipolar argumentation frameworks (QBAFs) in a number of real-world settings, from judgmental forecasting to explainable AI. In this paper, we provide a novel methodology for obtaining GS for statement graphs, a form of structured argumentation framework, where arguments and relations between them are built from logical statements. Our methodology differs from existing approaches in the literature in two main ways. First, it naturally accommodates incomplete information, so that arguments with partially specified premises can play a meaningful role in the evaluation. Second, it is modularly defined to leverage on any GS for QBAFs. We also define a set of novel properties for our GS and study their suitability alongside a set of existing properties (adapted to our setting) for two instantiations of our GS, demonstrating their advantages over existing approaches.</description>

      <title>Rethinking External Slow-Thinking: From Snowball Errors to Probability of Correct Reasoning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15602v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Test-time scaling, which is also often referred to as slow-thinking, has been demonstrated to enhance multi-step reasoning in large language models (LLMs). However, despite its widespread utilization, the mechanisms underlying slow-thinking methods remain poorly understood. This paper explores the mechanisms of external slow-thinking from a theoretical standpoint. We begin by examining the snowball error effect within the LLM reasoning process and connect it to the likelihood of correct reasoning using information theory. Building on this, we show that external slow-thinking methods can be interpreted as strategies to mitigate the error probability. We further provide a comparative analysis of popular external slow-thinking approaches, ranging from simple to complex, highlighting their differences and interrelationships. Our findings suggest that the efficacy of these methods is not primarily determined by the specific framework employed, and that expanding the search scope or the model's internal reasoning capacity may yield more sustained improvements in the long term. We open-source our code at https://github.com/ZyGan1999/Snowball-Errors-and-Probability.</description>

      <title>QuantumNAT: Quantum Noise-Aware Training with Noise Injection, Quantization and Normalization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2110.11331v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Parameterized Quantum Circuits (PQC) are promising towards quantum advantage on near-term quantum hardware. However, due to the large quantum noises (errors), the performance of PQC models has a severe degradation on real quantum devices. Take Quantum Neural Network (QNN) as an example, the accuracy gap between noise-free simulation and noisy results on IBMQ-Yorktown for MNIST-4 classification is over 60%. Existing noise mitigation methods are general ones without leveraging unique characteristics of PQC; on the other hand, existing PQC work does not consider noise effect. To this end, we present QuantumNAT, a PQC-specific framework to perform noise-aware optimizations in both training and inference stages to improve robustness. We experimentally observe that the effect of quantum noise to PQC measurement outcome is a linear map from noise-free outcome with a scaling and a shift factor. Motivated by that, we propose post-measurement normalization to mitigate the feature distribution differences between noise-free and noisy scenarios. Furthermore, to improve the robustness against noise, we propose noise injection to the training process by inserting quantum error gates to PQC according to realistic noise models of quantum hardware. Finally, post-measurement quantization is introduced to quantize the measurement outcomes to discrete values, achieving the denoising effect. Extensive experiments on 8 classification tasks using 6 quantum devices demonstrate that QuantumNAT improves accuracy by up to 43%, and achieves over 94% 2-class, 80% 4-class, and 34% 10-class classification accuracy measured on real quantum computers. The code for construction and noise-aware training of PQC is available in the TorchQuantum library.</description>

      <title>QuEst: Graph Transformer for Quantum Circuit Reliability Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.16724v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Among different quantum algorithms, PQC for QML show promises on near-term devices. To facilitate the QML and PQC research, a recent python library called TorchQuantum has been released. It can construct, simulate, and train PQC for machine learning tasks with high speed and convenient debugging supports. Besides quantum for ML, we want to raise the community's attention on the reversed direction: ML for quantum. Specifically, the TorchQuantum library also supports using data-driven ML models to solve problems in quantum system research, such as predicting the impact of quantum noise on circuit fidelity and improving the quantum circuit compilation efficiency.
  This paper presents a case study of the ML for quantum part. Since estimating the noise impact on circuit reliability is an essential step toward understanding and mitigating noise, we propose to leverage classical ML to predict noise impact on circuit fidelity. Inspired by the natural graph representation of quantum circuits, we propose to leverage a graph transformer model to predict the noisy circuit fidelity. We firstly collect a large dataset with a variety of quantum circuits and obtain their fidelity on noisy simulators and real machines. Then we embed each circuit into a graph with gate and noise properties as node features, and adopt a graph transformer to predict the fidelity.
  Evaluated on 5 thousand random and algorithm circuits, the graph transformer predictor can provide accurate fidelity estimation with RMSE error 0.04 and outperform a simple neural network-based model by 0.02 on average. It can achieve 0.99 and 0.95 R$^2$ scores for random and algorithm circuits, respectively. Compared with circuit simulators, the predictor has over 200X speedup for estimating the fidelity.</description>

      <title>Preferences Evolve And So Should Your Bandits: Bandits with Evolving States for Online Platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.11655v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a model for learning with bandit feedback while accounting for deterministically evolving and unobservable states that we call Bandits with Deterministically Evolving States ($B$-$DES$). The workhorse applications of our model are learning for recommendation systems and learning for online ads. In both cases, the reward that the algorithm obtains at each round is a function of the short-term reward of the action chosen and how "healthy" the system is (i.e., as measured by its state). For example, in recommendation systems, the reward that the platform obtains from a user's engagement with a particular type of content depends not only on the inherent features of the specific content, but also on how the user's preferences have evolved as a result of interacting with other types of content on the platform. Our general model accounts for the different rate $\lambda \in [0,1]$ at which the state evolves (e.g., how fast a user's preferences shift as a result of previous content consumption) and encompasses standard multi-armed bandits as a special case. The goal of the algorithm is to minimize a notion of regret against the best-fixed sequence of arms pulled, which is significantly harder to attain compared to standard benchmark of the best-fixed action in hindsight. We present online learning algorithms for any possible value of the evolution rate $\lambda$ and we show the robustness of our results to various model misspecifications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18664v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The challenge of delivering efficient explanations is a critical barrier that prevents the adoption of model explanations in real-world applications. Existing approaches often depend on extensive model queries for sample-level explanations or rely on expert's knowledge of specific model structures that trade general applicability for efficiency. To address these limitations, this paper introduces a novel framework Fast Explanation (FEX) that represents attribution-based explanations via probability distributions, which are optimized by leveraging the policy gradient method. The proposed framework offers a robust, scalable solution for real-time, large-scale model explanations, bridging the gap between efficiency and applicability. We validate our framework on image and text classification tasks and the experiments demonstrate that our method reduces inference time by over 97% and memory usage by 70% compared to traditional model-agnostic approaches while maintaining high-quality explanations and broad applicability.</description>

      <title>Effective Interplay between Sparsity and Quantization: From Theory to Practice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20935v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The increasing size of deep neural networks (DNNs) necessitates effective model compression to reduce their computational and memory footprints. Sparsity and quantization are two prominent compression methods that have been shown to reduce DNNs' computational and memory footprints significantly while preserving model accuracy. However, how these two methods interact when combined together remains a key question for developers, as many tacitly assume that they are orthogonal, meaning that their combined use does not introduce additional errors beyond those introduced by each method independently. In this paper, we provide the first mathematical proof that sparsity and quantization are non-orthogonal. We corroborate these results with experiments spanning a range of large language models, including the OPT and LLaMA model families (with 125M to 8B parameters), and vision models like ViT and ResNet. We show that the order in which we apply these methods matters because applying quantization before sparsity may disrupt the relative importance of tensor elements, which may inadvertently remove significant elements from a tensor. More importantly, we show that even if applied in the correct order, the compounded errors from sparsity and quantization can significantly harm accuracy. Our findings extend to the efficient deployment of large models in resource-constrained compute platforms to reduce serving cost, offering insights into best practices for applying these compression methods to maximize hardware resource efficiency without compromising accuracy.</description>

      <title>On AI-Inspired UI-Design</title>

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (or simply UI) is a primary mean of interaction between users and their devices. In this paper, we discuss three complementary Artificial Intelligence (AI) approaches for triggering the creativity of app designers and inspiring them create better and more diverse UI designs. First, designers can prompt a Large Language Model (LLM) to directly generate and adjust UIs. Second, a Vision-Language Model (VLM) enables designers to effectively search a large screenshot dataset, e.g. from apps published in app stores. Third, a Diffusion Model (DM) can be trained to specifically generate UIs as inspirational images. We present an AI-inspired design process and discuss the implications and limitations of the approaches.</description>

      <title>Self-interpreting Adversarial Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08970v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new type of indirect, cross-modal injection attacks against visual language models that enable creation of self-interpreting images. These images contain hidden "meta-instructions" that control how models answer users' questions about the image and steer their outputs to express an adversary-chosen style, sentiment, or point of view. Self-interpreting images act as soft prompts, conditioning the model to satisfy the adversary's (meta-)objective while still producing answers based on the image's visual content. Meta-instructions are thus a stronger form of prompt injection. Adversarial images look natural and the model's answers are coherent and plausible--yet they also follow the adversary-chosen interpretation, e.g., political spin, or even objectives that are not achievable with explicit text instructions. We evaluate the efficacy of self-interpreting images for a variety of models, interpretations, and user prompts. We describe how these attacks could cause harm by enabling creation of self-interpreting content that carries spam, misinformation, or spin. Finally, we discuss defenses.</description>

      <title>GFE-Mamba: Mamba-based AD Multi-modal Progression Assessment via Generative Feature Extraction from MCI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15719v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a progressive, irreversible neurodegenerative disorder that often originates from Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). This progression results in significant memory loss and severely affects patients' quality of life. Clinical trials have consistently shown that early and targeted interventions for individuals with MCI may slow or even prevent the advancement of AD. Research indicates that accurate medical classification requires diverse multimodal data, including detailed assessment scales and neuroimaging techniques like Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Positron Emission Tomography (PET). However, simultaneously collecting the aforementioned three modalities for training presents substantial challenges. To tackle these difficulties, we propose GFE-Mamba, a multimodal classifier founded on Generative Feature Extractor. The intermediate features provided by this Extractor can compensate for the shortcomings of PET and achieve profound multimodal fusion in the classifier. The Mamba block, as the backbone of the classifier, enables it to efficiently extract information from long-sequence scale information. Pixel-level Bi-cross Attention supplements pixel-level information from MRI and PET. We provide our rationale for developing this cross-temporal progression prediction dataset and the pre-trained Extractor weights. Our experimental findings reveal that the GFE-Mamba model effectively predicts the progression from MCI to AD and surpasses several leading methods in the field.

      <title>Large Language Models for cross-language code clone detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04430v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the involvement of multiple programming languages in modern software development, cross-lingual code clone detection has gained traction within the software engineering community. Numerous studies have explored this topic, proposing various promising approaches. Inspired by the significant advances in machine learning in recent years, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), which have demonstrated their ability to tackle various tasks, this paper revisits cross-lingual code clone detection. We evaluate the performance of five (05) LLMs and eight prompts (08) for the identification of cross-lingual code clones. Additionally, we compare these results against two baseline methods. Finally, we evaluate a pre-trained embedding model to assess the effectiveness of the generated representations for classifying clone and non-clone pairs. The studies involving LLMs and Embedding models are evaluated using two widely used cross-lingual datasets, XLCoST and CodeNet. Our results show that LLMs can achieve high F1 scores, up to 0.99, for straightforward programming examples. However, they not only perform less well on programs associated with complex programming challenges but also do not necessarily understand the meaning of "code clones" in a cross-lingual setting. We show that embedding models used to represent code fragments from different programming languages in the same representation space enable the training of a basic classifier that outperforms all LLMs by ~1 and ~20 percentage points on the XLCoST and CodeNet datasets, respectively. This finding suggests that, despite the apparent capabilities of LLMs, embeddings provided by embedding models offer suitable representations to achieve state-of-the-art performance in cross-lingual code clone detection.</description>

      <title>Proto-OOD: Enhancing OOD Object Detection with Prototype Feature Similarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05466v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural networks that are trained on limited category samples often mispredict out-of-distribution (OOD) objects. We observe that features of the same category are more tightly clustered in feature space, while those of different categories are more dispersed. Based on this, we propose using prototype similarity for OOD detection. Drawing on widely used prototype features in few-shot learning, we introduce a novel OOD detection network structure (Proto-OOD). Proto-OOD enhances the representativeness of category prototypes using contrastive loss and detects OOD data by evaluating the similarity between input features and category prototypes. During training, Proto-OOD generates OOD samples for training the similarity module with a negative embedding generator. When Pascal VOC are used as the in-distribution dataset and MS-COCO as the OOD dataset, Proto-OOD significantly reduces the FPR (false positive rate). Moreover, considering the limitations of existing evaluation metrics, we propose a more reasonable evaluation protocol. The code will be released.</description>

      <title>StressPrompt: Does Stress Impact Large Language Models and Human Performance Similarly?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17167v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Human beings often experience stress, which can significantly influence their performance. This study explores whether Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit stress responses similar to those of humans and whether their performance fluctuates under different stress-inducing prompts. To investigate this, we developed a novel set of prompts, termed StressPrompt, designed to induce varying levels of stress. These prompts were derived from established psychological frameworks and carefully calibrated based on ratings from human participants. We then applied these prompts to several LLMs to assess their responses across a range of tasks, including instruction-following, complex reasoning, and emotional intelligence. The findings suggest that LLMs, like humans, perform optimally under moderate stress, consistent with the Yerkes-Dodson law. Notably, their performance declines under both low and high-stress conditions. Our analysis further revealed that these StressPrompts significantly alter the internal states of LLMs, leading to changes in their neural representations that mirror human responses to stress. This research provides critical insights into the operational robustness and flexibility of LLMs, demonstrating the importance of designing AI systems capable of maintaining high performance in real-world scenarios where stress is prevalent, such as in customer service, healthcare, and emergency response contexts. Moreover, this study contributes to the broader AI research community by offering a new perspective on how LLMs handle different scenarios and their similarities to human cognition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20064v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Knowledge discovery is key to understand and interpret a dataset, as well as to find the underlying relationships between its components. Unsupervised Cognition is a novel unsupervised learning algorithm that focus on modelling the learned data. This paper presents three techniques to perform knowledge discovery over an already trained Unsupervised Cognition model. Specifically, we present a technique for pattern mining, a technique for feature selection based on the previous pattern mining technique, and a technique for dimensionality reduction based on the previous feature selection technique. The final goal is to distinguish between relevant and irrelevant features and use them to build a model from which to extract meaningful patterns. We evaluated our proposals with empirical experiments and found that they overcome the state-of-the-art in knowledge discovery.</description>

      <title>Interpret Your Decision: Logical Reasoning Regularization for Generalization in Visual Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04492v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vision models excel in image classification but struggle to generalize to unseen data, such as classifying images from unseen domains or discovering novel categories. In this paper, we explore the relationship between logical reasoning and deep learning generalization in visual classification. A logical regularization termed L-Reg is derived which bridges a logical analysis framework to image classification. Our work reveals that L-Reg reduces the complexity of the model in terms of the feature distribution and classifier weights. Specifically, we unveil the interpretability brought by L-Reg, as it enables the model to extract the salient features, such as faces to persons, for classification. Theoretical analysis and experiments demonstrate that L-Reg enhances generalization across various scenarios, including multi-domain generalization and generalized category discovery. In complex real-world scenarios where images span unknown classes and unseen domains, L-Reg consistently improves generalization, highlighting its practical efficacy.</description>

      <title>On A Scale From 1 to 5: Quantifying Hallucination in Faithfulness Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12222v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hallucination has been a popular topic in natural language generation (NLG). In real-world applications, unfaithful content can result in bad data quality or loss of trust from end users. Thus, it is crucial to fact-check before adopting NLG for production usage, which can be expensive if done manually. In this paper, we investigate automated faithfulness evaluation in guided NLG. We developed a rubrics template and use large language models (LLMs) to score the generation into quantifiable scales. We compared popular LLMs as well as the widely adopted natural language inference (NLI) models in scoring quality and sensitivity. In addition, we developed methods to generation synthetic unfaithful data, as well as a heuristics to quantify the percentage of hallucination. Our results on 4 travel-domain industry dataset show that GPT-4 can provide accurate judgement and explanation on whether a source and a generation are factually consistent. Furthermore, we found that tuning NLI models on synthetic data can improve performance. Lastly, we present insights on latency and cost for deploying such system.</description>

      <title>Multi-view biomedical foundation models for molecule-target and property prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19704v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Foundation models applied to bio-molecular space hold promise to accelerate drug discovery. Molecular representation is key to building such models. Previous works have typically focused on a single representation or view of the molecules. Here, we develop a multi-view foundation model approach, that integrates molecular views of graph, image and text. Single-view foundation models are each pre-trained on a dataset of up to 200M molecules and then aggregated into combined representations. Our multi-view model is validated on a diverse set of 18 tasks, encompassing ligand-protein binding, molecular solubility, metabolism and toxicity. We show that the multi-view models perform robustly and are able to balance the strengths and weaknesses of specific views. We then apply this model to screen compounds against a large (&gt;100 targets) set of G Protein-Coupled receptors (GPCRs). From this library of targets, we identify 33 that are related to Alzheimer's disease. On this subset, we employ our model to identify strong binders, which are validated through structure-based modeling and identification of key binding motifs.</description>

      <title>CNMBERT: A Model for Converting Hanyu Pinyin Abbreviations to Chinese Characters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11770v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The task of converting Hanyu Pinyin abbreviations to Chinese characters is a significant branch within the domain of Chinese Spelling Correction (CSC). It plays an important role in many downstream applications such as named entity recognition and sentiment analysis. This task typically involves text-length alignment and seems easy to solve; however, due to the limited information content in pinyin abbreviations, achieving accurate conversion is challenging. In this paper, we treat this as a fill-mask task and propose CNMBERT, which stands for zh-CN Pinyin Multi-mask BERT Model, as a solution to this issue. By introducing a multi-mask strategy and Mixture of Experts (MoE) layers, CNMBERT outperforms fine-tuned GPT models and ChatGPT-4o with a 61.53% MRR score and 51.86% accuracy on a 10,373-sample test dataset.</description>

      <title>Conditional Distribution Learning on Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15206v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Leveraging the diversity and quantity of data provided by various graph-structured data augmentations while preserving intrinsic semantic information is challenging. Additionally, successive layers in graph neural network (GNN) tend to produce more similar node embeddings, while graph contrastive learning aims to increase the dissimilarity between negative pairs of node embeddings. This inevitably results in a conflict between the message-passing mechanism (MPM) of GNNs and the contrastive learning (CL) of negative pairs via intraviews. In this paper, we propose a conditional distribution learning (CDL) method that learns graph representations from graph-structured data for semisupervised graph classification. Specifically, we present an end-to-end graph representation learning model to align the conditional distributions of weakly and strongly augmented features over the original features. This alignment enables the CDL model to effectively preserve intrinsic semantic information when both weak and strong augmentations are applied to graph-structured data. To avoid the conflict between the MPM and the CL of negative pairs, positive pairs of node representations are retained for measuring the similarity between the original features and the corresponding weakly augmented features. Extensive experiments with several benchmark graph datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed CDL method.</description>

      <title>CantorNet: A Sandbox for Testing Geometrical and Topological Complexity Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19713v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many natural phenomena are characterized by self-similarity, for example the symmetry of human faces, or a repetitive motif of a song. Studying of such symmetries will allow us to gain deeper insights into the underlying mechanisms of complex systems. Recognizing the importance of understanding these patterns, we propose a geometrically inspired framework to study such phenomena in artificial neural networks. To this end, we introduce \emph{CantorNet}, inspired by the triadic construction of the Cantor set, which was introduced by Georg Cantor in the $19^\text{th}$ century. In mathematics, the Cantor set is a set of points lying on a single line that is self-similar and has a counter intuitive property of being an uncountably infinite null set. Similarly, we introduce CantorNet as a sandbox for studying self-similarity by means of novel topological and geometrical complexity measures. CantorNet constitutes a family of ReLU neural networks that spans the whole spectrum of possible Kolmogorov complexities, including the two opposite descriptions (linear and exponential as measured by the description length). CantorNet's decision boundaries can be arbitrarily ragged, yet are analytically known. Besides serving as a testing ground for complexity measures, our work may serve to illustrate potential pitfalls in geometry-ignorant data augmentation techniques and adversarial attacks.</description>

      <title>Intelligent Tutors for Adult Learners: An Analysis of Needs and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04477v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This research examines the sociotechnical factors that influence the adoption and usage of intelligent tutoring systems in self-directed learning contexts, focusing specifically on adult learners. The study is divided into two parts. First, we present Apprentice Tutors, a novel intelligent tutoring system designed to address the unique needs of adult learners. The platform includes adaptive problem selection, real-time feedback, and visual dashboards to support learning in college algebra topics. Second, we investigate the specific needs and experiences of adult users through a deployment study and a series of focus groups.

      <title>Adversarial Vulnerabilities in Large Language Models for Time Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08099v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated significant potential in the field of time series forecasting, offering impressive capabilities in handling complex temporal data. However, their robustness and reliability in real-world applications remain under-explored, particularly concerning their susceptibility to adversarial attacks. In this paper, we introduce a targeted adversarial attack framework for LLM-based time series forecasting. By employing both gradient-free and black-box optimization methods, we generate minimal yet highly effective perturbations that significantly degrade the forecasting accuracy across multiple datasets and LLM architectures. Our experiments, which include models like TimeGPT and LLM-Time with GPT-3.5, GPT-4, LLaMa, and Mistral, show that adversarial attacks lead to much more severe performance degradation than random noise, and demonstrate the broad effectiveness of our attacks across different LLMs. The results underscore the critical vulnerabilities of LLMs in time series forecasting, highlighting the need for robust defense mechanisms to ensure their reliable deployment in practical applications.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini's Vision Capabilities for Compositional Analysis from Dried Solution Drops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10587v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When microliter drops of salt solutions dry on non-porous surfaces, they form erratic yet characteristic deposit patterns influenced by complex crystallization dynamics and fluid motion. Using OpenAI's image-enabled language models, we analyzed deposits from 12 salts with 200 images per salt and per model. GPT-4o classified 57% of the salts accurately, significantly outperforming random chance and GPT-4o mini. This study underscores the promise of general-use AI tools for reliably identifying salts from their drying patterns.</description>

      <title>Label-Efficient Data Augmentation with Video Diffusion Models for Guidewire Segmentation in Cardiac Fluoroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16050v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The accurate segmentation of guidewires in interventional cardiac fluoroscopy videos is crucial for computer-aided navigation tasks. Although deep learning methods have demonstrated high accuracy and robustness in wire segmentation, they require substantial annotated datasets for generalizability, underscoring the need for extensive labeled data to enhance model performance. To address this challenge, we propose the Segmentation-guided Frame-consistency Video Diffusion Model (SF-VD) to generate large collections of labeled fluoroscopy videos, augmenting the training data for wire segmentation networks. SF-VD leverages videos with limited annotations by independently modeling scene distribution and motion distribution. It first samples the scene distribution by generating 2D fluoroscopy images with wires positioned according to a specified input mask, and then samples the motion distribution by progressively generating subsequent frames, ensuring frame-to-frame coherence through a frame-consistency strategy. A segmentation-guided mechanism further refines the process by adjusting wire contrast, ensuring a diverse range of visibility in the synthesized image. Evaluation on a fluoroscopy dataset confirms the superior quality of the generated videos and shows significant improvements in guidewire segmentation.</description>

      <title>DynaGRAG | Exploring the Topology of Information for Advancing Language Understanding and Generation in Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18644v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GRAG or Graph RAG) architectures aim to enhance language understanding and generation by leveraging external knowledge. However, effectively capturing and integrating the rich semantic information present in textual and structured data remains a challenge. To address this, a novel GRAG framework, Dynamic Graph Retrieval-Agumented Generation (DynaGRAG), is proposed to focus on enhancing subgraph representation and diversity within the knowledge graph. By improving graph density, capturing entity and relation information more effectively, and dynamically prioritizing relevant and diverse subgraphs and information within them, the proposed approach enables a more comprehensive understanding of the underlying semantic structure. This is achieved through a combination of de-duplication processes, two-step mean pooling of embeddings, query-aware retrieval considering unique nodes, and a Dynamic Similarity-Aware BFS (DSA-BFS) traversal algorithm. Integrating Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) through hard prompting further enhances the learning of rich node and edge representations while preserving the hierarchical subgraph structure. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of DynaGRAG, showcasing the significance of enhanced subgraph representation and diversity for improved language understanding and generation.</description>

      <title>GroverGPT: A Large Language Model with 8 Billion Parameters for Quantum Searching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00135v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing is an exciting non-Von Neumann paradigm, offering provable speedups over classical computing for specific problems. However, the practical limits of classical simulatability for quantum circuits remain unclear, especially with current noisy quantum devices. In this work, we explore the potential of leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to simulate the output of a quantum Turing machine using Grover's quantum circuits, known to provide quadratic speedups over classical counterparts. To this end, we developed GroverGPT, a specialized model based on LLaMA's 8-billion-parameter architecture, trained on over 15 trillion tokens. Unlike brute-force state-vector simulations, which demand substantial computational resources, GroverGPT employs pattern recognition to approximate quantum search algorithms without explicitly representing quantum states. Analyzing 97K quantum search instances, GroverGPT consistently outperformed OpenAI's GPT-4o (45\% accuracy), achieving nearly 100\% accuracy on 6- and 10-qubit datasets when trained on 4-qubit or larger datasets. It also demonstrated strong generalization, surpassing 95\% accuracy for systems with over 20 qubits when trained on 3- to 6-qubit data. Analysis indicates GroverGPT captures quantum features of Grover's search rather than classical patterns, supported by novel prompting strategies to enhance performance. Although accuracy declines with increasing system size, these findings offer insights into the practical boundaries of classical simulatability. This work suggests task-specific LLMs can surpass general-purpose models like GPT-4o in quantum algorithm learning and serve as powerful tools for advancing quantum research.</description>

      <title>Weakly Supervised Learning on Large Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02021v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph classification plays a pivotal role in various domains, including pathology, where images can be represented as graphs. In this domain, images can be represented as graphs, where nodes might represent individual nuclei, and edges capture the spatial or functional relationships between them. Often, the overall label of the graph, such as a cancer type or disease state, is determined by patterns within smaller, localized regions of the image. This work introduces a weakly-supervised graph classification framework leveraging two subgraph extraction techniques: (1) Sliding-window approach (2) BFS-based approach. Subgraphs are processed using a Graph Attention Network (GAT), which employs attention mechanisms to identify the most informative subgraphs for classification. Weak supervision is achieved by propagating graph-level labels to subgraphs, eliminating the need for detailed subgraph annotations.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of "Spontaneous" Topic Changes in Next Token Prediction with Self-Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06382v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Human cognition can spontaneously shift conversation topics, often triggered by emotional or contextual signals. In contrast, self-attention-based language models depend on structured statistical cues from input tokens for next-token prediction, lacking this spontaneity. Motivated by this distinction, we investigate the factors that influence the next-token prediction to change the topic of the input sequence. We define concepts of topic continuity, ambiguous sequences, and change of topic, based on defining a topic as a set of token priority graphs (TPGs). Using a simplified single-layer self-attention architecture, we derive analytical characterizations of topic changes. Specifically, we demonstrate that (1) the model maintains the priority order of tokens related to the input topic, (2) a topic change can occur only if lower-priority tokens outnumber all higher-priority tokens of the input topic, and (3) unlike human cognition, longer context lengths and overlapping topics reduce the likelihood of spontaneous redirection. These insights highlight differences between human cognition and self-attention-based models in navigating topic changes and underscore the challenges in designing conversational AI capable of handling "spontaneous" conversations more naturally. To the best of our knowledge, no prior work has explored these questions with a focus as closely aligned to human conversation and thought.</description>

      <title>Cyber Shadows: Neutralizing Security Threats with AI and Targeted Policy Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09025v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The digital age, driven by the AI revolution, brings significant opportunities but also conceals security threats, which we refer to as cyber shadows. These threats pose risks at individual, organizational, and societal levels. This paper examines the systemic impact of these cyber threats and proposes a comprehensive cybersecurity strategy that integrates AI-driven solutions, such as Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), with targeted policy interventions. By combining technological and regulatory measures, we create a multilevel defense capable of addressing both direct threats and indirect negative externalities. We emphasize that the synergy between AI-driven solutions and policy interventions is essential for neutralizing cyber threats and mitigating their negative impact on the digital economy. Finally, we underscore the need for continuous adaptation of these strategies, especially in response to the rapid advancement of autonomous AI-driven attacks, to ensure the creation of secure and resilient digital ecosystems.</description>

      <title>Multi-View Spectral Clustering for Graphs with Multiple View Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11422v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the fundamental importance of clustering, to this day, much of the relevant research is still based on ambiguous foundations, leading to an unclear understanding of whether or how the various clustering methods are connected with each other. In this work, we provide an additional stepping stone towards resolving such ambiguities by presenting a general clustering framework that subsumes a series of seemingly disparate clustering methods, including various methods belonging to the widely popular spectral clustering framework. In fact, the generality of the proposed framework is additionally capable of shedding light to the largely unexplored area of multi-view graphs where each view may have differently clustered nodes. In turn, we propose GenClus: a method that is simultaneously an instance of this framework and a generalization of spectral clustering, while also being closely related to k-means as well. This results in a principled alternative to the few existing methods studying this special type of multi-view graphs. Then, we conduct in-depth experiments, which demonstrate that GenClus is more computationally efficient than existing methods, while also attaining similar or better clustering performance. Lastly, a qualitative real-world case-study further demonstrates the ability of GenClus to produce meaningful clusterings.</description>

      <title>Conversation Routines: A Prompt Engineering Framework for Task-Oriented Dialog Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11613v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study introduces Conversation Routines (CR), a structured prompt engineering framework for developing task-oriented dialog systems using Large Language Models (LLMs). While LLMs demonstrate remarkable natural language understanding capabilities, engineering them to reliably execute complex business workflows remains challenging. The proposed CR framework enables the development of Conversation Agentic Systems (CAS) through natural language specifications, embedding task-oriented logic within LLM prompts. This approach provides a systematic methodology for designing and implementing complex conversational workflows while maintaining behavioral consistency. We demonstrate the framework's effectiveness through two proof-of-concept implementations: a Train Ticket Booking System and an Interactive Troubleshooting Copilot. These case studies validate CR's capability to encode sophisticated behavioral patterns and decision logic while preserving natural conversational flexibility. Results show that CR enables domain experts to design conversational workflows in natural language while leveraging custom enterprise functionalities (tools) developed by software engineers, creating an efficient division of responsibilities where developers focus on core API implementation and domain experts handle conversation design. While the framework shows promise in accessibility and adaptability, we identify key challenges including computational overhead, non-deterministic behavior, and domain-specific logic optimization. Future research directions include CR evaluation methods based on prompt engineering framework driven by goal-oriented grading criteria, improving scalability for complex multi-agent interactions, enhancing system robustness addressing the identified limitations across diverse business applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11900v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Personalized news headline generation aims to provide users with attention-grabbing headlines that are tailored to their preferences. Prevailing methods focus on user-oriented content preferences, but most of them overlook the fact that diverse stylistic preferences are integral to users' panoramic interests, leading to suboptimal personalization. In view of this, we propose a novel Stylistic-Content Aware Personalized Headline Generation (SCAPE) framework. SCAPE extracts both content and stylistic features from headlines with the aid of large language model (LLM) collaboration. It further adaptively integrates users' long- and short-term interests through a contrastive learning-based hierarchical fusion network. By incorporating the panoramic interests into the headline generator, SCAPE reflects users' stylistic-content preferences during the generation process. Extensive experiments on the real-world dataset PENS demonstrate the superiority of SCAPE over baselines.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12121v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Continual learning has emerged as a pivotal area of research, primarily due to its advantageous characteristic that allows models to persistently acquire and retain information. However, catastrophic forgetting can severely impair model performance. In this study, we address network forgetting by introducing a novel framework termed Optimally-Weighted Maximum Mean Discrepancy (OWMMD), which imposes penalties on representation alterations via a Multi-Level Feature Matching Mechanism (MLFMM). Furthermore, we propose an Adaptive Regularization Optimization (ARO) strategy to refine the adaptive weight vectors, which autonomously assess the significance of each feature layer throughout the optimization process, The proposed ARO approach can relieve the over-regularization problem and promote the future task learning. We conduct a comprehensive series of experiments, benchmarking our proposed method against several established baselines. The empirical findings indicate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance.</description>

      <title>Examining Alignment of Large Language Models through Representative Heuristics: The Case of Political Stereotypes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14294v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Examining the alignment of large language models (LLMs) has become increasingly important, particularly when these systems fail to operate as intended. This study explores the challenge of aligning LLMs with human intentions and values, with specific focus on their political inclinations. Previous research has highlighted LLMs' propensity to display political leanings, and their ability to mimic certain political parties' stances on various issues. However, the extent and conditions under which LLMs deviate from empirical positions have not been thoroughly examined. To address this gap, our study systematically investigates the factors contributing to LLMs' deviations from empirical positions on political issues, aiming to quantify these deviations and identify the conditions that cause them.
  Drawing on cognitive science findings related to representativeness heuristics -- where individuals readily recall the representative attribute of a target group in a way that leads to exaggerated beliefs -- we scrutinize LLM responses through this heuristics lens. We conduct experiments to determine how LLMs exhibit stereotypes by inflating judgments in favor of specific political parties. Our results indicate that while LLMs can mimic certain political parties' positions, they often exaggerate these positions more than human respondents do. Notably, LLMs tend to overemphasize representativeness to a greater extent than humans. This study highlights the susceptibility of LLMs to representativeness heuristics, suggeseting potential vulnerabilities to political stereotypes. We propose prompt-based mitigation strategies that demonstrate effectiveness in reducing the influence of representativeness in LLM responses.</description>

      <title>Scaling laws for decoding images from brain activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15322v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative AI has recently propelled the decoding of images from brain activity. How do these approaches scale with the amount and type of neural recordings? Here, we systematically compare image decoding from four types of non-invasive devices: electroencephalography (EEG), magnetoencephalography (MEG), high-field functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (3T fMRI) and ultra-high field (7T) fMRI. For this, we evaluate decoding models on the largest benchmark to date, encompassing 8 public datasets, 84 volunteers, 498 hours of brain recording and 2.3 million brain responses to natural images. Unlike previous work, we focus on single-trial decoding performance to simulate real-time settings. This systematic comparison reveals three main findings. First, the most precise neuroimaging devices tend to yield the best decoding performances, when the size of the training sets are similar. However, the gain enabled by deep learning - in comparison to linear models - is obtained with the noisiest devices. Second, we do not observe any plateau of decoding performance as the amount of training data increases. Rather, decoding performance scales log-linearly with the amount of brain recording. Third, this scaling law primarily depends on the amount of data per subject. However, little decoding gain is observed by increasing the number of subjects. Overall, these findings delineate the path most suitable to scale the decoding of images from non-invasive brain recordings.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15747v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Known by more than 1.5 billion people in the Indian subcontinent, Indic languages present unique challenges and opportunities for natural language processing (NLP) research due to their rich cultural heritage, linguistic diversity, and complex structures. IndicMMLU-Pro is a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) across Indic languages, building upon the MMLU Pro (Massive Multitask Language Understanding) framework. Covering major languages such as Hindi, Bengali, Gujarati, Marathi, Kannada, Punjabi, Tamil, Telugu, and Urdu, our benchmark addresses the unique challenges and opportunities presented by the linguistic diversity of the Indian subcontinent. This benchmark encompasses a wide range of tasks in language comprehension, reasoning, and generation, meticulously crafted to capture the intricacies of Indian languages. IndicMMLU-Pro provides a standardized evaluation framework to push the research boundaries in Indic language AI, facilitating the development of more accurate, efficient, and culturally sensitive models. This paper outlines the benchmarks' design principles, task taxonomy, and data collection methodology, and presents baseline results from state-of-the-art multilingual models.</description>

      <title>Efficiency Bottlenecks of Convolutional Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks: A Comprehensive Scrutiny with ImageNet, AlexNet, LeNet and Tabular Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15757</link>

Abstract: Algorithmic level developments like Convolutional Neural Networks, transformers, attention mechanism, Retrieval Augmented Generation and so on have changed Artificial Intelligence. Recent such development was observed by Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks that suggested to challenge the fundamental concept of a Neural Network, thus change Multilayer Perceptron, and Convolutional Neural Networks. They received a good reception in terms of scientific modeling, yet had some drawbacks in terms of efficiency. In this paper, we train Convolutional Kolmogorov Arnold Networks (CKANs) with the ImageNet-1k dataset with 1.3 million images, MNIST dataset with 60k images and a tabular biological science related MoA dataset and test the promise of CKANs in terms of FLOPS, Inference Time, number of trainable parameters and training time against the accuracy, precision, recall and f-1 score they produce against the standard industry practice on CNN models. We show that the CKANs perform fair yet slower than CNNs in small size dataset like MoA and MNIST but are not nearly comparable as the dataset gets larger and more complex like the ImageNet.

      <title>SpatialVLA: Exploring Spatial Representations for Visual-Language-Action Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15830v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we claim that spatial understanding is the keypoint in robot manipulation, and propose SpatialVLA to explore effective spatial representations for the robot foundation model. Specifically, we introduce Ego3D Position Encoding to inject 3D information into the input observations of the visual-language-action model, and propose Adaptive Action Grids to represent spatial robot movement actions with adaptive discretized action grids, facilitating learning generalizable and transferrable spatial action knowledge for cross-robot control. SpatialVLA is first pre-trained on top of a vision-language model with 1.1 Million real-world robot episodes, to learn a generalist manipulation policy across multiple robot environments and tasks. After pre-training, SpatialVLA is directly applied to perform numerous tasks in a zero-shot manner. The superior results in both simulation and real-world robots demonstrate its advantage of inferring complex robot motion trajectories and its strong in-domain multi-task generalization ability. We further show the proposed Adaptive Action Grids offer a new and effective way to fine-tune the pre-trained SpatialVLA model for new simulation and real-world setups, where the pre-learned action grids are re-discretized to capture robot-specific spatial action movements of new setups. The superior results from extensive evaluations demonstrate the exceptional in-distribution generalization and out-of-distribution adaptation capability, highlighting the crucial benefit of the proposed spatial-aware representations for generalist robot policy learning. All the details and codes will be open-sourced.</description>

      <title>Upside Down Reinforcement Learning with Policy Generators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16288v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Upside Down Reinforcement Learning (UDRL) is a promising framework for solving reinforcement learning problems which focuses on learning command-conditioned policies. In this work, we extend UDRL to the task of learning a command-conditioned generator of deep neural network policies. We accomplish this using Hypernetworks - a variant of Fast Weight Programmers, which learn to decode input commands representing a desired expected return into command-specific weight matrices. Our method, dubbed Upside Down Reinforcement Learning with Policy Generators (UDRLPG), streamlines comparable techniques by removing the need for an evaluator or critic to update the weights of the generator. To counteract the increased variance in last returns caused by not having an evaluator, we decouple the sampling probability of the buffer from the absolute number of policies in it, which, together with a simple weighting strategy, improves the empirical convergence of the algorithm. Compared with existing algorithms, UDRLPG achieves competitive performance and high returns, sometimes outperforming more complex architectures. Our experiments show that a trained generator can generalize to create policies that achieve unseen returns zero-shot. The proposed method appears to be effective in mitigating some of the challenges associated with learning highly multimodal functions. Altogether, we believe that UDRLPG represents a promising step forward in achieving greater empirical sample efficiency in RL. A full implementation of UDRLPG is publicly available at https://github.com/JacopoD/udrlpg_</description>
