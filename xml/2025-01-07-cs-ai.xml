      <title>Mathematical Definition and Systematization of Puzzle Rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While logic puzzles have engaged individuals through problem-solving and critical thinking, the creation of new puzzle rules has largely relied on ad-hoc processes. Pencil puzzles, such as Slitherlink and Sudoku, represent a prominent subset of these games, celebrated for their intellectual challenges rooted in combinatorial logic and spatial reasoning. Despite extensive research into solving techniques and automated problem generation, a unified framework for systematic and scalable rule design has been lacking. Here, we introduce a mathematical framework for defining and systematizing pencil puzzle rules. This framework formalizes grid elements, their positional relationships, and iterative composition operations, allowing for the incremental construction of structures that form the basis of puzzle rules. Furthermore, we establish a formal method to describe constraints and domains for each structure, ensuring solvability and coherence. Applying this framework, we successfully formalized the rules of well-known Nikoli puzzles, including Slitherlink and Sudoku, demonstrating the formal representation of a significant portion (approximately one-fourth) of existing puzzles. These results validate the potential of the framework to systematize and innovate puzzle rule design, establishing a pathway to automated rule generation. By providing a mathematical foundation for puzzle rule creation, this framework opens avenues for computers, potentially enhanced by AI, to design novel puzzle rules tailored to player preferences, expanding the scope of puzzle diversity. Beyond its direct application to pencil puzzles, this work illustrates how mathematical frameworks can bridge recreational mathematics and algorithmic design, offering tools for broader exploration in logic-based systems, with potential applications in educational game design, personalized learning, and computational creativity.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Mission Design in Neuro-Symbolic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) is a growing field that demands accurate modeling of legal concepts and restrictions in navigating intelligent vehicles. In addition, any implementation of AAM needs to face the challenges posed by inherently dynamic and uncertain human-inhabited spaces robustly. Nevertheless, the employment of Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) is an endearing task that promises to enhance significantly today's logistics and emergency response capabilities. To tackle these challenges, we present a probabilistic and neuro-symbolic architecture to encode legal frameworks and expert knowledge over uncertain spatial relations and noisy perception in an interpretable and adaptable fashion. More specifically, we demonstrate Probabilistic Mission Design (ProMis), a system architecture that links geospatial and sensory data with declarative, Hybrid Probabilistic Logic Programs (HPLP) to reason over the agent's state space and its legality. As a result, ProMis generates Probabilistic Mission Landscapes (PML), which quantify the agent's belief that a set of mission conditions is satisfied across its navigation space. Extending prior work on ProMis' reasoning capabilities and computational characteristics, we show its integration with potent machine learning models such as Large Language Models (LLM) and Transformer-based vision models. Hence, our experiments underpin the application of ProMis with multi-modal input data and how our method applies to many important AAM scenarios.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Reasoning through Process Supervision with Monte Carlo Tree Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their remarkable capacity across a variety of tasks. However, reasoning remains a challenge for LLMs. To improve LLMs' reasoning ability, process supervision has proven to be better than outcome supervision. In this work, we study using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to generate process supervision data with LLMs themselves for training them. We sample reasoning steps with an LLM and assign each step a score that captures its "relative correctness," and the LLM is then trained by minimizing weighted log-likelihood of generating the reasoning steps. This generate-then-train process is repeated iteratively until convergence.Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed methods considerably improve the performance of LLMs on two mathematical reasoning datasets. Furthermore, models trained on one dataset also exhibit improved performance on the other, showing the transferability of the enhanced reasoning ability.</description>

      <title>BLAST: A Stealthy Backdoor Leverage Attack against Cooperative Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning based Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies have shown that cooperative multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (c-MADRL) is under the threat of backdoor attacks. Once a backdoor trigger is observed, it will perform malicious actions leading to failures or malicious goals. However, existing backdoor attacks suffer from several issues, e.g., instant trigger patterns lack stealthiness, the backdoor is trained or activated by an additional network, or all agents are backdoored. To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel backdoor leverage attack against c-MADRL, BLAST, which attacks the entire multi-agent team by embedding the backdoor only in a single agent. Firstly, we introduce adversary spatiotemporal behavior patterns as the backdoor trigger rather than manual-injected fixed visual patterns or instant status and control the period to perform malicious actions. This method can guarantee the stealthiness and practicality of BLAST. Secondly, we hack the original reward function of the backdoor agent via unilateral guidance to inject BLAST, so as to achieve the \textit{leverage attack effect} that can pry open the entire multi-agent system via a single backdoor agent. We evaluate our BLAST against 3 classic c-MADRL algorithms (VDN, QMIX, and MAPPO) in 2 popular c-MADRL environments (SMAC and Pursuit), and 2 existing defense mechanisms. The experimental results demonstrate that BLAST can achieve a high attack success rate while maintaining a low clean performance variance rate.</description>

      <title>Prism: Mining Task-aware Domains in Non-i.i.d. IMU Data for Flexible User Perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A wide range of user perception applications leverage inertial measurement unit (IMU) data for online prediction. However, restricted by the non-i.i.d. nature of IMU data collected from mobile devices, most systems work well only in a controlled setting (e.g., for a specific user in particular postures), limiting application scenarios. To achieve uncontrolled online prediction on mobile devices, referred to as the flexible user perception (FUP) problem, is attractive but hard. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme, called Prism, which can obtain high FUP accuracy on mobile devices. The core of Prism is to discover task-aware domains embedded in IMU dataset, and to train a domain-aware model on each identified domain. To this end, we design an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm to estimate latent domains with respect to the specific downstream perception task. Finally, the best-fit model can be automatically selected for use by comparing the test sample and all identified domains in the feature space. We implement Prism on various mobile devices and conduct extensive experiments. Results demonstrate that Prism can achieve the best FUP performance with a low latency.</description>

      <title>AgentRefine: Enhancing Agent Generalization through Refinement Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) based agents have proved their ability to perform complex tasks like humans. However, there is still a large gap between open-sourced LLMs and commercial models like the GPT series. In this paper, we focus on improving the agent generalization capabilities of LLMs via instruction tuning. We first observe that the existing agent training corpus exhibits satisfactory results on held-in evaluation sets but fails to generalize to held-out sets. These agent-tuning works face severe formatting errors and are frequently stuck in the same mistake for a long while. We analyze that the poor generalization ability comes from overfitting to several manual agent environments and a lack of adaptation to new situations. They struggle with the wrong action steps and can not learn from the experience but just memorize existing observation-action relations. Inspired by the insight, we propose a novel AgentRefine framework for agent-tuning. The core idea is to enable the model to learn to correct its mistakes via observation in the trajectory. Specifically, we propose an agent synthesis framework to encompass a diverse array of environments and tasks and prompt a strong LLM to refine its error action according to the environment feedback. AgentRefine significantly outperforms state-of-the-art agent-tuning work in terms of generalization ability on diverse agent tasks. It also has better robustness facing perturbation and can generate diversified thought in inference. Our findings establish the correlation between agent generalization and self-refinement and provide a new paradigm for future research.</description>

      <title>Proposing Hierarchical Goal-Conditioned Policy Planning in Multi-Goal Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Humanoid robots must master numerous tasks with sparse rewards, posing a challenge for reinforcement learning (RL). We propose a method combining RL and automated planning to address this. Our approach uses short goal-conditioned policies (GCPs) organized hierarchically, with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) planning using high-level actions (HLAs). Instead of primitive actions, the planning process generates HLAs. A single plan-tree, maintained during the agent's lifetime, holds knowledge about goal achievement. This hierarchy enhances sample efficiency and speeds up reasoning by reusing HLAs and anticipating future actions. Our Hierarchical Goal-Conditioned Policy Planning (HGCPP) framework uniquely integrates GCPs, MCTS, and hierarchical RL, potentially improving exploration and planning in complex tasks.</description>

      <title>SDPO: Segment-Level Direct Preference Optimization for Social Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social agents powered by large language models (LLMs) can simulate human social behaviors but fall short in handling complex goal-oriented social dialogues. Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has proven effective in aligning LLM behavior with human preferences across a variety of agent tasks. Existing DPO-based approaches for multi-turn interactions are divided into turn-level and session-level methods. The turn-level method is overly fine-grained, focusing exclusively on individual turns, while session-level methods are too coarse-grained, often introducing training noise. To address these limitations, we propose Segment-Level Direct Preference Optimization (SDPO), which focuses on specific key segments within interactions to optimize multi-turn agent behavior while minimizing training noise. Evaluations on the SOTOPIA benchmark demonstrate that SDPO-tuned agents consistently outperform both existing DPO-based methods and proprietary LLMs like GPT-4o, underscoring SDPO's potential to advance the social intelligence of LLM-based agents. We release our code and data at https://github.com/AlibabaResearch/DAMO-ConvAI/tree/main/SDPO.</description>

      <title>ASKCOS: an open source software suite for synthesis planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advancement of machine learning and the availability of large-scale reaction datasets have accelerated the development of data-driven models for computer-aided synthesis planning (CASP) in the past decade. Here, we detail the newest version of ASKCOS, an open source software suite for synthesis planning that makes available several research advances in a freely available, practical tool. Four one-step retrosynthesis models form the basis of both interactive planning and automatic planning modes. Retrosynthetic planning is complemented by other modules for feasibility assessment and pathway evaluation, including reaction condition recommendation, reaction outcome prediction, and auxiliary capabilities such as solubility prediction and quantum mechanical descriptor prediction. ASKCOS has assisted hundreds of medicinal, synthetic, and process chemists in their day-to-day tasks, complementing expert decision making. It is our belief that CASP tools like ASKCOS are an important part of modern chemistry research, and that they offer ever-increasing utility and accessibility.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: General Purpose AI - such as Large Language Models (LLMs) - have seen rapid deployment in a wide range of use cases. Most surprisingly, they have have made their way from plain language models, to chat-bots, all the way to an almost ``operating system''-like status that can control decisions and logic of an application. Tool-use, Microsoft co-pilot/office integration, and OpenAIs Altera are just a few examples of increased autonomy, data access, and execution capabilities. These methods come with a range of cybersecurity challenges. We highlight some of the work we have done in terms of evaluation as well as outline future opportunities and challenges.</description>

      <title>Explanatory Debiasing: Involving Domain Experts in the Data Generation Process to Mitigate Representation Bias in AI Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Representation bias is one of the most common types of biases in artificial intelligence (AI) systems, causing AI models to perform poorly on underrepresented data segments. Although AI practitioners use various methods to reduce representation bias, their effectiveness is often constrained by insufficient domain knowledge in the debiasing process. To address this gap, this paper introduces a set of generic design guidelines for effectively involving domain experts in representation debiasing. We instantiated our proposed guidelines in a healthcare-focused application and evaluated them through a comprehensive mixed-methods user study with 35 healthcare experts. Our findings show that involving domain experts can reduce representation bias without compromising model accuracy. Based on our findings, we also offer recommendations for developers to build robust debiasing systems guided by our generic design guidelines, ensuring more effective inclusion of domain experts in the debiasing process.</description>

      <title>LS-GAN: Human Motion Synthesis with Latent-space GANs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human motion synthesis conditioned on textual input has gained significant attention in recent years due to its potential applications in various domains such as gaming, film production, and virtual reality. Conditioned Motion synthesis takes a text input and outputs a 3D motion corresponding to the text. While previous works have explored motion synthesis using raw motion data and latent space representations with diffusion models, these approaches often suffer from high training and inference times. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework that utilizes Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in the latent space to enable faster training and inference while achieving results comparable to those of the state-of-the-art diffusion methods. We perform experiments on the HumanML3D, HumanAct12 benchmarks and demonstrate that a remarkably simple GAN in the latent space achieves a FID of 0.482 with more than 91% in FLOPs reduction compared to latent diffusion model. Our work opens up new possibilities for efficient and high-quality motion synthesis using latent space GANs.</description>

      <title>Human-AI Teaming Using Large Language Models: Boosting Brain-Computer Interfacing (BCI) and Brain Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, there is an increasing interest in using artificial intelligence (AI) to automate aspects of the research process, or even autonomously conduct the full research cycle from idea generation, over data analysis, to composing and evaluation of scientific manuscripts. Examples of working AI scientist systems have been demonstrated for computer science tasks and running molecular biology labs. While some approaches aim for full autonomy of the scientific AI, others rather aim for leveraging human-AI teaming. Here, we address how to adapt such approaches for boosting Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) development, as well as brain research resp. neuroscience at large. We argue that at this time, a strong emphasis on human-AI teaming, in contrast to fully autonomous AI BCI researcher will be the most promising way forward. We introduce the collaborative workspaces concept for human-AI teaming based on a set of Janusian design principles, looking both ways, to the human as well as to the AI side. Based on these principles, we present ChatBCI, a Python-based toolbox for enabling human-AI collaboration based on interaction with Large Language Models (LLMs), designed for BCI research and development projects. We show how ChatBCI was successfully used in a concrete BCI project on advancing motor imagery decoding from EEG signals. Our approach can be straightforwardly extended to broad neurotechnological and neuroscientific topics, and may by design facilitate human expert knowledge transfer to scientific AI systems in general.</description>

The Infectious Disease Ontology (IDO) and its extensions, such as the Coronavirus Infectious Disease Ontology (CIDO), are essential for organizing and disseminating information related to infectious diseases. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the need for updating IDO and its virus-specific extensions. There is an additional need to update IDO extensions specific to bacteria, fungus, and parasite infectious diseases. We adopt the "hub and spoke" methodology to generate pathogen-specific extensions of IDO: Virus Infectious Disease Ontology (VIDO), Bacteria Infectious Disease Ontology (BIDO), Mycosis Infectious Disease Ontology (MIDO), and Parasite Infectious Disease Ontology (PIDO). The creation of pathogen-specific reference ontologies advances modularization and reusability of infectious disease data within the IDO ecosystem. Future work will focus on further refining these ontologies, creating new extensions, and developing application ontologies based on them, in line with ongoing efforts to standardize biological and biomedical terminologies for improved data sharing and analysis.</description>

      <title>Reinforcing Thinking through Reasoning-Enhanced Reward Models</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit great potential in complex multi-step reasoning through inference-time thinking but still struggle with deciding when to stop thinking due to limited self-awareness about their knowledge boundaries. While human preference alignment has shown extraordinary opportunities, expensive labeling challenges adherence to scaling law. Language model self-critique, as an alternative to using human-labeled reasoning data, is questioned with its inherited biases. This work addresses these challenges by distilling the LLM's own reasoning processes into synthetic behavioral data, eliminating the need for manual labeling of intermediate steps. Building on this concept, we propose Distillation-Reinforcement-Reasoning (DRR), a three-step framework that leverages the LLM's inherent behaviors as external feedback by first generating behavioral data using the Reasoner (LLM) to reflect its reasoning capabilities, then training a lightweight discriminative reward model (DM) on behavioral data, and finally deploying the DM at inference time to assist the Reasoner's decision-making. Experiments on multiple benchmarks show that the DRR framework outperforms self-critique approaches without relying on additional complex data annotation. Benefiting from lightweight design, ease of replication, and adaptability, DRR is applicable to a wide range of LLM-centric tasks.</description>

      <title>GAN-TAT: A Novel Framework Using Protein Interaction Networks in Druggable Gene Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identifying druggable genes is essential for developing effective pharmaceuticals. With the availability of extensive, high-quality data, computational methods have become a significant asset. Protein Interaction Network (PIN) is valuable but challenging to implement due to its high dimensionality and sparsity. Previous methods relied on indirect integration, leading to resolution loss. This study proposes GAN-TAT, a framework utilizing an advanced graph embedding technology, ImGAGN, to directly integrate PIN for druggable gene inference work. Tested on three Pharos datasets, GAN-TAT achieved the highest AUC-ROC score of 0.951 on Tclin. Further evaluation shows that GAN-TAT's predictions are supported by clinical evidence, highlighting its potential practical applications in pharmacogenomics. This research represents a methodological attempt with the direct utilization of PIN, expanding potential new solutions for developing drug targets. The source code of GAN-TAT is available at (https://github.com/george-yuanji-wang/GAN-TAT).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Host-response-based diagnostics can improve the accuracy of diagnosing bacterial and viral infections, thereby reducing inappropriate antibiotic prescriptions. However, the existing cohorts with limited sample size and coarse infections types are unable to support the exploration of an accurate and generalizable diagnostic model. Here, we curate the largest infection host-response transcriptome data, including 11,247 samples across 89 blood transcriptome datasets from 13 countries and 21 platforms. We build a diagnostic model for pathogen prediction starting from a pan-infection model as foundation (AUC = 0.97) based on the pan-infection dataset. Then, we utilize knowledge distillation to efficiently transfer the insights from this "teacher" model to four lightweight pathogen "student" models, i.e., staphylococcal infection (AUC = 0.99), streptococcal infection (AUC = 0.94), HIV infection (AUC = 0.93), and RSV infection (AUC = 0.94), as well as a sepsis "student" model (AUC = 0.99). The proposed knowledge distillation framework not only facilitates the diagnosis of pathogens using pan-infection data, but also enables an across-disease study from pan-infection to sepsis. Moreover, the framework enables high-degree lightweight design of diagnostic models, which is expected to be adaptively deployed in clinical settings.</description>

      <title>Goal Recognition using Actor-Critic Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01463v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Goal Recognition aims to infer an agent's goal from a sequence of observations. Existing approaches often rely on manually engineered domains and discrete representations. Deep Recognition using Actor-Critic Optimization (DRACO) is a novel approach based on deep reinforcement learning that overcomes these limitations by providing two key contributions. First, it is the first goal recognition algorithm that learns a set of policy networks from unstructured data and uses them for inference. Second, DRACO introduces new metrics for assessing goal hypotheses through continuous policy representations. DRACO achieves state-of-the-art performance for goal recognition in discrete settings while not using the structured inputs used by existing approaches. Moreover, it outperforms these approaches in more challenging, continuous settings at substantially reduced costs in both computing and memory. Together, these results showcase the robustness of the new algorithm, bridging traditional goal recognition and deep reinforcement learning.</description>

      <title>Balance-aware Sequence Sampling Makes Multi-modal Learning Better</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To address the modality imbalance caused by data heterogeneity, existing multi-modal learning (MML) approaches primarily focus on balancing this difference from the perspective of optimization objectives. However, almost all existing methods ignore the impact of sample sequences, i.e., an inappropriate training order tends to trigger learning bias in the model, further exacerbating modality imbalance. In this paper, we propose Balance-aware Sequence Sampling (BSS) to enhance the robustness of MML. Specifically, we first define a multi-perspective measurer to evaluate the balance degree of each sample. Via the evaluation, we employ a heuristic scheduler based on curriculum learning (CL) that incrementally provides training subsets, progressing from balanced to imbalanced samples to rebalance MML. Moreover, considering that sample balance may evolve as the model capability increases, we propose a learning-based probabilistic sampling method to dynamically update the training sequences at the epoch level, further improving MML performance. Extensive experiments on widely used datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method compared with state-of-the-art (SOTA) MML approaches.</description>

      <title>Augmented Contrastive Clustering with Uncertainty-Aware Prototyping for Time Series Test Time Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Test-time adaptation aims to adapt pre-trained deep neural networks using solely online unlabelled test data during inference. Although TTA has shown promise in visual applications, its potential in time series contexts remains largely unexplored. Existing TTA methods, originally designed for visual tasks, may not effectively handle the complex temporal dynamics of real-world time series data, resulting in suboptimal adaptation performance. To address this gap, we propose Augmented Contrastive Clustering with Uncertainty-aware Prototyping (ACCUP), a straightforward yet effective TTA method for time series data. Initially, our approach employs augmentation ensemble on the time series data to capture diverse temporal information and variations, incorporating uncertainty-aware prototypes to distill essential characteristics. Additionally, we introduce an entropy comparison scheme to selectively acquire more confident predictions, enhancing the reliability of pseudo labels. Furthermore, we utilize augmented contrastive clustering to enhance feature discriminability and mitigate error accumulation from noisy pseudo labels, promoting cohesive clustering within the same class while facilitating clear separation between different classes. Extensive experiments conducted on three real-world time series datasets and an additional visual dataset demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization potential of the proposed method, advancing the underexplored realm of TTA for time series data.</description>

      <title>Unraveling Indirect In-Context Learning Using Influence Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work introduces a novel paradigm for generalized In-Context Learning (ICL), termed Indirect In-Context Learning. In Indirect ICL, we explore demonstration selection strategies tailored for two distinct real-world scenarios: Mixture of Tasks and Noisy Demonstrations. We systematically evaluate the effectiveness of Influence Functions (IFs) as a selection tool for these settings, highlighting the potential for IFs to better capture the informativeness of examples within the demonstration pool. For the Mixture of Tasks setting, demonstrations are drawn from 28 diverse tasks, including MMLU, BigBench, StrategyQA, and CommonsenseQA. We demonstrate that combining BertScore-Recall (BSR) with an IF surrogate model can significantly improve performance, leading to average absolute accuracy gains of 0.37\% and 1.45\% for 3-shot and 5-shot setups when compared to traditional ICL metrics. In the Noisy Demonstrations setting, we examine scenarios where demonstrations might be mislabeled. Our experiments show that reweighting traditional ICL selectors (BSR and Cosine Similarity) with IF-based selectors boosts accuracy by an average of 2.90\% for Cosine Similarity and 2.94\% for BSR on noisy GLUE benchmarks. In sum, we propose a robust framework for demonstration selection that generalizes beyond traditional ICL, offering valuable insights into the role of IFs for Indirect ICL.</description>

      <title>A Survey of Deep Learning Methods in Protein Bioinformatics and its Impact on Protein Design</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Proteins are sequences of amino acids that serve as the basic building blocks of living organisms. Despite rapidly growing databases documenting structural and functional information for various protein sequences, our understanding of proteins remains limited because of the large possible sequence space and the complex inter- and intra-molecular forces. Deep learning, which is characterized by its ability to learn relevant features directly from large datasets, has demonstrated remarkable performance in fields such as computer vision and natural language processing. It has also been increasingly applied in recent years to the data-rich domain of protein sequences with great success, most notably with Alphafold2's breakout performance in the protein structure prediction. The performance improvements achieved by deep learning unlocks new possibilities in the field of protein bioinformatics, including protein design, one of the most difficult but useful tasks. In this paper, we broadly categorize problems in protein bioinformatics into three main categories: 1) structural prediction, 2) functional prediction, and 3) protein design, and review the progress achieved from using deep learning methodologies in each of them. We expand on the main challenges of the protein design problem and highlight how advances in structural and functional prediction have directly contributed to design tasks. Finally, we conclude by identifying important topics and future research directions.</description>

      <title>Drift2Matrix: Kernel-Induced Self Representation for Concept Drift Adaptation in Co-evolving Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the realm of time series analysis, tackling the phenomenon of concept drift poses a significant challenge. Concept drift -- characterized by the evolving statistical properties of time series data, affects the reliability and accuracy of conventional analysis models. This is particularly evident in co-evolving scenarios where interactions among variables are crucial. This paper presents Drift2Matrix, a novel framework that leverages kernel-induced self-representation for adaptive responses to concept drift in time series. Drift2Matrix employs a kernel-based learning mechanism to generate a representation matrix, encapsulating the inherent dynamics of co-evolving time series. This matrix serves as a key tool for identification and adaptation to concept drift by observing its temporal variations. Furthermore, Drift2Matrix effectively identifies prevailing patterns and offers insights into emerging trends through pattern evolution analysis. Our empirical evaluation of Drift2Matrix across various datasets demonstrates its effectiveness in handling the complexities of concept drift. This approach introduces a novel perspective in the theoretical domain of co-evolving time series analysis, enhancing adaptability and accuracy in the face of dynamic data environments.</description>

      <title>ORACLE: A Real-Time, Hierarchical, Deep-Learning Photometric Classifier for the LSST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present ORACLE, the first hierarchical deep-learning model for real-time, context-aware classification of transient and variable astrophysical phenomena. ORACLE is a recurrent neural network with Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs), and has been trained using a custom hierarchical cross-entropy loss function to provide high-confidence classifications along an observationally-driven taxonomy with as little as a single photometric observation. Contextual information for each object, including host galaxy photometric redshift, offset, ellipticity and brightness, is concatenated to the light curve embedding and used to make a final prediction. Training on $\sim$0.5M events from the Extended LSST Astronomical Time-Series Classification Challenge, we achieve a top-level (Transient vs Variable) macro-averaged precision of 0.96 using only 1 day of photometric observations after the first detection in addition to contextual information, for each event; this increases to $&gt;$0.99 once 64 days of the light curve has been obtained, and 0.83 at 1024 days after first detection for 19-way classification (including supernova sub-types, active galactic nuclei, variable stars, microlensing events, and kilonovae). We also compare ORACLE with other state-of-the-art classifiers and report comparable performance for the 19-way classification task, in addition to delivering accurate top-level classifications much earlier. The code and model weights used in this work are publicly available at our associated GitHub repository (https://github.com/uiucsn/ELAsTiCC-Classification).</description>

Abstract: This work analyzes transfer learning of the Variational Quantum Circuit (VQC). Our framework begins with a pretrained VQC configured in one domain and calculates the transition of 1-parameter unitary subgroups required for a new domain. A formalism is established to investigate the adaptability and capability of a VQC under the analysis of loss bounds. Our theory observes knowledge transfer in VQCs and provides a heuristic interpretation for the mechanism. An analytical fine-tuning method is derived to attain the optimal transition for adaptations of similar domains.</description>

      <title>AI-Enabled Operations at Fermi Complex: Multivariate Time Series Prediction for Outage Prediction and Diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Main Control Room of the Fermilab accelerator complex continuously gathers extensive time-series data from thousands of sensors monitoring the beam. However, unplanned events such as trips or voltage fluctuations often result in beam outages, causing operational downtime. This downtime not only consumes operator effort in diagnosing and addressing the issue but also leads to unnecessary energy consumption by idle machines awaiting beam restoration. The current threshold-based alarm system is reactive and faces challenges including frequent false alarms and inconsistent outage-cause labeling. To address these limitations, we propose an AI-enabled framework that leverages predictive analytics and automated labeling. Using data from $2,703$ Linac devices and $80$ operator-labeled outages, we evaluate state-of-the-art deep learning architectures, including recurrent, attention-based, and linear models, for beam outage prediction. Additionally, we assess a Random Forest-based labeling system for providing consistent, confidence-scored outage annotations. Our findings highlight the strengths and weaknesses of these architectures for beam outage prediction and identify critical gaps that must be addressed to fully harness AI for transitioning downtime handling from reactive to predictive, ultimately reducing downtime and improving decision-making in accelerator management.</description>

      <title>DiagrammaticLearning: A Graphical Language for Compositional Training Regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by deep learning regimes with multiple interacting yet distinct model components, we introduce learning diagrams, graphical depictions of training setups that capture parameterized learning as data rather than code. A learning diagram compiles to a unique loss function on which component models are trained. The result of training on this loss is a collection of models whose predictions ``agree" with one another. We show that a number of popular learning setups such as few-shot multi-task learning, knowledge distillation, and multi-modal learning can be depicted as learning diagrams. We further implement learning diagrams in a library that allows users to build diagrams of PyTorch and Flux.jl models. By implementing some classic machine learning use cases, we demonstrate how learning diagrams allow practitioners to build complicated models as compositions of smaller components, identify relationships between workflows, and manipulate models during or after training. Leveraging a category theoretic framework, we introduce a rigorous semantics for learning diagrams that puts such operations on a firm mathematical foundation.</description>

      <title>Improving Robustness Estimates in Natural Language Explainable AI though Synonymity Weighted Similarity Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) has seen a surge in recent interest with the proliferation of powerful but intractable black-box models. Moreover, XAI has come under fire for techniques that may not offer reliable explanations. As many of the methods in XAI are themselves models, adversarial examples have been prominent in the literature surrounding the effectiveness of XAI, with the objective of these examples being to alter the explanation while maintaining the output of the original model. For explanations in natural language, it is natural to use measures found in the domain of information retrieval for use with ranked lists to guide the adversarial XAI process. We show that the standard implementation of these measures are poorly suited for the comparison of explanations in adversarial XAI and amend them by using information that is discarded, the synonymity of perturbed words. This synonymity weighting produces more accurate estimates of the actual weakness of XAI methods to adversarial examples.</description>

      <title>A Metasemantic-Metapragmatic Framework for Taxonomizing Multimodal Communicative Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Drawing on contemporary pragmatist philosophy and linguistic theories on cognition, meaning, and communication, this paper presents a dynamic, metasemantic-metapragmatic taxonomy for grounding and conceptualizing human-like multimodal communicative alignment. The framework is rooted in contemporary developments of the three basic communicative capacities initially identified by American logician and pragmatist philosopher Charles Sanders Peirce: iconic (sensory and perceptual qualities), indexical (contextual and sociocultural associations), and rule-like (symbolic and intuitive reasoning). Expanding on these developments, I introduce the concept of indexical contextualization and propose the principle of "contextualization directionality" for characterizing the crucial metapragmatic capacity for maintaining, navigating, or transitioning between semantic and pragmatic modes of multimodal communication. I contend that current cognitive-social computational and engineering methodologies disproportionately emphasize the semantic/metasemantic domain, overlooking the pivotal role of metapragmatic indexicality in traversing the semantic-pragmatic spectrum of communication. The framework's broader implications for intentionality, identity, affect, and ethics in within-modal and cross-modal human-machine alignment are also discussed.</description>

      <title>In Search of a Lost Metric: Human Empowerment as a Pillar of Socially Conscious Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In social robot navigation, traditional metrics like proxemics and behavior naturalness emphasize human comfort and adherence to social norms but often fail to capture an agent's autonomy and adaptability in dynamic environments. This paper introduces human empowerment, an information-theoretic concept that measures a human's ability to influence their future states and observe those changes, as a complementary metric for evaluating social compliance. This metric reveals how robot navigation policies can indirectly impact human empowerment. We present a framework that integrates human empowerment into the evaluation of social performance in navigation tasks. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate that human empowerment as a metric not only aligns with intuitive social behavior, but also shows statistically significant differences across various robot navigation policies. These results provide a deeper understanding of how different policies affect social compliance, highlighting the potential of human empowerment as a complementary metric for future research in social navigation.</description>

      <title>BoxingGym: Benchmarking Progress in Automated Experimental Design and Model Discovery</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the world and explaining it with scientific theories is a central aspiration of artificial intelligence research. Proposing theories, designing experiments to test them, and then revising them based on data are fundamental to scientific discovery. Despite the significant promise of LLM-based scientific agents, no benchmarks systematically test LLM's ability to propose scientific models, collect experimental data, and revise them in light of new data. We introduce BoxingGym, a benchmark with 10 environments for systematically evaluating both experimental design (e.g. collecting data to test a scientific theory) and model discovery (e.g. proposing and revising scientific theories). To enable tractable and quantitative evaluation, we implement each environment as a generative probabilistic model with which a scientific agent can run interactive experiments. These probabilistic models are drawn from various real-world scientific domains ranging from psychology to ecology. To quantitatively evaluate a scientific agent's ability to collect informative experimental data, we compute the expected information gain (EIG), an information-theoretic quantity which measures how much an experiment reduces uncertainty about the parameters of a generative model. A good scientific theory is a concise and predictive explanation. Therefore, to quantitatively evaluate model discovery, we ask a scientific agent to explain their model and then assess whether this explanation enables another scientific agent to make reliable predictions about this environment. In addition to this explanation-based evaluation, we compute standard model evaluation metrics such as prediction errors. We find that current LLMs, such as GPT-4o, struggle with both experimental design and model discovery. We find that augmenting the LLM-based agent with an explicit statistical model does not reliably improve these results.</description>

      <title>Constructing and explaining machine learning models for chemistry: example of the exploration and design of boron-based Lewis acids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of machine learning (ML) into chemistry offers transformative potential in the design of molecules. However, the focus has often been on creating highly efficient predictive models, sometimes at the expense of interpretability. We leverage explainable AI techniques to explore the design of boron-based Lewis acids, which play a pivotal role in organic reactions. Using Fluoride Ion Affinity as a proxy for Lewis acidity, we developed interpretable ML models based on chemically meaningful descriptors, including ab initio features and substituent-based parameters. By constraining the chemical space to well-defined molecular scaffolds, we achieved highly accurate predictions, surpassing conventional black-box deep learning models in low-data regime. Interpretability analyses of the models unraveled the origin of Lewis acidity in these compounds and identified actionable levers to modulate it. This work bridges ML and chemist's way of thinking, demonstrating how explainable models can inspire molecular design and enhance scientific understanding of chemical reactivity.</description>

      <title>(WhyPHI) Fine-Tuning PHI-3 for Multiple-Choice Question Answering: Methodology, Results, and Challenges</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become essential tools across various domains due to their impressive capabilities in understanding and generating human-like text. The ability to accurately answer multiple-choice questions (MCQs) holds significant value in education, particularly in automated tutoring systems and assessment platforms. However, adapting LLMs to handle MCQ tasks effectively remains challenging due to the hallucinations and unclear prompts. This work explores the potential of Microsoft's PHI-3\cite{Abdin2024}, a compact yet efficient LLM, for MCQ answering. Our contributions include fine-tuning the model on the TruthfulQA dataset, designing optimized prompts to enhance model performance, and evaluating using perplexity and traditional metrics like accuracy and F1 score. Results show a remarkable improvement in PHI-3.5's MCQ handling post-fine-tuning, with perplexity decreasing from 4.68 to 2.27, and accuracy rising from 62\% to 90.8\%. This research underlines the importance of efficient models in adaptive learning systems and educational assessments, paving the way for broader integration into the classroom, particularly in fields like test preparation, student feedback, and personalized learning.</description>

      <title>PSYCHE: A Multi-faceted Patient Simulation Framework for Evaluation of Psychiatric Assessment Conversational Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have accelerated the development of conversational agents capable of generating human-like responses. Since psychiatric assessments typically involve complex conversational interactions between psychiatrists and patients, there is growing interest in developing LLM-based psychiatric assessment conversational agents (PACAs) that aim to simulate the role of psychiatrists in clinical evaluations. However, standardized methods for benchmarking the clinical appropriateness of PACAs' interaction with patients still remain underexplored. Here, we propose PSYCHE, a novel framework designed to enable the 1) clinically relevant, 2) ethically safe, 3) cost-efficient, and 4) quantitative evaluation of PACAs. This is achieved by simulating psychiatric patients based on a multi-faceted psychiatric construct that defines the simulated patients' profiles, histories, and behaviors, which PACAs are expected to assess. We validate the effectiveness of PSYCHE through a study with 10 board-certified psychiatrists, supported by an in-depth analysis of the simulated patient utterances.</description>

      <title>Few-shot Implicit Function Generation via Equivariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have emerged as a powerful framework for representing continuous signals. However, generating diverse INR weights remains challenging due to limited training data. We introduce Few-shot Implicit Function Generation, a new problem setup that aims to generate diverse yet functionally consistent INR weights from only a few examples. This is challenging because even for the same signal, the optimal INRs can vary significantly depending on their initializations. To tackle this, we propose EquiGen, a framework that can generate new INRs from limited data. The core idea is that functionally similar networks can be transformed into one another through weight permutations, forming an equivariance group. By projecting these weights into an equivariant latent space, we enable diverse generation within these groups, even with few examples. EquiGen implements this through an equivariant encoder trained via contrastive learning and smooth augmentation, an equivariance-guided diffusion process, and controlled perturbations in the equivariant subspace. Experiments on 2D image and 3D shape INR datasets demonstrate that our approach effectively generates diverse INR weights while preserving their functional properties in few-shot scenarios.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the volume of digital image data increases, the effectiveness of image classification intensifies. This study introduces a robust multi-label classification system designed to assign multiple labels to a single image, addressing the complexity of images that may be associated with multiple categories (ranging from 1 to 19, excluding 12). We propose a multi-modal classifier that merges advanced image recognition algorithms with Natural Language Processing (NLP) models, incorporating a fusion module to integrate these distinct modalities. The purpose of integrating textual data is to enhance the accuracy of label prediction by providing contextual understanding that visual analysis alone cannot fully capture. Our proposed classification model combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for image processing with NLP techniques for analyzing textual description (i.e., captions). This approach includes rigorous training and validation phases, with each model component verified and analyzed through ablation experiments. Preliminary results demonstrate the classifier's accuracy and efficiency, highlighting its potential as an automatic image-labeling system.</description>

      <title>Merging Context Clustering with Visual State Space Models for Medical Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Medical image segmentation demands the aggregation of global and local feature representations, posing a challenge for current methodologies in handling both long-range and short-range feature interactions. Recently, vision mamba (ViM) models have emerged as promising solutions for addressing model complexities by excelling in long-range feature iterations with linear complexity. However, existing ViM approaches overlook the importance of preserving short-range local dependencies by directly flattening spatial tokens and are constrained by fixed scanning patterns that limit the capture of dynamic spatial context information. To address these challenges, we introduce a simple yet effective method named context clustering ViM (CCViM), which incorporates a context clustering module within the existing ViM models to segment image tokens into distinct windows for adaptable local clustering. Our method effectively combines long-range and short-range feature interactions, thereby enhancing spatial contextual representations for medical image segmentation tasks. Extensive experimental evaluations on diverse public datasets, i.e., Kumar, CPM17, ISIC17, ISIC18, and Synapse demonstrate the superior performance of our method compared to current state-of-the-art methods. Our code can be found at https://github.com/zymissy/CCViM.</description>

      <title>ICPC: In-context Prompt Compression with Faster Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the recent success of Large Language Models (LLMs), it remains challenging to feed LLMs with long prompts due to the fixed size of LLM inputs. As a remedy, prompt compression becomes a promising solution by removing redundant tokens in the prompt. However, using LLM in the existing works requires additional computation resources and leads to memory overheads. To address it, we propose ICPC (In-context Prompt Compression), a novel and scalable prompt compression method that adaptively reduces the prompt length. The key idea of ICPC is to calculate the probability of each word appearing in the prompt using encoders and calculate information carried by each word through the information function, which effectively reduces the information loss during prompt compression and increases the speed of compression. Empirically, we demonstrate that ICPC can effectively compress long texts of different categories and thus achieve better performance and speed on different types of NLP tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models have emergent capabilities that come unexpectedly at scale, but we need a theoretical framework to explain why and how they emerge. We prove that language models are actually non-ergodic systems while providing a mathematical framework based on Stuart Kauffman's theory of the adjacent possible (TAP) to explain capability emergence. Our resource-constrained TAP equation demonstrates how architectural, training, and contextual constraints interact to shape model capabilities through phase transitions in semantic space. We prove through experiments with three different language models that capacities emerge through discrete transitions guided by constraint interactions and path-dependent exploration. This framework provides a theoretical basis for understanding emergence in language models and guides the development of architectures that can guide capability emergence.</description>

Abstract: The rapid integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare is revolutionizing medical diagnostics, personalized medicine, and operational efficiency. However, alongside these advancements, significant challenges arise concerning patient data privacy, ethical considerations, and regulatory compliance. This paper examines the dual impact of AI on healthcare, highlighting its transformative potential and the critical need for safeguarding sensitive health information. It explores the role of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) as a regulatory framework for ensuring data privacy and security, emphasizing the importance of robust safeguards and ethical standards in AI-driven healthcare. Through case studies, including AI applications in diabetic retinopathy, oncology, and the controversies surrounding data sharing, this study underscores the ethical and legal complexities of AI implementation. A balanced approach that fosters innovation while maintaining patient trust and privacy is imperative. The findings emphasize the importance of continuous education, transparency, and adherence to regulatory frameworks to harness AI's full potential responsibly and ethically in healthcare.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models have become a popular topic in deep visual understanding due to many promising real-world applications. However, hour-long video understanding, spanning over one hour and containing tens of thousands of visual frames, remains under-explored because of 1) challenging long-term video analyses, 2) inefficient large-model approaches, and 3) lack of large-scale benchmark datasets. Among them, in this paper, we focus on building a large-scale hour-long long video benchmark, HLV-1K, designed to evaluate long video understanding models. HLV-1K comprises 1009 hour-long videos with 14,847 high-quality question answering (QA) and multi-choice question asnwering (MCQA) pairs with time-aware query and diverse annotations, covering frame-level, within-event-level, cross-event-level, and long-term reasoning tasks. We evaluate our benchmark using existing state-of-the-art methods and demonstrate its value for testing deep long video understanding capabilities at different levels and for various tasks. This includes promoting future long video understanding tasks at a granular level, such as deep understanding of long live videos, meeting recordings, and movies.</description>

      <title>AVATAR: Adversarial Autoencoders with Autoregressive Refinement for Time Series Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data augmentation can significantly enhance the performance of machine learning tasks by addressing data scarcity and improving generalization. However, generating time series data presents unique challenges. A model must not only learn a probability distribution that reflects the real data distribution but also capture the conditional distribution at each time step to preserve the inherent temporal dependencies. To address these challenges, we introduce AVATAR, a framework that combines Adversarial Autoencoders (AAE) with Autoregressive Learning to achieve both objectives. Specifically, our technique integrates the autoencoder with a supervisor and introduces a novel supervised loss to assist the decoder in learning the temporal dynamics of time series data. Additionally, we propose another innovative loss function, termed distribution loss, to guide the encoder in more efficiently aligning the aggregated posterior of the autoencoder's latent representation with a prior Gaussian distribution. Furthermore, our framework employs a joint training mechanism to simultaneously train all networks using a combined loss, thereby fulfilling the dual objectives of time series generation. We evaluate our technique across a variety of time series datasets with diverse characteristics. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements in both the quality and practical utility of the generated data, as assessed by various qualitative and quantitative metrics.</description>

      <title>EAUWSeg: Eliminating annotation uncertainty in weakly-supervised medical image segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Weakly-supervised medical image segmentation is gaining traction as it requires only rough annotations rather than accurate pixel-to-pixel labels, thereby reducing the workload for specialists. Although some progress has been made, there is still a considerable performance gap between the label-efficient methods and fully-supervised one, which can be attributed to the uncertainty nature of these weak labels. To address this issue, we propose a novel weak annotation method coupled with its learning framework EAUWSeg to eliminate the annotation uncertainty. Specifically, we first propose the Bounded Polygon Annotation (BPAnno) by simply labeling two polygons for a lesion. Then, the tailored learning mechanism that explicitly treat bounded polygons as two separated annotations is proposed to learn invariant feature by providing adversarial supervision signal for model training. Subsequently, a confidence-auxiliary consistency learner incorporates with a classification-guided confidence generator is designed to provide reliable supervision signal for pixels in uncertain region by leveraging the feature presentation consistency across pixels within the same category as well as class-specific information encapsulated in bounded polygons annotation. Experimental results demonstrate that EAUWSeg outperforms existing weakly-supervised segmentation methods. Furthermore, compared to fully-supervised counterparts, the proposed method not only delivers superior performance but also costs much less annotation workload. This underscores the superiority and effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <title>BARTPredict: Empowering IoT Security with LLM-Driven Cyber Threat Prediction</title>

Abstract: The integration of Internet of Things (IoT) technology in various domains has led to operational advancements, but it has also introduced new vulnerabilities to cybersecurity threats, as evidenced by recent widespread cyberattacks on IoT devices. Intrusion detection systems are often reactive, triggered by specific patterns or anomalies observed within the network. To address this challenge, this work proposes a proactive approach to anticipate and preemptively mitigate malicious activities, aiming to prevent potential damage before it occurs. This paper proposes an innovative intrusion prediction framework empowered by Pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs). The framework incorporates two LLMs: a fine-tuned Bidirectional and AutoRegressive Transformers (BART) model for predicting network traffic and a fine-tuned Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model for evaluating the predicted traffic. By harnessing the bidirectional capabilities of BART the framework then identifies malicious packets among these predictions. Evaluated using the CICIoT2023 IoT attack dataset, our framework showcases a notable enhancement in predictive performance, attaining an impressive 98% overall accuracy, providing a powerful response to the cybersecurity challenges that confront IoT networks.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Few-shot Prompting for Machine Translation with Pre-trained Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, Large language models (LLMs) with in-context learning have demonstrated remarkable potential in handling neural machine translation. However, existing evidence shows that LLMs are prompt-sensitive and it is sub-optimal to apply the fixed prompt to any input for downstream machine translation tasks. To address this issue, we propose an adaptive few-shot prompting (AFSP) framework to automatically select suitable translation demonstrations for various source input sentences to further elicit the translation capability of an LLM for better machine translation. First, we build a translation demonstration retrieval module based on LLM's embedding to retrieve top-k semantic-similar translation demonstrations from aligned parallel translation corpus. Rather than using other embedding models for semantic demonstration retrieval, we build a hybrid demonstration retrieval module based on the embedding layer of the deployed LLM to build better input representation for retrieving more semantic-related translation demonstrations. Then, to ensure better semantic consistency between source inputs and target outputs, we force the deployed LLM itself to generate multiple output candidates in the target language with the help of translation demonstrations and rerank these candidates. Besides, to better evaluate the effectiveness of our AFSP framework on the latest language and extend the research boundary of neural machine translation, we construct a high-quality diplomatic Chinese-English parallel dataset that consists of 5,528 parallel Chinese-English sentences. Finally, extensive experiments on the proposed diplomatic Chinese-English parallel dataset and the United Nations Parallel Corpus (Chinese-English part) show the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed AFSP.</description>

      <title>VidFormer: A novel end-to-end framework fused by 3DCNN and Transformer for Video-based Remote Physiological Measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Remote physiological signal measurement based on facial videos, also known as remote photoplethysmography (rPPG), involves predicting changes in facial vascular blood flow from facial videos. While most deep learning-based methods have achieved good results, they often struggle to balance performance across small and large-scale datasets due to the inherent limitations of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformer. In this paper, we introduce VidFormer, a novel end-to-end framework that integrates 3-Dimension Convolutional Neural Network (3DCNN) and Transformer models for rPPG tasks. Initially, we conduct an analysis of the traditional skin reflection model and subsequently introduce an enhanced model for the reconstruction of rPPG signals. Based on this improved model, VidFormer utilizes 3DCNN and Transformer to extract local and global features from input data, respectively. To enhance the spatiotemporal feature extraction capabilities of VidFormer, we incorporate temporal-spatial attention mechanisms tailored for both 3DCNN and Transformer. Additionally, we design a module to facilitate information exchange and fusion between the 3DCNN and Transformer. Our evaluation on five publicly available datasets demonstrates that VidFormer outperforms current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Finally, we discuss the essential roles of each VidFormer module and examine the effects of ethnicity, makeup, and exercise on its performance.</description>

      <title>The Essence of Contextual Understanding in Theory of Mind: A Study on Question Answering with Story Characters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Theory-of-Mind (ToM) is a fundamental psychological capability that allows humans to understand and interpret the mental states of others. Humans infer others' thoughts by integrating causal cues and indirect clues from broad contextual information, often derived from past interactions. In other words, human ToM heavily relies on the understanding about the backgrounds and life stories of others. Unfortunately, this aspect is largely overlooked in existing benchmarks for evaluating machines' ToM capabilities, due to their usage of short narratives without global backgrounds. In this paper, we verify the importance of understanding long personal backgrounds in ToM and assess the performance of LLMs in such realistic evaluation scenarios. To achieve this, we introduce a novel benchmark, CharToM-QA, comprising 1,035 ToM questions based on characters from classic novels. Our human study reveals a significant disparity in performance: the same group of educated participants performs dramatically better when they have read the novels compared to when they have not. In parallel, our experiments on state-of-the-art LLMs, including the very recent o1 model, show that LLMs still perform notably worse than humans, despite that they have seen these stories during pre-training. This highlights the limitations of current LLMs in capturing the nuanced contextual information required for ToM reasoning.</description>

      <title>MoVE-KD: Knowledge Distillation for VLMs with Mixture of Visual Encoders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Visual encoders are fundamental components in vision-language models (VLMs), each showcasing unique strengths derived from various pre-trained visual foundation models. To leverage the various capabilities of these encoders, recent studies incorporate multiple encoders within a single VLM, leading to a considerable increase in computational cost. In this paper, we present Mixture-of-Visual-Encoder Knowledge Distillation (MoVE-KD), a novel framework that distills the unique proficiencies of multiple vision encoders into a single, efficient encoder model. Specifically, to mitigate conflicts and retain the unique characteristics of each teacher encoder, we employ low-rank adaptation (LoRA) and mixture-of-experts (MoEs) to selectively activate specialized knowledge based on input features, enhancing both adaptability and efficiency. To regularize the KD process and enhance performance, we propose an attention-based distillation strategy that adaptively weighs the different visual encoders and emphasizes valuable visual tokens, reducing the burden of replicating comprehensive but distinct features from multiple teachers. Comprehensive experiments on popular VLMs, such as LLaVA and LLaVA-NeXT, validate the effectiveness of our method. The code will be released.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper presents a preliminary analysis of an experiment conducted by Frank Bold, a Czech expert group, to explore user interactions with GPT-4 for addressing legal queries. Between May 3, 2023, and July 25, 2023, 1,252 users submitted 3,847 queries. Unlike studies that primarily focus on the accuracy, factuality, or hallucination tendencies of large language models (LLMs), our analysis focuses on the user query dimension of the interaction. Using GPT-4o for zero-shot classification, we categorized queries on (1) whether users provided factual information about their issue (29.95%) or not (70.05%), (2) whether they sought legal information (64.93%) or advice on the course of action (35.07\%), and (3) whether they imposed requirements to shape or control the model's answer (28.57%) or not (71.43%). We provide both quantitative and qualitative insight into user needs and contribute to a better understanding of user engagement with LLMs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Customer Identity and Access Management (CIAM) systems play a pivotal role in securing enterprise infrastructures. However, the complexity of implementing these systems requires careful architectural planning to ensure positive Return on Investment (RoI) and avoid costly delays. The proliferation of Active Persistent cyber threats, coupled with advancements in AI, cloud computing, and geographically distributed customer populations, necessitates a paradigm shift towards adaptive and zero-trust security frameworks. This paper introduces the Combined Hyper-Extensible Extremely-Secured Zero-Trust (CHEZ) CIAM-PAM architecture, designed specifically for large-scale enterprises. The CHEZ PL CIAM-PAM framework addresses critical security gaps by integrating federated identity management (private and public identities), password-less authentication, adaptive multi-factor authentication (MFA), microservice-based PEP (Policy Entitlement Point), multi-layer RBAC (Role Based Access Control) and multi-level trust systems. This future-proof design also includes end-to-end data encryption, and seamless integration with state-of-the-art AI-based threat detection systems, while ensuring compliance with stringent regulatory standards.</description>

      <title>Augmentation Matters: A Mix-Paste Method for X-Ray Prohibited Item Detection under Noisy Annotations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automatic X-ray prohibited item detection is vital for public safety. Existing deep learning-based methods all assume that the annotations of training X-ray images are correct. However, obtaining correct annotations is extremely hard if not impossible for large-scale X-ray images, where item overlapping is ubiquitous.As a result, X-ray images are easily contaminated with noisy annotations, leading to performance deterioration of existing methods.In this paper, we address the challenging problem of training a robust prohibited item detector under noisy annotations (including both category noise and bounding box noise) from a novel perspective of data augmentation, and propose an effective label-aware mixed patch paste augmentation method (Mix-Paste). Specifically, for each item patch, we mix several item patches with the same category label from different images and replace the original patch in the image with the mixed patch. In this way, the probability of containing the correct prohibited item within the generated image is increased. Meanwhile, the mixing process mimics item overlapping, enabling the model to learn the characteristics of X-ray images. Moreover, we design an item-based large-loss suppression (LLS) strategy to suppress the large losses corresponding to potentially positive predictions of additional items due to the mixing operation. We show the superiority of our method on X-ray datasets under noisy annotations. In addition, we evaluate our method on the noisy MS-COCO dataset to showcase its generalization ability. These results clearly indicate the great potential of data augmentation to handle noise annotations. The source code is released at https://github.com/wscds/Mix-Paste.</description>

      <title>How Toxic Can You Get? Search-based Toxicity Testing for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Language is a deep-rooted means of perpetration of stereotypes and discrimination. Large Language Models (LLMs), now a pervasive technology in our everyday lives, can cause extensive harm when prone to generating toxic responses. The standard way to address this issue is to align the LLM, which, however, dampens the issue without constituting a definitive solution. Therefore, testing LLM even after alignment efforts remains crucial for detecting any residual deviations with respect to ethical standards. We present EvoTox, an automated testing framework for LLMs' inclination to toxicity, providing a way to quantitatively assess how much LLMs can be pushed towards toxic responses even in the presence of alignment. The framework adopts an iterative evolution strategy that exploits the interplay between two LLMs, the System Under Test (SUT) and the Prompt Generator steering SUT responses toward higher toxicity. The toxicity level is assessed by an automated oracle based on an existing toxicity classifier. We conduct a quantitative and qualitative empirical evaluation using four state-of-the-art LLMs as evaluation subjects having increasing complexity (7-13 billion parameters). Our quantitative evaluation assesses the cost-effectiveness of four alternative versions of EvoTox against existing baseline methods, based on random search, curated datasets of toxic prompts, and adversarial attacks. Our qualitative assessment engages human evaluators to rate the fluency of the generated prompts and the perceived toxicity of the responses collected during the testing sessions. Results indicate that the effectiveness, in terms of detected toxicity level, is significantly higher than the selected baseline methods (effect size up to 1.0 against random search and up to 0.99 against adversarial attacks). Furthermore, EvoTox yields a limited cost overhead (from 22% to 35% on average).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Legal articles often include vague concepts to adapt to the ever-changing society. Providing detailed interpretations of these concepts is a critical task for legal practitioners, which requires meticulous and professional annotations by legal experts, admittedly time-consuming and expensive to collect at scale. In this paper, we introduce a novel retrieval-augmented generation framework, ATRI, for AuTomatically Retrieving relevant information from past judicial precedents and Interpreting vague legal concepts. We further propose a new benchmark, Legal Concept Entailment, to automate the evaluation of generated concept interpretations without expert involvement. Automatic evaluations indicate that our generated interpretations can effectively assist large language models (LLMs) in understanding vague legal concepts. Multi-faceted evaluations by legal experts indicate that the quality of our concept interpretations is comparable to those written by human experts. Our work has strong implications for leveraging LLMs to support legal practitioners in interpreting vague legal concepts and beyond.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Following an analysis of existing AI-related exchange-traded funds (ETFs), we reveal the selection criteria for determining which stocks qualify as AI-related are often opaque and rely on vague phrases and subjective judgments. This paper proposes a new, objective, data-driven approach using natural language processing (NLP) techniques to classify AI stocks by analyzing annual 10-K filings from 3,395 NASDAQ-listed firms between 2011 and 2023. This analysis quantifies each company's engagement with AI through binary indicators and weighted AI scores based on the frequency and context of AI-related terms. Using these metrics, we construct four AI stock indices-the Equally Weighted AI Index (AII), the Size-Weighted AI Index (SAII), and two Time-Discounted AI Indices (TAII05 and TAII5X)-offering different perspectives on AI investment. We validate our methodology through an event study on the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT, demonstrating that companies with higher AI engagement saw significantly greater positive abnormal returns, with analyses supporting the predictive power of our AI measures. Our indices perform on par with or surpass 14 existing AI-themed ETFs and the Nasdaq Composite Index in risk-return profiles, market responsiveness, and overall performance, achieving higher average daily returns and risk-adjusted metrics without increased volatility. These results suggest our NLP-based approach offers a reliable, market-responsive, and cost-effective alternative to existing AI-related ETF products. Our innovative methodology can also guide investors, asset managers, and policymakers in using corporate data to construct other thematic portfolios, contributing to a more transparent, data-driven, and competitive approach.</description>

      <title>Can Synthetic Data be Fair and Private? A Comparative Study of Synthetic Data Generation and Fairness Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing use of machine learning in learning analytics (LA) has raised significant concerns around algorithmic fairness and privacy. Synthetic data has emerged as a dual-purpose tool, enhancing privacy and improving fairness in LA models. However, prior research suggests an inverse relationship between fairness and privacy, making it challenging to optimize both. This study investigates which synthetic data generators can best balance privacy and fairness, and whether pre-processing fairness algorithms, typically applied to real datasets, are effective on synthetic data. Our results highlight that the DEbiasing CAusal Fairness (DECAF) algorithm achieves the best balance between privacy and fairness. However, DECAF suffers in utility, as reflected in its predictive accuracy. Notably, we found that applying pre-processing fairness algorithms to synthetic data improves fairness even more than when applied to real data. These findings suggest that combining synthetic data generation with fairness pre-processing offers a promising approach to creating fairer LA models.</description>

      <title>Creating Artificial Students that Never Existed: Leveraging Large Language Models and CTGANs for Synthetic Data Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we explore the growing potential of AI and deep learning technologies, particularly Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Large Language Models (LLMs), for generating synthetic tabular data. Access to quality students data is critical for advancing learning analytics, but privacy concerns and stricter data protection regulations worldwide limit their availability and usage. Synthetic data offers a promising alternative. We investigate whether synthetic data can be leveraged to create artificial students for serving learning analytics models. Using the popular GAN model CTGAN and three LLMs- GPT2, DistilGPT2, and DialoGPT, we generate synthetic tabular student data. Our results demonstrate the strong potential of these methods to produce high-quality synthetic datasets that resemble real students data. To validate our findings, we apply a comprehensive set of utility evaluation metrics to assess the statistical and predictive performance of the synthetic data and compare the different generator models used, specially the performance of LLMs. Our study aims to provide the learning analytics community with valuable insights into the use of synthetic data, laying the groundwork for expanding the field methodological toolbox with new innovative approaches for learning analytics data generation.</description>

      <title>BERT4MIMO: A Foundation Model using BERT Architecture for Massive MIMO Channel State Information Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Massive MIMO (Multiple-Input Multiple-Output) is an advanced wireless communication technology, using a large number of antennas to improve the overall performance of the communication system in terms of capacity, spectral, and energy efficiency. The performance of MIMO systems is highly dependent on the quality of channel state information (CSI). Predicting CSI is, therefore, essential for improving communication system performance, particularly in MIMO systems, since it represents key characteristics of a wireless channel, including propagation, fading, scattering, and path loss. This study proposes a foundation model inspired by BERT, called BERT4MIMO, which is specifically designed to process high-dimensional CSI data from massive MIMO systems. BERT4MIMO offers superior performance in reconstructing CSI under varying mobility scenarios and channel conditions through deep learning and attention mechanisms. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of BERT4MIMO in a variety of wireless environments.</description>

      <title>End-to-End Long Document Summarization using Gradient Caching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Training transformer-based encoder-decoder models for long document summarization poses a significant challenge due to the quadratic memory consumption during training. Several approaches have been proposed to extend the input length at test time, but training with these approaches is still difficult, requiring truncation of input documents and causing a mismatch between training and test conditions. In this work, we propose CachED (Gradient $\textbf{Cach}$ing for $\textbf{E}$ncoder-$\textbf{D}$ecoder models), an approach that enables end-to-end training of existing transformer-based encoder-decoder models, using the entire document without truncation. Specifically, we apply non-overlapping sliding windows to input documents, followed by fusion in decoder. During backpropagation, the gradients are cached at the decoder and are passed through the encoder in chunks by re-computing the hidden vectors, similar to gradient checkpointing. In the experiments on long document summarization, we extend BART to CachED BART, processing more than 500K tokens during training and achieving superior performance without using any additional parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01827v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a case study on how to process cooking recipes (and more generally, how-to instructions) in a way that makes it possible for a robot or artificial cooking assistant to support human chefs in the kitchen. Such AI assistants would be of great benefit to society, as they can help to sustain the autonomy of aging adults or people with a physical impairment, or they may reduce the stress in a professional kitchen. We propose a novel approach to computational recipe understanding that mimics the human sense-making process, which is narrative-based. Using an English recipe for almond crescent cookies as illustration, we show how recipes can be modelled as rich narrative structures by integrating various knowledge sources such as language processing, ontologies, and mental simulation. We show how such narrative structures can be used for (a) dealing with the challenges of recipe language, such as zero anaphora, (b) optimizing a robot's planning process, (c) measuring how well an AI system understands its current tasks, and (d) allowing recipe annotations to become language-independent.</description>

      <title>Auto-RT: Automatic Jailbreak Strategy Exploration for Red-Teaming Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automated red-teaming has become a crucial approach for uncovering vulnerabilities in large language models (LLMs). However, most existing methods focus on isolated safety flaws, limiting their ability to adapt to dynamic defenses and uncover complex vulnerabilities efficiently. To address this challenge, we propose Auto-RT, a reinforcement learning framework that automatically explores and optimizes complex attack strategies to effectively uncover security vulnerabilities through malicious queries. Specifically, we introduce two key mechanisms to reduce exploration complexity and improve strategy optimization: 1) Early-terminated Exploration, which accelerate exploration by focusing on high-potential attack strategies; and 2) Progressive Reward Tracking algorithm with intermediate downgrade models, which dynamically refine the search trajectory toward successful vulnerability exploitation. Extensive experiments across diverse LLMs demonstrate that, by significantly improving exploration efficiency and automatically optimizing attack strategies, Auto-RT detects a boarder range of vulnerabilities, achieving a faster detection speed and 16.63\% higher success rates compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>MoColl: Agent-Based Specific and General Model Collaboration for Image Captioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Image captioning is a critical task at the intersection of computer vision and natural language processing, with wide-ranging applications across various domains. For complex tasks such as diagnostic report generation, deep learning models require not only domain-specific image-caption datasets but also the incorporation of relevant general knowledge to provide contextual accuracy. Existing approaches exhibit inherent limitations: specialized models excel in capturing domain-specific details but lack generalization, while vision-language models (VLMs) built on large language models (LLMs) leverage general knowledge but struggle with domain-specific adaptation. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel agent-enhanced model collaboration framework, which we called \textbf{MoColl}, designed to effectively integrate domain-specific and general knowledge. Specifically, our approach is to decompose complex image captioning tasks into a series of interconnected question-answer subtasks. A trainable visual question answering (VQA) model is employed as a specialized tool to focus on domain-specific visual analysis, answering task-specific questions based on image content. Concurrently, an LLM-based agent with general knowledge formulates these questions and synthesizes the resulting question-answer pairs into coherent captions. Beyond its role in leveraging the VQA model, the agent further guides its training to enhance its domain-specific capabilities. Experimental results on radiology report generation validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, demonstrating significant improvements in the quality of generated reports.</description>

      <title>Practical machine learning is learning on small samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on limited observations, machine learning discerns a dependence which is expected to hold in the future. What makes it possible? Statistical learning theory imagines indefinitely increasing training sample to justify its approach. In reality, there is no infinite time or even infinite general population for learning. Here I argue that practical machine learning is based on an implicit assumption that underlying dependence is relatively ``smooth" : likely, there are no abrupt differences in feedback between cases with close data points. From this point of view learning shall involve selection of the hypothesis ``smoothly" approximating the training set. I formalize this as Practical learning paradigm. The paradigm includes terminology and rules for description of learners. Popular learners (local smoothing, k-NN, decision trees, Naive Bayes, SVM for classification and for regression) are shown here to be implementations of this paradigm.</description>

      <title>Multi-Agent Conversational Online Learning for Adaptive LLM Response Identification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The remarkable generative capability of large language models (LLMs) has sparked a growing interest in automatically generating responses for different applications. Given the dynamic nature of user preferences and the uncertainty of LLM response performance, it is crucial to design efficient online learning algorithms to identify optimal LLM responses (i.e., high-quality responses that also meet user preferences). Most existing online algorithms adopt a centralized approach and fail to leverage explicit user preferences for more efficient and personalized LLM response identification. In contrast, this paper introduces \textit{MACO} (\underline{M}ulti-\underline{A}gent \underline{C}onversational \underline{O}nline Learning for Adaptive LLM Response Identification): 1) The online LLM response identification process is accelerated by multiple local agents (such as smartphones), while enhancing data privacy; 2) A novel conversational mechanism is proposed to adaptively conduct conversations for soliciting user preferences (e.g., a preference for a humorous tone over a serious one in generated responses), so to minimize uncertainty in preference estimation. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that \cadi\ is near-optimal regarding cumulative regret. Additionally, \cadi\ offers reduced communication costs and computational complexity by eliminating the traditional, computing-intensive ``G-optimal design" found in previous works. Extensive experiments with the open LLM \textit{Llama}, coupled with two different embedding models from Google and OpenAI for text vector representation, demonstrate that \cadi\ significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art in online LLM response identification.</description>

      <title>LCFed: An Efficient Clustered Federated Learning Framework for Heterogeneous Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Clustered federated learning (CFL) addresses the performance challenges posed by data heterogeneity in federated learning (FL) by organizing edge devices with similar data distributions into clusters, enabling collaborative model training tailored to each group. However, existing CFL approaches strictly limit knowledge sharing to within clusters, lacking the integration of global knowledge with intra-cluster training, which leads to suboptimal performance. Moreover, traditional clustering methods incur significant computational overhead, especially as the number of edge devices increases. In this paper, we propose LCFed, an efficient CFL framework to combat these challenges. By leveraging model partitioning and adopting distinct aggregation strategies for each sub-model, LCFed effectively incorporates global knowledge into intra-cluster co-training, achieving optimal training performance. Additionally, LCFed customizes a computationally efficient model similarity measurement method based on low-rank models, enabling real-time cluster updates with minimal computational overhead. Extensive experiments show that LCFed outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks in both test accuracy and clustering computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Scenario-based Decision-making for Interactive Autonomous Driving Using Rational Criteria: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous vehicles (AVs) can significantly promote the advances in road transport mobility in terms of safety, reliability, and decarbonization. However, ensuring safety and efficiency in interactive during within dynamic and diverse environments is still a primary barrier to large-scale AV adoption. In recent years, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has emerged as an advanced AI-based approach, enabling AVs to learn decision-making strategies adaptively from data and interactions. DRL strategies are better suited than traditional rule-based methods for handling complex, dynamic, and unpredictable driving environments due to their adaptivity. However, varying driving scenarios present distinct challenges, such as avoiding obstacles on highways and reaching specific exits at intersections, requiring different scenario-specific decision-making algorithms. Many DRL algorithms have been proposed in interactive decision-making. However, a rationale review of these DRL algorithms across various scenarios is lacking. Therefore, a comprehensive evaluation is essential to assess these algorithms from multiple perspectives, including those of vehicle users and vehicle manufacturers. This survey reviews the application of DRL algorithms in autonomous driving across typical scenarios, summarizing road features and recent advancements. The scenarios include highways, on-ramp merging, roundabouts, and unsignalized intersections. Furthermore, DRL-based algorithms are evaluated based on five rationale criteria: driving safety, driving efficiency, training efficiency, unselfishness, and interpretability (DDTUI). Each criterion of DDTUI is specifically analyzed in relation to the reviewed algorithms. Finally, the challenges for future DRL-based decision-making algorithms are summarized.</description>

Abstract: We introduce QuArch, a dataset of 1500 human-validated question-answer pairs designed to evaluate and enhance language models' understanding of computer architecture. The dataset covers areas including processor design, memory systems, and performance optimization. Our analysis highlights a significant performance gap: the best closed-source model achieves 84% accuracy, while the top small open-source model reaches 72%. We observe notable struggles in memory systems, interconnection networks, and benchmarking. Fine-tuning with QuArch improves small model accuracy by up to 8%, establishing a foundation for advancing AI-driven computer architecture research.

      <title>Virgo: A Preliminary Exploration on Reproducing o1-like MLLM</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, slow-thinking reasoning systems, built upon large language models (LLMs), have garnered widespread attention by scaling the thinking time during inference. There is also growing interest in adapting this capability to multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Given that MLLMs handle more complex data semantics across different modalities, it is intuitively more challenging to implement multimodal slow-thinking systems.
  To address this issue, in this paper, we explore a straightforward approach by fine-tuning a capable MLLM with a small amount of textual long-form thought data, resulting in a multimodal slow-thinking system, Virgo (Visual reasoning with long thought). We find that these long-form reasoning processes, expressed in natural language, can be effectively transferred to MLLMs. Moreover, it seems that such textual reasoning data can be even more effective than visual reasoning data in eliciting the slow-thinking capacities of MLLMs. While this work is preliminary, it demonstrates that slow-thinking capacities are fundamentally associated with the language model component, which can be transferred across modalities or domains. This finding can be leveraged to guide the development of more powerful slow-thinking reasoning systems. We release our resources at https://github.com/RUCAIBox/Virgo.</description>

      <title>Mingling with the Good to Backdoor Federated Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a decentralized machine learning technique that allows multiple entities to jointly train a model while preserving dataset privacy. However, its distributed nature has raised various security concerns, which have been addressed by increasingly sophisticated defenses. These protections utilize a range of data sources and metrics to, for example, filter out malicious model updates, ensuring that the impact of attacks is minimized or eliminated.
  This paper explores the feasibility of designing a generic attack method capable of installing backdoors in FL while evading a diverse array of defenses. Specifically, we focus on an attacker strategy called MIGO, which aims to produce model updates that subtly blend with legitimate ones. The resulting effect is a gradual integration of a backdoor into the global model, often ensuring its persistence long after the attack concludes, while generating enough ambiguity to hinder the effectiveness of defenses.
  MIGO was employed to implant three types of backdoors across five datasets and different model architectures. The results demonstrate the significant threat posed by these backdoors, as MIGO consistently achieved exceptionally high backdoor accuracy (exceeding 90%) while maintaining the utility of the main task. Moreover, MIGO exhibited strong evasion capabilities against ten defenses, including several state-of-the-art methods. When compared to four other attack strategies, MIGO consistently outperformed them across most configurations. Notably, even in extreme scenarios where the attacker controls just 0.1% of the clients, the results indicate that successful backdoor insertion is possible if the attacker can persist for a sufficient number of rounds.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Hallucination for Large Vision Language Model by Inter-Modality Correlation Calibration Decoding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in visual-language understanding for downstream multi-modal tasks. Despite their success, LVLMs still suffer from generating hallucinations in complex generation tasks, leading to inconsistencies between visual inputs and generated content. To address this issue, some approaches have introduced inference-time interventions, such as contrastive decoding and attention rectification, to reduce overreliance on language priors. However, these approaches overlook hallucinations stemming from spurious inter-modality correlations. In this paper, we propose an Inter-Modality Correlation Calibration Decoding (IMCCD) method to mitigate hallucinations in LVLMs in a training-free manner. In this method, we design a Cross-Modal Value-Enhanced Decoding(CMVED) module to alleviate hallucination by a novel contrastive decoding mechanism. During the estimation of distorted distribution, CMVED masks the value vectors associated with significant cross-modal attention weights, which address both uni-modality overreliance and misleading inter-modality correlations. Additionally, a Content-Driven Attention Refinement(CDAR) module refines cross-modal attention weights, guiding LVLMs to focus on important visual content. Experimental results on diverse hallucination benchmarks validate the superiority of our method over existing state-of-the-art techniques in reducing hallucinations in LVLM text generation. Our code will be available at https://github.com/lijm48/IMCCD.</description>

      <title>Cold-Start Recommendation towards the Era of Large Language Models (LLMs): A Comprehensive Survey and Roadmap</title>

Abstract: Cold-start problem is one of the long-standing challenges in recommender systems, focusing on accurately modeling new or interaction-limited users or items to provide better recommendations. Due to the diversification of internet platforms and the exponential growth of users and items, the importance of cold-start recommendation (CSR) is becoming increasingly evident. At the same time, large language models (LLMs) have achieved tremendous success and possess strong capabilities in modeling user and item information, providing new potential for cold-start recommendations. However, the research community on CSR still lacks a comprehensive review and reflection in this field. Based on this, in this paper, we stand in the context of the era of large language models and provide a comprehensive review and discussion on the roadmap, related literature, and future directions of CSR. Specifically, we have conducted an exploration of the development path of how existing CSR utilizes information, from content features, graph relations, and domain information, to the world knowledge possessed by large language models, aiming to provide new insights for both the research and industrial communities on CSR. Related resources of cold-start recommendations are collected and continuously updated for the community in https://github.com/YuanchenBei/Awesome-Cold-Start-Recommendation.</description>

      <title>MADGEN -- Mass-Spec attends to De Novo Molecular generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The annotation (assigning structural chemical identities) of MS/MS spectra remains a significant challenge due to the enormous molecular diversity in biological samples and the limited scope of reference databases. Currently, the vast majority of spectral measurements remain in the "dark chemical space" without structural annotations. To improve annotation, we propose MADGEN (Mass-spec Attends to De Novo Molecular GENeration), a scaffold-based method for de novo molecular structure generation guided by mass spectrometry data. MADGEN operates in two stages: scaffold retrieval and spectra-conditioned molecular generation starting with the scaffold. In the first stage, given an MS/MS spectrum, we formulate scaffold retrieval as a ranking problem and employ contrastive learning to align mass spectra with candidate molecular scaffolds. In the second stage, starting from the retrieved scaffold, we employ the MS/MS spectrum to guide an attention-based generative model to generate the final molecule. Our approach constrains the molecular generation search space, reducing its complexity and improving generation accuracy. We evaluate MADGEN on three datasets (NIST23, CANOPUS, and MassSpecGym) and evaluate MADGEN's performance with a predictive scaffold retriever and with an oracle retriever. We demonstrate the effectiveness of using attention to integrate spectral information throughout the generation process to achieve strong results with the oracle retriever.</description>

      <title>MixGCN: Scalable GCN Training by Mixture of Parallelism and Mixture of Accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) have demonstrated superiority in graph-based learning tasks. However, training GCNs on full graphs is particularly challenging, due to the following two challenges: (1) the associated feature tensors can easily explode the memory and block the communication bandwidth of modern accelerators, and (2) the computation workflow in training GCNs alternates between sparse and dense matrix operations, complicating the efficient utilization of computational resources. Existing solutions for scalable distributed full-graph GCN training mostly adopt partition parallelism, which is unsatisfactory as they only partially address the first challenge while incurring scaled-out communication volume. To this end, we propose MixGCN aiming to simultaneously address both the aforementioned challenges towards GCN training. To tackle the first challenge, MixGCN integrates mixture of parallelism. Both theoretical and empirical analysis verify its constant communication volumes and enhanced balanced workload; For handling the second challenge, we consider mixture of accelerators (i.e., sparse and dense accelerators) with a dedicated accelerator for GCN training and a fine-grain pipeline. Extensive experiments show that MixGCN achieves boosted training efficiency and scalability.</description>

      <title>Seeing the Unseen: Learning Basis Confounder Representations for Robust Traffic Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12472v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traffic prediction is essential for intelligent transportation systems and urban computing. It aims to establish a relationship between historical traffic data X and future traffic states Y by employing various statistical or deep learning methods. However, the relations of X -&gt; Y are often influenced by external confounders that simultaneously affect both X and Y , such as weather, accidents, and holidays. Existing deep-learning traffic prediction models adopt the classic front-door and back-door adjustments to address the confounder issue. However, these methods have limitations in addressing continuous or undefined confounders, as they depend on predefined discrete values that are often impractical in complex, real-world scenarios. To overcome this challenge, we propose the Spatial-Temporal sElf-superVised confoundEr learning (STEVE) model. This model introduces a basis vector approach, creating a base confounder bank to represent any confounder as a linear combination of a group of basis vectors. It also incorporates self-supervised auxiliary tasks to enhance the expressive power of the base confounder bank. Afterward, a confounder-irrelevant relation decoupling module is adopted to separate the confounder effects from direct X -&gt; Y relations. Extensive experiments across four large-scale datasets validate our model's superior performance in handling spatial and temporal distribution shifts and underscore its adaptability to unseen confounders. Our model implementation is available at https://github.com/bigscity/STEVE_CODE.</description>

      <title>Specification Overfitting in Artificial Intelligence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08425v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) approaches are often criticized for their inherent bias and for their lack of control, accountability, and transparency. Consequently, regulatory bodies struggle with containing this technology's potential negative side effects. High-level requirements such as fairness and robustness need to be formalized into concrete specification metrics, imperfect proxies that capture isolated aspects of the underlying requirements. Given possible trade-offs between different metrics and their vulnerability to over-optimization, integrating specification metrics in system development processes is not trivial. This paper defines specification overfitting, a scenario where systems focus excessively on specified metrics to the detriment of high-level requirements and task performance. We present an extensive literature survey to categorize how researchers propose, measure, and optimize specification metrics in several AI fields (e.g., natural language processing, computer vision, reinforcement learning). Using a keyword-based search on papers from major AI conferences and journals between 2018 and mid-2023, we identify and analyze 74 papers that propose or optimize specification metrics. We find that although most papers implicitly address specification overfitting (e.g., by reporting more than one specification metric), they rarely discuss which role specification metrics should play in system development or explicitly define the scope and assumptions behind metric formulations.</description>

Abstract: Structural pruning has emerged as a promising approach for producing more efficient models. Nevertheless, the community suffers from a lack of standardized benchmarks and metrics, leaving the progress in this area not fully comprehended.To fill this gap, we present the first comprehensive benchmark, termed PruningBench, for structural pruning. PruningBench showcases the following three characteristics: 1) PruningBench employs a unified and consistent framework for evaluating the effectiveness of diverse structural pruning techniques; 2) PruningBench systematically evaluates 16 existing pruning methods, encompassing a wide array of models (e.g., CNNs and ViTs) and tasks (e.g., classification and detection); 3) PruningBench provides easily implementable interfaces to facilitate the implementation of future pruning methods, and enables the subsequent researchers to incorporate their work into our leaderboards. We provide an online pruning platform http://pruning.vipazoo.cn for customizing pruning tasks and reproducing all results in this paper. Leaderboard results can be available on https://github.com/HollyLee2000/PruningBench.</description>

      <title>Need of AI in Modern Education: in the Eyes of Explainable AI (xAI)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00025v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern Education is not \textit{Modern} without AI. However, AI's complex nature makes understanding and fixing problems challenging. Research worldwide shows that a parent's income greatly influences a child's education. This led us to explore how AI, especially complex models, makes important decisions using Explainable AI tools. Our research uncovered many complexities linked to parental income and offered reasonable explanations for these decisions. However, we also found biases in AI that go against what we want from AI in education: clear transparency and equal access for everyone. These biases can impact families and children's schooling, highlighting the need for better AI solutions that offer fair opportunities to all. This chapter tries to shed light on the complex ways AI operates, especially concerning biases. These are the foundational steps towards better educational policies, which include using AI in ways that are more reliable, accountable, and beneficial for everyone involved.</description>

      <title>A little less conversation, a little more action, please: Investigating the physical common-sense of LLMs in a 3D embodied environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23242v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As general-purpose tools, Large Language Models (LLMs) must often reason about everyday physical environments. In a question-and-answer capacity, understanding the interactions of physical objects may be necessary to give appropriate responses. Moreover, LLMs are increasingly used as reasoning engines in agentic systems, designing and controlling their action sequences. The vast majority of research has tackled this issue using static benchmarks, comprised of text or image-based questions about the physical world. However, these benchmarks do not capture the complexity and nuance of real-life physical processes. Here we advocate for a second, relatively unexplored, approach: 'embodying' the LLMs by granting them control of an agent within a 3D environment. We present the first embodied and cognitively meaningful evaluation of physical common-sense reasoning in LLMs. Our framework allows direct comparison of LLMs with other embodied agents, such as those based on Deep Reinforcement Learning, and human and non-human animals. We employ the Animal-AI (AAI) environment, a simulated 3D virtual laboratory, to study physical common-sense reasoning in LLMs. For this, we use the AAI Testbed, a suite of experiments that replicate laboratory studies with non-human animals, to study physical reasoning capabilities including distance estimation, tracking out-of-sight objects, and tool use. We demonstrate that state-of-the-art multi-modal models with no finetuning can complete this style of task, allowing meaningful comparison to the entrants of the 2019 Animal-AI Olympics competition and to human children. Our results show that LLMs are currently outperformed by human children on these tasks. We argue that this approach allows the study of physical reasoning using ecologically valid experiments drawn directly from cognitive science, improving the predictability and reliability of LLMs.</description>

      <title>KG4Diagnosis: A Hierarchical Multi-Agent LLM Framework with Knowledge Graph Enhancement for Medical Diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16833v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) in healthcare diagnosis demands systematic frameworks that can handle complex medical scenarios while maintaining specialized expertise. We present KG4Diagnosis, a novel hierarchical multi-agent framework that combines LLMs with automated knowledge graph construction, encompassing 362 common diseases across medical specialties. Our framework mirrors real-world medical systems through a two-tier architecture: a general practitioner (GP) agent for initial assessment and triage, coordinating with specialized agents for in-depth diagnosis in specific domains. The core innovation lies in our end-to-end knowledge graph generation methodology, incorporating: (1) semantic-driven entity and relation extraction optimized for medical terminology, (2) multi-dimensional decision relationship reconstruction from unstructured medical texts, and (3) human-guided reasoning for knowledge expansion. KG4Diagnosis serves as an extensible foundation for specialized medical diagnosis systems, with capabilities to incorporate new diseases and medical knowledge. The framework's modular design enables seamless integration of domain-specific enhancements, making it valuable for developing targeted medical diagnosis systems. We provide architectural guidelines and protocols to facilitate adoption across medical contexts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19784v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a transformative development in artificial intelligence (AI), drawing significant attention from industry and academia. Trained on vast datasets, these sophisticated AI systems exhibit impressive natural language processing and content generation capabilities. This paper explores the potential of LLMs to address key challenges in personal finance, focusing on the United States. We evaluate several leading LLMs, including OpenAI's ChatGPT, Google's Gemini, Anthropic's Claude, and Meta's Llama, to assess their effectiveness in providing accurate financial advice on topics such as mortgages, taxes, loans, and investments. Our findings show that while these models achieve an average accuracy rate of approximately 70%, they also display notable limitations in certain areas. Specifically, LLMs struggle to provide accurate responses for complex financial queries, with performance varying significantly across different topics. Despite these limitations, the analysis reveals notable improvements in newer versions of these models, highlighting their growing utility for individuals and financial advisors. As these AI systems continue to evolve, their potential for advancing AI-driven applications in personal finance becomes increasingly promising.</description>

      <title>Communication-Efficient Split Learning via Adaptive Feature-Wise Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.10805v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel communication-efficient split learning (SL) framework, named SplitFC, which reduces the communication overhead required for transmitting intermediate feature and gradient vectors during the SL training process. The key idea of SplitFC is to leverage different dispersion degrees exhibited in the columns of the matrices. SplitFC incorporates two compression strategies: (i) adaptive feature-wise dropout and (ii) adaptive feature-wise quantization. In the first strategy, the intermediate feature vectors are dropped with adaptive dropout probabilities determined based on the standard deviation of these vectors. Then, by the chain rule, the intermediate gradient vectors associated with the dropped feature vectors are also dropped. In the second strategy, the non-dropped intermediate feature and gradient vectors are quantized using adaptive quantization levels determined based on the ranges of the vectors. To minimize the quantization error, the optimal quantization levels of this strategy are derived in a closed-form expression. Simulation results on the MNIST, CIFAR-100, and CelebA datasets demonstrate that SplitFC outperforms state-of-the-art SL frameworks by significantly reducing communication overheads while maintaining high accuracy.</description>

      <title>Transfer Learning with Partially Observable Offline Data via Causal Bounds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.03572v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transfer learning has emerged as an effective approach to accelerate learning by integrating knowledge from related source agents. However, challenges arise due to data heterogeneity-such as differences in feature sets or incomplete datasets-which often results in the nonidentifiability of causal effects. In this paper, we investigate transfer learning in partially observable contextual bandits, where agents operate with incomplete information and limited access to hidden confounders. To address the challenges posed by unobserved confounders, we formulate optimization problems to derive tight bounds on the nonidentifiable causal effects. We then propose an efficient method that discretizes the functional constraints of unknown distributions into linear constraints, allowing us to sample compatible causal models through a sequential process of solving linear programs. This method takes into account estimation errors and exhibits strong convergence properties, ensuring robust and reliable causal bounds. Leveraging these causal bounds, we improve classical bandit algorithms, achieving tighter regret upper and lower bounds relative to the sizes of action sets and function spaces. In tasks involving function approximation, which are crucial for handling complex context spaces, our method significantly improves the dependence on function space size compared to previous work. We formally prove that our causally enhanced algorithms outperform classical bandit algorithms, achieving notably faster convergence rates. The applicability of our approach is further illustrated through an example of offline pricing policy learning with censored demand. Simulations confirm the superiority of our approach over state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating its potential to enhance contextual bandit agents in real-world applications, especially when data is scarce, costly, or restricted due to privacy concerns.</description>

      <title>Efficient Deterministic Renewable Energy Forecasting Guided by Multiple-Location Weather Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17276v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electricity generated from renewable energy sources has been established as an efficient remedy for both energy shortages and the environmental pollution stemming from conventional energy production methods. Solar and wind power are two of the most dominant renewable energy sources. The accurate forecasting of the energy generation of those sources facilitates their integration into electric grids, by minimizing the negative impact of uncertainty regarding their management and operation. This paper proposes a novel methodology for deterministic wind and solar energy generation forecasting for multiple generation sites, utilizing multi-location weather forecasts. The method employs a U-shaped Temporal Convolutional Auto-Encoder (UTCAE) architecture for temporal processing of weather-related and energy-related time-series across each site. The Multi-sized Kernels convolutional Spatio-Temporal Attention (MKST-Attention), inspired by the multi-head scaled-dot product attention mechanism, is also proposed aiming to efficiently transfer temporal patterns from weather data to energy data, without a priori knowledge of the locations of the power stations and the locations of provided weather data. The conducted experimental evaluation on a day-ahead solar and wind energy forecasting scenario on five datasets demonstrated that the proposed method achieves top results, outperforming all competitive time-series forecasting state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Agent Planning with World Knowledge Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14205v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent endeavors towards directly using large language models (LLMs) as agent models to execute interactive planning tasks have shown commendable results. Despite their achievements, however, they still struggle with brainless trial-and-error in global planning and generating hallucinatory actions in local planning due to their poor understanding of the ``real'' physical world. Imitating humans' mental world knowledge model which provides global prior knowledge before the task and maintains local dynamic knowledge during the task, in this paper, we introduce parametric World Knowledge Model (WKM) to facilitate agent planning. Concretely, we steer the agent model to self-synthesize knowledge from both expert and sampled trajectories. Then we develop WKM, providing prior task knowledge to guide the global planning and dynamic state knowledge to assist the local planning. Experimental results on three complex real-world simulated datasets with three state-of-the-art open-source LLMs, Mistral-7B, Gemma-7B, and Llama-3-8B, demonstrate that our method can achieve superior performance compared to various strong baselines. Besides, we analyze to illustrate that our WKM can effectively alleviate the blind trial-and-error and hallucinatory action issues, providing strong support for the agent's understanding of the world. Other interesting findings include: 1) our instance-level task knowledge can generalize better to unseen tasks, 2) weak WKM can guide strong agent model planning, and 3) unified WKM training has promising potential for further development.

      <title>Federated Unsupervised Domain Generalization using Global and Local Alignment of Gradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16304v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the problem of federated domain generalization in an unsupervised setting for the first time. We first theoretically establish a connection between domain shift and alignment of gradients in unsupervised federated learning and show that aligning the gradients at both client and server levels can facilitate the generalization of the model to new (target) domains. Building on this insight, we propose a novel method named FedGaLA, which performs gradient alignment at the client level to encourage clients to learn domain-invariant features, as well as global gradient alignment at the server to obtain a more generalized aggregated model. To empirically evaluate our method, we perform various experiments on four commonly used multi-domain datasets, PACS, OfficeHome, DomainNet, and TerraInc. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method which outperforms comparable baselines. Ablation and sensitivity studies demonstrate the impact of different components and parameters in our approach. The source code is available at: https://github.com/MahdiyarMM/FedGaLA.</description>

      <title>Knowledge Circuits in Pretrained Transformers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17969v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The remarkable capabilities of modern large language models are rooted in their vast repositories of knowledge encoded within their parameters, enabling them to perceive the world and engage in reasoning. The inner workings of how these models store knowledge have long been a subject of intense interest and investigation among researchers. To date, most studies have concentrated on isolated components within these models, such as the Multilayer Perceptrons and attention head. In this paper, we delve into the computation graph of the language model to uncover the knowledge circuits that are instrumental in articulating specific knowledge. The experiments, conducted with GPT2 and TinyLLAMA, have allowed us to observe how certain information heads, relation heads, and Multilayer Perceptrons collaboratively encode knowledge within the model. Moreover, we evaluate the impact of current knowledge editing techniques on these knowledge circuits, providing deeper insights into the functioning and constraints of these editing methodologies. Finally, we utilize knowledge circuits to analyze and interpret language model behaviors such as hallucinations and in-context learning. We believe the knowledge circuits hold potential for advancing our understanding of Transformers and guiding the improved design of knowledge editing.

      <title>E-ICL: Enhancing Fine-Grained Emotion Recognition through the Lens of Prototype Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02642v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) achieves remarkable performance in various domains such as knowledge acquisition, commonsense reasoning, and semantic understanding. However, its performance significantly deteriorates for emotion detection tasks, especially fine-grained emotion recognition. The underlying reasons for this remain unclear. In this paper, we identify the reasons behind ICL's poor performance from the perspective of prototype theory and propose a method to address this issue. Specifically, we conduct extensive pilot experiments and find that ICL conforms to the prototype theory on fine-grained emotion recognition. Based on this theory, we uncover the following deficiencies in ICL: (1) It relies on prototypes (example-label pairs) that are semantically similar but emotionally inaccurate to predict emotions. (2) It is prone to interference from irrelevant categories, affecting the accuracy and robustness of the predictions. To address these issues, we propose an Emotion Context Learning method (E-ICL) on fine-grained emotion recognition. E-ICL relies on more emotionally accurate prototypes to predict categories by referring to emotionally similar examples with dynamic labels. Simultaneously, E-ICL employs an exclusionary emotion prediction strategy to avoid interference from irrelevant categories, thereby increasing its accuracy and robustness. Note that the entire process is accomplished with the assistance of a plug-and-play emotion auxiliary model, without additional training. Experiments on the fine-grained emotion datasets EDOS, Empathetic-Dialogues, EmpatheticIntent, and GoEmotions show that E-ICL achieves superior emotion prediction performance. Furthermore, even when the emotion auxiliary model used is lower than 10% of the LLMs, E-ICL can still boost the performance of LLMs by over 4% on multiple datasets.</description>

      <title>Debate-to-Write: A Persona-Driven Multi-Agent Framework for Diverse Argument Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19643v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Writing persuasive arguments is a challenging task for both humans and machines. It entails incorporating high-level beliefs from various perspectives on the topic, along with deliberate reasoning and planning to construct a coherent narrative. Current language models often generate surface tokens autoregressively, lacking explicit integration of these underlying controls, resulting in limited output diversity and coherence. In this work, we propose a persona-based multi-agent framework for argument writing. Inspired by the human debate, we first assign each agent a persona representing its high-level beliefs from a unique perspective, and then design an agent interaction process so that the agents can collaboratively debate and discuss the idea to form an overall plan for argument writing. Such debate process enables fluid and nonlinear development of ideas. We evaluate our framework on argumentative essay writing. The results show that our framework can generate more diverse and persuasive arguments through both automatic and human evaluations.</description>

      <title>NNsight and NDIF: Democratizing Access to Open-Weight Foundation Model Internals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14561v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce NNsight and NDIF, technologies that work in tandem to enable scientific study of very large neural networks. NNsight is an open-source system that extends PyTorch to introduce deferred remote execution. NDIF is a scalable inference service that executes NNsight requests, allowing users to share GPU resources and pretrained models. These technologies are enabled by the intervention graph, an architecture developed to decouple experiment design from model runtime. Together, this framework provides transparent and efficient access to the internals of deep neural networks such as very large language models (LLMs) without imposing the cost or complexity of hosting customized models individually. We conduct a quantitative survey of the machine learning literature that reveals a growing gap in the study of the internals of large-scale AI. We demonstrate the design and use of our framework to address this gap by enabling a range of research methods on huge models. Finally, we conduct benchmarks to compare performance with previous approaches. Code documentation, and materials are available at https://nnsight.net/.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Robust Cross-Lingual Entity Alignment via Neighbor Triple Matching with Entity and Relation Texts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15588v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cross-lingual entity alignment (EA) enables the integration of multiple knowledge graphs (KGs) across different languages, providing users with seamless access to diverse and comprehensive knowledge. Existing methods, mostly supervised, face challenges in obtaining labeled entity pairs. To address this, recent studies have shifted towards self-supervised and unsupervised frameworks. Despite their effectiveness, these approaches have limitations: (1) Relation passing: mainly focusing on the entity while neglecting the semantic information of relations, (2) Isomorphic assumption: assuming isomorphism between source and target graphs, which leads to noise and reduced alignment accuracy, and (3) Noise vulnerability: susceptible to noise in the textual features, especially when encountering inconsistent translations or Out-of-Vocabulary (OOV) problems. In this paper, we propose ERAlign, an unsupervised and robust cross-lingual EA pipeline that jointly performs Entity-level and Relation-level Alignment by neighbor triple matching strategy using semantic textual features of relations and entities. Its refinement step iteratively enhances results by fusing entity-level and relation-level alignments based on neighbor triple matching. The additional verification step examines the entities' neighbor triples as the linearized text. This Align-then-Verify pipeline rigorously assesses alignment results, achieving near-perfect alignment even in the presence of noisy textual features of entities. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that the robustness and general applicability of ERAlign improved the accuracy and effectiveness of EA tasks, contributing significantly to knowledge-oriented applications.</description>

      <title>An Ad-hoc graph node vector embedding algorithm for general knowledge graphs using Kinetica-Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15906v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper discusses how to generate general graph node embeddings from knowledge graph representations. The embedded space is composed of a number of sub-features to mimic both local affinity and remote structural relevance. These sub-feature dimensions are defined by several indicators that we speculate to catch nodal similarities, such as hop-based topological patterns, the number of overlapping labels, the transitional probabilities (markov-chain probabilities), and the cluster indices computed by our recursive spectral bisection (RSB) algorithm. These measures are flattened over the one dimensional vector space into their respective sub-component ranges such that the entire set of vector similarity functions could be used for finding similar nodes. The error is defined by the sum of pairwise square differences across a randomly selected sample of graph nodes between the assumed embeddings and the ground truth estimates as our novel loss function. The ground truth is estimated to be a combination of pairwise Jaccard similarity and the number of overlapping labels. Finally, we demonstrate a multi-variate stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm to compute the weighing factors among sub-vector spaces to minimize the average error using a random sampling logic.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20294v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce ChemBFN, a language model that handles chemistry tasks based on Bayesian flow networks working on discrete data. A new accuracy schedule is proposed to improve the sampling quality by significantly reducing the reconstruction loss. We show evidence that our method is appropriate for generating molecules with satisfied diversity even when a smaller number of sampling steps is used. A classifier-free guidance method is adapted for conditional generation. It is also worthwhile to point out that after generative training, our model can be fine-tuned on regression and classification tasks with the state-of-the-art performance, which opens the gate of building all-in-one models in a single module style. Our model has been open sourced at https://github.com/Augus1999/bayesian-flow-network-for-chemistry.</description>

      <title>GS-KGC: A Generative Subgraph-based Framework for Knowledge Graph Completion with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10819v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Knowledge graph completion (KGC) focuses on identifying missing triples in a knowledge graph (KG) , which is crucial for many downstream applications. Given the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), some LLM-based methods are proposed for KGC task. However, most of them focus on prompt engineering while overlooking the fact that finer-grained subgraph information can aid LLMs in generating more accurate answers. In this paper, we propose a novel completion framework called \textbf{G}enerative \textbf{S}ubgraph-based KGC (GS-KGC), which utilizes subgraph information as contextual reasoning and employs a QA approach to achieve the KGC task. This framework primarily includes a subgraph partitioning algorithm designed to generate negatives and neighbors. Specifically, negatives can encourage LLMs to generate a broader range of answers, while neighbors provide additional contextual insights for LLM reasoning. Furthermore, we found that GS-KGC can discover potential triples within the KGs and new facts beyond the KGs. Experiments conducted on four common KGC datasets highlight the advantages of the proposed GS-KGC, e.g., it shows a 5.6\% increase in Hits@3 compared to the LLM-based model CP-KGC on the FB15k-237N, and a 9.3\% increase over the LLM-based model TECHS on the ICEWS14.</description>

      <title>Toward Robust Early Detection of Alzheimer's Disease via an Integrated Multimodal Learning Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16343v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder marked by memory loss, executive dysfunction, and personality changes. Early diagnosis is challenging due to subtle symptoms and varied presentations, often leading to misdiagnosis with traditional unimodal diagnostic methods due to their limited scope. This study introduces an advanced multimodal classification model that integrates clinical, cognitive, neuroimaging, and EEG data to enhance diagnostic accuracy. The model incorporates a feature tagger with a tabular data coding architecture and utilizes the TimesBlock module to capture intricate temporal patterns in Electroencephalograms (EEG) data. By employing Cross-modal Attention Aggregation module, the model effectively fuses Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) spatial information with EEG temporal data, significantly improving the distinction between AD, Mild Cognitive Impairment, and Normal Cognition. Simultaneously, we have constructed the first AD classification dataset that includes three modalities: EEG, MRI, and tabular data. Our innovative approach aims to facilitate early diagnosis and intervention, potentially slowing the progression of AD. The source code and our private ADMC dataset are available at https://github.com/JustlfC03/MSTNet.</description>

      <title>Disentangling Speakers in Multi-Talker Speech Recognition with Speaker-Aware CTC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12388v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-talker speech recognition (MTASR) faces unique challenges in disentangling and transcribing overlapping speech. To address these challenges, this paper investigates the role of Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) in speaker disentanglement when incorporated with Serialized Output Training (SOT) for MTASR. Our visualization reveals that CTC guides the encoder to represent different speakers in distinct temporal regions of acoustic embeddings. Leveraging this insight, we propose a novel Speaker-Aware CTC (SACTC) training objective, based on the Bayes risk CTC framework. SACTC is a tailored CTC variant for multi-talker scenarios, it explicitly models speaker disentanglement by constraining the encoder to represent different speakers' tokens at specific time frames. When integrated with SOT, the SOT-SACTC model consistently outperforms standard SOT-CTC across various degrees of speech overlap. Specifically, we observe relative word error rate reductions of 10% overall and 15% on low-overlap speech. This work represents an initial exploration of CTC-based enhancements for MTASR tasks, offering a new perspective on speaker disentanglement in multi-talker speech recognition. The code is available at https://github.com/kjw11/Speaker-Aware-CTC.</description>

      <title>FUSED-Net: Detecting Traffic Signs with Limited Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14852v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Automatic Traffic Sign Recognition is paramount in modern transportation systems, motivating several research endeavors to focus on performance improvement by utilizing large-scale datasets. As the appearance of traffic signs varies across countries, curating large-scale datasets is often impractical; and requires efficient models that can produce satisfactory performance using limited data. In this connection, we present 'FUSED-Net', built-upon Faster RCNN for traffic sign detection, enhanced by Unfrozen Parameters, Pseudo-Support Sets, Embedding Normalization, and Domain Adaptation while reducing data requirement. Unlike traditional approaches, we keep all parameters unfrozen during training, enabling FUSED-Net to learn from limited samples. The generation of a Pseudo-Support Set through data augmentation further enhances performance by compensating for the scarcity of target domain data. Additionally, Embedding Normalization is incorporated to reduce intra-class variance, standardizing feature representation. Domain Adaptation, achieved by pre-training on a diverse traffic sign dataset distinct from the target domain, improves model generalization. Evaluating FUSED-Net on the BDTSD dataset, we achieved 2.4x, 2.2x, 1.5x, and 1.3x improvements of mAP in 1-shot, 3-shot, 5-shot, and 10-shot scenarios, respectively compared to the state-of-the-art Few-Shot Object Detection (FSOD) models. Additionally, we outperform state-of-the-art works on the cross-domain FSOD benchmark under several scenarios.</description>

      <title>OmniFlatten: An End-to-end GPT Model for Seamless Voice Conversation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17799v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Full-duplex spoken dialogue systems significantly surpass traditional turn-based dialogue systems, as they allow simultaneous bidirectional communication, closely mirroring human-human interactions. However, achieving low latency and natural interactions in full-duplex dialogue systems remains a significant challenge, especially considering human conversation dynamics such as interruptions, backchannels, and overlapping speech. In this paper, we introduce a novel End-to-End GPT-based model OmniFlatten for full-duplex conversation, capable of effectively modeling the complex behaviors inherent to natural conversations with low latency. To achieve full-duplex conversation capabilities, we propose a multi-stage post-training scheme that progressively adapts a text large language model (LLM) backbone into a speech-text dialogue LLM, capable of generating text and speech in real time, without modifying the architecture of the backbone LLM. The training process comprises three stages: modality alignment, half-duplex dialogue learning, and full-duplex dialogue learning. In all training stages, we standardize the data using a flattening operation, which enables unifying the training methods and the GPT backbone across different modalities and tasks. Our approach offers a simple modeling technique and a promising research direction for developing efficient and natural end-to-end full-duplex spoken dialogue systems. Audio samples of dialogues generated by OmniFlatten can be found at this web site (https://omniflatten.github.io/).</description>

      <title>Sequential Large Language Model-Based Hyper-parameter Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20302v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study introduces SLLMBO, an innovative framework leveraging large language models (LLMs) for hyperparameter optimization (HPO), incorporating dynamic search space adaptability, enhanced parameter space exploitation, and a novel LLM-tree-structured parzen estimator (LLM-TPE) sampler. By addressing limitations in recent fully LLM-based methods and traditional bayesian optimization (BO), SLLMBO achieves more robust optimization. This comprehensive benchmarking evaluates multiple LLMs, including GPT-3.5-Turbo, GPT-4o, Claude-Sonnet-3.5, and Gemini-1.5-Flash, extending prior work and establishing SLLMBO as the first framework to benchmark a diverse set of LLMs for HPO. By integrating LLMs' established strengths in parameter initialization with the exploitation abilities demonstrated in this study, alongside TPE's exploration capabilities, the LLM-TPE sampler achieves a balanced exploration-exploitation trade-off, reduces API costs, and mitigates premature early stoppings for more effective parameter searches. Across 14 tabular tasks in classification and regression, the LLM-TPE sampler outperformed fully LLM-based methods and achieved superior results over BO methods in 9 tasks. Testing early stopping in budget-constrained scenarios demonstrated competitive performance, indicating that LLM-based methods generally benefit from extended iterations for optimal results. This work lays the foundation for future research exploring open-source LLMs, reproducibility of LLM results in HPO, and benchmarking SLLMBO on complex datasets, such as image classification, segmentation, and machine translation.</description>

      <title>Evaluation Metric for Quality Control and Generative Models in Histopathology Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01034v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Our study introduces ResNet-L2 (RL2), a novel metric for evaluating generative models and image quality in histopathology, addressing limitations of traditional metrics, such as Frechet inception distance (FID), when the data is scarce. RL2 leverages ResNet features with a normalizing flow to calculate RMSE distance in the latent space, providing reliable assessments across diverse histopathology datasets. We evaluated the performance of RL2 on degradation types, such as blur, Gaussian noise, salt-and-pepper noise, and rectangular patches, as well as diffusion processes. RL2's monotonic response to increasing degradation makes it well-suited for models that assess image quality, proving a valuable advancement for evaluating image generation techniques in histopathology. It can also be used to discard low-quality patches while sampling from a whole slide image. It is also significantly lighter and faster compared to traditional metrics and requires fewer images to give stable metric value.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the Ability of Large Language Models to Generate Verifiable Specifications in VeriFast</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02318v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Static verification is a powerful method for enhancing software quality, but it demands significant human labor and resources. This is particularly true of static verifiers that reason about heap manipulating programs using an ownership logic. LLMs have shown promise in a number of software engineering activities, including code generation, test generation, proof generation for theorem provers, and specification generation for static verifiers. However, prior work has not explored how well LLMs can perform specification generation for specifications based in an ownership logic, such as separation logic. To address this gap, this paper explores OpenAI's GPT-4o model's effectiveness in generating specifications on C programs that are verifiable with VeriFast, a separation logic based static verifier. Our experiment employs three different types of user inputs as well as basic and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting to assess GPT's capabilities. Our results indicate that the specifications generated by GPT-4o preserve functional behavior, but struggle to be verifiable. When the specifications are verifiable they contain redundancies. Future directions are discussed to improve the performance.</description>

      <title>Dissecting the Failure of Invariant Learning on Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02847v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Enhancing node-level Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) generalization on graphs remains a crucial area of research. In this paper, we develop a Structural Causal Model (SCM) to theoretically dissect the performance of two prominent invariant learning methods -- Invariant Risk Minimization (IRM) and Variance-Risk Extrapolation (VREx) -- in node-level OOD settings. Our analysis reveals a critical limitation: due to the lack of class-conditional invariance constraints, these methods may struggle to accurately identify the structure of the predictive invariant ego-graph and consequently rely on spurious features. To address this, we propose Cross-environment Intra-class Alignment (CIA), which explicitly eliminates spurious features by aligning cross-environment representations conditioned on the same class, bypassing the need for explicit knowledge of the causal pattern structure. To adapt CIA to node-level OOD scenarios where environment labels are hard to obtain, we further propose CIA-LRA (Localized Reweighting Alignment) that leverages the distribution of neighboring labels to selectively align node representations, effectively distinguishing and preserving invariant features while removing spurious ones, all without relying on environment labels. We theoretically prove CIA-LRA's effectiveness by deriving an OOD generalization error bound based on PAC-Bayesian analysis. Experiments on graph OOD benchmarks validate the superiority of CIA and CIA-LRA, marking a significant advancement in node-level OOD generalization. The codes are available at https://github.com/NOVAglow646/NeurIPS24-Invariant-Learning-on-Graphs.</description>

      <title>Multi-View Majority Vote Learning Algorithms: Direct Minimization of PAC-Bayesian Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06276v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The PAC-Bayesian framework has significantly advanced the understanding of statistical learning, particularly for majority voting methods. Despite its successes, its application to multi-view learning -- a setting with multiple complementary data representations -- remains underexplored. In this work, we extend PAC-Bayesian theory to multi-view learning, introducing novel generalization bounds based on R\'enyi divergence. These bounds provide an alternative to traditional Kullback-Leibler divergence-based counterparts, leveraging the flexibility of R\'enyi divergence. Furthermore, we propose first- and second-order oracle PAC-Bayesian bounds and extend the C-bound to multi-view settings. To bridge theory and practice, we design efficient self-bounding optimization algorithms that align with our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Ensemble Learning for Microbubble Localization in Super-Resolution Ultrasound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07376v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Super-resolution ultrasound (SR-US) is a powerful imaging technique for capturing microvasculature and blood flow at high spatial resolution. However, accurate microbubble (MB) localization remains a key challenge, as errors in localization can propagate through subsequent stages of the super-resolution process, affecting overall performance. In this paper, we explore the potential of ensemble learning techniques to enhance MB localization by increasing detection sensitivity and reducing false positives. Our study evaluates the effectiveness of ensemble methods on both in vivo and simulated outputs of a Deformable DEtection TRansformer (Deformable DETR) network. As a result of our study, we are able to demonstrate the advantages of these ensemble approaches by showing improved precision and recall in MB detection and offering insights into their application in SR-US.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Vision-Language Model Safety through Progressive Concept-Bottleneck-Driven Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11543v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Benefiting from the powerful capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), pre-trained visual encoder models connected to LLMs form Vision Language Models (VLMs). However, recent research shows that the visual modality in VLMs is highly vulnerable, allowing attackers to bypass safety alignment in LLMs through visually transmitted content, launching harmful attacks. To address this challenge, we propose a progressive concept-based alignment strategy, PSA-VLM, which incorporates safety modules as concept bottlenecks to enhance visual modality safety alignment. By aligning model predictions with specific safety concepts, we improve defenses against risky images, enhancing explainability and controllability while minimally impacting general performance. Our method is obtained through two-stage training. The low computational cost of the first stage brings very effective performance improvement, and the fine-tuning of the language model in the second stage further improves the safety performance. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results on popular VLM safety benchmark.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15811v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transformer-based multi-object tracking (MOT) methods have captured the attention of many researchers in recent years. However, these models often suffer from slow inference speeds due to their structure or other issues. To address this problem, we revisited the Joint Detection and Tracking (JDT) method by looking back at past approaches. By integrating the original JDT approach with some advanced theories, this paper employs an efficient method of information transfer between frames on the DETR, constructing a fast and novel JDT-type MOT framework: FastTrackTr. Thanks to the superiority of this information transfer method, our approach not only reduces the number of queries required during tracking but also avoids the excessive introduction of network structures, ensuring model simplicity. Experimental results indicate that our method has the potential to achieve real-time tracking and exhibits competitive tracking accuracy across multiple datasets.</description>

      <title>Learning Chemical Reaction Representation with Reactant-Product Alignment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17629v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Organic synthesis stands as a cornerstone of the chemical industry. The development of robust machine learning models to support tasks associated with organic reactions is of significant interest. However, current methods rely on hand-crafted features or direct adaptations of model architectures from other domains, which lack feasibility as data scales increase or ignore the rich chemical information inherent in reactions. To address these issues, this paper introduces RAlign, a novel chemical reaction representation learning model for various organic reaction-related tasks. By integrating atomic correspondence between reactants and products, our model discerns the molecular transformations that occur during the reaction, thereby enhancing comprehension of the reaction mechanism. We have designed an adapter structure to incorporate reaction conditions into the chemical reaction representation, allowing the model to handle various reaction conditions and to adapt to various datasets and downstream tasks. Additionally, we introduce a reaction-center-aware attention mechanism that enables the model to concentrate on key functional groups, thereby generating potent representations for chemical reactions. Our model has been evaluated on a range of downstream tasks. Experimental results indicate that our model markedly outperforms existing chemical reaction representation learning architectures on most of the datasets. We plan to open-source the code contingent upon the acceptance of the paper.</description>

      <title>Heuristic-Induced Multimodal Risk Distribution Jailbreak Attack for Multimodal Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05934v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), concerns regarding their security have increasingly captured the attention of both academia and industry. Although MLLMs are vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, designing effective multimodal jailbreak attacks poses unique challenges, especially given the distinct protective measures implemented across various modalities in commercial models. Previous works concentrate risks into a single modality, resulting in limited jailbreak performance. In this paper, we propose a heuristic-induced multimodal risk distribution jailbreak attack method, called HIMRD, which consists of two elements: multimodal risk distribution strategy and heuristic-induced search strategy. The multimodal risk distribution strategy is used to segment harmful instructions across multiple modalities to effectively circumvent MLLMs' security protection. The heuristic-induced search strategy identifies two types of prompts: the understanding-enhancing prompt, which helps the MLLM reconstruct the malicious prompt, and the inducing prompt, which increases the likelihood of affirmative outputs over refusals, enabling a successful jailbreak attack. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this approach effectively uncovers vulnerabilities in MLLMs, achieving an average attack success rate of 90% across seven popular open-source MLLMs and an average attack success rate of around 68% in three popular closed-source MLLMs. Our code will coming soon. Warning: This paper contains offensive and harmful examples, reader discretion is advised.</description>

      <title>LMS-AutoTSF: Learnable Multi-Scale Decomposition and Integrated Autocorrelation for Time Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06866v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time series forecasting is an important challenge with significant applications in areas such as weather prediction, stock market analysis, scientific simulations and industrial process analysis. In this work, we introduce LMS-AutoTSF, a novel time series forecasting architecture that incorporates autocorrelation while leveraging dual encoders operating at multiple scales. Unlike models that rely on predefined trend and seasonal components, LMS-AutoTSF employs two separate encoders per scale: one focusing on low-pass filtering to capture trends and the other utilizing high-pass filtering to model seasonal variations. These filters are learnable, allowing the model to dynamically adapt and isolate trend and seasonal components directly in the frequency domain. A key innovation in our approach is the integration of autocorrelation, achieved by computing lagged differences in time steps, which enables the model to capture dependencies across time more effectively. Each encoder processes the input through fully connected layers to handle temporal and channel interactions. By combining frequency-domain filtering, autocorrelation-based temporal modeling, and channel-wise transformations, LMS-AutoTSF not only accurately captures long-term dependencies and fine-grained patterns but also operates more efficiently compared to other state-of-the-art methods. Its lightweight design ensures faster processing while maintaining high precision in forecasting across diverse time horizons.

      <title>Large Language Models: An Applied Econometric Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07031v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: How can we use the novel capacities of large language models (LLMs) in empirical research? And how can we do so while accounting for their limitations, which are themselves only poorly understood? We develop an econometric framework to answer this question that distinguishes between two types of empirical tasks. Using LLMs for prediction problems (including hypothesis generation) is valid under one condition: no ``leakage'' between the LLM's training dataset and the researcher's sample. No leakage can be ensured by using open-source LLMs with documented training data and published weights. Using LLM outputs for estimation problems to automate the measurement of some economic concept (expressed either by some text or from human subjects) requires the researcher to collect at least some validation data: without such data, the errors of the LLM's automation cannot be assessed and accounted for. As long as these steps are taken, LLM outputs can be used in empirical research with the familiar econometric guarantees we desire. Using two illustrative applications to finance and political economy, we find that these requirements are stringent; when they are violated, the limitations of LLMs now result in unreliable empirical estimates. Our results suggest the excitement around the empirical uses of LLMs is warranted -- they allow researchers to effectively use even small amounts of language data for both prediction and estimation -- but only with these safeguards in place.</description>

      <title>XLSTM-HVED: Cross-Modal Brain Tumor Segmentation and MRI Reconstruction Method Using Vision XLSTM and Heteromodal Variational Encoder-Decoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07804v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neurogliomas are among the most aggressive forms of cancer, presenting considerable challenges in both treatment and monitoring due to their unpredictable biological behavior. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is currently the preferred method for diagnosing and monitoring gliomas. However, the lack of specific imaging techniques often compromises the accuracy of tumor segmentation during the imaging process. To address this issue, we introduce the XLSTM-HVED model. This model integrates a hetero-modal encoder-decoder framework with the Vision XLSTM module to reconstruct missing MRI modalities. By deeply fusing spatial and temporal features, it enhances tumor segmentation performance. The key innovation of our approach is the Self-Attention Variational Encoder (SAVE) module, which improves the integration of modal features. Additionally, it optimizes the interaction of features between segmentation and reconstruction tasks through the Squeeze-Fusion-Excitation Cross Awareness (SFECA) module. Our experiments using the BraTS 2024 dataset demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms existing advanced methods in handling cases where modalities are missing. Our source code is available at https://github.com/Quanato607/XLSTM-HVED.</description>

      <title>A recent evaluation on the performance of LLMs on radiation oncology physics using questions of randomly shuffled options</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10622v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Purpose: We present an updated study evaluating the performance of large language models (LLMs) in answering radiation oncology physics questions, focusing on the recently released models.
  Methods: A set of 100 multiple choice radiation oncology physics questions, previously created by a well-experienced physicist, was used for this study. The answer options of the questions were randomly shuffled to create "new" exam sets. Five LLMs (OpenAI o1-preview, GPT-4o, LLaMA 3.1 (405B), Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet) with the versions released before September 30, 2024, were queried using these new exam sets. To evaluate their deductive reasoning capabilities, the correct answers in the questions were replaced with "None of the above." Then, the explaining-first and step-by-step instruction prompts were used to test if this strategy improved their reasoning capabilities. The performance of the LLMs was compared with the answers from medical physicists.
  Results: All models demonstrated expert-level performance on these questions, with o1-preview even surpassing medical physicists with a majority vote. When replacing the correct answers with "None of the above," all models exhibited a considerable decline in performance, suggesting room for improvement. The explaining-first and step-by-step instruction prompts helped enhance the reasoning capabilities of the LLaMA 3.1 (405B), Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet models.
  Conclusion: These recently released LLMs demonstrated expert-level performance in answering radiation oncology physics questions, exhibiting great potential to assist in radiation oncology physics training and education.</description>

      <title>LongBench v2: Towards Deeper Understanding and Reasoning on Realistic Long-context Multitasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15204v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces LongBench v2, a benchmark designed to assess the ability of LLMs to handle long-context problems requiring deep understanding and reasoning across real-world multitasks. LongBench v2 consists of 503 challenging multiple-choice questions, with contexts ranging from 8k to 2M words, across six major task categories: single-document QA, multi-document QA, long in-context learning, long-dialogue history understanding, code repository understanding, and long structured data understanding. To ensure the breadth and the practicality, we collect data from nearly 100 highly educated individuals with diverse professional backgrounds. We employ both automated and manual review processes to maintain high quality and difficulty, resulting in human experts achieving only 53.7% accuracy under a 15-minute time constraint. Our evaluation reveals that the best-performing model, when directly answers the questions, achieves only 50.1% accuracy. In contrast, the o1-preview model, which includes longer reasoning, achieves 57.7%, surpassing the human baseline by 4%. These results highlight the importance of enhanced reasoning ability and scaling inference-time compute to tackle the long-context challenges in LongBench v2. The project is available at https://longbench2.github.io.</description>

      <title>Speech Retrieval-Augmented Generation without Automatic Speech Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16500v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One common approach for question answering over speech data is to first transcribe speech using automatic speech recognition (ASR) and then employ text-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) on the transcriptions. While this cascaded pipeline has proven effective in many practical settings, ASR errors can propagate to the retrieval and generation steps. To overcome this limitation, we introduce SpeechRAG, a novel framework designed for open-question answering over spoken data. Our proposed approach fine-tunes a pre-trained speech encoder into a speech adapter fed into a frozen large language model (LLM)--based retrieval model. By aligning the embedding spaces of text and speech, our speech retriever directly retrieves audio passages from text-based queries, leveraging the retrieval capacity of the frozen text retriever. Our retrieval experiments on spoken question answering datasets show that direct speech retrieval does not degrade over the text-based baseline, and outperforms the cascaded systems using ASR. For generation, we use a speech language model (SLM) as a generator, conditioned on audio passages rather than transcripts. Without fine-tuning of the SLM, this approach outperforms cascaded text-based models when there is high WER in the transcripts.</description>

      <title>PB-UAP: Hybrid Universal Adversarial Attack For Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16651v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of deep learning, the model robustness has become a significant research hotspot, \ie, adversarial attacks on deep neural networks. Existing works primarily focus on image classification tasks, aiming to alter the model's predicted labels. Due to the output complexity and deeper network architectures, research on adversarial examples for segmentation models is still limited, particularly for universal adversarial perturbations. In this paper, we propose a novel universal adversarial attack method designed for segmentation models, which includes dual feature separation and low-frequency scattering modules. The two modules guide the training of adversarial examples in the pixel and frequency space, respectively. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves high attack success rates surpassing the state-of-the-art methods, and exhibits strong transferability across different models.</description>

      <title>MedHallBench: A New Benchmark for Assessing Hallucination in Medical Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18947v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Medical Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated potential in healthcare applications, yet their propensity for hallucinations -- generating medically implausible or inaccurate information -- presents substantial risks to patient care. This paper introduces MedHallBench, a comprehensive benchmark framework for evaluating and mitigating hallucinations in MLLMs. Our methodology integrates expert-validated medical case scenarios with established medical databases to create a robust evaluation dataset. The framework employs a sophisticated measurement system that combines automated ACHMI (Automatic Caption Hallucination Measurement in Medical Imaging) scoring with rigorous clinical expert evaluations and utilizes reinforcement learning methods to achieve automatic annotation. Through an optimized reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) training pipeline specifically designed for medical applications, MedHallBench enables thorough evaluation of MLLMs across diverse clinical contexts while maintaining stringent accuracy standards. We conducted comparative experiments involving various models, utilizing the benchmark to establish a baseline for widely adopted large language models (LLMs). Our findings indicate that ACHMI provides a more nuanced understanding of the effects of hallucinations compared to traditional metrics, thereby highlighting its advantages in hallucination assessment. This research establishes a foundational framework for enhancing MLLMs' reliability in healthcare settings and presents actionable strategies for addressing the critical challenge of AI hallucinations in medical applications.</description>

      <title>MobileNetV2: A lightweight classification model for home-based sleep apnea screening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19967v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study proposes a novel lightweight neural network model leveraging features extracted from electrocardiogram (ECG) and respiratory signals for early OSA screening. ECG signals are used to generate feature spectrograms to predict sleep stages, while respiratory signals are employed to detect sleep-related breathing abnormalities. By integrating these predictions, the method calculates the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) with enhanced accuracy, facilitating precise OSA diagnosis.
  The method was validated on three publicly available sleep apnea databases: the Apnea-ECG database, the UCDDB dataset, and the MIT-BIH Polysomnographic database. Results showed an overall OSA detection accuracy of 0.978, highlighting the model's robustness. Respiratory event classification achieved an accuracy of 0.969 and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC) of 0.98. For sleep stage classification, in UCDDB dataset, the ROC-AUC exceeded 0.85 across all stages, with recall for Sleep reaching 0.906 and specificity for REM and Wake states at 0.956 and 0.937, respectively.
  This study underscores the potential of integrating lightweight neural networks with multi-signal analysis for accurate, portable, and cost-effective OSA screening, paving the way for broader adoption in home-based and wearable health monitoring systems.</description>

      <title>Multi-Scenario Reasoning: Unlocking Cognitive Autonomy in Humanoid Robots for Multimodal Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20429v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To improve the cognitive autonomy of humanoid robots, this research proposes a multi-scenario reasoning architecture to solve the technical shortcomings of multi-modal understanding in this field. It draws on simulation based experimental design that adopts multi-modal synthesis (visual, auditory, tactile) and builds a simulator "Maha" to perform the experiment. The findings demonstrate the feasibility of this architecture in multimodal data. It provides reference experience for the exploration of cross-modal interaction strategies for humanoid robots in dynamic environments. In addition, multi-scenario reasoning simulates the high-level reasoning mechanism of the human brain to humanoid robots at the cognitive level. This new concept promotes cross-scenario practical task transfer and semantic-driven action planning. It heralds the future development of self-learning and autonomous behavior of humanoid robots in changing scenarios.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Table Recognition with Vision LLMs: A Benchmark and Neighbor-Guided Toolchain Reasoner</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20662v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pre-trained foundation models have recently significantly progressed in structured table understanding and reasoning. However, despite advancements in areas such as table semantic understanding and table question answering, recognizing the structure and content of unstructured tables using Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs) remains under-explored. In this work, we address this research gap by employing VLLMs in a training-free reasoning paradigm. First, we design a benchmark with various hierarchical dimensions relevant to table recognition. Subsequently, we conduct in-depth evaluations using pre-trained VLLMs, finding that low-quality image input is a significant bottleneck in the recognition process. Drawing inspiration from these findings, we propose the Neighbor-Guided Toolchain Reasoner (NGTR) framework, which is characterized by integrating multiple lightweight models for low-level visual processing operations aimed at mitigating issues with low-quality input images. Specifically, we utilize a neighbor retrieval mechanism to guide the generation of multiple tool invocation plans, transferring tool selection experiences from similar neighbors to the given input, thereby facilitating suitable tool selection. Additionally, we introduce a reflection module to supervise the tool invocation process. Extensive experiments on public table recognition datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances the recognition capabilities of the vanilla VLLMs. We believe that the designed benchmark and the proposed NGTR framework could provide an alternative solution in table recognition.</description>

      <title>Conservation-informed Graph Learning for Spatiotemporal Dynamics Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20962v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data-centric methods have shown great potential in understanding and predicting spatiotemporal dynamics, enabling better design and control of the object system. However, deep learning models often lack interpretability, fail to obey intrinsic physics, and struggle to cope with the various domains. While geometry-based methods, e.g., graph neural networks (GNNs), have been proposed to further tackle these challenges, they still need to find the implicit physical laws from large datasets and rely excessively on rich labeled data. In this paper, we herein introduce the conservation-informed GNN (CiGNN), an end-to-end explainable learning framework, to learn spatiotemporal dynamics based on limited training data. The network is designed to conform to the general conservation law via symmetry, where conservative and non-conservative information passes over a multiscale space enhanced by a latent temporal marching strategy. The efficacy of our model has been verified in various spatiotemporal systems based on synthetic and real-world datasets, showing superiority over baseline models. Results demonstrate that CiGNN exhibits remarkable accuracy and generalizability, and is readily applicable to learning for prediction of various spatiotemporal dynamics in a spatial domain with complex geometry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00562v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models offer new opportunities to devise automated implementation generation methods that can tackle problem solving activities beyond traditional methods, which require algorithmic specifications and can use only static domain knowledge, like performance metrics and libraries of basic building blocks. Large Language Models could support creating new methods to support problem solving activities for open-ended problems, like problem framing, exploring possible solving approaches, feature elaboration and combination, more advanced implementation assessment, and handling unexpected situations. This report summarized the current work on Large Language Models, including model prompting, Reinforcement Learning, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation. Future research requirements were also discussed.</description>

      <title>Large Language Model Based Multi-Agent System Augmented Complex Event Processing Pipeline for Internet of Multimedia Things</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00906v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the development and evaluation of a Large Language Model (LLM), also known as foundation models, based multi-agent system framework for complex event processing (CEP) with a focus on video query processing use cases. The primary goal is to create a proof-of-concept (POC) that integrates state-of-the-art LLM orchestration frameworks with publish/subscribe (pub/sub) tools to address the integration of LLMs with current CEP systems. Utilizing the Autogen framework in conjunction with Kafka message brokers, the system demonstrates an autonomous CEP pipeline capable of handling complex workflows. Extensive experiments evaluate the system's performance across varying configurations, complexities, and video resolutions, revealing the trade-offs between functionality and latency. The results show that while higher agent count and video complexities increase latency, the system maintains high consistency in narrative coherence. This research builds upon and contributes to, existing novel approaches to distributed AI systems, offering detailed insights into integrating such systems into existing infrastructures.</description>

      <title>MuQ: Self-Supervised Music Representation Learning with Mel Residual Vector Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01108v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent years have witnessed the success of foundation models pre-trained with self-supervised learning (SSL) in various music informatics understanding tasks, including music tagging, instrument classification, key detection, and more. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised music representation learning model for music understanding. Distinguished from previous studies adopting random projection or existing neural codec, the proposed model, named MuQ, is trained to predict tokens generated by Mel Residual Vector Quantization (Mel-RVQ). Our Mel-RVQ utilizes residual linear projection structure for Mel spectrum quantization to enhance the stability and efficiency of target extraction and lead to better performance. Experiments in a large variety of downstream tasks demonstrate that MuQ outperforms previous self-supervised music representation models with only 0.9K hours of open-source pre-training data. Scaling up the data to over 160K hours and adopting iterative training consistently improve the model performance. To further validate the strength of our model, we present MuQ-MuLan, a joint music-text embedding model based on contrastive learning, which achieves state-of-the-art performance in the zero-shot music tagging task on the MagnaTagATune dataset. Code and checkpoints are open source in https://github.com/tencent-ailab/MuQ.</description>
