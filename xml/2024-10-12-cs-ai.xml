      <title>AAAI Workshop on AI Planning for Cyber-Physical Systems -- CAIPI24</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The workshop 'AI-based Planning for Cyber-Physical Systems', which took place on February 26, 2024, as part of the 38th Annual AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Vancouver, Canada, brought together researchers to discuss recent advances in AI planning methods for Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). CPS pose a major challenge due to their complexity and data-intensive nature, which often exceeds the capabilities of traditional planning algorithms. The workshop highlighted new approaches such as neuro-symbolic architectures, large language models (LLMs), deep reinforcement learning and advances in symbolic planning. These techniques are promising when it comes to managing the complexity of CPS and have potential for real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Examining the Prevalence and Dynamics of AI-Generated Media in Art Subreddits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Broadly accessible generative AI models like Dall-E have made it possible for anyone to create compelling visual art. In online communities, the introduction of AI-generated content (AIGC) may impact community dynamics by shifting the kinds of content being posted or the responses to content suspected of being generated by AI. We take steps towards examining the potential impact of AIGC on art-related communities on Reddit. We distinguish between communities that disallow AI content and those without a direct policy. We look at image-based posts made to these communities that are transparently created by AI, or comments in these communities that suspect authors of using generative AI. We find that AI posts (and accusations) have played a very small part in these communities through the end of 2023, accounting for fewer than 0.2% of the image-based posts. Even as the absolute number of author-labelled AI posts dwindles over time, accusations of AI use remain more persistent. We show that AI content is more readily used by newcomers and may help increase participation if it aligns with community rules. However, the tone of comments suspecting AI use by others have become more negative over time, especially in communities that do not have explicit rules about AI. Overall, the results show the changing norms and interactions around AIGC in online communities designated for creativity.</description>

      <title>Improving the portability of predicting students performance models by using ontologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the main current challenges in Educational Data Mining and Learning Analytics is the portability or transferability of predictive models obtained for a particular course so that they can be applied to other different courses. To handle this challenge, one of the foremost problems is the models excessive dependence on the low-level attributes used to train them, which reduces the models portability. To solve this issue, the use of high level attributes with more semantic meaning, such as ontologies, may be very useful. Along this line, we propose the utilization of an ontology that uses a taxonomy of actions that summarises students interactions with the Moodle learning management system. We compare the results of this proposed approach against our previous results when we used low-level raw attributes obtained directly from Moodle logs. The results indicate that the use of the proposed ontology improves the portability of the models in terms of predictive accuracy. The main contribution of this paper is to show that the ontological models obtained in one source course can be applied to other different target courses with similar usage levels without losing prediction accuracy.</description>

      <title>The Cognitive Capabilities of Generative AI: A Comparative Analysis with Human Benchmarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is increasing interest in tracking the capabilities of general intelligence foundation models. This study benchmarks leading large language models and vision language models against human performance on the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS-IV), a comprehensive, population-normed assessment of underlying human cognition and intellectual abilities, with a focus on the domains of VerbalComprehension (VCI), Working Memory (WMI), and Perceptual Reasoning (PRI). Most models demonstrated exceptional capabilities in the storage, retrieval, and manipulation of tokens such as arbitrary sequences of letters and numbers, with performance on the Working Memory Index (WMI) greater or equal to the 99.5th percentile when compared to human population normative ability. Performance on the Verbal Comprehension Index (VCI) which measures retrieval of acquired information, and linguistic understanding about the meaning of words and their relationships to each other, also demonstrated consistent performance at or above the 98th percentile. Despite these broad strengths, we observed consistently poor performance on the Perceptual Reasoning Index (PRI; range 0.1-10th percentile) from multimodal models indicating profound inability to interpret and reason on visual information. Smaller and older model versions consistently performed worse, indicating that training data, parameter count and advances in tuning are resulting in significant advances in cognitive ability.</description>

      <title>Fostering Intrinsic Motivation in Reinforcement Learning with Pretrained Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exploration remains a significant challenge in reinforcement learning, especially in environments where extrinsic rewards are sparse or non-existent. The recent rise of foundation models, such as CLIP, offers an opportunity to leverage pretrained, semantically rich embeddings that encapsulate broad and reusable knowledge. In this work we explore the potential of these foundation models not just to drive exploration, but also to analyze the critical role of the episodic novelty term in enhancing exploration effectiveness of the agent. We also investigate whether providing the intrinsic module with complete state information -- rather than just partial observations -- can improve exploration, despite the difficulties in handling small variations within large state spaces. Our experiments in the MiniGrid domain reveal that intrinsic modules can effectively utilize full state information, significantly increasing sample efficiency while learning an optimal policy. Moreover, we show that the embeddings provided by foundation models are sometimes even better than those constructed by the agent during training, further accelerating the learning process, especially when coupled with the episodic novelty term to enhance exploration.</description>

      <title>WALL-E: World Alignment by Rule Learning Improves World Model-based LLM Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Can large language models (LLMs) directly serve as powerful world models for model-based agents? While the gaps between the prior knowledge of LLMs and the specified environment's dynamics do exist, our study reveals that the gaps can be bridged by aligning an LLM with its deployed environment and such "world alignment" can be efficiently achieved by rule learning on LLMs. Given the rich prior knowledge of LLMs, only a few additional rules suffice to align LLM predictions with the specified environment dynamics. To this end, we propose a neurosymbolic approach to learn these rules gradient-free through LLMs, by inducing, updating, and pruning rules based on comparisons of agent-explored trajectories and world model predictions. The resulting world model is composed of the LLM and the learned rules. Our embodied LLM agent "WALL-E" is built upon model-predictive control (MPC). By optimizing look-ahead actions based on the precise world model, MPC significantly improves exploration and learning efficiency. Compared to existing LLM agents, WALL-E's reasoning only requires a few principal rules rather than verbose buffered trajectories being included in the LLM input. On open-world challenges in Minecraft and ALFWorld, WALL-E achieves higher success rates than existing methods, with lower costs on replanning time and the number of tokens used for reasoning. In Minecraft, WALL-E exceeds baselines by 15-30% in success rate while costing 8-20 fewer replanning rounds and only 60-80% of tokens. In ALFWorld, its success rate surges to a new record high of 95% only after 6 iterations.</description>

      <title>COMMA: A Communicative Multimodal Multi-Agent Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advances of multi-modal agents built on large foundation models have largely overlooked their potential for language-based communication between agents in collaborative tasks. This oversight presents a critical gap in understanding their effectiveness in real-world deployments, particularly when communicating with humans. Existing agentic benchmarks fail to address key aspects of inter-agent communication and collaboration, particularly in scenarios where agents have unequal access to information and must work together to achieve tasks beyond the scope of individual capabilities. To fill this gap, we introduce a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the collaborative performance of multimodal multi-agent systems through language communication. Our benchmark features a variety of scenarios, providing a comprehensive evaluation across four key categories of agentic capability in a communicative collaboration setting. By testing both agent-agent and agent-human collaborations using open-source and closed-source models, our findings reveal surprising weaknesses in state-of-the-art models, including proprietary models like GPT-4o. These models struggle to outperform even a simple random agent baseline in agent-agent collaboration and only surpass the random baseline when a human is involved.</description>

      <title>Diversified and Adaptive Negative Sampling on Knowledge Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In knowledge graph embedding, aside from positive triplets (ie: facts in the knowledge graph), the negative triplets used for training also have a direct influence on the model performance. In reality, since knowledge graphs are sparse and incomplete, negative triplets often lack explicit labels, and thus they are often obtained from various sampling strategies (eg: randomly replacing an entity in a positive triplet). An ideal sampled negative triplet should be informative enough to help the model train better. However, existing methods often ignore diversity and adaptiveness in their sampling process, which harms the informativeness of negative triplets. As such, we propose a generative adversarial approach called Diversified and Adaptive Negative Sampling DANS on knowledge graphs. DANS is equipped with a two-way generator that generates more diverse negative triplets through two pathways, and an adaptive mechanism that produces more fine-grained examples by localizing the global generator for different entities and relations. On the one hand, the two-way generator increase the overall informativeness with more diverse negative examples; on the other hand, the adaptive mechanism increases the individual sample-wise informativeness with more fine-grained sampling. Finally, we evaluate the performance of DANS on three benchmark knowledge graphs to demonstrate its effectiveness through quantitative and qualitative experiments.</description>

      <title>Learning to Balance Altruism and Self-interest Based on Empathy in Mixed-Motive Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-world multi-agent scenarios often involve mixed motives, demanding altruistic agents capable of self-protection against potential exploitation. However, existing approaches often struggle to achieve both objectives. In this paper, based on that empathic responses are modulated by inferred social relationships between agents, we propose LASE Learning to balance Altruism and Self-interest based on Empathy), a distributed multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm that fosters altruistic cooperation through gifting while avoiding exploitation by other agents in mixed-motive games. LASE allocates a portion of its rewards to co-players as gifts, with this allocation adapting dynamically based on the social relationship -- a metric evaluating the friendliness of co-players estimated by counterfactual reasoning. In particular, social relationship measures each co-player by comparing the estimated $Q$-function of current joint action to a counterfactual baseline which marginalizes the co-player's action, with its action distribution inferred by a perspective-taking module. Comprehensive experiments are performed in spatially and temporally extended mixed-motive games, demonstrating LASE's ability to promote group collaboration without compromising fairness and its capacity to adapt policies to various types of interactive co-players.</description>

      <title>System-2 Reasoning via Generality and Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While significant progress has been made in task-specific applications, current models struggle with deep reasoning, generality, and adaptation -- key components of System-2 reasoning that are crucial for achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Despite the promise of approaches such as program synthesis, language models, and transformers, these methods often fail to generalize beyond their training data and to adapt to novel tasks, limiting their ability to perform human-like reasoning. This paper explores the limitations of existing approaches in achieving advanced System-2 reasoning and highlights the importance of generality and adaptation for AGI. Moreover, we propose four key research directions to address these gaps: (1) learning human intentions from action sequences, (2) combining symbolic and neural models, (3) meta-learning for unfamiliar environments, and (4) reinforcement learning to reason multi-step. Through these directions, we aim to advance the ability to generalize and adapt, bringing computational models closer to the reasoning capabilities required for AGI.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measures of voting power have been the subject of extensive research since the mid 1940s. More recently, similar measures of relative importance have been studied in other domains that include inconsistent knowledge bases, intensity of attacks in argumentation, different problems in the analysis of database management, and explainability. This paper demonstrates that all these examples are instantiations of computing measures of importance for a rather more general problem domain. The paper then shows that the best-known measures of importance can be computed for any reference set whenever one is given a monotonically increasing predicate that partitions the subsets of that reference set. As a consequence, the paper also proves that measures of importance can be devised in several domains, for some of which such measures have not yet been studied nor proposed. Furthermore, the paper highlights several research directions related with computing measures of importance.</description>

      <title>Executing Arithmetic: Fine-Tuning Large Language Models as Turing Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a wide range of natural language processing and reasoning tasks. However, their performance in the foundational domain of arithmetic remains unsatisfactory. When dealing with arithmetic tasks, LLMs often memorize specific examples rather than learning the underlying computational logic, limiting their ability to generalize to new problems. In this paper, we propose a Composable Arithmetic Execution Framework (CAEF) that enables LLMs to learn to execute step-by-step computations by emulating Turing Machines, thereby gaining a genuine understanding of computational logic. Moreover, the proposed framework is highly scalable, allowing composing learned operators to significantly reduce the difficulty of learning complex operators. In our evaluation, CAEF achieves nearly 100% accuracy across seven common mathematical operations on the LLaMA 3.1-8B model, effectively supporting computations involving operands with up to 100 digits, a level where GPT-4o falls short noticeably in some settings.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning for Generalised Planning with Background Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated planning is a form of declarative problem solving which has recently drawn attention from the machine learning (ML) community. ML has been applied to planning either as a way to test `reasoning capabilities' of architectures, or more pragmatically in an attempt to scale up solvers with learned domain knowledge. In practice, planning problems are easy to solve but hard to optimise. However, ML approaches still struggle to solve many problems that are often easy for both humans and classical planners. In this paper, we thus propose a new ML approach that allows users to specify background knowledge (BK) through Datalog rules to guide both the learning and planning processes in an integrated fashion. By incorporating BK, our approach bypasses the need to relearn how to solve problems from scratch and instead focuses the learning on plan quality optimisation. Experiments with BK demonstrate that our method successfully scales and learns to plan efficiently with high quality solutions from small training data generated in under 5 seconds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cognitive Architectures are the forefront of our research into developing an artificial cognition. However, they approach the problem from a separated memory and program model of computation. This model of computation poses a fundamental problem: the knowledge retrieval heuristic. In this paper we propose to solve this problem by using a new model of computation, one where the memory and the program are united: the Function-Representation. We propose a whole framework about how to implement and use these Function-Representations, and we explore their potential through mathematical definitions and proofs. We also talk about different ways to organise multiple Function-Representations, and explore the kind of functions that these Function-Representations can implement. Finally, we also explore the limitations of our proposal.</description>

      <title>Towards Assurance of LLM Adversarial Robustness using Ontology-Driven Argumentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the impressive adaptability of large language models (LLMs), challenges remain in ensuring their security, transparency, and interpretability. Given their susceptibility to adversarial attacks, LLMs need to be defended with an evolving combination of adversarial training and guardrails. However, managing the implicit and heterogeneous knowledge for continuously assuring robustness is difficult. We introduce a novel approach for assurance of the adversarial robustness of LLMs based on formal argumentation. Using ontologies for formalization, we structure state-of-the-art attacks and defenses, facilitating the creation of a human-readable assurance case, and a machine-readable representation. We demonstrate its application with examples in English language and code translation tasks, and provide implications for theory and practice, by targeting engineers, data scientists, users, and auditors.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Satisfaction of Temporal Logic Constraints in Reinforcement Learning via Adaptive Policy-Switching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Constrained Reinforcement Learning (CRL) is a subset of machine learning that introduces constraints into the traditional reinforcement learning (RL) framework. Unlike conventional RL which aims solely to maximize cumulative rewards, CRL incorporates additional constraints that represent specific mission requirements or limitations that the agent must comply with during the learning process. In this paper, we address a type of CRL problem where an agent aims to learn the optimal policy to maximize reward while ensuring a desired level of temporal logic constraint satisfaction throughout the learning process. We propose a novel framework that relies on switching between pure learning (reward maximization) and constraint satisfaction. This framework estimates the probability of constraint satisfaction based on earlier trials and properly adjusts the probability of switching between learning and constraint satisfaction policies. We theoretically validate the correctness of the proposed algorithm and demonstrate its performance and scalability through comprehensive simulations.</description>

      <title>The Computational Complexity of Circuit Discovery for Inner Interpretability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many proposed applications of neural networks in machine learning, cognitive/brain science, and society hinge on the feasibility of inner interpretability via circuit discovery. This calls for empirical and theoretical explorations of viable algorithmic options. Despite advances in the design and testing of heuristics, there are concerns about their scalability and faithfulness at a time when we lack understanding of the complexity properties of the problems they are deployed to solve. To address this, we study circuit discovery with classical and parameterized computational complexity theory: (1) we describe a conceptual scaffolding to reason about circuit finding queries in terms of affordances for description, explanation, prediction and control; (2) we formalize a comprehensive set of queries that capture mechanistic explanation, and propose a formal framework for their analysis; (3) we use it to settle the complexity of many query variants and relaxations of practical interest on multi-layer perceptrons (part of, e.g., transformers). Our findings reveal a challenging complexity landscape. Many queries are intractable (NP-hard, $\Sigma^p_2$-hard), remain fixed-parameter intractable (W[1]-hard) when constraining model/circuit features (e.g., depth), and are inapproximable under additive, multiplicative, and probabilistic approximation schemes. To navigate this landscape, we prove there exist transformations to tackle some of these hard problems (NP- vs. $\Sigma^p_2$-complete) with better-understood heuristics, and prove the tractability (PTIME) or fixed-parameter tractability (FPT) of more modest queries which retain useful affordances. This framework allows us to understand the scope and limits of interpretability queries, explore viable options, and compare their resource demands among existing and future architectures.</description>

      <title>SAKA: An Intelligent Platform for Semi-automated Knowledge Graph Construction and Application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowledge graph (KG) technology is extensively utilized in many areas, and many companies offer applications based on KG. Nonetheless, the majority of KG platforms necessitate expertise and tremendous time and effort of users to construct KG records manually, which poses great difficulties for ordinary people to use. Additionally, audio data is abundant and holds valuable information, but it is challenging to transform it into a KG. What's more, the platforms usually do not leverage the full potential of the KGs constructed by users. In this paper, we propose an intelligent and user-friendly platform for Semi-automated KG Construction and Application (SAKA) to address the problems aforementioned. Primarily, users can semi-automatically construct KGs from structured data of numerous areas by interacting with the platform, based on which multi-versions of KG can be stored, viewed, managed, and updated. Moreover, we propose an Audio-based KG Information Extraction (AGIE) method to establish KGs from audio data. Lastly, the platform creates a semantic parsing-based knowledge base question answering (KBQA) system based on the user-created KGs. We prove the feasibility of the semi-automatic KG construction method on the SAKA platform.</description>

      <title>A Generative AI Technique for Synthesizing a Digital Twin for U.S. Residential Solar Adoption and Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Residential rooftop solar adoption is considered crucial for reducing carbon emissions. The lack of photovoltaic (PV) data at a finer resolution (e.g., household, hourly levels) poses a significant roadblock to informed decision-making. We discuss a novel methodology to generate a highly granular, residential-scale realistic dataset for rooftop solar adoption across the contiguous United States. The data-driven methodology consists of: (i) integrated machine learning models to identify PV adopters, (ii) methods to augment the data using explainable AI techniques to glean insights about key features and their interactions, and (iii) methods to generate household-level hourly solar energy output using an analytical model. The resulting synthetic datasets are validated using real-world data and can serve as a digital twin for modeling downstream tasks. Finally, a policy-based case study utilizing the digital twin for Virginia demonstrated increased rooftop solar adoption with the 30\% Federal Solar Investment Tax Credit, especially in Low-to-Moderate-Income communities.</description>

      <title>Agent S: An Open Agentic Framework that Uses Computers Like a Human</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Agent S, an open agentic framework that enables autonomous interaction with computers through a Graphical User Interface (GUI), aimed at transforming human-computer interaction by automating complex, multi-step tasks. Agent S aims to address three key challenges in automating computer tasks: acquiring domain-specific knowledge, planning over long task horizons, and handling dynamic, non-uniform interfaces. To this end, Agent S introduces experience-augmented hierarchical planning, which learns from external knowledge search and internal experience retrieval at multiple levels, facilitating efficient task planning and subtask execution. In addition, it employs an Agent-Computer Interface (ACI) to better elicit the reasoning and control capabilities of GUI agents based on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Evaluation on the OSWorld benchmark shows that Agent S outperforms the baseline by 9.37% on success rate (an 83.6% relative improvement) and achieves a new state-of-the-art. Comprehensive analysis highlights the effectiveness of individual components and provides insights for future improvements. Furthermore, Agent S demonstrates broad generalizability to different operating systems on a newly-released WindowsAgentArena benchmark.

      <title>Evaluating Financial Relational Graphs: Interpretation Before Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate and robust stock trend forecasting has been a crucial and challenging task, as stock price changes are influenced by multiple factors. Graph neural network-based methods have recently achieved remarkable success in this domain by constructing stock relationship graphs that reflect internal factors and relationships between stocks. However, most of these methods rely on predefined factors to construct static stock relationship graphs due to the lack of suitable datasets, failing to capture the dynamic changes in stock relationships. Moreover, the evaluation of relationship graphs in these methods is often tied to the performance of neural network models on downstream tasks, leading to confusion and imprecision. To address these issues, we introduce the SPNews dataset, collected based on S\&amp;P 500 Index stocks, to facilitate the construction of dynamic relationship graphs. Furthermore, we propose a novel set of financial relationship graph evaluation methods that are independent of downstream tasks. By using the relationship graph to explain historical financial phenomena, we assess its validity before constructing a graph neural network, ensuring the graph's effectiveness in capturing relevant financial relationships. Experimental results demonstrate that our evaluation methods can effectively differentiate between various financial relationship graphs, yielding more interpretable results compared to traditional approaches. We make our source code publicly available on GitHub to promote reproducibility and further research in this area.</description>

Abstract: In high-energy particle physics, extracting information from complex detector signals is crucial for energy reconstruction. Recent advancements involve using deep learning to process calorimeter images from various sub-detectors in experiments like the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) for energy map reconstruction. This paper compares classical algorithms\-MLP, CNN, U-Net, and RNN\-with variants that include self-attention and 3D convolution modules to evaluate their effectiveness in reconstructing the initial energy distribution. Additionally, a test dataset of jet events is utilized to analyze and compare models' performance in handling anomalous high-energy events.

      <description>arXiv:2410.07265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid development of large language models (LLMs) has significantly transformed the field of artificial intelligence, demonstrating remarkable capabilities in natural language processing and moving towards multi-modal functionality. These models are increasingly integrated into diverse applications, impacting both research and industry. However, their development and deployment present substantial challenges, including the need for extensive computational resources, high energy consumption, and complex software optimizations. Unlike traditional deep learning systems, LLMs require unique optimization strategies for training and inference, focusing on system-level efficiency. This paper surveys hardware and software co-design approaches specifically tailored to address the unique characteristics and constraints of large language models. This survey analyzes the challenges and impacts of LLMs on hardware and algorithm research, exploring algorithm optimization, hardware design, and system-level innovations. It aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the trade-offs and considerations in LLM-centric computing systems, guiding future advancements in AI. Finally, we summarize the existing efforts in this space and outline future directions toward realizing production-grade co-design methodologies for the next generation of large language models and AI systems.</description>

      <title>Learning Content-Aware Multi-Modal Joint Input Pruning via Bird's-Eye-View Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the landscape of autonomous driving, Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) representation has recently garnered substantial academic attention, serving as a transformative framework for the fusion of multi-modal sensor inputs. This BEV paradigm effectively shifts the sensor fusion challenge from a rule-based methodology to a data-centric approach, thereby facilitating more nuanced feature extraction from an array of heterogeneous sensors. Notwithstanding its evident merits, the computational overhead associated with BEV-based techniques often mandates high-capacity hardware infrastructures, thus posing challenges for practical, real-world implementations. To mitigate this limitation, we introduce a novel content-aware multi-modal joint input pruning technique. Our method leverages BEV as a shared anchor to algorithmically identify and eliminate non-essential sensor regions prior to their introduction into the perception model's backbone. We validatethe efficacy of our approach through extensive experiments on the NuScenes dataset, demonstrating substantial computational efficiency without sacrificing perception accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first attempt to alleviate the computational burden from the input pruning point.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning for Surgical Instrument Recognition and Segmentation in Robotic-Assisted Surgeries: A Systematic Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Applying deep learning (DL) for annotating surgical instruments in robot-assisted minimally invasive surgeries (MIS) represents a significant advancement in surgical technology. This systematic review examines 48 studies that and advanced DL methods and architectures. These sophisticated DL models have shown notable improvements in the precision and efficiency of detecting and segmenting surgical tools. The enhanced capabilities of these models support various clinical applications, including real-time intraoperative guidance, comprehensive postoperative evaluations, and objective assessments of surgical skills. By accurately identifying and segmenting surgical instruments in video data, DL models provide detailed feedback to surgeons, thereby improving surgical outcomes and reducing complication risks. Furthermore, the application of DL in surgical education is transformative. The review underscores the significant impact of DL on improving the accuracy of skill assessments and the overall quality of surgical training programs. However, implementing DL in surgical tool detection and segmentation faces challenges, such as the need for large, accurately annotated datasets to train these models effectively. The manual annotation process is labor-intensive and time-consuming, posing a significant bottleneck. Future research should focus on automating the detection and segmentation process and enhancing the robustness of DL models against environmental variations. Expanding the application of DL models across various surgical specialties will be essential to fully realize this technology's potential. Integrating DL with other emerging technologies, such as augmented reality (AR), also offers promising opportunities to further enhance the precision and efficacy of surgical procedures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07271v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Program errors can occur in any type of programming, and can manifest in a variety of ways, such as unexpected output, crashes, or performance issues. And program error diagnosis can often be too abstract or technical for developers to understand, especially for beginners. The goal of this paper is to present a novel machine-learning approach for Multi-task Program Error Repair and Explanatory Diagnosis (mPRED). A pre-trained language model is used to encode the source code, and a downstream model is specifically designed to identify and repair errors. Programs and test cases will be augmented and optimized from several perspectives. Additionally, our approach incorporates a "chain of thoughts" method, which enables the models to produce intermediate reasoning explanations before providing the final correction. To aid in visualizing and analyzing the program structure, we use a graph neural network for program structure visualization. Overall, our approach offers a promising approach for repairing program errors across different programming languages and providing helpful explanations to programmers.</description>

      <title>Mitigation of gender bias in automatic facial non-verbal behaviors generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Research on non-verbal behavior generation for social interactive agents focuses mainly on the believability and synchronization of non-verbal cues with speech. However, existing models, predominantly based on deep learning architectures, often perpetuate biases inherent in the training data. This raises ethical concerns, depending on the intended application of these agents. This paper addresses these issues by first examining the influence of gender on facial non-verbal behaviors. We concentrate on gaze, head movements, and facial expressions. We introduce a classifier capable of discerning the gender of a speaker from their non-verbal cues. This classifier achieves high accuracy on both real behavior data, extracted using state-of-the-art tools, and synthetic data, generated from a model developed in previous work.Building upon this work, we present a new model, FairGenderGen, which integrates a gender discriminator and a gradient reversal layer into our previous behavior generation model. This new model generates facial non-verbal behaviors from speech features, mitigating gender sensitivity in the generated behaviors. Our experiments demonstrate that the classifier, developed in the initial phase, is no longer effective in distinguishing the gender of the speaker from the generated non-verbal behaviors.</description>

      <title>Swin-BERT: A Feature Fusion System designed for Speech-based Alzheimer's Dementia Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speech is usually used for constructing an automatic Alzheimer's dementia (AD) detection system, as the acoustic and linguistic abilities show a decline in people living with AD at the early stages. However, speech includes not only AD-related local and global information but also other information unrelated to cognitive status, such as age and gender. In this paper, we propose a speech-based system named Swin-BERT for automatic dementia detection. For the acoustic part, the shifted windows multi-head attention that proposed to extract local and global information from images, is used for designing our acoustic-based system. To decouple the effect of age and gender on acoustic feature extraction, they are used as an extra input of the designed acoustic system. For the linguistic part, the rhythm-related information, which varies significantly between people living with and without AD, is removed while transcribing the audio recordings into transcripts. To compensate for the removed rhythm-related information, the character-level transcripts are proposed to be used as the extra input of a word-level BERT-style system. Finally, the Swin-BERT combines the acoustic features learned from our proposed acoustic-based system with our linguistic-based system. The experiments are based on the two datasets provided by the international dementia detection challenges: the ADReSS and ADReSSo. The results show that both the proposed acoustic and linguistic systems can be better or comparable with previous research on the two datasets. Superior results are achieved by the proposed Swin-BERT system on the ADReSS and ADReSSo datasets, which are 85.58\% F-score and 87.32\% F-score respectively.</description>

      <title>Retrieval Replace Reduction: An effective visual token reduction method via semantic match</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong performance across various tasks without requiring training from scratch. However, they face significant computational and memory constraints, particularly when processing multimodal inputs that exceed context length, limiting their scalability. In this paper, we introduce a new approach, \textbf{TRSM} (\textbf{T}oken \textbf{R}eduction via \textbf{S}emantic \textbf{M}atch), which effectively reduces the number of visual tokens without compromising MLLM performance. Inspired by how humans process multimodal tasks, TRSM leverages semantic information from one modality to match relevant semantics in another, reducing the number of visual tokens.Specifically, to retain task relevant visual tokens, we use the text prompt as a query vector to retrieve the most similar vectors from the visual prompt and merge them with the text tokens. Based on experimental results, when applied to LLaVA-1.5\cite{liu2023}, our approach compresses the visual tokens by 20\%, achieving comparable performance across diverse visual question-answering and reasoning tasks.</description>

      <title>Prompt Infection: LLM-to-LLM Prompt Injection within Multi-Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) grow increasingly powerful, multi-agent systems are becoming more prevalent in modern AI applications. Most safety research, however, has focused on vulnerabilities in single-agent LLMs. These include prompt injection attacks, where malicious prompts embedded in external content trick the LLM into executing unintended or harmful actions, compromising the victim's application. In this paper, we reveal a more dangerous vector: LLM-to-LLM prompt injection within multi-agent systems. We introduce Prompt Infection, a novel attack where malicious prompts self-replicate across interconnected agents, behaving much like a computer virus. This attack poses severe threats, including data theft, scams, misinformation, and system-wide disruption, all while propagating silently through the system. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that multi-agent systems are highly susceptible, even when agents do not publicly share all communications. To address this, we propose LLM Tagging, a defense mechanism that, when combined with existing safeguards, significantly mitigates infection spread. This work underscores the urgent need for advanced security measures as multi-agent LLM systems become more widely adopted.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Data Heterogeneity Evaluation Approaches for Personalized Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is growing research interest in measuring the statistical heterogeneity of clients' local datasets. Such measurements are used to estimate the suitability for collaborative training of personalized federated learning (PFL) models. Currently, these research endeavors are taking place in silos and there is a lack of a unified benchmark to provide a fair and convenient comparison among various approaches in common settings. We aim to bridge this important gap in this paper. The proposed benchmarking framework currently includes six representative approaches. Extensive experiments have been conducted to compare these approaches under five standard non-IID FL settings, providing much needed insights into which approaches are advantageous under which settings. The proposed framework offers useful guidance on the suitability of various data divergence measures in FL systems. It is beneficial for keeping related research activities on the right track in terms of: (1) designing PFL schemes, (2) selecting appropriate data heterogeneity evaluation approaches for specific FL application scenarios, and (3) addressing fairness issues in collaborative model training.

      <title>Crafting desirable climate trajectories with RL explored socio-environmental simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Climate change poses an existential threat, necessitating effective climate policies to enact impactful change. Decisions in this domain are incredibly complex, involving conflicting entities and evidence. In the last decades, policymakers increasingly use simulations and computational methods to guide some of their decisions. Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) are one of such methods, which combine social, economic, and environmental simulations to forecast potential policy effects. For example, the UN uses outputs of IAMs for their recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports. Traditionally these have been solved using recursive equation solvers, but have several shortcomings, e.g. struggling at decision making under uncertainty. Recent preliminary work using Reinforcement Learning (RL) to replace the traditional solvers shows promising results in decision making in uncertain and noisy scenarios. We extend on this work by introducing multiple interacting RL agents as a preliminary analysis on modelling the complex interplay of socio-interactions between various stakeholders or nations that drives much of the current climate crisis. Our findings show that cooperative agents in this framework can consistently chart pathways towards more desirable futures in terms of reduced carbon emissions and improved economy. However, upon introducing competition between agents, for instance by using opposing reward functions, desirable climate futures are rarely reached. Modelling competition is key to increased realism in these simulations, as such we employ policy interpretation by visualising what states lead to more uncertain behaviour, to understand algorithm failure. Finally, we highlight the current limitations and avenues for further work to ensure future technology uptake for policy derivation.</description>

      <title>Principal Orthogonal Latent Components Analysis (POLCA Net)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07289v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Representation learning is a pivotal area in the field of machine learning, focusing on the development of methods to automatically discover the representations or features needed for a given task from raw data. Unlike traditional feature engineering, which requires manual crafting of features, representation learning aims to learn features that are more useful and relevant for tasks such as classification, prediction, and clustering. We introduce Principal Orthogonal Latent Components Analysis Network (POLCA Net), an approach to mimic and extend PCA and LDA capabilities to non-linear domains. POLCA Net combines an autoencoder framework with a set of specialized loss functions to achieve effective dimensionality reduction, orthogonality, variance-based feature sorting, high-fidelity reconstructions, and additionally, when used with classification labels, a latent representation well suited for linear classifiers and low dimensional visualization of class distribution as well.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Performance of Point Cloud Completion Networks with Consistency Loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Point cloud completion networks are conventionally trained to minimize the disparities between the completed point cloud and the ground-truth counterpart. However, an incomplete object-level point cloud can have multiple valid completion solutions when it is examined in isolation. This one-to-many mapping issue can cause contradictory supervision signals to the network because the loss function may produce different values for identical input-output pairs of the network. In many cases, this issue could adversely affect the network optimization process. In this work, we propose to enhance the conventional learning objective using a novel completion consistency loss to mitigate the one-to-many mapping problem. Specifically, the proposed consistency loss ensure that a point cloud completion network generates a coherent completion solution for incomplete objects originating from the same source point cloud. Experimental results across multiple well-established datasets and benchmarks demonstrated the proposed completion consistency loss have excellent capability to enhance the completion performance of various existing networks without any modification to the design of the networks. The proposed consistency loss enhances the performance of the point completion network without affecting the inference speed, thereby increasing the accuracy of point cloud completion. Notably, a state-of-the-art point completion network trained with the proposed consistency loss can achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on the challenging new MVP dataset. The code and result of experiment various point completion models using proposed consistency loss will be available at: https://github.com/kaist-avelab/ConsistencyLoss .</description>

      <title>Towards Generalisable Time Series Understanding Across Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In natural language processing and computer vision, self-supervised pre-training on large datasets unlocks foundational model capabilities across domains and tasks. However, this potential has not yet been realised in time series analysis, where existing methods disregard the heterogeneous nature of time series characteristics. Time series are prevalent in many domains, including medicine, engineering, natural sciences, and finance, but their characteristics vary significantly in terms of variate count, inter-variate relationships, temporal dynamics, and sampling frequency. This inherent heterogeneity across domains prevents effective pre-training on large time series corpora. To address this issue, we introduce OTiS, an open model for general time series analysis, that has been specifically designed to handle multi-domain heterogeneity. We propose a novel pre-training paradigm including a tokeniser with learnable domain-specific signatures, a dual masking strategy to capture temporal causality, and a normalised cross-correlation loss to model long-range dependencies. Our model is pre-trained on a large corpus of 640,187 samples and 11 billion time points spanning 8 distinct domains, enabling it to analyse time series from any (unseen) domain. In comprehensive experiments across 15 diverse applications - including classification, regression, and forecasting - OTiS showcases its ability to accurately capture domain-specific data characteristics and demonstrates its competitiveness against state-of-the-art baselines. Our code and pre-trained weights are publicly available at https://github.com/oetu/otis.</description>

      <title>The Moral Turing Test: Evaluating Human-LLM Alignment in Moral Decision-Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into society, their alignment with human morals is crucial. To better understand this alignment, we created a large corpus of human- and LLM-generated responses to various moral scenarios. We found a misalignment between human and LLM moral assessments; although both LLMs and humans tended to reject morally complex utilitarian dilemmas, LLMs were more sensitive to personal framing. We then conducted a quantitative user study involving 230 participants (N=230), who evaluated these responses by determining whether they were AI-generated and assessed their agreement with the responses. Human evaluators preferred LLMs' assessments in moral scenarios, though a systematic anti-AI bias was observed: participants were less likely to agree with judgments they believed to be machine-generated. Statistical and NLP-based analyses revealed subtle linguistic differences in responses, influencing detection and agreement. Overall, our findings highlight the complexities of human-AI perception in morally charged decision-making.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The demand of the halal food products is increasing rapidly around the world. The consumption of halal food product is just not among the Muslims but also among non-Muslims, due to the purity of the halal food products. However, there are several challenges that are faced by the halal food consumers. The challenges raise a doubt among the halal food consumers about the authenticity of the product being halal. Therefore, a solution that can address these issues and can establish trust between consumers and producers. Blockchain technology can provide a distributed ledger of an immutable record of the information. Artificial intelligence supports developing a solution for pattern identification. The proposed research utilizes blockchain an artificial intelligence-based system for developing a system that ensure the authenticity of the halal food products by providing the traceability related to all the operations and processes of the supply chain and sourcing the raw material. The proposed system has been tested with a local supermarket. The results and tests of the developed solution seemed effective and the testers expressed interest in real-world implementation of the proposed system.</description>

      <title>DA-Code: Agent Data Science Code Generation Benchmark for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce DA-Code, a code generation benchmark specifically designed to assess LLMs on agent-based data science tasks. This benchmark features three core elements: First, the tasks within DA-Code are inherently challenging, setting them apart from traditional code generation tasks and demanding advanced coding skills in grounding and planning. Second, examples in DA-Code are all based on real and diverse data, covering a wide range of complex data wrangling and analytics tasks. Third, to solve the tasks, the models must utilize complex data science programming languages, to perform intricate data processing and derive the answers. We set up the benchmark in a controllable and executable environment that aligns with real-world data analysis scenarios and is scalable. The annotators meticulously design the evaluation suite to ensure the accuracy and robustness of the evaluation. We develop the DA-Agent baseline. Experiments show that although the baseline performs better than other existing frameworks, using the current best LLMs achieves only 30.5% accuracy, leaving ample room for improvement. We release our benchmark at [https://da-code-bench.github.io](https://da-code-bench.github.io).</description>

      <title>Positive-Augmented Contrastive Learning for Vision-and-Language Evaluation and Training</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite significant advancements in caption generation, existing evaluation metrics often fail to capture the full quality or fine-grained details of captions. This is mainly due to their reliance on non-specific human-written references or noisy pre-training data. Still, finding an effective metric is crucial not only for captions evaluation but also for the generation phase. Metrics can indeed play a key role in the fine-tuning stage of captioning models, ultimately enhancing the quality of the generated captions. In this paper, we propose PAC-S++, a learnable metric that leverages the CLIP model, pre-trained on both web-collected and cleaned data and regularized through additional pairs of generated visual and textual positive samples. Exploiting this stronger and curated pre-training, we also apply PAC-S++ as a reward in the Self-Critical Sequence Training (SCST) stage typically employed to fine-tune captioning models. Extensive experiments on different image and video datasets highlight the effectiveness of PAC-S++ compared to popular metrics for the task, including its sensitivity to object hallucinations. Furthermore, we show that integrating PAC-S++ into the fine-tuning stage of a captioning model results in semantically richer captions with fewer repetitions and grammatical errors. Evaluations on out-of-domain benchmarks further demonstrate the efficacy of our fine-tuning approach in enhancing model capabilities.

      <title>MoE++: Accelerating Mixture-of-Experts Methods with Zero-Computation Experts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we aim to simultaneously enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) methods. To achieve this, we propose MoE++, a general and heterogeneous MoE framework that integrates both Feed-Forward Network~(FFN) and zero-computation experts. Specifically, we introduce three types of zero-computation experts: the zero expert, copy expert, and constant expert, which correspond to discard, skip, and replace operations, respectively. This design offers three key advantages: (i) Low Computing Overhead: Unlike the uniform mixing mechanism for all tokens within vanilla MoE, MoE++ allows each token to engage with a dynamic number of FFNs, be adjusted by constant vectors, or even skip the MoE layer entirely. (ii) High Performance: By enabling simple tokens to utilize fewer FFN experts, MoE++ allows more experts to focus on challenging tokens, thereby unlocking greater performance potential than vanilla MoE. (iii) Deployment Friendly: Given that zero-computation experts have negligible parameters, we can deploy all zero-computation experts on each GPU, eliminating the significant communication overhead and expert load imbalance associated with FFN experts distributed across different GPUs. Moreover, we leverage gating residuals, enabling each token to consider the pathway taken in the previous layer when selecting the appropriate experts. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that MoE++ achieves better performance while delivering 1.1-2.1x expert forward throughput compared to a vanilla MoE model of the same size, which lays a solid foundation for developing advanced and efficient MoE-related models.</description>

      <title>Unlocking Real-Time Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging: Multi-Pixel Parallelism for FPGA-Accelerated Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLI) is a widely used technique in the biomedical field for measuring the decay times of fluorescent molecules, providing insights into metabolic states, protein interactions, and ligand-receptor bindings. However, its broader application in fast biological processes, such as dynamic activity monitoring, and clinical use, such as in guided surgery, is limited by long data acquisition times and computationally demanding data processing. While deep learning has reduced post-processing times, time-resolved data acquisition remains a bottleneck for real-time applications. To address this, we propose a method to achieve real-time FLI using an FPGA-based hardware accelerator. Specifically, we implemented a GRU-based sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) model on an FPGA board compatible with time-resolved cameras. The GRU model balances accurate processing with the resource constraints of FPGAs, which have limited DSP units and BRAM. The limited memory and computational resources on the FPGA require efficient scheduling of operations and memory allocation to deploy deep learning models for low-latency applications. We address these challenges by using STOMP, a queue-based discrete-event simulator that automates and optimizes task scheduling and memory management on hardware. By integrating a GRU-based Seq2Seq model and its compressed version, called Seq2SeqLite, generated through knowledge distillation, we were able to process multiple pixels in parallel, reducing latency compared to sequential processing. We explore various levels of parallelism to achieve an optimal balance between performance and resource utilization. Our results indicate that the proposed techniques achieved a 17.7x and 52.0x speedup over manual scheduling for the Seq2Seq model and the Seq2SeqLite model, respectively.</description>

Abstract: Audio deepfake detection is crucial to combat the malicious use of AI-synthesized speech. Among many efforts undertaken by the community, the ASVspoof challenge has become one of the benchmarks to evaluate the generalizability and robustness of detection models. In this paper, we present Reality Defender's submission to the ASVspoof5 challenge, highlighting a novel pretraining strategy which significantly improves generalizability while maintaining low computational cost during training. Our system SLIM learns the style-linguistics dependency embeddings from various types of bonafide speech using self-supervised contrastive learning. The learned embeddings help to discriminate spoof from bonafide speech by focusing on the relationship between the style and linguistics aspects. We evaluated our system on ASVspoof5, ASV2019, and In-the-wild. Our submission achieved minDCF of 0.1499 and EER of 5.5% on ASVspoof5 Track 1, and EER of 7.4% and 10.8% on ASV2019 and In-the-wild respectively.</description>

      <title>SparseGrad: A Selective Method for Efficient Fine-tuning of MLP Layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The performance of Transformer models has been enhanced by increasing the number of parameters and the length of the processed text. Consequently, fine-tuning the entire model becomes a memory-intensive process. High-performance methods for parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) typically work with Attention blocks and often overlook MLP blocks, which contain about half of the model parameters. We propose a new selective PEFT method, namely SparseGrad, that performs well on MLP blocks. We transfer layer gradients to a space where only about 1\% of the layer's elements remain significant. By converting gradients into a sparse structure, we reduce the number of updated parameters. We apply SparseGrad to fine-tune BERT and RoBERTa for the NLU task and LLaMa-2 for the Question-Answering task. In these experiments, with identical memory requirements, our method outperforms LoRA and MeProp, robust popular state-of-the-art PEFT approaches.</description>

      <title>LLM Embeddings Improve Test-time Adaptation to Tabular $Y|X$-Shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For tabular datasets, the change in the relationship between the label and covariates ($Y|X$-shifts) is common due to missing variables (a.k.a. confounders). Since it is impossible to generalize to a completely new and unknown domain, we study models that are easy to adapt to the target domain even with few labeled examples. We focus on building more informative representations of tabular data that can mitigate $Y|X$-shifts, and propose to leverage the prior world knowledge in LLMs by serializing (write down) the tabular data to encode it. We find LLM embeddings alone provide inconsistent improvements in robustness, but models trained on them can be well adapted/finetuned to the target domain even using 32 labeled observations. Our finding is based on a comprehensive and systematic study consisting of 7650 source-target pairs and benchmark against 261,000 model configurations trained by 22 algorithms. Our observation holds when ablating the size of accessible target data and different adaptation strategies. The code is available at https://github.com/namkoong-lab/LLM-Tabular-Shifts.</description>

      <title>Exploring Efficient Foundational Multi-modal Models for Video Summarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Foundational models are able to generate text outputs given prompt instructions and text, audio, or image inputs. Recently these models have been combined to perform tasks on video, such as video summarization. Such video foundation models perform pre-training by aligning outputs from each modality-specific model into the same embedding space. Then the embeddings from each model are used within a language model, which is fine-tuned on a desired instruction set. Aligning each modality during pre-training is computationally expensive and prevents rapid testing of different base modality models. During fine-tuning, evaluation is carried out within in-domain videos where it is hard to understand the generalizability and data efficiency of these methods. To alleviate these issues we propose a plug-and-play video language model. It directly uses the texts generated from each input modality into the language model, avoiding pre-training alignment overhead. Instead of fine-tuning we leverage few-shot instruction adaptation strategies. We compare the performance versus the computational costs for our plug-and-play style method and baseline tuning methods. Finally, we explore the generalizability of each method during domain shift and present insights on what data is useful when training data is limited. Through this analysis, we present practical insights on how to leverage multi-modal foundational models for effective results given realistic compute and data limitations.</description>

      <title>CAFEEN: A Cooperative Approach for Energy Efficient NoCs with Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In emerging high-performance Network-on-Chip (NoC) architectures, efficient power management is crucial to minimize energy consumption. We propose a novel framework called CAFEEN that employs both heuristic-based fine-grained and machine learning-based coarse-grained power-gating for energy-efficient NoCs. CAFEEN uses a fine-grained method to activate only essential NoC buffers during lower network loads. It switches to a coarse-grained method at peak loads to minimize compounding wake-up overhead using multi-agent reinforcement learning. Results show that CAFEEN adaptively balances power-efficiency with performance, reducing total energy by 2.60x for single application workloads and 4.37x for multi-application workloads, compared to state-of-the-art NoC power-gating frameworks.</description>

      <title>Can Transformers Reason Logically? A Study in SAT Solving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically and empirically study the logical reasoning capabilities of LLMs in the context of the Boolean satisfiability (SAT) problem. First, we construct a decoder-only Transformer that can solve SAT using backtracking and deduction via Chain-of-Thought (CoT). We prove its correctness by showing trace equivalence to the well-known DPLL SAT-solving algorithm. Second, to support the implementation of this abstract construction, we design a compiler $\texttt{PARAT}$ that takes as input a procedural specification and outputs a transformer model implementing this specification. Third, rather than $\textit{programming}$ a transformer to reason, we evaluate empirically whether it can be $\textit{trained}$ to do so by learning directly from algorithmic traces ("reasoning paths") of the DPLL algorithm.</description>

      <title>Zero-Shot Generalization of Vision-Based RL Without Data Augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generalizing vision-based reinforcement learning (RL) agents to novel environments remains a difficult and open challenge. Current trends are to collect large-scale datasets or use data augmentation techniques to prevent overfitting and improve downstream generalization. However, the computational and data collection costs increase exponentially with the number of task variations and can destabilize the already difficult task of training RL agents. In this work, we take inspiration from recent advances in computational neuroscience and propose a model, Associative Latent DisentAnglement (ALDA), that builds on standard off-policy RL towards zero-shot generalization. Specifically, we revisit the role of latent disentanglement in RL and show how combining it with a model of associative memory achieves zero-shot generalization on difficult task variations without relying on data augmentation. Finally, we formally show that data augmentation techniques are a form of weak disentanglement and discuss the implications of this insight.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Prior research has demonstrated the effectiveness of end-to-end deep learning for robotic navigation, where the control signals are directly derived from raw sensory data. However, the majority of existing end-to-end navigation solutions are predominantly camera-based. In this paper, we introduce TinyLidarNet, a lightweight 2D LiDAR-based end-to-end deep learning model for autonomous racing. An F1TENTH vehicle using TinyLidarNet won 3rd place in the 12th F1TENTH Autonomous Grand Prix competition, demonstrating its competitive performance. We systematically analyze its performance on untrained tracks and computing requirements for real-time processing. We find that TinyLidarNet's 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based architecture significantly outperforms widely used Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) based architecture. In addition, we show that it can be processed in real-time on low-end micro-controller units (MCUs).</description>

      <title>SEAL: Safety-enhanced Aligned LLM Fine-tuning via Bilevel Data Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fine-tuning on task-specific data to boost downstream performance is a crucial step for leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs). However, previous studies have demonstrated that fine-tuning the models on several adversarial samples or even benign data can greatly comprise the model's pre-equipped alignment and safety capabilities. In this work, we propose SEAL, a novel framework to enhance safety in LLM fine-tuning. SEAL learns a data ranker based on the bilevel optimization to up rank the safe and high-quality fine-tuning data and down rank the unsafe or low-quality ones. Models trained with SEAL demonstrate superior quality over multiple baselines, with 8.5% and 9.7% win rate increase compared to random selection respectively on Llama-3-8b-Instruct and Merlinite-7b models. Our code is available on github https://github.com/hanshen95/SEAL.</description>

      <title>Exploring the design space of deep-learning-based weather forecasting systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite tremendous progress in developing deep-learning-based weather forecasting systems, their design space, including the impact of different design choices, is yet to be well understood. This paper aims to fill this knowledge gap by systematically analyzing these choices including architecture, problem formulation, pretraining scheme, use of image-based pretrained models, loss functions, noise injection, multi-step inputs, additional static masks, multi-step finetuning (including larger stride models), as well as training on a larger dataset. We study fixed-grid architectures such as UNet, fully convolutional architectures, and transformer-based models, along with grid-invariant architectures, including graph-based and operator-based models. Our results show that fixed-grid architectures outperform grid-invariant architectures, indicating a need for further architectural developments in grid-invariant models such as neural operators. We therefore propose a hybrid system that combines the strong performance of fixed-grid models with the flexibility of grid-invariant architectures. We further show that multi-step fine-tuning is essential for most deep-learning models to work well in practice, which has been a common practice in the past. Pretraining objectives degrade performance in comparison to supervised training, while image-based pretrained models provide useful inductive biases in some cases in comparison to training the model from scratch. Interestingly, we see a strong positive effect of using a larger dataset when training a smaller model as compared to training on a smaller dataset for longer. Larger models, on the other hand, primarily benefit from just an increase in the computational budget. We believe that these results will aid in the design of better weather forecasting systems in the future.</description>

      <title>Dense Optimizer : An Information Entropy-Guided Structural Search Method for Dense-like Neural Network Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dense Convolutional Network has been continuously refined to adopt a highly efficient and compact architecture, owing to its lightweight and efficient structure. However, the current Dense-like architectures are mainly designed manually, it becomes increasingly difficult to adjust the channels and reuse level based on past experience. As such, we propose an architecture search method called Dense Optimizer that can search high-performance dense-like network automatically. In Dense Optimizer, we view the dense network as a hierarchical information system, maximize the network's information entropy while constraining the distribution of the entropy across each stage via a power law, thereby constructing an optimization problem. We also propose a branch-and-bound optimization algorithm, tightly integrates power-law principle with search space scaling to solve the optimization problem efficiently. The superiority of Dense Optimizer has been validated on different computer vision benchmark datasets. Specifically, Dense Optimizer completes high-quality search but only costs 4 hours with one CPU. Our searched model DenseNet-OPT achieved a top 1 accuracy of 84.3% on CIFAR-100, which is 5.97% higher than the original one.</description>

Abstract: Factors are a foundational component of legal analysis and computational models of legal reasoning. These factor-based representations enable lawyers, judges, and AI and Law researchers to reason about legal cases. In this paper, we introduce a methodology that leverages large language models (LLMs) to discover lists of factors that effectively represent a legal domain. Our method takes as input raw court opinions and produces a set of factors and associated definitions. We demonstrate that a semi-automated approach, incorporating minimal human involvement, produces factor representations that can predict case outcomes with moderate success, if not yet as well as expert-defined factors can.</description>

      <title>CrossQuant: A Post-Training Quantization Method with Smaller Quantization Kernel for Precise Large Language Model Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) is an effective technique for compressing Large Language Models (LLMs). While many studies focus on quantizing both weights and activations, it is still a challenge to maintain the accuracy of LLM after activating quantization. To investigate the primary cause, we extend the concept of kernel from linear algebra to quantization functions to define a new term, "quantization kernel", which refers to the set of elements in activations that are quantized to zero. Through quantitative analysis of the quantization kernel, we find that these elements are crucial for maintaining the accuracy of quantized LLMs. With the decrease of quantization kernel, the precision of quantized LLMs increases. If the quantization kernel proportion is kept below 19% for OPT models and below 1% for LLaMA models, the precision loss from quantizing activations to INT8 becomes negligible. Motivated by the goal of developing a quantization method with small quantization kernel, we propose CrossQuant: a simple yet effective method for quantizing activations. CrossQuant cross-quantizes elements using row and column-wise absolute maximum vectors, achieving a quantization kernel of approximately 16% for OPT models and less than 0.1% for LLaMA models. Experimental results on LLMs (LLaMA, OPT) ranging from 6.7B to 70B parameters demonstrate that CrossQuant improves or maintains perplexity and accuracy in language modeling, zero-shot, and few-shot tasks.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary Contrastive Distillation for Language Model Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability of large language models (LLMs) to execute complex instructions is essential for their real-world applications. However, several recent studies indicate that LLMs struggle with challenging instructions. In this paper, we propose Evolutionary Contrastive Distillation (ECD), a novel method for generating high-quality synthetic preference data designed to enhance the complex instruction-following capability of language models. ECD generates data that specifically illustrates the difference between a response that successfully follows a set of complex instructions and a response that is high-quality, but nevertheless makes some subtle mistakes. This is done by prompting LLMs to progressively evolve simple instructions to more complex instructions. When the complexity of an instruction is increased, the original successful response to the original instruction becomes a "hard negative" response for the new instruction, mostly meeting requirements of the new instruction, but barely missing one or two. By pairing a good response with such a hard negative response, and employing contrastive learning algorithms such as DPO, we improve language models' ability to follow complex instructions. Empirically, we observe that our method yields a 7B model that exceeds the complex instruction-following performance of current SOTA 7B models and is competitive even with open-source 70B models.</description>

      <title>DemoShapley: Valuation of Demonstrations for In-Context Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) leveraging in-context learning (ICL) have set new benchmarks in few-shot learning across various tasks without needing task-specific fine-tuning. However, extensive research has demonstrated that the effectiveness of ICL is significantly influenced by the selection and ordering of demonstrations. Considering the critical role of demonstration selection in ICL, we introduce DemoShapley which is inspired by the Data Shapley valuation theorem. This approach assesses the influence of individual demonstration instances, distinguishing between those that contribute positively and those that may hinder performance. Our findings reveal that DemoShapley not only enhances model performance in terms of accuracy and fairness but also generalizes queries from domains distinct from those of the in-context demonstrations, highlighting its versatility and effectiveness in optimizing ICL demonstration selection. Last but not least, DemoShapley demonstrates its ability to aid in identifying noisy data within the demonstration set.</description>

      <title>Upcycling Large Language Models into Mixture of Experts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Upcycling pre-trained dense language models into sparse mixture-of-experts (MoE) models is an efficient approach to increase the model capacity of already trained models. However, optimal techniques for upcycling at scale remain unclear. In this work, we conduct an extensive study of upcycling methods and hyperparameters for billion-parameter scale language models. We propose a novel "virtual group" initialization scheme and weight scaling approach to enable upcycling into fine-grained MoE architectures. Through ablations, we find that upcycling outperforms continued dense model training. In addition, we show that softmax-then-topK expert routing improves over topK-then-softmax approach and higher granularity MoEs can help improve accuracy. Finally, we upcycled Nemotron-4 15B on 1T tokens and compared it to a continuously trained version of the same model on the same 1T tokens: the continuous trained model achieved 65.3% MMLU, whereas the upcycled model achieved 67.6%. Our results offer insights and best practices to effectively leverage upcycling for building MoE language models.</description>

      <title>Offline Inverse Constrained Reinforcement Learning for Safe-Critical Decision Making in Healthcare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) applied in healthcare can lead to unsafe medical decisions and treatment, such as excessive dosages or abrupt changes, often due to agents overlooking common-sense constraints. Consequently, Constrained Reinforcement Learning (CRL) is a natural choice for safe decisions. However, specifying the exact cost function is inherently difficult in healthcare. Recent Inverse Constrained Reinforcement Learning (ICRL) is a promising approach that infers constraints from expert demonstrations. ICRL algorithms model Markovian decisions in an interactive environment. These settings do not align with the practical requirement of a decision-making system in healthcare, where decisions rely on historical treatment recorded in an offline dataset. To tackle these issues, we propose the Constraint Transformer (CT). Specifically, 1) we utilize a causal attention mechanism to incorporate historical decisions and observations into the constraint modeling, while employing a Non-Markovian layer for weighted constraints to capture critical states. 2) A generative world model is used to perform exploratory data augmentation, enabling offline RL methods to simulate unsafe decision sequences. In multiple medical scenarios, empirical results demonstrate that CT can capture unsafe states and achieve strategies that approximate lower mortality rates, reducing the occurrence probability of unsafe behaviors.</description>

      <title>MKGL: Mastery of a Three-Word Language</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced performance across a spectrum of natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Yet, their application to knowledge graphs (KGs), which describe facts in the form of triplets and allow minimal hallucinations, remains an underexplored frontier. In this paper, we investigate the integration of LLMs with KGs by introducing a specialized KG Language (KGL), where a sentence precisely consists of an entity noun, a relation verb, and ends with another entity noun. Despite KGL's unfamiliar vocabulary to the LLM, we facilitate its learning through a tailored dictionary and illustrative sentences, and enhance context understanding via real-time KG context retrieval and KGL token embedding augmentation. Our results reveal that LLMs can achieve fluency in KGL, drastically reducing errors compared to conventional KG embedding methods on KG completion. Furthermore, our enhanced LLM shows exceptional competence in generating accurate three-word sentences from an initial entity and interpreting new unseen terms out of KGs.</description>

      <title>Audio Explanation Synthesis with Generative Foundation Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing success of audio foundation models across various tasks has led to a growing need for improved interpretability to understand their intricate decision-making processes better. Existing methods primarily focus on explaining these models by attributing importance to elements within the input space based on their influence on the final decision. In this paper, we introduce a novel audio explanation method that capitalises on the generative capacity of audio foundation models. Our method leverages the intrinsic representational power of the embedding space within these models by integrating established feature attribution techniques to identify significant features in this space. The method then generates listenable audio explanations by prioritising the most important features. Through rigorous benchmarking against standard datasets, including keyword spotting and speech emotion recognition, our model demonstrates its efficacy in producing audio explanations.</description>

      <title>Reducing the Cost of Dropout in Flash-Attention by Hiding RNG with GEMM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dropout, a network operator, when enabled is likely to dramatically impact the performance of Flash-Attention, which in turn increases the end-to-end training time of Large-Language-Models (LLMs). The main contributor to such performance degradation is the Random Number Generation (RNG) phase that is traditionally fused into the Flash-Attention kernel. As RNG and Attention have the same hardware bottlenecks, RNG latency can hardly be hidden within the Attention kernel.
  We propose overlapping RNG with previous GEMM layers in the network to hide RNG runtime and improve end-to-end performance. RNG and GEMM have distinct resource requirements and hardware bottlenecks, so they can run in parallel without compromising each other's performance. Our fine-grained performance model, cross-validated by silicon results, shows 1.14x speedup on one transformer block (including multi-head attention and feed-forward layers) for Llama2, and up to 1.23x speedup when varying workload sizes, on GH100 GPUs with FP8 precision. Further, we extend our theoretical model to different RNG implementations and hardware architectures, and discuss the widely applicable benefits for overlapping RNG with GEMM layers.</description>

      <title>Efficient Generation of Molecular Clusters with Dual-Scale Equivariant Flow Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Amorphous molecular solids offer a promising alternative to inorganic semiconductors, owing to their mechanical flexibility and solution processability. The packing structure of these materials plays a crucial role in determining their electronic and transport properties, which are key to enhancing the efficiency of devices like organic solar cells (OSCs). However, obtaining these optoelectronic properties computationally requires molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to generate a conformational ensemble, a process that can be computationally expensive due to the large system sizes involved. Recent advances have focused on using generative models, particularly flow-based models as Boltzmann generators, to improve the efficiency of MD sampling. In this work, we developed a dual-scale flow matching method that separates training and inference into coarse-grained and all-atom stages and enhances both the accuracy and efficiency of standard flow matching samplers. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method on a dataset of Y6 molecular clusters obtained through MD simulations, and we benchmark its efficiency and accuracy against single-scale flow matching methods.</description>

      <title>Generalizable Indoor Human Activity Recognition Method Based on Micro-Doppler Corner Point Cloud and Dynamic Graph Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Through-the-wall radar (TWR) human activity recognition can be achieved by fusing micro-Doppler signature extraction and intelligent decision-making algorithms. However, limited by the insufficient priori of tester in practical indoor scenarios, the trained models on one tester are commonly difficult to inference well on other testers, which causes poor generalization ability. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a generalizable indoor human activity recognition method based on micro-Doppler corner point cloud and dynamic graph learning. In the proposed method, DoG-{\mu}D-CornerDet is used for micro-Doppler corner extraction on two types of radar profiles. Then, a micro-Doppler corner filtering method based on polynomial fitting smoothing is proposed to maximize the feature distance under the constraints of the kinematic model. The extracted corners from the two types of radar profiles are concatenated together into three-dimensional point cloud. Finally, the paper proposes a dynamic graph neural network (DGNN)-based recognition method for data-to-activity label mapping. Visualization, comparison and ablation experiments are carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results prove that the proposed method has strong generalization ability on radar data collected from different testers.</description>

      <title>Generalization Ability Analysis of Through-the-Wall Radar Human Activity Recognition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Through-the-Wall radar (TWR) human activity recognition (HAR) is a technology that uses low-frequency ultra-wideband (UWB) signal to detect and analyze indoor human motion. However, the high dependence of existing end-to-end recognition models on the distribution of TWR training data makes it difficult to achieve good generalization across different indoor testers. In this regard, the generalization ability of TWR HAR is analyzed in this paper. In detail, an end-to-end linear neural network method for TWR HAR and its generalization error bound are first discussed. Second, a micro-Doppler corner representation method and the change of the generalization error before and after dimension reduction are presented. The appropriateness of the theoretical generalization errors is proved through numerical simulations and experiments. The results demonstrate that feature dimension reduction is effective in allowing recognition models to generalize across different indoor testers.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive Online Training and Deployment for Spiking Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are considered to have enormous potential in the future development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) due to their brain-inspired and energy-efficient properties. In the current supervised learning domain of SNNs, compared to vanilla Spatial-Temporal Back-propagation (STBP) training, online training can effectively overcome the risk of GPU memory explosion and has received widespread academic attention. However, the current proposed online training methods cannot tackle the inseparability problem of temporal dependent gradients and merely aim to optimize the training memory, resulting in no performance advantages compared to the STBP training models in the inference phase. To address the aforementioned challenges, we propose Efficient Multi-Precision Firing (EM-PF) model, which is a family of advanced spiking models based on floating-point spikes and binary synaptic weights. We point out that EM-PF model can effectively separate temporal gradients and achieve full-stage optimization towards computation speed and memory footprint. Experimental results have demonstrated that EM-PF model can be flexibly combined with various techniques including random back-propagation, parallel computation and channel attention mechanism, to achieve state-of-the-art performance with extremely low computational overhead in the field of online learning.</description>

      <title>OneNet: A Fine-Tuning Free Framework for Few-Shot Entity Linking via Large Language Model Prompting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entity Linking (EL) is the process of associating ambiguous textual mentions to specific entities in a knowledge base. Traditional EL methods heavily rely on large datasets to enhance their performance, a dependency that becomes problematic in the context of few-shot entity linking, where only a limited number of examples are available for training. To address this challenge, we present OneNet, an innovative framework that utilizes the few-shot learning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) without the need for fine-tuning. To the best of our knowledge, this marks a pioneering approach to applying LLMs to few-shot entity linking tasks. OneNet is structured around three key components prompted by LLMs: (1) an entity reduction processor that simplifies inputs by summarizing and filtering out irrelevant entities, (2) a dual-perspective entity linker that combines contextual cues and prior knowledge for precise entity linking, and (3) an entity consensus judger that employs a unique consistency algorithm to alleviate the hallucination in the entity linking reasoning. Comprehensive evaluations across seven benchmark datasets reveal that OneNet outperforms current state-of-the-art entity linking methods.</description>

      <title>KRAG Framework for Enhancing LLMs in the Legal Domain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces Knowledge Representation Augmented Generation (KRAG), a novel framework designed to enhance the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) within domain-specific applications. KRAG points to the strategic inclusion of critical knowledge entities and relationships that are typically absent in standard data sets and which LLMs do not inherently learn. In the context of legal applications, we present Soft PROLEG, an implementation model under KRAG, which uses inference graphs to aid LLMs in delivering structured legal reasoning, argumentation, and explanations tailored to user inquiries. The integration of KRAG, either as a standalone framework or in tandem with retrieval augmented generation (RAG), markedly improves the ability of language models to navigate and solve the intricate challenges posed by legal texts and terminologies. This paper details KRAG's methodology, its implementation through Soft PROLEG, and potential broader applications, underscoring its significant role in advancing natural language understanding and processing in specialized knowledge domains.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a neural architecture finetuned for the task of scenario context generation: The relevant location and time of an event or entity mentioned in text. Contextualizing information extraction helps to scope the validity of automated finings when aggregating them as knowledge graphs. Our approach uses a high-quality curated dataset of time and location annotations in a corpus of epidemiology papers to train an encoder-decoder architecture. We also explored the use of data augmentation techniques during training. Our findings suggest that a relatively small fine-tuned encoder-decoder model performs better than out-of-the-box LLMs and semantic role labeling parsers to accurate predict the relevant scenario information of a particular entity or event.</description>

      <title>Detecting Training Data of Large Language Models via Expectation Maximization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The widespread deployment of large language models (LLMs) has led to impressive advancements, yet information about their training data, a critical factor in their performance, remains undisclosed. Membership inference attacks (MIAs) aim to determine whether a specific instance was part of a target model's training data. MIAs can offer insights into LLM outputs and help detect and address concerns such as data contamination and compliance with privacy and copyright standards. However, applying MIAs to LLMs presents unique challenges due to the massive scale of pre-training data and the ambiguous nature of membership. Additionally, creating appropriate benchmarks to evaluate MIA methods is not straightforward, as training and test data distributions are often unknown. In this paper, we introduce EM-MIA, a novel MIA method for LLMs that iteratively refines membership scores and prefix scores via an expectation-maximization algorithm, leveraging the duality that the estimates of these scores can be improved by each other. Membership scores and prefix scores assess how each instance is likely to be a member and discriminative as a prefix, respectively. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results on the WikiMIA dataset. To further evaluate EM-MIA, we present OLMoMIA, a benchmark built from OLMo resources, which allows us to control the difficulty of MIA tasks with varying degrees of overlap between training and test data distributions. We believe that EM-MIA serves as a robust MIA method for LLMs and that OLMoMIA provides a valuable resource for comprehensively evaluating MIA approaches, thereby driving future research in this critical area.</description>

      <title>A Unified Debiasing Approach for Vision-Language Models across Modalities and Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have enabled complex multimodal tasks by processing text and image data simultaneously, significantly enhancing the field of artificial intelligence. However, these models often exhibit biases that can skew outputs towards societal stereotypes, thus necessitating debiasing strategies. Existing debiasing methods focus narrowly on specific modalities or tasks, and require extensive retraining. To address these limitations, this paper introduces Selective Feature Imputation for Debiasing (SFID), a novel methodology that integrates feature pruning and low confidence imputation (LCI) to effectively reduce biases in VLMs. SFID is versatile, maintaining the semantic integrity of outputs and costly effective by eliminating the need for retraining. Our experimental results demonstrate SFID's effectiveness across various VLMs tasks including zero-shot classification, text-to-image retrieval, image captioning, and text-to-image generation, by significantly reducing gender biases without compromising performance. This approach not only enhances the fairness of VLMs applications but also preserves their efficiency and utility across diverse scenarios.</description>

We propose canonical similarity analysis (CSA), which uses two unimodal encoders to replicate multimodal encoders using limited data. CSA maps unimodal features into a multimodal space, using a new similarity score to retain only the multimodal information. CSA only involves the inference of unimodal encoders and a cubic-complexity matrix decomposition, eliminating the need for extensive GPU-based model training. Experiments show that CSA outperforms CLIP while requiring $300,000\times$ fewer multimodal data pairs and $6\times$ fewer unimodal data for ImageNet classification and misinformative news captions detection. CSA surpasses the state-of-the-art method to map unimodal features to multimodal features. We also demonstrate the ability of CSA with modalities beyond image and text, paving the way for future modality pairs with limited paired multimodal data but abundant unpaired unimodal data, such as lidar and text.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cyber-attacks are becoming increasingly sophisticated and frequent, highlighting the importance of network intrusion detection systems. This paper explores the potential and challenges of using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) in network intrusion detection. It begins by introducing key DRL concepts and frameworks, such as deep Q-networks and actor-critic algorithms, and reviews recent research utilizing DRL for intrusion detection. The study evaluates challenges related to model training efficiency, detection of minority and unknown class attacks, feature selection, and handling unbalanced datasets. The performance of DRL models is comprehensively analyzed, showing that while DRL holds promise, many recent technologies remain underexplored. Some DRL models achieve state-of-the-art results on public datasets, occasionally outperforming traditional deep learning methods. The paper concludes with recommendations for enhancing DRL deployment and testing in real-world network scenarios, with a focus on Internet of Things intrusion detection. It discusses recent DRL architectures and suggests future policy functions for DRL-based intrusion detection. Finally, the paper proposes integrating DRL with generative methods to further improve performance, addressing current gaps and supporting more robust and adaptive network intrusion detection systems.</description>

      <title>Moyun: A Diffusion-Based Model for Style-Specific Chinese Calligraphy Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although Chinese calligraphy generation has achieved style transfer, generating calligraphy by specifying the calligrapher, font, and character style remains challenging. To address this, we propose a new Chinese calligraphy generation model 'Moyun' , which replaces the Unet in the Diffusion model with Vision Mamba and introduces the TripleLabel control mechanism to achieve controllable calligraphy generation. The model was tested on our large-scale dataset 'Mobao' of over 1.9 million images, and the results demonstrate that 'Moyun' can effectively control the generation process and produce calligraphy in the specified style. Even for calligraphy the calligrapher has not written, 'Moyun' can generate calligraphy that matches the style of the calligrapher.</description>

      <title>Automatic Curriculum Expert Iteration for Reliable LLM Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hallucinations (i.e., generating plausible but inaccurate content) and laziness (i.e. excessive refusals or defaulting to "I don't know") persist as major challenges in LLM reasoning. Current efforts to reduce hallucinations primarily focus on factual errors in knowledge-grounded tasks, often neglecting hallucinations related to faulty reasoning. Meanwhile, some approaches render LLMs overly conservative, limiting their problem-solving capabilities. To mitigate hallucination and laziness in reasoning tasks, we propose Automatic Curriculum Expert Iteration (Auto-CEI) to enhance LLM reasoning and align responses to the model's capabilities--assertively answering within its limits and declining when tasks exceed them. In our method, Expert Iteration explores the reasoning trajectories near the LLM policy, guiding incorrect paths back on track to reduce compounding errors and improve robustness; it also promotes appropriate "I don't know" responses after sufficient reasoning attempts. The curriculum automatically adjusts rewards, incentivizing extended reasoning before acknowledging incapability, thereby pushing the limits of LLM reasoning and aligning its behaviour with these limits. We compare Auto-CEI with various SOTA baselines across logical reasoning, mathematics, and planning tasks, where Auto-CEI achieves superior alignment by effectively balancing assertiveness and conservativeness.</description>

      <title>Almost Minimax Optimal Best Arm Identification in Piecewise Stationary Linear Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a {\em novel} piecewise stationary linear bandit (PSLB) model, where the environment randomly samples a context from an unknown probability distribution at each changepoint, and the quality of an arm is measured by its return averaged over all contexts. The contexts and their distribution, as well as the changepoints are unknown to the agent. We design {\em Piecewise-Stationary $\varepsilon$-Best Arm Identification$^+$} (PS$\varepsilon$BAI$^+$), an algorithm that is guaranteed to identify an $\varepsilon$-optimal arm with probability $\ge 1-\delta$ and with a minimal number of samples. PS$\varepsilon$BAI$^+$ consists of two subroutines, PS$\varepsilon$BAI and {\sc Na\"ive $\varepsilon$-BAI} (N$\varepsilon$BAI), which are executed in parallel. PS$\varepsilon$BAI actively detects changepoints and aligns contexts to facilitate the arm identification process. When PS$\varepsilon$BAI and N$\varepsilon$BAI are utilized judiciously in parallel, PS$\varepsilon$BAI$^+$ is shown to have a finite expected sample complexity. By proving a lower bound, we show the expected sample complexity of PS$\varepsilon$BAI$^+$ is optimal up to a logarithmic factor. We compare PS$\varepsilon$BAI$^+$ to baseline algorithms using numerical experiments which demonstrate its efficiency. Both our analytical and numerical results corroborate that the efficacy of PS$\varepsilon$BAI$^+$ is due to the delicate change detection and context alignment procedures embedded in PS$\varepsilon$BAI.</description>

      <title>DISCO: A Hierarchical Disentangled Cognitive Diagnosis Framework for Interpretable Job Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid development of online recruitment platforms has created unprecedented opportunities for job seekers while concurrently posing the significant challenge of quickly and accurately pinpointing positions that align with their skills and preferences. Job recommendation systems have significantly alleviated the extensive search burden for job seekers by optimizing user engagement metrics, such as clicks and applications, thus achieving notable success. In recent years, a substantial amount of research has been devoted to developing effective job recommendation models, primarily focusing on text-matching based and behavior modeling based methods. While these approaches have realized impressive outcomes, it is imperative to note that research on the explainability of recruitment recommendations remains profoundly unexplored. To this end, in this paper, we propose DISCO, a hierarchical Disentanglement based Cognitive diagnosis framework, aimed at flexibly accommodating the underlying representation learning model for effective and interpretable job recommendations. Specifically, we first design a hierarchical representation disentangling module to explicitly mine the hierarchical skill-related factors implied in hidden representations of job seekers and jobs. Subsequently, we propose level-aware association modeling to enhance information communication and robust representation learning both inter- and intra-level, which consists of the interlevel knowledge influence module and the level-wise contrastive learning. Finally, we devise an interaction diagnosis module incorporating a neural diagnosis function for effectively modeling the multi-level recruitment interaction process between job seekers and jobs, which introduces the cognitive measurement theory.</description>

      <title>MACPO: Weak-to-Strong Alignment via Multi-Agent Contrastive Preference Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are rapidly advancing and achieving near-human capabilities, aligning them with human values is becoming more urgent. In scenarios where LLMs outperform humans, we face a weak-to-strong alignment problem where we need to effectively align strong student LLMs through weak supervision generated by weak teachers. Existing alignment methods mainly focus on strong-to-weak alignment and self-alignment settings, and it is impractical to adapt them to the much harder weak-to-strong alignment setting. To fill this gap, we propose a multi-agent contrastive preference optimization (MACPO) framework. MACPO facilitates weak teachers and strong students to learn from each other by iteratively reinforcing unfamiliar positive behaviors while penalizing familiar negative ones. To get this, we devise a mutual positive behavior augmentation strategy to encourage weak teachers and strong students to learn from each other's positive behavior and further provide higher quality positive behavior for the next iteration. Additionally, we propose a hard negative behavior construction strategy to induce weak teachers and strong students to generate familiar negative behavior by fine-tuning on negative behavioral data. Experimental results on the HH-RLHF and PKU-SafeRLHF datasets, evaluated using both automatic metrics and human judgments, demonstrate that MACPO simultaneously improves the alignment performance of strong students and weak teachers. Moreover, as the number of weak teachers increases, MACPO achieves better weak-to-strong alignment performance through more iteration optimization rounds.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Clickbait Detection by De-confounding Biases Using Causal Representation Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper focuses on detecting clickbait posts on the Web. These posts often use eye-catching disinformation in mixed modalities to mislead users to click for profit. That affects the user experience and thus would be blocked by content provider. To escape detection, malicious creators use tricks to add some irrelevant non-bait content into bait posts, dressing them up as legal to fool the detector. This content often has biased relations with non-bait labels, yet traditional detectors tend to make predictions based on simple co-occurrence rather than grasping inherent factors that lead to malicious behavior. This spurious bias would easily cause misjudgments. To address this problem, we propose a new debiased method based on causal inference. We first employ a set of features in multiple modalities to characterize the posts. Considering these features are often mixed up with unknown biases, we then disentangle three kinds of latent factors from them, including the invariant factor that indicates intrinsic bait intention; the causal factor which reflects deceptive patterns in a certain scenario, and non-causal noise. By eliminating the noise that causes bias, we can use invariant and causal factors to build a robust model with good generalization ability. Experiments on three popular datasets show the effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Robustness Overestimation and Instability in TRADES</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper examines the phenomenon of probabilistic robustness overestimation in TRADES, a prominent adversarial training method. Our study reveals that TRADES sometimes yields disproportionately high PGD validation accuracy compared to the AutoAttack testing accuracy in the multiclass classification task. This discrepancy highlights a significant overestimation of robustness for these instances, potentially linked to gradient masking. We further analyze the parameters contributing to unstable models that lead to overestimation. Our findings indicate that smaller batch sizes, lower beta values (which control the weight of the robust loss term in TRADES), larger learning rates, and higher class complexity (e.g., CIFAR-100 versus CIFAR-10) are associated with an increased likelihood of robustness overestimation. By examining metrics such as the First-Order Stationary Condition (FOSC), inner-maximization, and gradient information, we identify the underlying cause of this phenomenon as gradient masking and provide insights into it. Furthermore, our experiments show that certain unstable training instances may return to a state without robust overestimation, inspiring our attempts at a solution. In addition to adjusting parameter settings to reduce instability or retraining when overestimation occurs, we recommend incorporating Gaussian noise in inputs when the FOSC score exceed the threshold. This method aims to mitigate robustness overestimation of TRADES and other similar methods at its source, ensuring more reliable representation of adversarial robustness during evaluation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fine-tuning on agent-environment interaction trajectory data holds significant promise for surfacing generalized agent capabilities in open-source large language models (LLMs). In this work, we introduce AgentBank, by far the largest trajectory tuning data collection featuring more than 50k diverse high-quality interaction trajectories which comprises 16 tasks covering five distinct agent skill dimensions. Leveraging a novel annotation pipeline, we are able to scale the annotated trajectories and generate a trajectory dataset with minimized difficulty bias. Furthermore, we fine-tune LLMs on AgentBank to get a series of agent models, Samoyed. Our comparative experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of scaling the interaction trajectory data to acquire generalized agent capabilities. Additional studies also reveal some key observations regarding trajectory tuning and agent skill generalization.</description>

      <title>Learning Tree Pattern Transformations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Explaining why and how a tree $t$ structurally differs from another tree $t^*$ is a question that is encountered throughout computer science, including in understanding tree-structured data such as XML or JSON data. In this article, we explore how to learn explanations for structural differences between pairs of trees from sample data: suppose we are given a set $\{(t_1, t_1^*),\dots, (t_n, t_n^*)\}$ of pairs of labelled, ordered trees; is there a small set of rules that explains the structural differences between all pairs $(t_i, t_i^*)$? This raises two research questions: (i) what is a good notion of "rule" in this context?; and (ii) how can sets of rules explaining a data set be learnt algorithmically?
  We explore these questions from the perspective of database theory by (1) introducing a pattern-based specification language for tree transformations; (2) exploring the computational complexity of variants of the above algorithmic problem, e.g. showing NP-hardness for very restricted variants; and (3) discussing how to solve the problem for data from CS education research using SAT solvers.</description>

      <title>On the Generalization Properties of Deep Learning for Aircraft Fuel Flow Estimation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately estimating aircraft fuel flow is essential for evaluating new procedures, designing next-generation aircraft, and monitoring the environmental impact of current aviation practices. This paper investigates the generalization capabilities of deep learning models in predicting fuel consumption, focusing particularly on their performance for aircraft types absent from the training data. We propose a novel methodology that integrates neural network architectures with domain generalization techniques to enhance robustness and reliability across a wide range of aircraft. A comprehensive dataset containing 101 different aircraft types, separated into training and generalization sets, with each aircraft type set containing 1,000 flights. We employed the base of aircraft data (BADA) model for fuel flow estimates, introduced a pseudo-distance metric to assess aircraft type similarity, and explored various sampling strategies to optimize model performance in data-sparse regions. Our results reveal that for previously unseen aircraft types, the introduction of noise into aircraft and engine parameters improved model generalization. The model is able to generalize with acceptable mean absolute percentage error between 2\% and 10\% for aircraft close to existing aircraft, while performance is below 1\% error for known aircraft in the training set. This study highlights the potential of combining domain-specific insights with advanced machine learning techniques to develop scalable, accurate, and generalizable fuel flow estimation models.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Federated Domain Adaptation with Multi-Domain Prototype-Based Federated Fine-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated Domain Adaptation (FDA) is a Federated Learning (FL) scenario where models are trained across multiple clients with unique data domains but a shared category space, without transmitting private data. The primary challenge in FDA is data heterogeneity, which causes significant divergences in gradient updates when using conventional averaging-based aggregation methods, reducing the efficacy of the global model. This further undermines both in-domain and out-of-domain performance (within the same federated system but outside the local client). To address this, we propose a novel framework called \textbf{M}ulti-domain \textbf{P}rototype-based \textbf{F}ederated Fine-\textbf{T}uning (MPFT). MPFT fine-tunes a pre-trained model using multi-domain prototypes, i.e., pretrained representations enriched with domain-specific information from category-specific local data. This enables supervised learning on the server to derive a globally optimized adapter that is subsequently distributed to local clients, without the intrusion of data privacy. Empirical results show that MPFT significantly improves both in-domain and out-of-domain accuracy over conventional methods, enhancing knowledge preservation and adaptation in FDA. Notably, MPFT achieves convergence within a single communication round, greatly reducing computation and communication costs. To ensure privacy, MPFT applies differential privacy to protect the prototypes. Additionally, we develop a prototype-based feature space hijacking attack to evaluate robustness, confirming that raw data samples remain unrecoverable even after extensive training epochs. The complete implementation of MPFL is available at \url{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/DomainFL/}.</description>

      <title>Learning Low-Level Causal Relations using a Simulated Robotic Arm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Causal learning allows humans to predict the effect of their actions on the known environment and use this knowledge to plan the execution of more complex actions. Such knowledge also captures the behaviour of the environment and can be used for its analysis and the reasoning behind the behaviour. This type of knowledge is also crucial in the design of intelligent robotic systems with common sense. In this paper, we study causal relations by learning the forward and inverse models based on data generated by a simulated robotic arm involved in two sensorimotor tasks. As a next step, we investigate feature attribution methods for the analysis of the forward model, which reveals the low-level causal effects corresponding to individual features of the state vector related to both the arm joints and the environment features. This type of analysis provides solid ground for dimensionality reduction of the state representations, as well as for the aggregation of knowledge towards the explainability of causal effects at higher levels.</description>

      <title>$\textit{Jump Your Steps}$: Optimizing Sampling Schedule of Discrete Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have seen notable success in continuous domains, leading to the development of discrete diffusion models (DDMs) for discrete variables. Despite recent advances, DDMs face the challenge of slow sampling speeds. While parallel sampling methods like $\tau$-leaping accelerate this process, they introduce $\textit{Compounding Decoding Error}$ (CDE), where discrepancies arise between the true distribution and the approximation from parallel token generation, leading to degraded sample quality. In this work, we present $\textit{Jump Your Steps}$ (JYS), a novel approach that optimizes the allocation of discrete sampling timesteps by minimizing CDE without extra computational cost. More precisely, we derive a practical upper bound on CDE and propose an efficient algorithm for searching for the optimal sampling schedule. Extensive experiments across image, music, and text generation show that JYS significantly improves sampling quality, establishing it as a versatile framework for enhancing DDM performance for fast sampling.</description>

      <title>HARIVO: Harnessing Text-to-Image Models for Video Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a method to create diffusion-based video models from pretrained Text-to-Image (T2I) models. Recently, AnimateDiff proposed freezing the T2I model while only training temporal layers. We advance this method by proposing a unique architecture, incorporating a mapping network and frame-wise tokens, tailored for video generation while maintaining the diversity and creativity of the original T2I model. Key innovations include novel loss functions for temporal smoothness and a mitigating gradient sampling technique, ensuring realistic and temporally consistent video generation despite limited public video data. We have successfully integrated video-specific inductive biases into the architecture and loss functions. Our method, built on the frozen StableDiffusion model, simplifies training processes and allows for seamless integration with off-the-shelf models like ControlNet and DreamBooth. project page: https://kwonminki.github.io/HARIVO</description>

      <title>GameTraversalBenchmark: Evaluating Planning Abilities Of Large Language Models Through Traversing 2D Game Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated great success in generating and understanding natural language. While they have also shown potential beyond the domain of natural language, it remains an open question as to what extent and in which way these LLMs can plan. We investigate their planning capabilities by proposing GameTraversalBenchmark (GTB), a benchmark consisting of diverse 2D grid-based game maps. An LLM succeeds if it can traverse through given objectives, with a minimum number of steps and a minimum number of generation errors. We evaluate a number of LLMs on GTB and found that GPT-4-Turbo achieved the highest score of 44.97% on GTB\_Score (GTBS), a composite score that combines the three above criteria. Furthermore, we preliminarily test large reasoning models, namely o1, which scores $67.84\%$ on GTBS, indicating that the benchmark remains challenging for current models. Code, data, and documentation are available at https://github.com/umair-nasir14/Game-Traversal-Benchmark.</description>

      <title>Full-Rank No More: Low-Rank Weight Training for Modern Speech Recognition Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the under-explored area of low-rank weight training for large-scale Conformer-based speech recognition models from scratch. Our study demonstrates the viability of this training paradigm for such models, yielding several notable findings. Firstly, we discover that applying a low-rank structure exclusively to the attention modules can unexpectedly enhance performance, even with a significant rank reduction of 12%. In contrast, feed-forward layers present greater challenges, as they begin to exhibit performance degradation with a moderate 50% rank reduction. Furthermore, we find that both initialization and layer-wise rank assignment play critical roles in successful low-rank training. Specifically, employing SVD initialization and linear layer-wise rank mapping significantly boosts the efficacy of low-rank weight training. Building on these insights, we introduce the Low-Rank Speech Model from Scratch (LR-SMS), an approach that achieves performance parity with full-rank training while delivering substantial reductions in parameters count (by at least 2x), and training time speedups (by 1.3x for ASR and 1.15x for AVSR).</description>

      <title>Mastering Contact-rich Tasks by Combining Soft and Rigid Robotics with Imitation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Soft robots have the potential to revolutionize the use of robotic systems with their capability of establishing safe, robust, and adaptable interactions with their environment, but their precise control remains challenging. In contrast, traditional rigid robots offer high accuracy and repeatability but lack the flexibility of soft robots. We argue that combining these characteristics in a hybrid robotic platform can significantly enhance overall capabilities. This work presents a novel hybrid robotic platform that integrates a rigid manipulator with a fully developed soft arm. This system is equipped with the intelligence necessary to perform flexible and generalizable tasks through imitation learning autonomously. The physical softness and machine learning enable our platform to achieve highly generalizable skills, while the rigid components ensure precision and repeatability.</description>

      <title>Do Current Language Models Support Code Intelligence for R Programming Language?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in developing Pre-trained Language Models for Code (Code-PLMs) have urged many areas of Software Engineering (SE) and brought breakthrough results for many SE tasks. Though these models have achieved the state-of-the-art performance for SE tasks for many popular programming languages, such as Java and Python, the Scientific Software and its related languages like R programming language have rarely benefited or even been evaluated with the Code-PLMs. Research has shown that R has many differences with other programming languages and requires specific techniques. In this study, we provide the first insights for code intelligence for R. For this purpose, we collect and open source an R dataset, and evaluate Code-PLMs for the two tasks of code summarization and method name prediction using several settings and strategies, including the differences in two R styles, Tidy-verse and Base R. Our results demonstrate that the studied models have experienced varying degrees of performance degradation when processing R programming language code, which is supported by human evaluation. Additionally, not all models show performance improvement in R-specific tasks even after multi-language fine-tuning. The dual syntax paradigms in R significantly impact the models' performance, particularly in code summarization tasks. Furthermore, the project-specific context inherent in R codebases significantly impacts the performance when attempting cross-project training.</description>

      <title>Rewriting Conversational Utterances with Instructed Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many recent studies have shown the ability of large language models (LLMs) to achieve state-of-the-art performance on many NLP tasks, such as question answering, text summarization, coding, and translation. In some cases, the results provided by LLMs are on par with those of human experts. These models' most disruptive innovation is their ability to perform tasks via zero-shot or few-shot prompting. This capability has been successfully exploited to train instructed LLMs, where reinforcement learning with human feedback is used to guide the model to follow the user's requests directly. In this paper, we investigate the ability of instructed LLMs to improve conversational search effectiveness by rewriting user questions in a conversational setting. We study which prompts provide the most informative rewritten utterances that lead to the best retrieval performance. Reproducible experiments are conducted on publicly-available TREC CAST datasets. The results show that rewriting conversational utterances with instructed LLMs achieves significant improvements of up to 25.2% in MRR, 31.7% in Precision@1, 27% in NDCG@3, and 11.5% in Recall@500 over state-of-the-art techniques.</description>

      <title>Temporal-Difference Variational Continual Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A crucial capability of Machine Learning models in real-world applications is the ability to continuously learn new tasks. This adaptability allows them to respond to potentially inevitable shifts in the data-generating distribution over time. However, in Continual Learning (CL) settings, models often struggle to balance learning new tasks (plasticity) with retaining previous knowledge (memory stability). Consequently, they are susceptible to Catastrophic Forgetting, which degrades performance and undermines the reliability of deployed systems. Variational Continual Learning methods tackle this challenge by employing a learning objective that recursively updates the posterior distribution and enforces it to stay close to the latest posterior estimate. Nonetheless, we argue that these methods may be ineffective due to compounding approximation errors over successive recursions. To mitigate this, we propose new learning objectives that integrate the regularization effects of multiple previous posterior estimations, preventing individual errors from dominating future posterior updates and compounding over time. We reveal insightful connections between these objectives and Temporal-Difference methods, a popular learning mechanism in Reinforcement Learning and Neuroscience. We evaluate the proposed objectives on challenging versions of popular CL benchmarks, demonstrating that they outperform standard Variational CL methods and non-variational baselines, effectively alleviating Catastrophic Forgetting.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Gender Bias in Code Large Language Models via Model Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, with the maturation of large language model (LLM) technology and the emergence of high-quality programming code datasets, researchers have become increasingly confident in addressing the challenges of program synthesis automatically. However, since most of the training samples for LLMs are unscreened, it is inevitable that LLMs' performance may not align with real-world scenarios, leading to the presence of social bias. To evaluate and quantify the gender bias in code LLMs, we propose a dataset named CodeGenBias (Gender Bias in the Code Generation) and an evaluation metric called FB-Score (Factual Bias Score) based on the actual gender distribution of correlative professions. With the help of CodeGenBias and FB-Score, we evaluate and analyze the gender bias in eight mainstream Code LLMs. Previous work has demonstrated that model editing methods that perform well in knowledge editing have the potential to mitigate social bias in LLMs. Therefore, we develop a model editing approach named MG-Editing (Multi-Granularity model Editing), which includes the locating and editing phases. Our model editing method MG-Editing can be applied at five different levels of model parameter granularity: full parameters level, layer level, module level, row level, and neuron level. Extensive experiments not only demonstrate that our MG-Editing can effectively mitigate the gender bias in code LLMs while maintaining their general code generation capabilities, but also showcase its excellent generalization. At the same time, the experimental results show that, considering both the gender bias of the model and its general code generation capability, MG-Editing is most effective when applied at the row and neuron levels of granularity.</description>

      <title>LaB-CL: Localized and Balanced Contrastive Learning for improving parking slot detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parking slot detection is an essential technology in autonomous parking systems. In general, the classification problem of parking slot detection consists of two tasks, a task determining whether localized candidates are junctions of parking slots or not, and the other that identifies a shape of detected junctions. Both classification tasks can easily face biased learning toward the majority class, degrading classification performances. Yet, the data imbalance issue has been overlooked in parking slot detection. We propose the first supervised contrastive learning framework for parking slot detection, Localized and Balanced Contrastive Learning for improving parking slot detection (LaB-CL). The proposed LaB-CL framework uses two main approaches. First, we propose to include class prototypes to consider representations from all classes in every mini batch, from the local perspective. Second, we propose a new hard negative sampling scheme that selects local representations with high prediction error. Experiments with the benchmark dataset demonstrate that the proposed LaB-CL framework can outperform existing parking slot detection methods.</description>

      <title>Masked Generative Priors Improve World Models Sequence Modelling Capabilities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become the leading approach for creating artificial agents in complex environments. Model-based approaches, which are RL methods with world models that predict environment dynamics, are among the most promising directions for improving data efficiency, forming a critical step toward bridging the gap between research and real-world deployment. In particular, world models enhance sample efficiency by learning in imagination, which involves training a generative sequence model of the environment in a self-supervised manner. Recently, Masked Generative Modelling has emerged as a more efficient and superior inductive bias for modelling and generating token sequences. Building on the Efficient Stochastic Transformer-based World Models (STORM) architecture, we replace the traditional MLP prior with a Masked Generative Prior (e.g., MaskGIT Prior) and introduce GIT-STORM. We evaluate our model on two downstream tasks: reinforcement learning and video prediction. GIT-STORM demonstrates substantial performance gains in RL tasks on the Atari 100k benchmark. Moreover, we apply Transformer-based World Models to continuous action environments for the first time, addressing a significant gap in prior research. To achieve this, we employ a state mixer function that integrates latent state representations with actions, enabling our model to handle continuous control tasks. We validate this approach through qualitative and quantitative analyses on the DeepMind Control Suite, showcasing the effectiveness of Transformer-based World Models in this new domain. Our results highlight the versatility and efficacy of the MaskGIT dynamics prior, paving the way for more accurate world models and effective RL policies.</description>

      <title>MinorityPrompt: Text to Minority Image Generation via Prompt Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the generation of minority samples using pretrained text-to-image (T2I) latent diffusion models. Minority instances, in the context of T2I generation, can be defined as ones living on low-density regions of text-conditional data distributions. They are valuable for various applications of modern T2I generators, such as data augmentation and creative AI. Unfortunately, existing pretrained T2I diffusion models primarily focus on high-density regions, largely due to the influence of guided samplers (like CFG) that are essential for producing high-quality generations. To address this, we present a novel framework to counter the high-density-focus of T2I diffusion models. Specifically, we first develop an online prompt optimization framework that can encourage the emergence of desired properties during inference while preserving semantic contents of user-provided prompts. We subsequently tailor this generic prompt optimizer into a specialized solver that promotes the generation of minority features by incorporating a carefully-crafted likelihood objective. Our comprehensive experiments, conducted across various types of T2I models, demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances the capability to produce high-quality minority instances compared to existing samplers.</description>

      <title>SNN-PAR: Energy Efficient Pedestrian Attribute Recognition via Spiking Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial neural network based Pedestrian Attribute Recognition (PAR) has been widely studied in recent years, despite many progresses, however, the energy consumption is still high. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a Spiking Neural Network (SNN) based framework for energy-efficient attribute recognition. Specifically, we first adopt a spiking tokenizer module to transform the given pedestrian image into spiking feature representations. Then, the output will be fed into the spiking Transformer backbone networks for energy-efficient feature extraction. We feed the enhanced spiking features into a set of feed-forward networks for pedestrian attribute recognition. In addition to the widely used binary cross-entropy loss function, we also exploit knowledge distillation from the artificial neural network to the spiking Transformer network for more accurate attribute recognition. Extensive experiments on three widely used PAR benchmark datasets fully validated the effectiveness of our proposed SNN-PAR framework.

      <title>From Logits to Hierarchies: Hierarchical Clustering made Simple</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The structure of many real-world datasets is intrinsically hierarchical, making the modeling of such hierarchies a critical objective in both unsupervised and supervised machine learning. Recently, novel approaches for hierarchical clustering with deep architectures have been proposed. In this work, we take a critical perspective on this line of research and demonstrate that many approaches exhibit major limitations when applied to realistic datasets, partly due to their high computational complexity. In particular, we show that a lightweight procedure implemented on top of pre-trained non-hierarchical clustering models outperforms models designed specifically for hierarchical clustering. Our proposed approach is computationally efficient and applicable to any pre-trained clustering model that outputs logits, without requiring any fine-tuning. To highlight the generality of our findings, we illustrate how our method can also be applied in a supervised setup, recovering meaningful hierarchies from a pre-trained ImageNet classifier.</description>

      <title>RDT-1B: a Diffusion Foundation Model for Bimanual Manipulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bimanual manipulation is essential in robotics, yet developing foundation models is extremely challenging due to the inherent complexity of coordinating two robot arms (leading to multi-modal action distributions) and the scarcity of training data. In this paper, we present the Robotics Diffusion Transformer (RDT), a pioneering diffusion foundation model for bimanual manipulation. RDT builds on diffusion models to effectively represent multi-modality, with innovative designs of a scalable Transformer to deal with the heterogeneity of multi-modal inputs and to capture the nonlinearity and high frequency of robotic data. To address data scarcity, we further introduce a Physically Interpretable Unified Action Space, which can unify the action representations of various robots while preserving the physical meanings of original actions, facilitating learning transferrable physical knowledge. With these designs, we managed to pre-train RDT on the largest collection of multi-robot datasets to date and scaled it up to 1.2B parameters, which is the largest diffusion-based foundation model for robotic manipulation. We finally fine-tuned RDT on a self-created multi-task bimanual dataset with over 6K+ episodes to refine its manipulation capabilities. Experiments on real robots demonstrate that RDT significantly outperforms existing methods. It exhibits zero-shot generalization to unseen objects and scenes, understands and follows language instructions, learns new skills with just 1~5 demonstrations, and effectively handles complex, dexterous tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), with their exceptional ability to handle a wide range of tasks, have driven significant advancements in tackling reasoning and planning tasks, wherein decomposing complex problems into executable workflows is a crucial step in this process. Existing workflow evaluation frameworks either focus solely on holistic performance or suffer from limitations such as restricted scenario coverage, simplistic workflow structures, and lax evaluation standards. To this end, we introduce WorFBench, a unified workflow generation benchmark with multi-faceted scenarios and intricate graph workflow structures. Additionally, we present WorFEval, a systemic evaluation protocol utilizing subsequence and subgraph matching algorithms to accurately quantify the LLM agent's workflow generation capabilities. Through comprehensive evaluations across different types of LLMs, we discover distinct gaps between the sequence planning capabilities and graph planning capabilities of LLM agents, with even GPT-4 exhibiting a gap of around 15%. We also train two open-source models and evaluate their generalization abilities on held-out tasks. Furthermore, we observe that the generated workflows can enhance downstream tasks, enabling them to achieve superior performance with less time during inference. Code and dataset will be available at https://github.com/zjunlp/WorFBench.</description>

      <title>ONCOPILOT: A Promptable CT Foundation Model For Solid Tumor Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Carcinogenesis is a proteiform phenomenon, with tumors emerging in various locations and displaying complex, diverse shapes. At the crucial intersection of research and clinical practice, it demands precise and flexible assessment. However, current biomarkers, such as RECIST 1.1's long and short axis measurements, fall short of capturing this complexity, offering an approximate estimate of tumor burden and a simplistic representation of a more intricate process. Additionally, existing supervised AI models face challenges in addressing the variability in tumor presentations, limiting their clinical utility. These limitations arise from the scarcity of annotations and the models' focus on narrowly defined tasks.
  To address these challenges, we developed ONCOPILOT, an interactive radiological foundation model trained on approximately 7,500 CT scans covering the whole body, from both normal anatomy and a wide range of oncological cases. ONCOPILOT performs 3D tumor segmentation using visual prompts like point-click and bounding boxes, outperforming state-of-the-art models (e.g., nnUnet) and achieving radiologist-level accuracy in RECIST 1.1 measurements. The key advantage of this foundation model is its ability to surpass state-of-the-art performance while keeping the radiologist in the loop, a capability that previous models could not achieve. When radiologists interactively refine the segmentations, accuracy improves further. ONCOPILOT also accelerates measurement processes and reduces inter-reader variability, facilitating volumetric analysis and unlocking new biomarkers for deeper insights.
  This AI assistant is expected to enhance the precision of RECIST 1.1 measurements, unlock the potential of volumetric biomarkers, and improve patient stratification and clinical care, while seamlessly integrating into the radiological workflow.</description>

      <title>Meta-Learning Integration in Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning for Advanced Task Complexity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) effectively tackles complex tasks by decomposing them into structured policies. However, HRL agents often face challenges with efficient exploration and rapid adaptation. To address this, we integrate meta-learning into HRL to enhance the agent's ability to learn and adapt hierarchical policies swiftly. Our approach employs meta-learning for rapid task adaptation based on prior experience, while intrinsic motivation mechanisms encourage efficient exploration by rewarding novel state visits. Specifically, our agent uses a high-level policy to select among multiple low-level policies operating within custom grid environments. We utilize gradient-based meta-learning with differentiable inner-loop updates, enabling optimization across a curriculum of increasingly difficult tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that our meta-learned hierarchical agent significantly outperforms traditional HRL agents without meta-learning and intrinsic motivation. The agent exhibits accelerated learning, higher cumulative rewards, and improved success rates in complex grid environments. These findings suggest that integrating meta-learning with HRL, alongside curriculum learning and intrinsic motivation, substantially enhances the agent's capability to handle complex tasks.</description>

      <title>COMPL-AI Framework: A Technical Interpretation and LLM Benchmarking Suite for the EU Artificial Intelligence Act</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The EU's Artificial Intelligence Act (AI Act) is a significant step towards responsible AI development, but lacks clear technical interpretation, making it difficult to assess models' compliance. This work presents COMPL-AI, a comprehensive framework consisting of (i) the first technical interpretation of the EU AI Act, translating its broad regulatory requirements into measurable technical requirements, with the focus on large language models (LLMs), and (ii) an open-source Act-centered benchmarking suite, based on thorough surveying and implementation of state-of-the-art LLM benchmarks. By evaluating 12 prominent LLMs in the context of COMPL-AI, we reveal shortcomings in existing models and benchmarks, particularly in areas like robustness, safety, diversity, and fairness. This work highlights the need for a shift in focus towards these aspects, encouraging balanced development of LLMs and more comprehensive regulation-aligned benchmarks. Simultaneously, COMPL-AI for the first time demonstrates the possibilities and difficulties of bringing the Act's obligations to a more concrete, technical level. As such, our work can serve as a useful first step towards having actionable recommendations for model providers, and contributes to ongoing efforts of the EU to enable application of the Act, such as the drafting of the GPAI Code of Practice.</description>

      <title>Neural Reasoning Networks: Efficient Interpretable Neural Networks With Automatic Textual Explanations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning have led to a surge in adoption of neural networks for various tasks, but lack of interpretability remains an issue for many others in which an understanding of the features influencing the prediction is necessary to ensure fairness, safety, and legal compliance. In this paper we consider one class of such tasks, tabular dataset classification, and propose a novel neuro-symbolic architecture, Neural Reasoning Networks (NRN), that is scalable and generates logically sound textual explanations for its predictions. NRNs are connected layers of logical neurons which implement a form of real valued logic. A training algorithm (R-NRN) learns the weights of the network as usual using gradient descent optimization with backprop, but also learns the network structure itself using a bandit-based optimization. Both are implemented in an extension to PyTorch (https://github.com/IBM/torchlogic) that takes full advantage of GPU scaling and batched training. Evaluation on a diverse set of 22 open-source datasets for tabular classification demonstrates performance (measured by ROC AUC) which improves over multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and is statistically similar to other state-of-the-art approaches such as Random Forest, XGBoost and Gradient Boosted Trees, while offering 43% faster training and a more than 2 orders of magnitude reduction in the number of parameters required, on average. Furthermore, R-NRN explanations are shorter than the compared approaches while producing more accurate feature importance scores.</description>

      <title>Doob's Lagrangian: A Sample-Efficient Variational Approach to Transition Path Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rare event sampling in dynamical systems is a fundamental problem arising in the natural sciences, which poses significant computational challenges due to an exponentially large space of trajectories. For settings where the dynamical system of interest follows a Brownian motion with known drift, the question of conditioning the process to reach a given endpoint or desired rare event is definitively answered by Doob's h-transform. However, the naive estimation of this transform is infeasible, as it requires simulating sufficiently many forward trajectories to estimate rare event probabilities. In this work, we propose a variational formulation of Doob's $h$-transform as an optimization problem over trajectories between a given initial point and the desired ending point. To solve this optimization, we propose a simulation-free training objective with a model parameterization that imposes the desired boundary conditions by design. Our approach significantly reduces the search space over trajectories and avoids expensive trajectory simulation and inefficient importance sampling estimators which are required in existing methods. We demonstrate the ability of our method to find feasible transition paths on real-world molecular simulation and protein folding tasks.</description>

      <title>D-Wave's Nonlinear-Program Hybrid Solver: Description and Performance Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of advanced quantum-classical algorithms is among the most prominent strategies in quantum computing. Numerous hybrid solvers have been introduced recently. Many of these methods are created ad hoc to address specific use cases. However, several well-established schemes are frequently utilized to address optimization problems. In this context, D-Wave launched the Hybrid Solver Service in 2020, offering a portfolio of methods designed to accelerate time-to-solution for users aiming to optimize performance and operational processes. Recently, a new technique has been added to this portfolio: the Nonlinear-Program Hybrid Solver. This paper describes this solver and evaluates its performance through a benchmark of 45 instances across three combinatorial optimization problems: the Traveling Salesman Problem, the Knapsack Problem, and the Maximum Cut Problem. To facilitate the use of this relatively unexplored solver, we provide details of the implementation used to solve these three optimization problems.</description>

      <title>MolMix: A Simple Yet Effective Baseline for Multimodal Molecular Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a simple transformer-based baseline for multimodal molecular representation learning, integrating three distinct modalities: SMILES strings, 2D graph representations, and 3D conformers of molecules. A key aspect of our approach is the aggregation of 3D conformers, allowing the model to account for the fact that molecules can adopt multiple conformations-an important factor for accurate molecular representation. The tokens for each modality are extracted using modality-specific encoders: a transformer for SMILES strings, a message-passing neural network for 2D graphs, and an equivariant neural network for 3D conformers. The flexibility and modularity of this framework enable easy adaptation and replacement of these encoders, making the model highly versatile for different molecular tasks. The extracted tokens are then combined into a unified multimodal sequence, which is processed by a downstream transformer for prediction tasks. To efficiently scale our model for large multimodal datasets, we utilize Flash Attention 2 and bfloat16 precision. Despite its simplicity, our approach achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness as a strong baseline for multimodal molecular representation learning.</description>

      <title>Human and LLM Biases in Hate Speech Annotations: A Socio-Demographic Analysis of Annotators and Targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rise of online platforms exacerbated the spread of hate speech, demanding scalable and effective detection. However, the accuracy of hate speech detection systems heavily relies on human-labeled data, which is inherently susceptible to biases. While previous work has examined the issue, the interplay between the characteristics of the annotator and those of the target of the hate are still unexplored. We fill this gap by leveraging an extensive dataset with rich socio-demographic information of both annotators and targets, uncovering how human biases manifest in relation to the target's attributes. Our analysis surfaces the presence of widespread biases, which we quantitatively describe and characterize based on their intensity and prevalence, revealing marked differences. Furthermore, we compare human biases with those exhibited by persona-based LLMs. Our findings indicate that while persona-based LLMs do exhibit biases, these differ significantly from those of human annotators. Overall, our work offers new and nuanced results on human biases in hate speech annotations, as well as fresh insights into the design of AI-driven hate speech detection systems.</description>

      <title>Towards Synergistic, Generalized, and Efficient Dual-System for Robotic Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08001v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing demand for versatile robotic systems to operate in diverse and dynamic environments has emphasized the importance of a generalist policy, which leverages a large cross-embodiment data corpus to facilitate broad adaptability and high-level reasoning. However, the generalist would struggle with inefficient inference and cost-expensive training. The specialist policy, instead, is curated for specific domain data and excels at task-level precision with efficiency. Yet, it lacks the generalization capacity for a wide range of applications. Inspired by these observations, we introduce RoboDual, a synergistic dual-system that supplements the merits of both generalist and specialist policy. A diffusion transformer-based specialist is devised for multi-step action rollouts, exquisitely conditioned on the high-level task understanding and discretized action output of a vision-language-action (VLA) based generalist. Compared to OpenVLA, RoboDual achieves 26.7% improvement in real-world setting and 12% gain on CALVIN by introducing a specialist policy with merely 20M trainable parameters. It maintains strong performance with 5% of demonstration data only, and enables a 3.8 times higher control frequency in real-world deployment. Code would be made publicly available.

      <title>Efficiently Learning at Test-Time: Active Fine-Tuning of LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent efforts in fine-tuning language models often rely on automatic data selection, commonly using Nearest Neighbors retrieval from large datasets. However, we theoretically show that this approach tends to select redundant data, limiting its effectiveness or even hurting performance. To address this, we introduce SIFT, a data selection algorithm designed to reduce uncertainty about the model's response given a prompt, which unifies ideas from retrieval and active learning. Whereas Nearest Neighbor retrieval typically fails in the presence of information duplication, SIFT accounts for information duplication and optimizes the overall information gain of the selected examples. We focus our evaluations on fine-tuning at test-time for prompt-specific language modeling on the Pile dataset, and show that SIFT consistently outperforms Nearest Neighbor retrieval, with minimal computational overhead. Moreover, we show that our uncertainty estimates can predict the performance gain of test-time fine-tuning, and use this to develop an adaptive algorithm that invests test-time compute proportional to realized performance gains. We provide the $\texttt{activeft}$ (Active Fine-Tuning) library which can be used as a drop-in replacement for Nearest Neighbor retrieval.</description>

      <title>GrabDAE: An Innovative Framework for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation Utilizing Grab-Mask and Denoise Auto-Encoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) aims to adapt a model trained on a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain by addressing the domain shift. Existing Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) methods often fall short in fully leveraging contextual information from the target domain, leading to suboptimal decision boundary separation during source and target domain alignment. To address this, we introduce GrabDAE, an innovative UDA framework designed to tackle domain shift in visual classification tasks. GrabDAE incorporates two key innovations: the Grab-Mask module, which blurs background information in target domain images, enabling the model to focus on essential, domain-relevant features through contrastive learning; and the Denoising Auto-Encoder (DAE), which enhances feature alignment by reconstructing features and filtering noise, ensuring a more robust adaptation to the target domain. These components empower GrabDAE to effectively handle unlabeled target domain data, significantly improving both classification accuracy and robustness. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, including VisDA-2017, Office-Home, and Office31, demonstrate that GrabDAE consistently surpasses state-of-the-art UDA methods, setting new performance benchmarks. By tackling UDA's critical challenges with its novel feature masking and denoising approach, GrabDAE offers both significant theoretical and practical advancements in domain adaptation.</description>

      <title>Pretraining Graph Transformers with Atom-in-a-Molecule Quantum Properties for Improved ADMET Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We evaluate the impact of pretraining Graph Transformer architectures on atom-level quantum-mechanical features for the modeling of absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET) properties of drug-like compounds. We compare this pretraining strategy with two others: one based on molecular quantum properties (specifically the HOMO-LUMO gap) and one using a self-supervised atom masking technique. After fine-tuning on Therapeutic Data Commons ADMET datasets, we evaluate the performance improvement in the different models observing that models pretrained with atomic quantum mechanical properties produce in general better results. We then analyse the latent representations and observe that the supervised strategies preserve the pretraining information after finetuning and that different pretrainings produce different trends in latent expressivity across layers. Furthermore, we find that models pretrained on atomic quantum mechanical properties capture more low-frequency laplacian eigenmodes of the input graph via the attention weights and produce better representations of atomic environments within the molecule. Application of the analysis to a much larger non-public dataset for microsomal clearance illustrates generalizability of the studied indicators. In this case the performances of the models are in accordance with the representation analysis and highlight, especially for the case of masking pretraining and atom-level quantum property pretraining, how model types with similar performance on public benchmarks can have different performances on large scale pharmaceutical data.</description>

      <title>Private Language Models via Truncated Laplacian Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08027v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning models for NLP tasks are prone to variants of privacy attacks. To prevent privacy leakage, researchers have investigated word-level perturbations, relying on the formal guarantees of differential privacy (DP) in the embedding space. However, many existing approaches either achieve unsatisfactory performance in the high privacy regime when using the Laplacian or Gaussian mechanism, or resort to weaker relaxations of DP that are inferior to the canonical DP in terms of privacy strength. This raises the question of whether a new method for private word embedding can be designed to overcome these limitations. In this paper, we propose a novel private embedding method called the high dimensional truncated Laplacian mechanism. Specifically, we introduce a non-trivial extension of the truncated Laplacian mechanism, which was previously only investigated in one-dimensional space cases. Theoretically, we show that our method has a lower variance compared to the previous private word embedding methods. To further validate its effectiveness, we conduct comprehensive experiments on private embedding and downstream tasks using three datasets. Remarkably, even in the high privacy regime, our approach only incurs a slight decrease in utility compared to the non-private scenario.</description>

      <title>Strategic Classification With Externalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new variant of the strategic classification problem: a principal reveals a classifier, and $n$ agents report their (possibly manipulated) features to be classified. Motivated by real-world applications, our model crucially allows the manipulation of one agent to affect another; that is, it explicitly captures inter-agent externalities. The principal-agent interactions are formally modeled as a Stackelberg game, with the resulting agent manipulation dynamics captured as a simultaneous game. We show that under certain assumptions, the pure Nash Equilibrium of this agent manipulation game is unique and can be efficiently computed. Leveraging this result, PAC learning guarantees are established for the learner: informally, we show that it is possible to learn classifiers that minimize loss on the distribution, even when a random number of agents are manipulating their way to a pure Nash Equilibrium. We also comment on the optimization of such classifiers through gradient-based approaches. This work sets the theoretical foundations for a more realistic analysis of classifiers that are robust against multiple strategic actors interacting in a common environment.</description>

      <title>IntrinsicVoice: Empowering LLMs with Intrinsic Real-time Voice Interaction Abilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current methods of building LLMs with voice interaction capabilities rely heavily on explicit text autoregressive generation before or during speech response generation to maintain content quality, which unfortunately brings computational overhead and increases latency in multi-turn interactions. To address this, we introduce IntrinsicVoic,e an LLM designed with intrinsic real-time voice interaction capabilities. IntrinsicVoice aims to facilitate the transfer of textual capabilities of pre-trained LLMs to the speech modality by mitigating the modality gap between text and speech. Our novelty architecture, GroupFormer, can reduce speech sequences to lengths comparable to text sequences while generating high-quality audio, significantly reducing the length difference between speech and text, speeding up inference, and alleviating long-text modeling issues. Additionally, we construct a multi-turn speech-to-speech dialogue dataset named \method-500k which includes nearly 500k turns of speech-to-speech dialogues, and a cross-modality training strategy to enhance the semantic alignment between speech and text. Experimental results demonstrate that IntrinsicVoice can generate high-quality speech response with latency lower than 100ms in multi-turn dialogue scenarios. Demos are available at https://instrinsicvoice.github.io/.</description>

      <title>Composite Learning Units: Generalized Learning Beyond Parameter Updates to Transform LLMs into Adaptive Reasoners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human learning thrives on the ability to learn from mistakes, adapt through feedback, and refine understanding-processes often missing in static machine learning models. In this work, we introduce Composite Learning Units (CLUs) designed to transform reasoners, such as Large Language Models (LLMs), into learners capable of generalized, continuous learning without conventional parameter updates while enhancing their reasoning abilities through continual interaction and feedback. CLUs are built on an architecture that allows a reasoning model to maintain and evolve a dynamic knowledge repository: a General Knowledge Space for broad, reusable insights and a Prompt-Specific Knowledge Space for task-specific learning. Through goal-driven interactions, CLUs iteratively refine these knowledge spaces, enabling the system to adapt dynamically to complex tasks, extract nuanced insights, and build upon past experiences autonomously. We demonstrate CLUs' effectiveness through a cryptographic reasoning task, where they continuously evolve their understanding through feedback to uncover hidden transformation rules. While conventional models struggle to grasp underlying logic, CLUs excel by engaging in an iterative, goal-oriented process. Specialized components-handling knowledge retrieval, prompt generation, and feedback analysis-work together within a reinforcing feedback loop. This approach allows CLUs to retain the memory of past failures and successes, adapt autonomously, and apply sophisticated reasoning effectively, continually learning from mistakes while also building on breakthroughs.</description>

      <title>On the Convergence of (Stochastic) Gradient Descent for Kolmogorov--Arnold Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kolmogorov--Arnold Networks (KANs), a recently proposed neural network architecture, have gained significant attention in the deep learning community, due to their potential as a viable alternative to multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) and their broad applicability to various scientific tasks. Empirical investigations demonstrate that KANs optimized via stochastic gradient descent (SGD) are capable of achieving near-zero training loss in various machine learning (e.g., regression, classification, and time series forecasting, etc.) and scientific tasks (e.g., solving partial differential equations). In this paper, we provide a theoretical explanation for the empirical success by conducting a rigorous convergence analysis of gradient descent (GD) and SGD for two-layer KANs in solving both regression and physics-informed tasks. For regression problems, we establish using the neural tangent kernel perspective that GD achieves global linear convergence of the objective function when the hidden dimension of KANs is sufficiently large. We further extend these results to SGD, demonstrating a similar global convergence in expectation. Additionally, we analyze the global convergence of GD and SGD for physics-informed KANs, which unveils additional challenges due to the more complex loss structure. This is the first work establishing the global convergence guarantees for GD and SGD applied to optimize KANs and physics-informed KANs.</description>

      <title>Scaling Up Your Kernels: Large Kernel Design in ConvNets towards Universal Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes the paradigm of large convolutional kernels in designing modern Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets). We establish that employing a few large kernels, instead of stacking multiple smaller ones, can be a superior design strategy. Our work introduces a set of architecture design guidelines for large-kernel ConvNets that optimize their efficiency and performance. We propose the UniRepLKNet architecture, which offers systematical architecture design principles specifically crafted for large-kernel ConvNets, emphasizing their unique ability to capture extensive spatial information without deep layer stacking. This results in a model that not only surpasses its predecessors with an ImageNet accuracy of 88.0%, an ADE20K mIoU of 55.6%, and a COCO box AP of 56.4% but also demonstrates impressive scalability and performance on various modalities such as time-series forecasting, audio, point cloud, and video recognition. These results indicate the universal modeling abilities of large-kernel ConvNets with faster inference speed compared with vision transformers. Our findings reveal that large-kernel ConvNets possess larger effective receptive fields and a higher shape bias, moving away from the texture bias typical of smaller-kernel CNNs. All codes and models are publicly available at https://github.com/AILab-CVC/UniRepLKNet promoting further research and development in the community.</description>

      <title>Closing the Loop: Learning to Generate Writing Feedback via Language Model Simulated Student Revisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Providing feedback is widely recognized as crucial for refining students' writing skills. Recent advances in language models (LMs) have made it possible to automatically generate feedback that is actionable and well-aligned with human-specified attributes. However, it remains unclear whether the feedback generated by these models is truly effective in enhancing the quality of student revisions. Moreover, prompting LMs with a precise set of instructions to generate feedback is nontrivial due to the lack of consensus regarding the specific attributes that can lead to improved revising performance. To address these challenges, we propose PROF that PROduces Feedback via learning from LM simulated student revisions. PROF aims to iteratively optimize the feedback generator by directly maximizing the effectiveness of students' overall revising performance as simulated by LMs. Focusing on an economic essay assignment, we empirically test the efficacy of PROF and observe that our approach not only surpasses a variety of baseline methods in effectiveness of improving students' writing but also demonstrates enhanced pedagogical values, even though it was not explicitly trained for this aspect.</description>

      <title>Optimal Transportation by Orthogonal Coupling Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many numerical algorithms and learning tasks rest on solution of the Monge-Kantorovich problem and corresponding Wasserstein distances. While the natural approach is to treat the problem as an infinite-dimensional linear programming, such a methodology severely limits the computational performance due to the polynomial scaling with respect to the sample size along with intensive memory requirements. We propose a novel alternative framework to address the Monge-Kantorovich problem based on a projection type gradient descent scheme. The micro-dynamics is built on the notion of the conditional expectation, where the connection with the opinion dynamics is explored and leveraged to build compact numerical schemes. We demonstrate that the devised dynamics recovers random maps with favourable computational performance. Along with the theoretical insight, the provided dynamics paves the way for innovative approaches to construct numerical schemes for computing optimal transport maps as well as Wasserstein distances.</description>

      <title>Reward-Augmented Data Enhances Direct Preference Alignment of LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Preference alignment in Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly improved their ability to adhere to human instructions and intentions. However, existing direct alignment algorithms primarily focus on relative preferences and often overlook the qualitative aspects of responses. Striving to maximize the implicit reward gap between the chosen and the slightly inferior rejected responses can cause overfitting and unnecessary unlearning of the high-quality rejected responses. The unawareness of the reward scores also drives the LLM to indiscriminately favor the low-quality chosen responses and fail to generalize to responses with the highest rewards, which are sparse in data. To overcome these shortcomings, our study introduces reward-conditioned LLM policies that discern and learn from the entire spectrum of response quality within the dataset, helping extrapolate to more optimal regions. We propose an effective yet simple data relabeling method that conditions the preference pairs on quality scores to construct a reward-augmented dataset. This dataset is easily integrated with existing direct alignment algorithms and is applicable to any preference dataset. The experimental results across instruction-following benchmarks including AlpacaEval, MT-Bench, and Arena-Hard-Auto demonstrate that our approach consistently boosts the performance of DPO by a considerable margin across diverse models. Additionally, our method improves the average accuracy on various academic benchmarks. When applying our method to on-policy data, the resulting DPO model achieves SOTA results on AlpacaEval. Through ablation studies, we demonstrate that our method not only maximizes the utility of preference data but also mitigates the issue of unlearning, demonstrating its broad effectiveness beyond mere dataset expansion. Our code is available at https://github.com/shenao-zhang/reward-augmented-preference.</description>

      <title>Teaching-Inspired Integrated Prompting Framework: A Novel Approach for Enhancing Reasoning in Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit impressive performance across various domains but still struggle with arithmetic reasoning tasks. Recent work shows the effectiveness of prompt design methods in enhancing reasoning capabilities. However, these approaches overlook crucial requirements for prior knowledge of specific concepts, theorems, and tricks to tackle most arithmetic reasoning problems successfully. To address this issue, we propose a novel and effective Teaching-Inspired Integrated Framework, which emulates the instructional process of a teacher guiding students. This method equips LLMs with essential concepts, relevant theorems, and similar problems with analogous solution approaches, facilitating the enhancement of reasoning abilities. Additionally, we introduce two new Chinese datasets, MathMC and MathToF, both with detailed explanations and answers. Experiments are conducted on nine benchmarks which demonstrates that our approach improves the reasoning accuracy of LLMs. With GPT-4 and our framework, we achieve new state-of-the-art performance on four math benchmarks (AddSub, SVAMP, Math23K and AQuA) with accuracies of 98.2% (+3.3%), 93.9% (+0.2%), 94.3% (+7.2%) and 81.1% (+1.2%).

      <description>arXiv:2410.08069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gradient-based interpretations often require an anchor point of comparison to avoid saturation in computing feature importance. We show that current baselines defined using static functions--constant mapping, averaging or blurring--inject harmful colour, texture or frequency assumptions that deviate from model behaviour. This leads to accumulation of irregular gradients, resulting in attribution maps that are biased, fragile and manipulable. Departing from the static approach, we propose UNI to compute an (un)learnable, debiased and adaptive baseline by perturbing the input towards an unlearning direction of steepest ascent. Our method discovers reliable baselines and succeeds in erasing salient features, which in turn locally smooths the high-curvature decision boundaries. Our analyses point to unlearning as a promising avenue for generating faithful, efficient and robust interpretations.</description>

      <title>Packing Analysis: Packing Is More Appropriate for Large Models or Datasets in Supervised Fine-tuning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Packing, initially utilized in the pre-training phase, is an optimization technique designed to maximize hardware resource efficiency by combining different training sequences to fit the model's maximum input length. Although it has demonstrated effectiveness during pre-training, there remains a lack of comprehensive analysis for the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage on the following points: (1) whether packing can effectively enhance training efficiency while maintaining performance, (2) the suitable size of the model and dataset for fine-tuning with the packing method, and (3) whether packing unrelated or related training samples might cause the model to either excessively disregard or over-rely on the context.
  In this paper, we perform extensive comparisons between SFT methods using padding and packing, covering SFT datasets ranging from 69K to 1.2M and models from 8B to 70B. This provides the first comprehensive analysis of the advantages and limitations of packing versus padding, as well as practical considerations for implementing packing in various training scenarios. Our analysis covers various benchmarks, including knowledge, reasoning, and coding, as well as GPT-based evaluations, time efficiency, and other fine-tuning parameters. We also open-source our code for fine-tuning and evaluation and provide checkpoints fine-tuned on datasets of different sizes, aiming to advance future research on packing methods.

      <title>Can Knowledge Graphs Make Large Language Models More Trustworthy? An Empirical Study over Open-ended Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent works integrating Knowledge Graphs (KGs) have led to promising improvements in enhancing reasoning accuracy of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, current benchmarks mainly focus on closed tasks, leaving a gap in the assessment of more complex, real-world scenarios. This gap has also obscured the evaluation of KGs' potential to mitigate the problem of hallucination in LLMs. To fill the gap, we introduce OKGQA, a new benchmark specifically designed to assess LLMs enhanced with KGs under open-ended, real-world question answering scenarios. OKGQA is designed to closely reflect the complexities of practical applications using questions from different types, and incorporates specific metrics to measure both the reduction in hallucinations and the enhancement in reasoning capabilities. To consider the scenario in which KGs may have varying levels of mistakes, we further propose another experiment setting OKGQA-P to assess model performance when the semantics and structure of KGs are deliberately perturbed and contaminated. OKGQA aims to (1) explore whether KGs can make LLMs more trustworthy in an open-ended setting, and (2) conduct a comparative analysis to shed light on methods and future directions for leveraging KGs to reduce LLMs' hallucination. We believe that this study can facilitate a more complete performance comparison and encourage continuous improvement in integrating KGs with LLMs.</description>

      <title>A Closer Look at Machine Unlearning for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) may memorize sensitive or copyrighted content, raising privacy and legal concerns. Due to the high cost of retraining from scratch, researchers attempt to employ machine unlearning to remove specific content from LLMs while preserving the overall performance. In this paper, we discuss several issues in machine unlearning for LLMs and provide our insights on possible approaches. To address the issue of inadequate evaluation of model outputs after unlearning, we introduce three additional metrics to evaluate token diversity, sentence semantics, and factual correctness. We then categorize unlearning methods into untargeted and targeted, and discuss their issues respectively. Specifically, the behavior that untargeted unlearning attempts to approximate is unpredictable and may involve hallucinations, and existing regularization is insufficient for targeted unlearning. To alleviate these issues, we propose using the objective of maximizing entropy (ME) for untargeted unlearning and incorporate answer preservation (AP) loss as regularization for targeted unlearning.

      <title>Active Fourier Auditor for Estimating Distributional Properties of ML Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the pervasive deployment of Machine Learning (ML) models in real-world applications, verifying and auditing properties of ML models have become a central concern. In this work, we focus on three properties: robustness, individual fairness, and group fairness. We discuss two approaches for auditing ML model properties: estimation with and without reconstruction of the target model under audit. Though the first approach is studied in the literature, the second approach remains unexplored. For this purpose, we develop a new framework that quantifies different properties in terms of the Fourier coefficients of the ML model under audit but does not parametrically reconstruct it. We propose the Active Fourier Auditor (AFA), which queries sample points according to the Fourier coefficients of the ML model, and further estimates the properties. We derive high probability error bounds on AFA's estimates, along with the worst-case lower bounds on the sample complexity to audit them. Numerically we demonstrate on multiple datasets and models that AFA is more accurate and sample-efficient to estimate the properties of interest than the baselines.</description>

      <title>Robust AI-Generated Text Detection by Restricted Embeddings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Growing amount and quality of AI-generated texts makes detecting such content more difficult. In most real-world scenarios, the domain (style and topic) of generated data and the generator model are not known in advance. In this work, we focus on the robustness of classifier-based detectors of AI-generated text, namely their ability to transfer to unseen generators or semantic domains. We investigate the geometry of the embedding space of Transformer-based text encoders and show that clearing out harmful linear subspaces helps to train a robust classifier, ignoring domain-specific spurious features. We investigate several subspace decomposition and feature selection strategies and achieve significant improvements over state of the art methods in cross-domain and cross-generator transfer. Our best approaches for head-wise and coordinate-based subspace removal increase the mean out-of-distribution (OOD) classification score by up to 9% and 14% in particular setups for RoBERTa and BERT embeddings respectively. We release our code and data: https://github.com/SilverSolver/RobustATD</description>

      <title>Optima: Optimizing Effectiveness and Efficiency for LLM-Based Multi-Agent System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) based multi-agent systems (MAS) show remarkable potential in collaborative problem-solving, yet they still face critical challenges: low communication efficiency, poor scalability, and a lack of effective parameter-updating optimization methods. We present Optima, a novel framework that addresses these issues by significantly enhancing both communication efficiency and task effectiveness in LLM-based MAS through LLM training. Optima employs an iterative generate, rank, select, and train paradigm with a reward function balancing task performance, token efficiency, and communication readability. We explore various RL algorithms, including Supervised Fine-Tuning, Direct Preference Optimization, and their hybrid approaches, providing insights into their effectiveness-efficiency trade-offs. We integrate Monte Carlo Tree Search-inspired techniques for DPO data generation, treating conversation turns as tree nodes to explore diverse interaction paths. Evaluated on common multi-agent tasks, including information-asymmetric question answering and complex reasoning, Optima shows consistent and substantial improvements over single-agent baselines and vanilla MAS based on Llama 3 8B, achieving up to 2.8x performance gain with less than 10\% tokens on tasks requiring heavy information exchange. Moreover, Optima's efficiency gains open new possibilities for leveraging inference-compute more effectively, leading to improved inference-time scaling laws. By addressing fundamental challenges in LLM-based MAS, Optima shows the potential towards scalable, efficient, and effective MAS (https://chenweize1998.github.io/optima-project-page).</description>

      <title>Heterogeneous Graph Auto-Encoder for CreditCard Fraud Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The digital revolution has significantly impacted financial transactions, leading to a notable increase in credit card usage. However, this convenience comes with a trade-off: a substantial rise in fraudulent activities. Traditional machine learning methods for fraud detection often struggle to capture the inherent interconnectedness within financial data. This paper proposes a novel approach for credit card fraud detection that leverages Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with attention mechanisms applied to heterogeneous graph representations of financial data. Unlike homogeneous graphs, heterogeneous graphs capture intricate relationships between various entities in the financial ecosystem, such as cardholders, merchants, and transactions, providing a richer and more comprehensive data representation for fraud analysis. To address the inherent class imbalance in fraud data, where genuine transactions significantly outnumber fraudulent ones, the proposed approach integrates an autoencoder. This autoencoder, trained on genuine transactions, learns a latent representation and flags deviations during reconstruction as potential fraud. This research investigates two key questions: (1) How effectively can a GNN with an attention mechanism detect and prevent credit card fraud when applied to a heterogeneous graph? (2) How does the efficacy of the autoencoder with attention approach compare to traditional methods? The results are promising, demonstrating that the proposed model outperforms benchmark algorithms such as Graph Sage and FI-GRL, achieving a superior AUC-PR of 0.89 and an F1-score of 0.81. This research significantly advances fraud detection systems and the overall security of financial transactions by leveraging GNNs with attention mechanisms and addressing class imbalance through an autoencoder.</description>

      <title>Mars: Situated Inductive Reasoning in an Open-World Environment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) trained on massive corpora have shown remarkable success in knowledge-intensive tasks. Yet, most of them rely on pre-stored knowledge. Inducing new general knowledge from a specific environment and performing reasoning with the acquired knowledge -- \textit{situated inductive reasoning}, is crucial and challenging for machine intelligence. In this paper, we design Mars, an interactive environment devised for situated inductive reasoning. It introduces counter-commonsense game mechanisms by modifying terrain, survival setting and task dependency while adhering to certain principles. In Mars, agents need to actively interact with their surroundings, derive useful rules and perform decision-making tasks in specific contexts. We conduct experiments on various RL-based and LLM-based methods, finding that they all struggle on this challenging situated inductive reasoning benchmark. Furthermore, we explore \textit{Induction from Reflection}, where we instruct agents to perform inductive reasoning from history trajectory. The superior performance underscores the importance of inductive reasoning in Mars. Through Mars, we aim to galvanize advancements in situated inductive reasoning and set the stage for developing the next generation of AI systems that can reason in an adaptive and context-sensitive way.</description>

      <title>Assessing Episodic Memory in LLMs with Sequence Order Recall Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current LLM benchmarks focus on evaluating models' memory of facts and semantic relations, primarily assessing semantic aspects of long-term memory. However, in humans, long-term memory also includes episodic memory, which links memories to their contexts, such as the time and place they occurred. The ability to contextualize memories is crucial for many cognitive tasks and everyday functions. This form of memory has not been evaluated in LLMs with existing benchmarks. To address the gap in evaluating memory in LLMs, we introduce Sequence Order Recall Tasks (SORT), which we adapt from tasks used to study episodic memory in cognitive psychology. SORT requires LLMs to recall the correct order of text segments, and provides a general framework that is both easily extendable and does not require any additional annotations. We present an initial evaluation dataset, Book-SORT, comprising 36k pairs of segments extracted from 9 books recently added to the public domain. Based on a human experiment with 155 participants, we show that humans can recall sequence order based on long-term memory of a book. We find that models can perform the task with high accuracy when relevant text is given in-context during the SORT evaluation. However, when presented with the book text only during training, LLMs' performance on SORT falls short. By allowing to evaluate more aspects of memory, we believe that SORT will aid in the emerging development of memory-augmented models.</description>

      <title>Steering Masked Discrete Diffusion Models via Discrete Denoising Posterior Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative modeling of discrete data underlies important applications spanning text-based agents like ChatGPT to the design of the very building blocks of life in protein sequences. However, application domains need to exert control over the generated data by steering the generative process - typically via RLHF - to satisfy a specified property, reward, or affinity metric. In this paper, we study the problem of steering Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs), a recent class of discrete diffusion models that offer a compelling alternative to traditional autoregressive models. We introduce Discrete Denoising Posterior Prediction (DDPP), a novel framework that casts the task of steering pre-trained MDMs as a problem of probabilistic inference by learning to sample from a target Bayesian posterior. Our DDPP framework leads to a family of three novel objectives that are all simulation-free, and thus scalable while applying to general non-differentiable reward functions. Empirically, we instantiate DDPP by steering MDMs to perform class-conditional pixel-level image modeling, RLHF-based alignment of MDMs using text-based rewards, and finetuning protein language models to generate more diverse secondary structures and shorter proteins. We substantiate our designs via wet-lab validation, where we observe transient expression of reward-optimized protein sequences.</description>

      <title>DelTA: An Online Document-Level Translation Agent Based on Multi-Level Memory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved reasonable quality improvements in machine translation (MT). However, most current research on MT-LLMs still faces significant challenges in maintaining translation consistency and accuracy when processing entire documents. In this paper, we introduce DelTA, a Document-levEL Translation Agent designed to overcome these limitations. DelTA features a multi-level memory structure that stores information across various granularities and spans, including Proper Noun Records, Bilingual Summary, Long-Term Memory, and Short-Term Memory, which are continuously retrieved and updated by auxiliary LLM-based components. Experimental results indicate that DelTA significantly outperforms strong baselines in terms of translation consistency and quality across four open/closed-source LLMs and two representative document translation datasets, achieving an increase in consistency scores by up to 4.58 percentage points and in COMET scores by up to 3.16 points on average. DelTA employs a sentence-by-sentence translation strategy, ensuring no sentence omissions and offering a memory-efficient solution compared to the mainstream method. Furthermore, DelTA improves pronoun translation accuracy, and the summary component of the agent also shows promise as a tool for query-based summarization tasks. We release our code and data at https://github.com/YutongWang1216/DocMTAgent.</description>

      <title>On the Evaluation of Generative Robotic Simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to the difficulty of acquiring extensive real-world data, robot simulation has become crucial for parallel training and sim-to-real transfer, highlighting the importance of scalable simulated robotic tasks. Foundation models have demonstrated impressive capacities in autonomously generating feasible robotic tasks. However, this new paradigm underscores the challenge of adequately evaluating these autonomously generated tasks. To address this, we propose a comprehensive evaluation framework tailored to generative simulations. Our framework segments evaluation into three core aspects: quality, diversity, and generalization. For single-task quality, we evaluate the realism of the generated task and the completeness of the generated trajectories using large language models and vision-language models. In terms of diversity, we measure both task and data diversity through text similarity of task descriptions and world model loss trained on collected task trajectories. For task-level generalization, we assess the zero-shot generalization ability on unseen tasks of a policy trained with multiple generated tasks. Experiments conducted on three representative task generation pipelines demonstrate that the results from our framework are highly consistent with human evaluations, confirming the feasibility and validity of our approach. The findings reveal that while metrics of quality and diversity can be achieved through certain methods, no single approach excels across all metrics, suggesting a need for greater focus on balancing these different metrics. Additionally, our analysis further highlights the common challenge of low generalization capability faced by current works.

      <title>Sample then Identify: A General Framework for Risk Control and Assessment in Multimodal Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) exhibit promising advancements across various tasks, yet they still encounter significant trustworthiness issues. Prior studies apply Split Conformal Prediction (SCP) in language modeling to construct prediction sets with statistical guarantees. However, these methods typically rely on internal model logits or are restricted to multiple-choice settings, which hampers their generalizability and adaptability in dynamic, open-ended environments. In this paper, we introduce TRON, a two-step framework for risk control and assessment, applicable to any MLLM that supports sampling in both open-ended and closed-ended scenarios. TRON comprises two main components: (1) a novel conformal score to sample response sets of minimum size, and (2) a nonconformity score to identify high-quality responses based on self-consistency theory, controlling the error rates by two specific risk levels. Furthermore, we investigate semantic redundancy in prediction sets within open-ended contexts for the first time, leading to a promising evaluation metric for MLLMs based on average set size. Our comprehensive experiments across four Video Question-Answering (VideoQA) datasets utilizing eight MLLMs show that TRON achieves desired error rates bounded by two user-specified risk levels. Additionally, deduplicated prediction sets maintain adaptiveness while being more efficient and stable for risk assessment under different risk levels.</description>

      <title>MRAG-Bench: Vision-Centric Evaluation for Retrieval-Augmented Multimodal Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing multimodal retrieval benchmarks primarily focus on evaluating whether models can retrieve and utilize external textual knowledge for question answering. However, there are scenarios where retrieving visual information is either more beneficial or easier to access than textual data. In this paper, we introduce a multimodal retrieval-augmented generation benchmark, MRAG-Bench, in which we systematically identify and categorize scenarios where visually augmented knowledge is better than textual knowledge, for instance, more images from varying viewpoints. MRAG-Bench consists of 16,130 images and 1,353 human-annotated multiple-choice questions across 9 distinct scenarios. With MRAG-Bench, we conduct an evaluation of 10 open-source and 4 proprietary large vision-language models (LVLMs). Our results show that all LVLMs exhibit greater improvements when augmented with images compared to textual knowledge, confirming that MRAG-Bench is vision-centric. Additionally, we conduct extensive analysis with MRAG-Bench, which offers valuable insights into retrieval-augmented LVLMs. Notably, the top-performing model, GPT-4o, faces challenges in effectively leveraging retrieved knowledge, achieving only a 5.82% improvement with ground-truth information, in contrast to a 33.16% improvement observed in human participants. These findings highlight the importance of MRAG-Bench in encouraging the community to enhance LVLMs' ability to utilize retrieved visual knowledge more effectively.</description>

      <title>DifFRelight: Diffusion-Based Facial Performance Relighting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel framework for free-viewpoint facial performance relighting using diffusion-based image-to-image translation. Leveraging a subject-specific dataset containing diverse facial expressions captured under various lighting conditions, including flat-lit and one-light-at-a-time (OLAT) scenarios, we train a diffusion model for precise lighting control, enabling high-fidelity relit facial images from flat-lit inputs. Our framework includes spatially-aligned conditioning of flat-lit captures and random noise, along with integrated lighting information for global control, utilizing prior knowledge from the pre-trained Stable Diffusion model. This model is then applied to dynamic facial performances captured in a consistent flat-lit environment and reconstructed for novel-view synthesis using a scalable dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting method to maintain quality and consistency in the relit results. In addition, we introduce unified lighting control by integrating a novel area lighting representation with directional lighting, allowing for joint adjustments in light size and direction. We also enable high dynamic range imaging (HDRI) composition using multiple directional lights to produce dynamic sequences under complex lighting conditions. Our evaluations demonstrate the models efficiency in achieving precise lighting control and generalizing across various facial expressions while preserving detailed features such as skintexture andhair. The model accurately reproduces complex lighting effects like eye reflections, subsurface scattering, self-shadowing, and translucency, advancing photorealism within our framework.</description>

      <title>MathCoder2: Better Math Reasoning from Continued Pretraining on Model-translated Mathematical Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Code has been shown to be effective in enhancing the mathematical reasoning abilities of large language models due to its precision and accuracy. Previous works involving continued mathematical pretraining often include code that utilizes math-related packages, which are primarily designed for fields such as engineering, machine learning, signal processing, or module testing, rather than being directly focused on mathematical reasoning. In this paper, we introduce a novel method for generating mathematical code accompanied with corresponding reasoning steps for continued pretraining. Our approach begins with the construction of a high-quality mathematical continued pretraining dataset by incorporating math-related web data, code using mathematical packages, math textbooks, and synthetic data. Next, we construct reasoning steps by extracting LaTeX expressions, the conditions needed for the expressions, and the results of the expressions from the previously collected dataset. Based on this extracted information, we generate corresponding code to accurately capture the mathematical reasoning process. Appending the generated code to each reasoning step results in data consisting of paired natural language reasoning steps and their corresponding code. Combining this data with the original dataset results in a 19.2B-token high-performing mathematical pretraining corpus, which we name MathCode-Pile.

      <title>From Exploration to Mastery: Enabling LLMs to Master Tools via Self-Driven Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tool learning enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to interact with external environments by invoking tools, serving as an effective strategy to mitigate the limitations inherent in their pre-training data. In this process, tool documentation plays a crucial role by providing usage instructions for LLMs, thereby facilitating effective tool utilization. This paper concentrates on the critical challenge of bridging the comprehension gap between LLMs and external tools due to the inadequacies and inaccuracies inherent in existing human-centric tool documentation. We propose a novel framework, DRAFT, aimed at Dynamically Refining tool documentation through the Analysis of Feedback and Trails emanating from LLMs' interactions with external tools. This methodology pivots on an innovative trial-and-error approach, consisting of three distinct learning phases: experience gathering, learning from experience, and documentation rewriting, to iteratively enhance the tool documentation. This process is further optimized by implementing a diversity-promoting exploration strategy to ensure explorative diversity and a tool-adaptive termination mechanism to prevent overfitting while enhancing efficiency. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that DRAFT's iterative, feedback-based refinement significantly ameliorates documentation quality, fostering a deeper comprehension and more effective utilization of tools by LLMs. Notably, our analysis reveals that the tool documentation refined via our approach demonstrates robust cross-model generalization capabilities.</description>

      <title>SPA: 3D Spatial-Awareness Enables Effective Embodied Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce SPA, a novel representation learning framework that emphasizes the importance of 3D spatial awareness in embodied AI. Our approach leverages differentiable neural rendering on multi-view images to endow a vanilla Vision Transformer (ViT) with intrinsic spatial understanding. We present the most comprehensive evaluation of embodied representation learning to date, covering 268 tasks across 8 simulators with diverse policies in both single-task and language-conditioned multi-task scenarios. The results are compelling: SPA consistently outperforms more than 10 state-of-the-art representation methods, including those specifically designed for embodied AI, vision-centric tasks, and multi-modal applications, while using less training data. Furthermore, we conduct a series of real-world experiments to confirm its effectiveness in practical scenarios. These results highlight the critical role of 3D spatial awareness for embodied representation learning. Our strongest model takes more than 6000 GPU hours to train and we are committed to open-sourcing all code and model weights to foster future research in embodied representation learning.

      <title>Emerging Pixel Grounding in Large Multimodal Models Without Grounding Supervision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current large multimodal models (LMMs) face challenges in grounding, which requires the model to relate language components to visual entities. Contrary to the common practice that fine-tunes LMMs with additional grounding supervision, we find that the grounding ability can in fact emerge in LMMs trained without explicit grounding supervision. To reveal this emerging grounding, we introduce an "attend-and-segment" method which leverages attention maps from standard LMMs to perform pixel-level segmentation. Furthermore, to enhance the grounding ability, we propose DIFFLMM, an LMM utilizing a diffusion-based visual encoder, as opposed to the standard CLIP visual encoder, and trained with the same weak supervision. Without being constrained by the biases and limited scale of grounding-specific supervision data, our approach is more generalizable and scalable. We achieve competitive performance on both grounding-specific and general visual question answering benchmarks, compared with grounding LMMs and generalist LMMs, respectively. Notably, we achieve a 44.2 grounding mask recall on grounded conversation generation without any grounding supervision, outperforming the extensively supervised model GLaMM.

      <title>PointOBB-v2: Towards Simpler, Faster, and Stronger Single Point Supervised Oriented Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single point supervised oriented object detection has gained attention and made initial progress within the community. Diverse from those approaches relying on one-shot samples or powerful pretrained models (e.g. SAM), PointOBB has shown promise due to its prior-free feature. In this paper, we propose PointOBB-v2, a simpler, faster, and stronger method to generate pseudo rotated boxes from points without relying on any other prior. Specifically, we first generate a Class Probability Map (CPM) by training the network with non-uniform positive and negative sampling. We show that the CPM is able to learn the approximate object regions and their contours. Then, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied to accurately estimate the orientation and the boundary of objects. By further incorporating a separation mechanism, we resolve the confusion caused by the overlapping on the CPM, enabling its operation in high-density scenarios. Extensive comparisons demonstrate that our method achieves a training speed 15.58x faster and an accuracy improvement of 11.60%/25.15%/21.19% on the DOTA-v1.0/v1.5/v2.0 datasets compared to the previous state-of-the-art, PointOBB. This significantly advances the cutting edge of single point supervised oriented detection in the modular track.</description>

      <title>LatteCLIP: Unsupervised CLIP Fine-Tuning via LMM-Synthetic Texts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large-scale vision-language pre-trained (VLP) models (e.g., CLIP) are renowned for their versatility, as they can be applied to diverse applications in a zero-shot setup. However, when these models are used in specific domains, their performance often falls short due to domain gaps or the under-representation of these domains in the training data. While fine-tuning VLP models on custom datasets with human-annotated labels can address this issue, annotating even a small-scale dataset (e.g., 100k samples) can be an expensive endeavor, often requiring expert annotators if the task is complex. To address these challenges, we propose LatteCLIP, an unsupervised method for fine-tuning CLIP models on classification with known class names in custom domains, without relying on human annotations. Our method leverages Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to generate expressive textual descriptions for both individual images and groups of images. These provide additional contextual information to guide the fine-tuning process in the custom domains. Since LMM-generated descriptions are prone to hallucination or missing details, we introduce a novel strategy to distill only the useful information and stabilize the training. Specifically, we learn rich per-class prototype representations from noisy generated texts and dual pseudo-labels. Our experiments on 10 domain-specific datasets show that LatteCLIP outperforms pre-trained zero-shot methods by an average improvement of +4.74 points in top-1 accuracy and other state-of-the-art unsupervised methods by +3.45 points.</description>

      <title>Contextual Linear Bandits under Noisy Features: Towards Bayesian Oracles</title>

      <description>arXiv:1703.01347v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study contextual linear bandit problems under feature uncertainty, where the features are noisy and have missing entries. To address the challenges posed by this noise, we analyze Bayesian oracles given the observed noisy features. Our Bayesian analysis reveals that the optimal hypothesis can significantly deviate from the underlying realizability function, depending on the noise characteristics. These deviations are highly non-intuitive and do not occur in classical noiseless setups. This implies that classical approaches cannot guarantee a non-trivial regret bound. Therefore, we propose an algorithm that aims to approximate the Bayesian oracle based on the observed information under this model, achieving $\tilde{O}(d\sqrt{T})$ regret bound when there is a large number of arms. We demonstrate the proposed algorithm using synthetic and real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>OpenDriver: An Open-Road Driver State Detection Dataset</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.04203v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Among numerous studies for driver state detection, wearable physiological measurements offer a practical method for real-time monitoring. However, there are few driver physiological datasets in open-road scenarios, and the existing datasets suffer from issues such as poor signal quality, small sample sizes, and short data collection periods. Therefore, in this paper, a large-scale multimodal driving dataset, OpenDriver, for driver state detection is developed. The OpenDriver encompasses a total of 3,278 driving trips, with a signal collection duration spanning approximately 4,600 hours. Two modalities of driving signals are enrolled in OpenDriver: electrocardiogram (ECG) signals and six-axis motion data of the steering wheel from a motion measurement unit (IMU), which were recorded from 81 drivers and their vehicles. Furthermore, three challenging tasks are involved in our work, namely ECG signal quality assessment, individual biometric identification based on ECG signals, and physiological signal analysis in complex driving environments. To facilitate research in these tasks, corresponding benchmarks have also been introduced. First, a noisy augmentation strategy is applied to generate a larger-scale ECG signal dataset with realistic noise simulation for quality assessment. Second, an end-to-end contrastive learning framework is employed for individual biometric identification. Finally, a comprehensive analysis of drivers' HRV features under different driving conditions is conducted. Each benchmark provides evaluation metrics and reference results. The OpenDriver dataset will be publicly available at https://github.com/bdne/OpenDriver.</description>

      <title>Generalized Out-of-distribution Fault Diagnosis (GOOFD) via Internal Contrastive Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.15266v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fault diagnosis is crucial in monitoring machines within industrial processes. With the increasing complexity of working conditions and demand for safety during production, diverse diagnosis methods are required, and an integrated fault diagnosis system capable of handling multiple tasks is highly desired. However, the diagnosis subtasks are often studied separately, and the current methods still need improvement for such a generalized system. To address this issue, we propose the Generalized Out-of-distribution Fault Diagnosis (GOOFD) framework to integrate diagnosis subtasks. Additionally, a unified fault diagnosis method based on internal contrastive learning and Mahalanobis distance is put forward to underpin the proposed generalized framework. The method involves feature extraction through internal contrastive learning and outlier recognition based on the Mahalanobis distance. Our proposed method can be applied to multiple faults diagnosis tasks and achieve better performance than the existing single-task methods. Experiments are conducted on benchmark and practical process datasets, indicating the effectiveness of the proposed framework.</description>

      <title>MedSafetyBench: Evaluating and Improving the Medical Safety of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03744v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) develop increasingly sophisticated capabilities and find applications in medical settings, it becomes important to assess their medical safety due to their far-reaching implications for personal and public health, patient safety, and human rights. However, there is little to no understanding of the notion of medical safety in the context of LLMs, let alone how to evaluate and improve it. To address this gap, we first define the notion of medical safety in LLMs based on the Principles of Medical Ethics set forth by the American Medical Association. We then leverage this understanding to introduce MedSafetyBench, the first benchmark dataset designed to measure the medical safety of LLMs. We demonstrate the utility of MedSafetyBench by using it to evaluate and improve the medical safety of LLMs. Our results show that publicly-available medical LLMs do not meet standards of medical safety and that fine-tuning them using MedSafetyBench improves their medical safety while preserving their medical performance. By introducing this new benchmark dataset, our work enables a systematic study of the state of medical safety in LLMs and motivates future work in this area, paving the way to mitigate the safety risks of LLMs in medicine. The benchmark dataset and code are available at https://github.com/AI4LIFE-GROUP/med-safety-bench.</description>

      <title>FiDeLiS: Faithful Reasoning in Large Language Model for Knowledge Graph Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13873v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models are often challenged by generating erroneous or `hallucinated' responses, especially in complex reasoning tasks. To mitigate this, we propose a retrieval augmented reasoning method, FiDeLiS, which enhances knowledge graph question answering by anchoring responses to structured, verifiable reasoning paths. FiDeLiS uses a keyword-enhanced retrieval mechanism that fetches relevant entities and relations from a vector-based index of KGs to ensure high-recall retrieval. Once these entities and relations are retrieved, our method constructs candidate reasoning paths which are then refined using a stepwise beam search. This ensures that all the paths we create can be confidently linked back to KGs, ensuring they are accurate and reliable. A distinctive feature of our approach is its blend of natural language planning with beam search to optimize the selection of reasoning paths. Moreover, we redesign the way reasoning paths are scored by transforming this process into a deductive reasoning task, allowing the LLM to assess the validity of the paths through deductive reasoning rather than traditional logit-based scoring. This helps avoid misleading reasoning chains and reduces unnecessary computational demand. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method, even as a training-free method which has lower computational costs and superior generality, outperforms established strong baselines across three datasets.</description>

Abstract: The rapid growth of scientific literature makes it challenging for researchers to identify novel and impactful ideas, especially across disciplines. Modern artificial intelligence (AI) systems offer new approaches, potentially inspiring ideas not conceived by humans alone. But how compelling are these AI-generated ideas, and how can we improve their quality? Here, we introduce SciMuse, which uses 58 million research papers and a large-language model to generate research ideas. We conduct a large-scale evaluation in which over 100 research group leaders - from natural sciences to humanities - ranked more than 4,400 personalized ideas based on their interest. This data allows us to predict research interest using (1) supervised neural networks trained on human evaluations, and (2) unsupervised zero-shot ranking with large-language models. Our results demonstrate how future systems can help generating compelling research ideas and foster unforeseen interdisciplinary collaborations.</description>

      <title>Dr-LLaVA: Visual Instruction Tuning with Symbolic Clinical Grounding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19567v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLM) can support clinicians by analyzing medical images and engaging in natural language interactions to assist in diagnostic and treatment tasks. However, VLMs often exhibit "hallucinogenic" behavior, generating textual outputs not grounded in contextual multimodal information. This challenge is particularly pronounced in the medical domain, where we do not only require VLM outputs to be accurate in single interactions but also to be consistent with clinical reasoning and diagnostic pathways throughout multi-turn conversations. For this purpose, we propose a new alignment algorithm that uses symbolic representations of clinical reasoning to ground VLMs in medical knowledge. These representations are utilized to (i) generate GPT-4-guided visual instruction tuning data at scale, simulating clinician-VLM conversations with demonstrations of clinical reasoning, and (ii) create an automatic reward function that evaluates the clinical validity of VLM generations throughout clinician-VLM interactions. Our algorithm eliminates the need for human involvement in training data generation or reward model construction, reducing costs compared to standard reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF). We apply our alignment algorithm to develop Dr-LLaVA, a conversational VLM finetuned for analyzing bone marrow pathology slides, demonstrating strong performance in multi-turn medical conversations.</description>

      <title>Thread: A Logic-Based Data Organization Paradigm for How-To Question Answering with Retrieval Augmented Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13372v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in retrieval-augmented generation have significantly improved the performance of question-answering systems, particularly on factoid '5Ws' questions. However, these systems still face substantial challenges when addressing '1H' questions, specifically how-to questions, which are integral to decision-making processes and require dynamic, step-by-step answers. The key limitation lies in the prevalent data organization paradigm, chunk, which divides documents into fixed-size segments, and disrupts the logical coherence and connections within the context. To overcome this, in this paper, we propose Thread, a novel data organization paradigm aimed at enabling current systems to handle how-to questions more effectively. Specifically, we introduce a new knowledge granularity, termed 'logic unit', where documents are transformed into more structured and loosely interconnected logic units with large language models. Extensive experiments conducted across both open-domain and industrial settings demonstrate that Thread outperforms existing paradigms significantly, improving the success rate of handling how-to questions by 21% to 33%. Moreover, Thread exhibits high adaptability in processing various document formats, drastically reducing the candidate quantity in the knowledge base and minimizing the required information to one-fourth compared with chunk, optimizing both efficiency and effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Can Large Language Models Understand DL-Lite Ontologies? An Empirical Study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17532v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown significant achievements in solving a wide range of tasks. Recently, LLMs' capability to store, retrieve and infer with symbolic knowledge has drawn a great deal of attention, showing their potential to understand structured information. However, it is not yet known whether LLMs can understand Description Logic (DL) ontologies. In this work, we empirically analyze the LLMs' capability of understanding DL-Lite ontologies covering 6 representative tasks from syntactic and semantic aspects. With extensive experiments, we demonstrate both the effectiveness and limitations of LLMs in understanding DL-Lite ontologies. We find that LLMs can understand formal syntax and model-theoretic semantics of concepts and roles. However, LLMs struggle with understanding TBox NI transitivity and handling ontologies with large ABoxes. We hope that our experiments and analyses provide more insights into LLMs and inspire to build more faithful knowledge engineering solutions.</description>

      <title>InsightBench: Evaluating Business Analytics Agents Through Multi-Step Insight Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06423v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data analytics is essential for extracting valuable insights from data that can assist organizations in making effective decisions. We introduce InsightBench, a benchmark dataset with three key features. First, it consists of 100 datasets representing diverse business use cases such as finance and incident management, each accompanied by a carefully curated set of insights planted in the datasets. Second, unlike existing benchmarks focusing on answering single queries, InsightBench evaluates agents based on their ability to perform end-to-end data analytics, including formulating questions, interpreting answers, and generating a summary of insights and actionable steps. Third, we conducted comprehensive quality assurance to ensure that each dataset in the benchmark had clear goals and included relevant and meaningful questions and analysis. Furthermore, we implement a two-way evaluation mechanism using LLaMA-3 as an effective, open-source evaluator to assess agents' ability to extract insights. We also propose AgentPoirot, our baseline data analysis agent capable of performing end-to-end data analytics. Our evaluation on InsightBench shows that AgentPoirot outperforms existing approaches (such as Pandas Agent) that focus on resolving single queries. We also compare the performance of open- and closed-source LLMs and various evaluation strategies. Overall, this benchmark serves as a testbed to motivate further development in comprehensive automated data analytics.</description>

      <title>Multi-Agent Causal Discovery Using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15073v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in causal discovery tasks by utilizing their vast expert knowledge from extensive text corpora. However, the multi-agent capabilities of LLMs in causal discovery remain underexplored. This paper introduces a general framework to investigate this potential. The first is the Meta Agents Model, which relies exclusively on reasoning and discussions among LLM agents to conduct causal discovery. The second is the Coding Agents Model, which leverages the agents' ability to plan, write, and execute code, utilizing advanced statistical libraries for causal discovery. The third is the Hybrid Model, which integrates both the Meta Agents Model and CodingAgents Model approaches, combining the statistical analysis and reasoning skills of multiple agents. Our proposed framework shows promising results by effectively utilizing LLMs expert knowledge, reasoning capabilities, multi-agent cooperation, and statistical causal methods. By exploring the multi-agent potential of LLMs, we aim to establish a foundation for further research in utilizing LLMs multi-agent for solving causal-related problems.</description>

      <title>ByteCheckpoint: A Unified Checkpointing System for Large Foundation Model Development</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20143v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Checkpointing to preserve training states is crucial during the development of Large Foundation Models (LFMs), for training resumption upon various failures or changes in GPU resources and parallelism configurations. In addition, saved checkpoints are dispatched to evaluation tasks or transferred across different training stages (e.g., from pre-training to post-training). All these scenarios require resharding distributed checkpoints from one parallelism to another. In production, different LFMs are trained with various frameworks and storage backends, depending on model sizes and training scales. A high-performance checkpointing system is needed to enable efficient checkpoint management at scale. This paper presents ByteCheckpoint, an industrial-grade checkpointing system for large-scale LFM training. ByteCheckpoint employs a parallelism-agnostic checkpoint representation that enables efficient load-time checkpoint resharding. ByteCheckpoint advocates a generic checkpoint saving/loading workflow to accommodate multiple training frameworks and support different storage backends. To ensure high I/O efficiency, we take a full-stack approach to optimize saving/loading plan generation, critical stages of checkpointing pipelines, and irregular tensor processing required by resharding. To guarantee the scalability of ByteCheckpoint in large-scale training, we enhance the storage system to efficiently handle high volumes of checkpointing I/O requests, devise communication optimizations within the checkpointing workflow, and introduce a suite of monitoring tools to analyze performance and detect bottlenecks. Compared to existing open-source checkpointing systems [40, 46], ByteCheckpoint significantly reduces runtime checkpoint stalls, achieving an average reduction of 54.20x. For saving and loading times, ByteCheckpoint achieves improvements of up to 9.96x and 8.80x, respectively.</description>

      <title>In-Context Ensemble Improves Video-Language Models for Low-Level Workflow Understanding from Human Demonstrations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15867v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) defines a low-level, step-by-step written guide for a business software workflow based on a video demonstration. SOPs are a crucial step toward automating end-to-end software workflows. Manually creating SOPs can be time-consuming. Recent advancements in large video-language models offer the potential for automating SOP generation by analyzing recordings of human demonstrations. However, current large video-language models face challenges with zero-shot SOP generation. We explore in-context learning with video-language models for SOP generation. We report that in-context learning sometimes helps video-language models at SOP generation. We then propose an in-context ensemble learning to further enhance the capabilities of the models in SOP generation.</description>

      <title>From News to Forecast: Integrating Event Analysis in LLM-Based Time Series Forecasting with Reflection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17515v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and Generative Agents to enhance time series forecasting by reasoning across both text and time series data. With language as a medium, our method adaptively integrates social events into forecasting models, aligning news content with time series fluctuations to provide richer insights. Specifically, we utilize LLM-based agents to iteratively filter out irrelevant news and employ human-like reasoning to evaluate predictions. This enables the model to analyze complex events, such as unexpected incidents and shifts in social behavior, and continuously refine the selection logic of news and the robustness of the agent's output. By integrating selected news events with time series data, we fine-tune a pre-trained LLM to predict sequences of digits in time series. The results demonstrate significant improvements in forecasting accuracy, suggesting a potential paradigm shift in time series forecasting through the effective utilization of unstructured news data.</description>

      <title>ST-WebAgentBench: A Benchmark for Evaluating Safety and Trustworthiness in Web Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06703v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in LLM-based web agents have introduced novel architectures and benchmarks showcasing progress in autonomous web navigation and interaction. However, most existing benchmarks prioritize effectiveness and accuracy, overlooking crucial factors like safety and trustworthiness which are essential for deploying web agents in enterprise settings. The risks of unsafe web agent behavior, such as accidentally deleting user accounts or performing unintended actions in critical business operations, pose significant barriers to widespread adoption. In this paper, we present ST-WebAgentBench, a new online benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the safety and trustworthiness of web agents in enterprise contexts. This benchmark is grounded in a detailed framework that defines safe and trustworthy (ST) agent behavior, outlines how ST policies should be structured and introduces the Completion under Policies metric to assess agent performance. Our evaluation reveals that current SOTA agents struggle with policy adherence and cannot yet be relied upon for critical business applications. Additionally, we propose architectural principles aimed at improving policy awareness and compliance in web agents. We open-source this benchmark and invite the community to contribute, with the goal of fostering a new generation of safer, more trustworthy AI agents. All code, data, environment reproduction resources, and video demonstrations are available at https://sites.google.com/view/st-webagentbench/home.</description>

      <title>Identifying and Addressing Delusions for Target-Directed Decision-Making</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07096v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We are interested in target-directed agents, which produce targets during decision-time planning, to guide their behaviors and achieve better generalization during evaluation. Improper training of these agents can result in delusions: the agent may come to hold false beliefs about the targets, which cannot be properly rejected, leading to unwanted behaviors and damaging out-of-distribution generalization. We identify different types of delusions by using intuitive examples in carefully controlled environments, and investigate their causes. We demonstrate how delusions can be addressed for agents trained by hindsight relabeling, a mainstream approach in for training target-directed RL agents. We validate empirically the effectiveness of the proposed solutions in correcting delusional behaviors and improving out-of-distribution generalization.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we generalize the reaction-diffusion equation in statistical physics, Schr\"odinger equation in quantum mechanics, Helmholtz equation in paraxial optics into the neural partial differential equations (NPDE), which can be considered as the fundamental equations in the field of artificial intelligence research. We take finite difference method to discretize NPDE for finding numerical solution, and the basic building blocks of deep neural network architecture, including multi-layer perceptron, convolutional neural network and recurrent neural networks, are generated. The learning strategies, such as Adaptive moment estimation, L-BFGS, pseudoinverse learning algorithms and partial differential equation constrained optimization, are also presented. We believe it is of significance that presented clear physical image of interpretable deep neural networks, which makes it be possible for applying to analog computing device design, and pave the road to physical artificial intelligence.</description>

      <title>DualStreamFoveaNet: A Dual Stream Fusion Architecture with Anatomical Awareness for Robust Fovea Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.06961v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate fovea localization is essential for analyzing retinal diseases to prevent irreversible vision loss. While current deep learning-based methods outperform traditional ones, they still face challenges such as the lack of local anatomical landmarks around the fovea, the inability to robustly handle diseased retinal images, and the variations in image conditions. In this paper, we propose a novel transformer-based architecture called DualStreamFoveaNet (DSFN) for multi-cue fusion. This architecture explicitly incorporates long-range connections and global features using retina and vessel distributions for robust fovea localization. We introduce a spatial attention mechanism in the dual-stream encoder to extract and fuse self-learned anatomical information, focusing more on features distributed along blood vessels and significantly reducing computational costs by decreasing token numbers. Our extensive experiments show that the proposed architecture achieves state-of-the-art performance on two public datasets and one large-scale private dataset. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the DSFN is more robust on both normal and diseased retina images and has better generalization capacity in cross-dataset experiments.</description>

      <title>HiNet: Novel Multi-Scenario &amp; Multi-Task Learning with Hierarchical Information Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.06095v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-scenario &amp; multi-task learning has been widely applied to many recommendation systems in industrial applications, wherein an effective and practical approach is to carry out multi-scenario transfer learning on the basis of the Mixture-of-Expert (MoE) architecture. However, the MoE-based method, which aims to project all information in the same feature space, cannot effectively deal with the complex relationships inherent among various scenarios and tasks, resulting in unsatisfactory performance. To tackle the problem, we propose a Hierarchical information extraction Network (HiNet) for multi-scenario and multi-task recommendation, which achieves hierarchical extraction based on coarse-to-fine knowledge transfer scheme. The multiple extraction layers of the hierarchical network enable the model to enhance the capability of transferring valuable information across scenarios while preserving specific features of scenarios and tasks. Furthermore, a novel scenario-aware attentive network module is proposed to model correlations between scenarios explicitly. Comprehensive experiments conducted on real-world industrial datasets from Meituan Meishi platform demonstrate that HiNet achieves a new state-of-the-art performance and significantly outperforms existing solutions. HiNet is currently fully deployed in two scenarios and has achieved 2.87% and 1.75% order quantity gain respectively.</description>

      <title>Markov Decision Processes under External Temporal Processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.16056v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Most reinforcement learning algorithms treat the context under which they operate as a stationary, isolated, and undisturbed environment. However, in real world applications, environments constantly change due to a variety of external events. To address this problem, we study Markov Decision Processes (MDP) under the influence of an external temporal process. First, we formalize this notion and derive conditions under which the problem becomes tractable with suitable solutions. We propose a policy iteration algorithm to solve this problem and theoretically analyze its performance. Our analysis addresses the non-stationarity present in the MDP as a result of non-Markovian events, necessitating the formulation of policies that are contingent upon both the current state and a history of prior events. Additionally, we derive insights regarding the sample complexity of the algorithm and incorporate factors that define the exogenous temporal process into the established bounds. Finally, we perform experiments to demonstrate our findings within a traditional control environment.</description>

      <title>Networked Communication for Decentralised Agents in Mean-Field Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.02766v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce networked communication to the mean-field game framework, in particular to oracle-free settings where $N$ decentralised agents learn along a single, non-episodic run of the empirical system. We prove that our architecture has sample guarantees bounded between those of the centralised- and independent-learning cases. We provide the order of the difference in these bounds in terms of network structure and number of communication rounds, and also contribute a policy-update stability guarantee. We discuss how the sample guarantees of the three theoretical algorithms do not actually result in practical convergence. We therefore show that in practical settings where the theoretical parameters are not observed (leading to poor estimation of the Q-function), our communication scheme significantly accelerates convergence over the independent case (and sometimes even the centralised case), without relying on the assumption of a centralised learner. We contribute further practical enhancements to all three theoretical algorithms, allowing us to present their first empirical demonstrations. Our experiments confirm that we can remove several of the theoretical assumptions of the algorithms, and display the empirical convergence benefits brought by our new networked communication. We additionally show that the networked approach has significant advantages, over both the centralised and independent alternatives, in terms of robustness to unexpected learning failures and to changes in population size.</description>

      <title>Asynchronous Graph Generator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.17335v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the asynchronous graph generator (AGG), a novel graph attention network for imputation and prediction of multi-channel time series. Free from recurrent components or assumptions about temporal/spatial regularity, AGG encodes measurements, timestamps and channel-specific features directly in the nodes via learnable embeddings. Through an attention mechanism, these embeddings allow for discovering expressive relationships among the variables of interest in the form of a homogeneous graph. Once trained, AGG performs imputation by \emph{conditional attention generation}, i.e., by creating a new node conditioned on given timestamps and channel specification. The proposed AGG is compared to related methods in the literature and its performance is analysed from a data augmentation perspective. Our experiments reveal that AGG achieved state-of-the-art results in time series imputation, classification and prediction for the benchmark datasets \emph{Beijing Air Quality}, \emph{PhysioNet ICU 2012} and \emph{UCI localisation}, outperforming other recent attention-based networks.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Generative Artificial Intelligence on Market Equilibrium: Evidence from a Natural Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07071v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (AI) exhibits the capability to generate creative content akin to human output with greater efficiency and reduced costs. This groundbreaking capability, however, has ignited a debate regarding its potential to displace human creators. In light of these discussions, this paper empirically investigates the impact of generative AI on market equilibrium, in the context of China's leading art outsourcing platform. We overcome the challenge of causal inference by identifying an unanticipated and sudden leak of an advanced image-generative AI as a natural experiment. This leak precipitated a notable reduction in the production costs of anime-style images compared to other genres, thereby providing a unique opportunity for difference-in-differences comparisons. Our analysis shows that the advent of generative AI led to a 64% reduction in average prices, yet it simultaneously spurred a 121% increase in order volume and a 56% increase in overall revenue. This growth is primarily driven by the rising demand for "low-end" personal orders, rather than commercial orders. Moreover, incumbent creators retain the majority of the market share and reap the most benefits of generative AI. Our research highlights the potential of generative AI to benefit all stakeholders across the platform economy, yielding both scholarly contributions and practical implications.</description>

Abstract: Model fusion research aims to aggregate the knowledge of multiple individual models to enhance performance by combining their weights. In this work, we study the inverse problem: investigating whether model fusion can be used to reduce unwanted knowledge. We investigate the effects of model fusion in three scenarios: the learning of shortcuts, social biases, and memorization of training data in fine-tuned language models. Through experiments covering classification and generation tasks, our analysis highlights that shared knowledge among models is enhanced during model fusion, while unshared knowledge is usually forgotten. Based on this observation, we demonstrate the potential of model fusion as a debiasing tool and showcase its efficacy in addressing privacy concerns associated with language models.</description>

      <title>VREM-FL: Mobility-Aware Computation-Scheduling Co-Design for Vehicular Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18741v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Assisted and autonomous driving are rapidly gaining momentum and will soon become a reality. Artificial intelligence and machine learning are regarded as key enablers thanks to the massive amount of data that smart vehicles will collect from onboard sensors. Federated learning is one of the most promising techniques for training global machine learning models while preserving data privacy of vehicles and optimizing communications resource usage. In this article, we propose vehicular radio environment map federated learning (VREM-FL), a computation-scheduling co-design for vehicular federated learning that combines mobility of vehicles with 5G radio environment maps. VREM-FL jointly optimizes learning performance of the global model and wisely allocates communication and computation resources. This is achieved by orchestrating local computations at the vehicles in conjunction with transmission of their local models in an adaptive and predictive fashion, by exploiting radio channel maps. The proposed algorithm can be tuned to trade training time for radio resource usage. Experimental results demonstrate that VREM-FL outperforms literature benchmarks for both a linear regression model (learning time reduced by 28%) and a deep neural network for semantic image segmentation (doubling the number of model updates within the same time window).</description>

      <title>TAP4LLM: Table Provider on Sampling, Augmenting, and Packing Semi-structured Data for Large Language Model Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09039v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Table reasoning tasks have shown remarkable progress with the development of large language models (LLMs), which involve interpreting and drawing conclusions from tabular data based on natural language (NL) questions. Existing solutions mainly tested on smaller tables face scalability issues and struggle with complex queries due to incomplete or dispersed data across different table sections. To alleviate these challenges, we propose TAP4LLM as a versatile pre-processor suite for leveraging LLMs in table-based tasks effectively. It covers several distinct components: (1) table sampling to decompose large tables into manageable sub-tables based on query semantics, (2) table augmentation to enhance tables with additional knowledge from external sources or models, and (3) table packing &amp; serialization to convert tables into various formats suitable for LLMs' understanding. In each module, we design and compare several common methods under various usage scenarios, aiming to shed light on the best practices for leveraging LLMs for table-reasoning tasks. Our experiments show that our method improves LLMs' reasoning capabilities in various tabular tasks and enhances the interaction between LLMs and tabular data by employing effective pre-processing.</description>

      <title>Spike No More: Stabilizing the Pre-training of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16903v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Loss spikes often occur during pre-training of large language models. The spikes degrade the performance of large language models and sometimes ruin the pre-training. Since the pre-training needs a vast computational budget, we should avoid such spikes. Based on the assumption that the loss spike is caused by the sudden growth of the gradient norm, we explore factors to keep the gradient norm small through an analysis of the spectral norms of the Jacobian matrices for the sub-layers. Our findings suggest that stabilizing the pre-training process requires two conditions: small sub-layers and large shortcut. We conduct various experiments to empirically verify our theoretical analyses. Experimental results demonstrate that methods satisfying the conditions effectively prevent loss spikes during pre-training.</description>

      <title>CoSS: Co-optimizing Sensor and Sampling Rate for Data-Efficient AI in Human Activity Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05426v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Artificial Neural Networks have significantly improved human activity recognition using multiple time-series sensors. While employing numerous sensors with high-frequency sampling rates usually improves the results, it often leads to data inefficiency and unnecessary expansion of the ANN, posing a challenge for their practical deployment on edge devices. Addressing these issues, our work introduces a pragmatic framework for data-efficient utilization in HAR tasks, considering the optimization of both sensor modalities and sampling rate simultaneously. Central to our approach are the designed trainable parameters, termed 'Weight Scores,' which assess the significance of each sensor modality and sampling rate during the training phase. These scores guide the sensor modalities and sampling rate selection. The pruning method allows users to make a trade-off between computational budgets and performance by selecting the sensor modalities and sampling rates according to the weight score ranking. We tested our framework's effectiveness in optimizing sensor modality and sampling rate selection using three public HAR benchmark datasets. The results show that the sensor and sampling rate combination selected via CoSS achieves similar classification performance to configurations using the highest sampling rate with all sensors but at a reduced hardware cost.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Optimization with k-Cluster Big Bang-Big Crunch Algorithm and Postprocessing Methods for Identification and Quantification of Optima</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06153v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal optimization is often encountered in engineering problems, especially when different and alternative solutions are sought. Evolutionary algorithms can efficiently tackle multimodal optimization thanks to their features such as the concept of population, exploration/exploitation, and being suitable for parallel computation. This paper investigates whether a less-known optimizer, the Big Bang-Big Crunch (BBBC) algorithm, is suitable for multimodal optimization. We extended BBBC and propose k-BBBC, a clustering-based multi-modal optimizer. Additionally, we introduce two post-processing methods to (i) identify the local optima in a set of retrieved solutions (i.e., a population), and (ii) quantify the number of correctly retrieved optima against the expected ones (i.e., success rate). Our results show that k-BBBC performs well even with problems having a large number of optima (tested on $379$ optima) and high dimensionality (tested on $32$ decision variables), but it becomes computationally too expensive for problems with many local optima (i.e., in the CEC'2013 benchmark set). Compared to other multimodal optimization methods, it outperforms them in terms of accuracy (in both search and objective space) and success rate (number of correctly retrieved optima) when tested on basic multimodal functions, especially when elitism is applied; however, it requires knowing the number of optima of a problem, which makes its performance decrease when tested on niching competition test CEC'2013. Lastly, we validated our proposed post-processing methods by comparing their success rate to the actual one: results suggest that these methods can be used to evaluate the performance of a multimodal optimization algorithm by correctly identifying optima and providing an indication of success -- without the need to know where the optima are located in the search space.</description>

      <title>Language Models as Hierarchy Encoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11374v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interpreting hierarchical structures latent in language is a key limitation of current language models (LMs). While previous research has implicitly leveraged these hierarchies to enhance LMs, approaches for their explicit encoding are yet to be explored. To address this, we introduce a novel approach to re-train transformer encoder-based LMs as Hierarchy Transformer encoders (HiTs), harnessing the expansive nature of hyperbolic space. Our method situates the output embedding space of pre-trained LMs within a Poincar\'e ball with a curvature that adapts to the embedding dimension, followed by training on hyperbolic clustering and centripetal losses. These losses are designed to effectively cluster related entities (input as texts) and organise them hierarchically. We evaluate HiTs against pre-trained LMs, standard fine-tuned LMs, and several hyperbolic embedding baselines, focusing on their capabilities in simulating transitive inference, predicting subsumptions, and transferring knowledge across hierarchies. The results demonstrate that HiTs consistently outperform all baselines in these tasks, underscoring the effectiveness and transferability of our re-trained hierarchy encoders.</description>

      <title>LLaMP: Large Language Model Made Powerful for High-fidelity Materials Knowledge Retrieval and Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17244v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reducing hallucination of Large Language Models (LLMs) is imperative for use in the sciences, where reliability and reproducibility are crucial. However, LLMs inherently lack long-term memory, making it a nontrivial, ad hoc, and inevitably biased task to fine-tune them on domain-specific literature and data. Here we introduce LLaMP, a multimodal retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework of hierarchical reasoning-and-acting (ReAct) agents that can dynamically and recursively interact with computational and experimental data on Materials Project (MP) and run atomistic simulations via high-throughput workflow interface. Without fine-tuning, LLaMP demonstrates strong tool usage ability to comprehend and integrate various modalities of materials science concepts, fetch relevant data stores on the fly, process higher-order data (such as crystal structure and elastic tensor), and streamline complex tasks in computational materials and chemistry. We propose a simple metric combining uncertainty and confidence estimates to evaluate the self-consistency of responses by LLaMP and vanilla LLMs. Our benchmark shows that LLaMP effectively mitigates the intrinsic bias in LLMs, counteracting the errors on bulk moduli, electronic bandgaps, and formation energies that seem to derive from mixed data sources. We also demonstrate LLaMP's capability to edit crystal structures and run annealing molecular dynamics simulations using pre-trained machine-learning force fields. The framework offers an intuitive and nearly hallucination-free approach to exploring and scaling materials informatics, and establishes a pathway for knowledge distillation and fine-tuning other language models.

      <title>Paramanu: A Family of Novel Efficient Generative Foundation Language Models for Indian Languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.18034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.18034v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present "Paramanu", a family of novel language models (LM) for Indian languages, consisting of auto-regressive monolingual, bilingual, and multilingual models pretrained from scratch. Currently, it covers 10 languages (Assamese, Bangla, Hindi, Konkani, Maithili, Marathi, Odia, Sanskrit, Tamil, Telugu) across 5 scripts (Bangla, Devanagari, Odia, Tamil, Telugu). The models are pretrained on a single GPU with context size of 1024 and vary in size from 13.29 million (M) to 367.5 M parameters. We proposed a RoPE embedding scaling method that enables us to pretrain language models from scratch at larger sequence length context size than typical GPU memory permits. We also introduced a novel efficient Indic tokenizer, "mBharat", using a combination of BPE and Unigram, achieving the least fertility score and the ability to tokenize unseen languages in both the same script &amp; Roman script. We also proposed and performed language-specific tokenization for multilingual models &amp; domain-specific tokenization for monolingual models. To address the "curse of multilinguality" in our mParamanu model, we pretrained on comparable corpora based on typological grouping within the same script. Our findings show a language transfer phenomenon from low-resource to high-resource languages within languages of the same script &amp; typology. Human evaluations for open-ended text generation demonstrated that Paramanu models outperformed several LLMs, despite being 20 to 64 times smaller. We created instruction-tuning datasets &amp; instruction-tuned our models on 23,000 instructions in respective languages. Comparisons with multilingual LLMs across various benchmarks for natural language (NL) understanding, NL inference, &amp; reading comprehension highlight the advantages of our models; leads to the conclusion that high quality generative LM are possible without high amount of compute power &amp; enormous number of parameters.</description>

      <title>MOMENT: A Family of Open Time-series Foundation Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03885v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce MOMENT, a family of open-source foundation models for general-purpose time series analysis. Pre-training large models on time series data is challenging due to (1) the absence of a large and cohesive public time series repository, and (2) diverse time series characteristics which make multi-dataset training onerous. Additionally, (3) experimental benchmarks to evaluate these models, especially in scenarios with limited resources, time, and supervision, are still in their nascent stages. To address these challenges, we compile a large and diverse collection of public time series, called the Time series Pile, and systematically tackle time series-specific challenges to unlock large-scale multi-dataset pre-training. Finally, we build on recent work to design a benchmark to evaluate time series foundation models on diverse tasks and datasets in limited supervision settings. Experiments on this benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of our pre-trained models with minimal data and task-specific fine-tuning. Finally, we present several interesting empirical observations about large pre-trained time series models. Pre-trained models (AutonLab/MOMENT-1-large) and Time Series Pile (AutonLab/Timeseries-PILE) are available on Huggingface.</description>

      <title>SAGMAN: Stability Analysis of Graph Neural Networks on the Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08653v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern graph neural networks (GNNs) can be sensitive to changes in the input graph structure and node features, potentially resulting in unpredictable behavior and degraded performance. In this work, we introduce a spectral framework known as SAGMAN for examining the stability of GNNs. This framework assesses the distance distortions that arise from the nonlinear mappings of GNNs between the input and output manifolds: when two nearby nodes on the input manifold are mapped (through a GNN model) to two distant ones on the output manifold, it implies a large distance distortion and thus a poor GNN stability. We propose a distance-preserving graph dimension reduction (GDR) approach that utilizes spectral graph embedding and probabilistic graphical models (PGMs) to create low-dimensional input/output graph-based manifolds for meaningful stability analysis. Our empirical evaluations show that SAGMAN effectively assesses the stability of each node when subjected to various edge or feature perturbations, offering a scalable approach for evaluating the stability of GNNs, extending to applications within recommendation systems. Furthermore, we illustrate its utility in downstream tasks, notably in enhancing GNN stability and facilitating adversarial targeted attacks.</description>

Abstract: Question answering (QA) can only make progress if we know if an answer is correct, but current answer correctness (AC) metrics struggle with verbose, free-form answers from large language models (LLMs). There are two challenges with current short-form QA evaluations: a lack of diverse styles of evaluation data and an over-reliance on expensive and slow LLMs. LLM-based scorers correlate better with humans, but this expensive task has only been tested on limited QA datasets. We rectify these issues by providing rubrics and datasets for evaluating machine QA adopted from the Trivia community. We also propose an efficient, and interpretable QA evaluation that is more stable than an exact match and neural methods(BERTScore).</description>

      <title>Universal Physics Transformers: A Framework For Efficiently Scaling Neural Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12365v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural operators, serving as physics surrogate models, have recently gained increased interest. With ever increasing problem complexity, the natural question arises: what is an efficient way to scale neural operators to larger and more complex simulations - most importantly by taking into account different types of simulation datasets. This is of special interest since, akin to their numerical counterparts, different techniques are used across applications, even if the underlying dynamics of the systems are similar. Whereas the flexibility of transformers has enabled unified architectures across domains, neural operators mostly follow a problem specific design, where GNNs are commonly used for Lagrangian simulations and grid-based models predominate Eulerian simulations. We introduce Universal Physics Transformers (UPTs), an efficient and unified learning paradigm for a wide range of spatio-temporal problems. UPTs operate without grid- or particle-based latent structures, enabling flexibility and scalability across meshes and particles. UPTs efficiently propagate dynamics in the latent space, emphasized by inverse encoding and decoding techniques. Finally, UPTs allow for queries of the latent space representation at any point in space-time. We demonstrate diverse applicability and efficacy of UPTs in mesh-based fluid simulations, and steady-state Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes simulations, and Lagrangian-based dynamics.</description>

      <title>Unlocking the Power of Large Language Models for Entity Alignment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15048v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Entity Alignment (EA) is vital for integrating diverse knowledge graph (KG) data, playing a crucial role in data-driven AI applications. Traditional EA methods primarily rely on comparing entity embeddings, but their effectiveness is constrained by the limited input KG data and the capabilities of the representation learning techniques. Against this backdrop, we introduce ChatEA, an innovative framework that incorporates large language models (LLMs) to improve EA. To address the constraints of limited input KG data, ChatEA introduces a KG-code translation module that translates KG structures into a format understandable by LLMs, thereby allowing LLMs to utilize their extensive background knowledge to improve EA accuracy. To overcome the over-reliance on entity embedding comparisons, ChatEA implements a two-stage EA strategy that capitalizes on LLMs' capability for multi-step reasoning in a dialogue format, thereby enhancing accuracy while preserving efficiency. Our experimental results verify ChatEA's superior performance, highlighting LLMs' potential in facilitating EA tasks.</description>

Abstract: This paper addresses task planning problems for language-instructed robot teams. Tasks are expressed in natural language (NL), requiring the robots to apply their capabilities at various locations and semantic objects. Several recent works have addressed similar planning problems by leveraging pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) to design effective multi-robot plans. However, these approaches lack mission completion guarantees. To address this challenge, we introduce a new distributed LLM-based planner, called S-ATLAS for Safe plAnning for Teams of Language-instructed AgentS, that is capable of achieving user-defined mission success rates. This is accomplished by leveraging conformal prediction (CP), a distribution-free uncertainty quantification tool in black-box models. CP allows the proposed multi-robot planner to reason about its inherent uncertainty in a distributed fashion, enabling robots to make individual decisions when they are sufficiently certain and seek help otherwise. We show, both theoretically and empirically, that the proposed planner can achieve user-specified task success rates while minimizing the overall number of help requests. We provide comparative experiments against related works showing that our method is significantly more computational efficient and achieves lower help rates. The advantage of our algorithm over baselines becomes more pronounced with increasing robot team size.</description>

      <title>How Likely Do LLMs with CoT Mimic Human Reasoning?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16048v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) emerges as a promising technique to elicit reasoning capabilities from Large Language Models (LLMs). However, it does not always improve task performance or accurately represent reasoning processes, leaving unresolved questions around its usage. In this paper, we diagnose the underlying mechanism by comparing the reasoning process of LLMs with humans, using causal analysis to understand the relationships between the problem instruction, reasoning, and answer in both LLMs and humans. Our empirical study reveals that LLMs often deviate from a causal chain, resulting in spurious correlations and potential consistency errors (inconsistent reasoning and answer). We also examine various factors influencing the causal structure, finding that in-context learning with examples strengthens it while post-training techniques like supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning on human feedback weaken it. To our surprise, the causal structure cannot be strengthened by enlarging the model size, urging research on new techniques. We hope this preliminary study will shed light on the understanding and further improvement of the reasoning process in LLMs.</description>

      <title>AKEW: Assessing Knowledge Editing in the Wild</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18909v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Knowledge editing injects knowledge updates into language models to keep them correct and up-to-date. However, its current evaluations deviate significantly from practice: their knowledge updates solely consist of structured facts derived from meticulously crafted datasets, instead of practical sources -- unstructured texts like news articles, and they often overlook practical real-world knowledge updates. To address these issues, in this paper we propose AKEW (Assessing Knowledge Editing in the Wild), a new practical benchmark for knowledge editing. AKEW fully covers three editing settings of knowledge updates: structured facts, unstructured texts as facts, and extracted triplets. It further introduces new datasets featuring both counterfactual and real-world knowledge updates. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the considerable gap between state-of-the-art knowledge-editing methods and practical scenarios. Our analyses further highlight key insights to motivate future research for practical knowledge editing.</description>

      <title>TV-TREES: Multimodal Entailment Trees for Neuro-Symbolic Video Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19467v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is challenging for models to understand complex, multimodal content such as television clips, and this is in part because video-language models often rely on single-modality reasoning and lack interpretability. To combat these issues we propose TV-TREES, the first multimodal entailment tree generator. TV-TREES serves as an approach to video understanding that promotes interpretable joint-modality reasoning by searching for trees of entailment relationships between simple text-video evidence and higher-level conclusions that prove question-answer pairs. We also introduce the task of multimodal entailment tree generation to evaluate reasoning quality. Our method's performance on the challenging TVQA benchmark demonstrates interpretable, state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on full clips, illustrating that multimodal entailment tree generation can be a best-of-both-worlds alternative to black-box systems.</description>

      <title>DiaHalu: A Dialogue-level Hallucination Evaluation Benchmark for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00896v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since large language models (LLMs) achieve significant success in recent years, the hallucination issue remains a challenge, numerous benchmarks are proposed to detect the hallucination. Nevertheless, some of these benchmarks are not naturally generated by LLMs but are intentionally induced. Also, many merely focus on the factuality hallucination while ignoring the faithfulness hallucination. Additionally, although dialogue pattern is more widely utilized in the era of LLMs, current benchmarks only concentrate on sentence-level and passage-level hallucination. In this study, we propose DiaHalu, the first dialogue-level hallucination evaluation benchmark to our knowledge. Initially, we integrate the collected topics into system prompts and facilitate a dialogue between two ChatGPT3.5. Subsequently, we manually modify the contents that do not adhere to human language conventions and then have LLMs re-generate, simulating authentic human-machine interaction scenarios. Finally, professional scholars annotate all the samples in the dataset. DiaHalu covers four common multi-turn dialogue domains and five hallucination subtypes, extended from factuality and faithfulness hallucination. Experiments through some well-known LLMs and detection methods on the dataset show that DiaHalu is a challenging benchmark, holding significant value for further research.</description>

      <title>AutoRD: An Automatic and End-to-End System for Rare Disease Knowledge Graph Construction Based on Ontologies-enhanced Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00953v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rare diseases affect millions worldwide but often face limited research focus due to their low prevalence. This results in prolonged diagnoses and a lack of approved therapies. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in automating the extraction of medical information, offering potential to improve medical diagnosis and management. However, most LLMs lack professional medical knowledge, especially concerning rare diseases, and struggle to handle the latest rare disease information. They also cannot effectively manage rare disease data and are not directly suitable for diagnosis and management tasks. Our objective is to create an end-to-end system called AutoRD, which automates the extraction of information from medical texts about rare diseases, focusing on entities and their relations. AutoRD integrates up-to-date structured knowledge and demonstrates superior performance in rare disease extraction tasks. We conduct various experiments to evaluate AutoRD's performance, aiming to surpass common LLMs and traditional methods.</description>

      <title>BirdSet: A Large-Scale Dataset for Audio Classification in Avian Bioacoustics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10380v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep learning (DL) has greatly advanced audio classification, yet the field is limited by the scarcity of large-scale benchmark datasets that have propelled progress in other domains. While AudioSet aims to bridge this gap as a universal-domain dataset, its restricted accessibility and lack of diverse real-world evaluation use cases challenge its role as the primary resource. Therefore, we introduce $\texttt{BirdSet}$, a large-scale benchmark dataset for audio classification focusing on avian bioacoustics. $\texttt{BirdSet}$ surpasses AudioSet with over 6,800 recording hours ($\uparrow\!17\%$) from nearly 10,000 classes ($\uparrow\!18\times$) for training and more than 400 hours ($\uparrow\!7\times$) across eight strongly labeled evaluation datasets. It serves as a versatile resource for use cases such as multi-label classification, covariate shift or self-supervised learning. We benchmark six well-known DL models in multi-label classification across three distinct training scenarios and outline further evaluation use cases in audio classification. We host our dataset on Hugging Face for easy accessibility and offer an extensive codebase to reproduce our results.</description>

      <title>Reference-based Metrics Disprove Themselves in Question Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12242v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reference-based metrics such as BLEU and BERTScore are widely used to evaluate question generation (QG). In this study, on QG benchmarks such as SQuAD and HotpotQA, we find that using human-written references cannot guarantee the effectiveness of the reference-based metrics. Most QG benchmarks have only one reference; we replicate the annotation process and collect another reference. A good metric is expected to grade a human-validated question no worse than generated questions. However, the results of reference-based metrics on our newly collected reference disproved the metrics themselves. We propose a reference-free metric consisted of multi-dimensional criteria such as naturalness, answerability, and complexity, utilizing large language models. These criteria are not constrained to the syntactic or semantic of a single reference question, and the metric does not require a diverse set of references. Experiments reveal that our metric accurately distinguishes between high-quality questions and flawed ones, and achieves state-of-the-art alignment with human judgment.</description>

      <title>Generalized Consistency Trajectory Models for Image Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12510v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) excel in unconditional generation, as well as on applications such as image editing and restoration. The success of DMs lies in the iterative nature of diffusion: diffusion breaks down the complex process of mapping noise to data into a sequence of simple denoising tasks. Moreover, we are able to exert fine-grained control over the generation process by injecting guidance terms into each denoising step. However, the iterative process is also computationally intensive, often taking from tens up to thousands of function evaluations. Although consistency trajectory models (CTMs) enable traversal between any time points along the probability flow ODE (PFODE) and score inference with a single function evaluation, CTMs only allow translation from Gaussian noise to data. This work aims to unlock the full potential of CTMs by proposing generalized CTMs (GCTMs), which translate between arbitrary distributions via ODEs. We discuss the design space of GCTMs and demonstrate their efficacy in various image manipulation tasks such as image-to-image translation, restoration, and editing.</description>

      <title>Instruction Multi-Constraint Molecular Generation Using a Teacher-Student Large Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13244v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While various models and computational tools have been proposed for structure and property analysis of molecules, generating molecules that conform to all desired structures and properties remains a challenge. Here, we introduce a multi-constraint molecular generation large language model, TSMMG, which, akin to a student, incorporates knowledge from various small models and tools, namely, the 'teachers'. To train TSMMG, we construct a large set of text-molecule pairs by extracting molecular knowledge from these 'teachers', enabling it to generate novel molecules that conform to the descriptions through various text prompts. We experimentally show that TSMMG remarkably performs in generating molecules meeting complex, natural language-described property requirements across two-, three-, and four-constraint tasks, with an average molecular validity of over 99% and success ratio of 82.58%, 68.03%, and 67.48%, respectively. The model also exhibits adaptability through zero-shot testing, creating molecules that satisfy combinations of properties that have not been encountered. It can comprehend text inputs with various language styles, extending beyond the confines of outlined prompts, as confirmed through empirical validation. Additionally, the knowledge distillation feature of TSMMG contributes to the continuous enhancement of small models, while the innovative approach to dataset construction effectively addresses the issues of data scarcity and quality, which positions TSMMG as a promising tool in the domains of drug discovery and materials science.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models for Orchestrating Bimanual Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02018v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although there has been rapid progress in endowing robots with the ability to solve complex manipulation tasks, generating control policies for bimanual robots to solve tasks involving two hands is still challenging because of the difficulties in effective temporal and spatial coordination. With emergent abilities in terms of step-by-step reasoning and in-context learning, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated promising potential in a variety of robotic tasks. However, the nature of language communication via a single sequence of discrete symbols makes LLM-based coordination in continuous space a particular challenge for bimanual tasks. To tackle this challenge, we present LAnguage-model-based Bimanual ORchestration (LABOR), an agent utilizing an LLM to analyze task configurations and devise coordination control policies for addressing long-horizon bimanual tasks. We evaluate our method through simulated experiments involving two classes of long-horizon tasks using the NICOL humanoid robot. Our results demonstrate that our method outperforms the baseline in terms of success rate. Additionally, we thoroughly analyze failure cases, offering insights into LLM-based approaches in bimanual robotic control and revealing future research trends.

      <title>Protecting Your LLMs with Information Bottleneck</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13968v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The advent of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized the field of natural language processing, yet they might be attacked to produce harmful content. Despite efforts to ethically align LLMs, these are often fragile and can be circumvented by jailbreaking attacks through optimized or manual adversarial prompts. To address this, we introduce the Information Bottleneck Protector (IBProtector), a defense mechanism grounded in the information bottleneck principle, and we modify the objective to avoid trivial solutions. The IBProtector selectively compresses and perturbs prompts, facilitated by a lightweight and trainable extractor, preserving only essential information for the target LLMs to respond with the expected answer. Moreover, we further consider a situation where the gradient is not visible to be compatible with any LLM. Our empirical evaluations show that IBProtector outperforms current defense methods in mitigating jailbreak attempts, without overly affecting response quality or inference speed. Its effectiveness and adaptability across various attack methods and target LLMs underscore the potential of IBProtector as a novel, transferable defense that bolsters the security of LLMs without requiring modifications to the underlying models.</description>

      <title>Cross-Embodied Affordance Transfer through Learning Affordance Equivalences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15648v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Affordances represent the inherent effect and action possibilities that objects offer to the agents within a given context. From a theoretical viewpoint, affordances bridge the gap between effect and action, providing a functional understanding of the connections between the actions of an agent and its environment in terms of the effects it can cause. In this study, we propose a deep neural network model that unifies objects, actions, and effects into a single latent vector in a common latent space that we call the affordance space. Using the affordance space, our system can generate effect trajectories when action and object are given and can generate action trajectories when effect trajectories and objects are given. Our model does not learn the behavior of individual objects acted upon by a single agent. Still, rather, it forms a `shared affordance representation' spanning multiple agents and objects, which we call Affordance Equivalence. Affordance Equivalence facilitates not only action generalization over objects but also Cross Embodiment transfer linking actions of different robots. In addition to the simulation experiments that demonstrate the proposed model's range of capabilities, we also showcase that our model can be used for direct imitation in real-world settings.</description>

      <title>Neural Operators Learn the Local Physics of Magnetohydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16015v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) plays a pivotal role in describing the dynamics of plasma and conductive fluids, essential for understanding phenomena such as the structure and evolution of stars and galaxies, and in nuclear fusion for plasma motion through ideal MHD equations. Solving these hyperbolic PDEs requires sophisticated numerical methods, presenting computational challenges due to complex structures and high costs. Recent advances introduce neural operators like the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) as surrogate models for traditional numerical analyses. This study explores a modified Flux Fourier neural operator model to approximate the numerical flux of ideal MHD, offering a novel approach that outperforms existing neural operator models by enabling continuous inference, generalization outside sampled distributions, and faster computation compared to classical numerical schemes.</description>

      <title>Mapping the Unseen: Unified Promptable Panoptic Mapping with Dynamic Labeling using Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02162v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the field of robotics and computer vision, efficient and accurate semantic mapping remains a significant challenge due to the growing demand for intelligent machines that can comprehend and interact with complex environments. Conventional panoptic mapping methods, however, are limited by predefined semantic classes, thus making them ineffective for handling novel or unforeseen objects. In response to this limitation, we introduce the Unified Promptable Panoptic Mapping (UPPM) method. UPPM utilizes recent advances in foundation models to enable real-time, on-demand label generation using natural language prompts. By incorporating a dynamic labeling strategy into traditional panoptic mapping techniques, UPPM provides significant improvements in adaptability and versatility while maintaining high performance levels in map reconstruction. We demonstrate our approach on real-world and simulated datasets. Results show that UPPM can accurately reconstruct scenes and segment objects while generating rich semantic labels through natural language interactions. A series of ablation experiments validated the advantages of foundation model-based labeling over fixed label sets.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning-based Accelerated MR Cholangiopancreatography without Fully-sampled Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03732v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this study was to accelerate MR cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) acquisitions using deep learning-based (DL) reconstruction at 3T and 0.55T. A total of 35 healthy volunteers underwent conventional two-fold accelerated MRCP scans at field strengths of 3T and 0.55T. We trained DL reconstructions using two different training strategies, supervised (SV) and self-supervised (SSV), with retrospectively six-fold undersampled data obtained at 3T. We then evaluated the DL reconstructions against standard techniques, parallel imaging (PI) and compressed sensing (CS), focusing on peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity (SSIM) as metrics. We also tested DL reconstructions in a prospectively accelerated scenario to reflect real-world clinical applications and evaluated their adaptability to MRCP at 0.55T. Both DL reconstructions demonstrated a remarkable reduction in average acquisition time from 599/542 to 255/180 seconds for MRCP at 3T/0.55T. In both retrospective and prospective undersampling scenarios, PSNR and SSIM of DL reconstructions were higher than those of PI and CS. At the same time, DL reconstructions preserved the image quality of undersampled data, including sharpness and the visibility of hepatobiliary ducts. In addition, both DL approaches produced high-quality reconstructions at 0.55T. In summary, DL reconstructions trained for highly accelerated MRCP enabled a reduction in acquisition time by a factor of 2.4/3.0 at 3T/0.55T while maintaining the image quality of conventional acquisition.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Compositional Deficiency of Large Language Models in Mathematical Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06680v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Human cognition exhibits systematic compositionality, the algebraic ability to generate infinite novel combinations from finite learned components, which is the key to understanding and reasoning about complex logic. In this work, we investigate the compositionality of large language models (LLMs) in mathematical reasoning. Specifically, we construct a new dataset \textsc{MathTrap} by introducing carefully designed logical traps into the problem descriptions of MATH and GSM8K. Since problems with logical flaws are quite rare in the real world, these represent "unseen" cases to LLMs. Solving these requires the models to systematically compose (1) the mathematical knowledge involved in the original problems with (2) knowledge related to the introduced traps. Our experiments show that while LLMs possess both components of requisite knowledge, they do not \textbf{spontaneously} combine them to handle these novel cases. We explore several methods to mitigate this deficiency, such as natural language prompts, few-shot demonstrations, and fine-tuning. Additionally, we test the recently released OpenAI o1 model and find that human-like `slow thinking' helps improve the compositionality of LLMs. Overall, systematic compositionality remains an open challenge for large language models.</description>

      <title>Localized Adaptive Risk Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07976v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Adaptive Risk Control (ARC) is an online calibration strategy based on set prediction that offers worst-case deterministic long-term risk control, as well as statistical marginal coverage guarantees. ARC adjusts the size of the prediction set by varying a single scalar threshold based on feedback from past decisions. In this work, we introduce Localized Adaptive Risk Control (L-ARC), an online calibration scheme that targets statistical localized risk guarantees ranging from conditional risk to marginal risk, while preserving the worst-case performance of ARC. L-ARC updates a threshold function within a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), with the kernel determining the level of localization of the statistical risk guarantee. The theoretical results highlight a trade-off between localization of the statistical risk and convergence speed to the long-term risk target. Thanks to localization, L-ARC is demonstrated via experiments to produce prediction sets with risk guarantees across different data subpopulations, significantly improving the fairness of the calibrated model for tasks such as image segmentation and beam selection in wireless networks.</description>

      <title>MetaReflection: Learning Instructions for Language Agents using Past Reflections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13009v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The popularity of Large Language Models (LLMs) have unleashed a new age ofLanguage Agents for solving a diverse range of tasks. While contemporary frontier LLMs are capable enough to power reasonably good Language agents, the closed-API model makes it hard to improve in cases they perform sub-optimally. To address this, recent works have explored ways to improve their performance using techniques like self-reflection and prompt optimization. Unfortunately, techniques like self-reflection can be used only in an online setup, while contemporary prompt optimization techniques are designed and tested to work on simple tasks. To this end, we introduce MetaReflection, a novel offline reinforcement learning technique that enhances the performance of Language Agents by augmenting a semantic memory based on experiential learnings from past trials. We demonstrate the efficacy of MetaReflection by evaluating across multiple domains, including complex logical reasoning, biomedical semantic similarity, open world question answering, and vulnerability threat detection, in Infrastructure-as-Code, spanning different agent designs. MetaReflection boosts Language agents' performance by 4% to 16.82% over the raw GPT-4 baseline and performs on par with existing state-of-the-art prompt optimization techniques while requiring fewer LLM calls.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Mixture of Experts: An Auto-Tuning Approach for Efficient Transformer Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14297v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Sparse Mixture of Experts (SMoE) has been widely employed to enhance the efficiency of training and inference for Transformer-based foundational models, yielding promising results. However, the performance of SMoE heavily depends on the choice of hyper-parameters, such as the number of experts and the number of experts to be activated (referred to as top-k), resulting in significant computational overhead due to the extensive model training by searching over various hyper-parameter configurations. As a remedy, we introduce the Dynamic Mixture of Experts (DynMoE) technique. DynMoE incorporates (1) a novel gating method that enables each token to automatically determine the number of experts to activate. (2) An adaptive process automatically adjusts the number of experts during training. Extensive numerical results across Vision, Language, and Vision-Language tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach to achieve competitive performance compared to GMoE for vision and language tasks, and MoE-LLaVA for vision-language tasks, while maintaining efficiency by activating fewer parameters. Our code is available at https://github.com/LINs-lab/DynMoE.</description>

      <title>EvGGS: A Collaborative Learning Framework for Event-based Generalizable Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14959v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Event cameras offer promising advantages such as high dynamic range and low latency, making them well-suited for challenging lighting conditions and fast-moving scenarios. However, reconstructing 3D scenes from raw event streams is difficult because event data is sparse and does not carry absolute color information. To release its potential in 3D reconstruction, we propose the first event-based generalizable 3D reconstruction framework, called EvGGS, which reconstructs scenes as 3D Gaussians from only event input in a feedforward manner and can generalize to unseen cases without any retraining. This framework includes a depth estimation module, an intensity reconstruction module, and a Gaussian regression module. These submodules connect in a cascading manner, and we collaboratively train them with a designed joint loss to make them mutually promote. To facilitate related studies, we build a novel event-based 3D dataset with various material objects and calibrated labels of grayscale images, depth maps, camera poses, and silhouettes. Experiments show models that have jointly trained significantly outperform those trained individually. Our approach performs better than all baselines in reconstruction quality, and depth/intensity predictions with satisfactory rendering speed.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Actor-Critic with Entropy Regulator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15177v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has proven highly effective in addressing complex decision-making and control tasks. However, in most traditional RL algorithms, the policy is typically parameterized as a diagonal Gaussian distribution with learned mean and variance, which constrains their capability to acquire complex policies. In response to this problem, we propose an online RL algorithm termed diffusion actor-critic with entropy regulator (DACER). This algorithm conceptualizes the reverse process of the diffusion model as a novel policy function and leverages the capability of the diffusion model to fit multimodal distributions, thereby enhancing the representational capacity of the policy. Since the distribution of the diffusion policy lacks an analytical expression, its entropy cannot be determined analytically. To mitigate this, we propose a method to estimate the entropy of the diffusion policy utilizing Gaussian mixture model. Building on the estimated entropy, we can learn a parameter $\alpha$ that modulates the degree of exploration and exploitation. Parameter $\alpha$ will be employed to adaptively regulate the variance of the added noise, which is applied to the action output by the diffusion model. Experimental trials on MuJoCo benchmarks and a multimodal task demonstrate that the DACER algorithm achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in most MuJoCo control tasks while exhibiting a stronger representational capacity of the diffusion policy.</description>

      <title>Self-Exploring Language Models: Active Preference Elicitation for Online Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19332v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Preference optimization, particularly through Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), has achieved significant success in aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) to adhere to human intentions. Unlike offline alignment with a fixed dataset, online feedback collection from humans or AI on model generations typically leads to more capable reward models and better-aligned LLMs through an iterative process. However, achieving a globally accurate reward model requires systematic exploration to generate diverse responses that span the vast space of natural language. Random sampling from standard reward-maximizing LLMs alone is insufficient to fulfill this requirement. To address this issue, we propose a bilevel objective optimistically biased towards potentially high-reward responses to actively explore out-of-distribution regions. By solving the inner-level problem with the reparameterized reward function, the resulting algorithm, named \textit{Self-Exploring Language Models} (SELM), eliminates the need for a separate RM and iteratively updates the LLM with a straightforward objective. Compared to \textit{Direct Preference Optimization} (DPO), the SELM objective reduces indiscriminate favor of unseen extrapolations and enhances exploration efficiency. Our experimental results demonstrate that when fine-tuned on Zephyr-7B-SFT and Llama-3-8B-Instruct models, SELM significantly boosts the performance on instruction-following benchmarks such as MT-Bench and AlpacaEval 2.0, as well as various standard academic benchmarks in different settings. Our code and models are available at https://github.com/shenao-zhang/SELM.</description>

      <title>Contrastive Learning Via Equivariant Representation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00262v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Invariant Contrastive Learning (ICL) methods have achieved impressive performance across various domains. However, the absence of latent space representation for distortion (augmentation)-related information in the latent space makes ICL sub-optimal regarding training efficiency and robustness in downstream tasks. Recent studies suggest that introducing equivariance into Contrastive Learning (CL) can improve overall performance. In this paper, we revisit the roles of augmentation strategies and equivariance in improving CL's efficacy. We propose CLeVER (Contrastive Learning Via Equivariant Representation), a novel equivariant contrastive learning framework compatible with augmentation strategies of arbitrary complexity for various mainstream CL backbone models. Experimental results demonstrate that CLeVER effectively extracts and incorporates equivariant information from practical natural images, thereby improving the training efficiency and robustness of baseline models in downstream tasks and achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. Moreover, we find that leveraging equivariant information extracted by CLeVER simultaneously enhances rotational invariance and sensitivity across experimental tasks, and helps stabilize the framework when handling complex augmentations, particularly for models with small-scale backbones.</description>

      <title>HBTP: Heuristic Behavior Tree Planning with Large Language Model Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00965v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Behavior Trees (BTs) are increasingly becoming a popular control structure in robotics due to their modularity, reactivity, and robustness. In terms of BT generation methods, BT planning shows promise for generating reliable BTs. However, the scalability of BT planning is often constrained by prolonged planning times in complex scenarios, largely due to a lack of domain knowledge. In contrast, pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated task reasoning capabilities across various domains, though the correctness and safety of their planning remain uncertain. This paper proposes integrating BT planning with LLM reasoning, introducing Heuristic Behavior Tree Planning (HBTP)-a reliable and efficient framework for BT generation. The key idea in HBTP is to leverage LLMs for task-specific reasoning to generate a heuristic path, which BT planning can then follow to expand efficiently. We first introduce the heuristic BT expansion process, along with two heuristic variants designed for optimal planning and satisficing planning, respectively. Then, we propose methods to address the inaccuracies of LLM reasoning, including action space pruning and reflective feedback, to further enhance both reasoning accuracy and planning efficiency. Experiments demonstrate the theoretical bounds of HBTP, and results from four datasets confirm its practical effectiveness in everyday service robot applications.</description>

      <title>Universal In-Context Approximation By Prompting Fully Recurrent Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01424v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Zero-shot and in-context learning enable solving tasks without model fine-tuning, making them essential for developing generative model solutions. Therefore, it is crucial to understand whether a pretrained model can be prompted to approximate any function, i.e., whether it is a universal in-context approximator. While it was recently shown that transformer models do possess this property, these results rely on their attention mechanism. Hence, these findings do not apply to fully recurrent architectures like RNNs, LSTMs, and the increasingly popular SSMs. We demonstrate that RNNs, LSTMs, GRUs, Linear RNNs, and linear gated architectures such as Mamba and Hawk/Griffin can also serve as universal in-context approximators. To streamline our argument, we introduce a programming language called LSRL that compiles to these fully recurrent architectures. LSRL may be of independent interest for further studies of fully recurrent models, such as constructing interpretability benchmarks. We also study the role of multiplicative gating and observe that architectures incorporating such gating (e.g., LSTMs, GRUs, Hawk/Griffin) can implement certain operations more stably, making them more viable candidates for practical in-context universal approximation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04848v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Training certifiably robust neural networks is an important but challenging task. While many algorithms for (deterministic) certified training have been proposed, they are often evaluated on different training schedules, certification methods, and systematically under-tuned hyperparameters, making it difficult to compare their performance. To address this challenge, we introduce CTBENCH, a unified library and a high-quality benchmark for certified training that evaluates all algorithms under fair settings and systematically tuned hyperparameters. We show that (1) almost all algorithms in CTBENCH surpass the corresponding reported performance in literature in the magnitude of algorithmic improvements, thus establishing new state-of-the-art, and (2) the claimed advantage of recent algorithms drops significantly when we enhance the outdated baselines with a fair training schedule, a fair certification method and well-tuned hyperparameters. Based on CTBENCH, we provide new insights into the current state of certified training and suggest future research directions. We are confident that CTBENCH will serve as a benchmark and testbed for future research in certified training.</description>

      <title>QGEval: Benchmarking Multi-dimensional Evaluation for Question Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05707v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Automatically generated questions often suffer from problems such as unclear expression or factual inaccuracies, requiring a reliable and comprehensive evaluation of their quality. Human evaluation is widely used in the field of question generation (QG) and serves as the gold standard for automatic metrics. However, there is a lack of unified human evaluation criteria, which hampers consistent and reliable evaluations of both QG models and automatic metrics. To address this, we propose QGEval, a multi-dimensional Evaluation benchmark for Question Generation, which evaluates both generated questions and existing automatic metrics across 7 dimensions: fluency, clarity, conciseness, relevance, consistency, answerability, and answer consistency. We demonstrate the appropriateness of these dimensions by examining their correlations and distinctions. Through consistent evaluations of QG models and automatic metrics with QGEval, we find that 1) most QG models perform unsatisfactorily in terms of answerability and answer consistency, and 2) existing metrics fail to align well with human judgments when evaluating generated questions across the 7 dimensions. We expect this work to foster the development of both QG technologies and their evaluation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06397v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Computational prediction of the interaction of T cell receptors (TCRs) and their ligands is a grand challenge in immunology. Despite advances in high-throughput assays, specificity-labelled TCR data remains sparse. In other domains, the pre-training of language models on unlabelled data has been successfully used to address data bottlenecks. However, it is unclear how to best pre-train protein language models for TCR specificity prediction. Here we introduce a TCR language model called SCEPTR (Simple Contrastive Embedding of the Primary sequence of T cell Receptors), capable of data-efficient transfer learning. Through our model, we introduce a novel pre-training strategy combining autocontrastive learning and masked-language modelling, which enables SCEPTR to achieve its state-of-the-art performance. In contrast, existing protein language models and a variant of SCEPTR pre-trained without autocontrastive learning are outperformed by sequence alignment-based methods. We anticipate that contrastive learning will be a useful paradigm to decode the rules of TCR specificity.</description>

      <title>SwitchLoRA: Switched Low-Rank Adaptation Can Learn Full-Rank Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06564v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the training of large language models, parameter-efficient techniques such as LoRA optimize memory usage and reduce communication overhead during the fine-tuning phase. However, applying such techniques directly during the pre-training phase results in poor performance, primarily because the premature implementation of low-rank training significantly reduces model accuracy. Existing methods like ReLoRA and GaLore have attempted to address this challenge by updating the low-rank subspace. However, they still fall short of achieving the accuracy of full-rank training because they must limit the update frequency to maintain optimizer state consistency, hindering their ability to closely approximate full-rank training behavior. In this paper, we introduce SwitchLoRA, a parameter-efficient training technique that frequently and smoothly replaces the trainable parameters of LoRA adapters with alternative parameters. SwitchLoRA updates the low-rank subspace incrementally, targeting only a few dimensions at a time to minimize the impact on optimizer states. This allows a higher update frequency, thereby enhancing accuracy by enabling the updated parameters to more closely mimic full-rank behavior during the pre-training phase. Our results demonstrate that SwitchLoRA actually surpasses full-rank training, reducing perplexity from 15.23 to 15.01 on the LLaMA 1.3B model while reducing communication overhead by 54\% on the LLaMA 1.3B model. Furthermore, after full fine-tuning the SwitchLoRA pre-trained model and the full-rank pre-trained model on the GLUE benchmark, the SwitchLoRA pre-trained model showed an average accuracy gain of about 1\% over the full-rank pre-trained model. This demonstrates enhanced generalization and reasoning capabilities of SwitchLoRA.</description>

      <title>$\textbf{PLUM}$: Improving Code LMs with Execution-Guided On-Policy Preference Learning Driven By Synthetic Test Cases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06887v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Preference learning provides a promising solution to address the limitations of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) for code language models, where the model is not explicitly trained to differentiate between correct and incorrect code. Recent findings demonstrate that on-policy data is the key to successful preference learning, where the preference data is collected using the same policy LM being trained. Inspired by this, we propose PLUM, an on-policy $\textbf{P}$reference $\textbf{L}$earning framework A$\textbf{u}$gmented with test cases for code L$\textbf{M}$ s. The framework operates in three key stages: (1) automatic generation of test cases from natural language instructions, (2) creation of a preference data by evaluating candidate code solutions sampled from the policy, which can then be used to (3) train the policy LM. PLUM levitates the need to train reward models, allowing for large scale on-policy and online preference data collation. PLUM is evaluated on both standard benchmarks (HumanEval, MBPP) and more challenging ones (LiveCodeBench), delivering substantial improvements over original SFT'ed models and other execution-feedback-driven approaches. We show PLUM's benefits are consistent across various widely-used code LMs even they have been well-trained with SFT. For example, PLUM increases pass rates by up to 4.8% on average on standard benchmarks and 11.8% on LiveCodeBench, demonstrating its effectiveness and generalizability. We also demonstrate the benefits of on-policy and online preference learning by comprehensive experimentation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07230v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), their evaluation has become increasingly comprehensive. However, understanding long multimodal content, as a foundational ability for real-world applications, remains underexplored. In this work, we present Needle In A Multimodal Haystack (MM-NIAH), the first benchmark specifically designed to systematically evaluate the capability of existing MLLMs to comprehend long multimodal documents. Our benchmark includes three types of evaluation tasks: multimodal retrieval, counting, and reasoning. In each task, the model is required to answer the questions according to different key information scattered throughout the given multimodal document. Evaluating the leading MLLMs on MM-NIAH, we observe that existing models still have significant room for improvement on these tasks, especially on vision-centric evaluation. We hope this work can provide a platform for further research on long multimodal document comprehension and contribute to the advancement of MLLMs. Code and benchmark are released at https://github.com/OpenGVLab/MM-NIAH.</description>

      <title>Are Large Language Models Good Statisticians?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07815v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across a range of scientific tasks including mathematics, physics, and chemistry. Despite their successes, the effectiveness of LLMs in handling complex statistical tasks remains systematically under-explored. To bridge this gap, we introduce StatQA, a new benchmark designed for statistical analysis tasks. StatQA comprises 11,623 examples tailored to evaluate LLMs' proficiency in specialized statistical tasks and their applicability assessment capabilities, particularly for hypothesis testing methods. We systematically experiment with representative LLMs using various prompting strategies and show that even state-of-the-art models such as GPT-4o achieve a best performance of only 64.83%, indicating significant room for improvement. Notably, while open-source LLMs (e.g. LLaMA-3) show limited capability, those fine-tuned ones exhibit marked improvements, outperforming all in-context learning-based methods (e.g. GPT-4o). Moreover, our comparative human experiments highlight a striking contrast in error types between LLMs and humans: LLMs primarily make applicability errors, whereas humans mostly make statistical task confusion errors. This divergence highlights distinct areas of proficiency and deficiency, suggesting that combining LLM and human expertise could lead to complementary strengths, inviting further investigation into their collaborative potential. Our source code and data are available at https://statqa.github.io/.</description>

      <title>CBGBench: Fill in the Blank of Protein-Molecule Complex Binding Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10840v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Structure-based drug design (SBDD) aims to generate potential drugs that can bind to a target protein and is greatly expedited by the aid of AI techniques in generative models. However, a lack of systematic understanding persists due to the diverse settings, complex implementation, difficult reproducibility, and task singularity. Firstly, the absence of standardization can lead to unfair comparisons and inconclusive insights. To address this dilemma, we propose CBGBench, a comprehensive benchmark for SBDD, that unifies the task as a generative heterogeneous graph completion, analogous to fill-in-the-blank of the 3D complex binding graph. By categorizing existing methods based on their attributes, CBGBench facilitates a modular and extensible framework that implements various cutting-edge methods. Secondly, a single task on \textit{de novo} molecule generation can hardly reflect their capabilities. To broaden the scope, we have adapted these models to a range of tasks essential in drug design, which are considered sub-tasks within the graph fill-in-the-blank tasks. These tasks include the generative designation of \textit{de novo} molecules, linkers, fragments, scaffolds, and sidechains, all conditioned on the structures of protein pockets. Our evaluations are conducted with fairness, encompassing comprehensive perspectives on interaction, chemical properties, geometry authenticity, and substructure validity. We further provide the pre-trained versions of the state-of-the-art models and deep insights with analysis from empirical studies. The codebase for CBGBench is publicly accessible at \url{https://github.com/Edapinenut/CBGBench}.</description>

      <title>miniCodeProps: a Minimal Benchmark for Proving Code Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11915v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: AI agents have shown initial promise in automating mathematical theorem proving in proof assistants such as Lean. The same proof assistants can be used to verify the correctness of code by pairing code with specifications and proofs that the specifications hold. Automating the writing of code, specifications, and proofs could lower the cost of verification, or, ambitiously, enable an AI agent to output safe, provably correct code. However, it remains unclear whether current neural theorem provers can automatically verify even relatively simple programs. We present miniCodeProps, a benchmark of 201 program specifications in the Lean proof assistant, aimed at the subproblem of automatically generating a proof for a provided program and specification. miniCodeProps contains specifications about simple, self-contained programs (e.g., lists, natural numbers, binary trees) with varied proof difficulty. Despite its simplicity, miniCodeProps is sufficient to break current LLM-based provers, with state-of-the-art methods showing promise on the easy properties in miniCodeProps, yet failing to prove nearly all of the medium and hard properties. We publicly release miniCodeProps as a benchmark for furthering automated theorem proving in the context of formally verified code.</description>

      <title>Factor Graph Optimization of Error-Correcting Codes for Belief Propagation Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12900v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The design of optimal linear block codes capable of being efficiently decoded is of major concern, especially for short block lengths. As near capacity-approaching codes, Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) codes possess several advantages over other families of codes, the most notable being its efficient decoding via Belief Propagation. While many LDPC code design methods exist, the development of efficient sparse codes that meet the constraints of modern short code lengths and accommodate new channel models remains a challenge. In this work, we propose for the first time a gradient-based data-driven approach for the design of sparse codes. We develop locally optimal codes with respect to Belief Propagation decoding via the learning of the Factor graph under channel noise simulations. This is performed via a novel complete graph tensor representation of the Belief Propagation algorithm, optimized over finite fields via backpropagation and coupled with an efficient line-search method. The proposed approach is shown to outperform the decoding performance of existing popular codes by orders of magnitude and demonstrates the power of data-driven approaches for code design.</description>

      <title>DialSim: A Real-Time Simulator for Evaluating Long-Term Multi-Party Dialogue Understanding of Conversational Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13144v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced the capabilities of conversational agents, making them applicable to various fields (e.g., education). Despite their progress, the evaluation of the agents often overlooks the complexities of real-world conversations, such as real-time interactions, multi-party dialogues, and extended contextual dependencies. To bridge this gap, we introduce DialSim, a real-time dialogue simulator. In this simulator, an agent is assigned the role of a character from popular TV shows, requiring it to respond to spontaneous questions using past dialogue information and to distinguish between known and unknown information. Key features of DialSim include evaluating the agent's ability to respond within a reasonable time limit, handling long-term multi-party dialogues, and testing the agent's performance under randomized questioning with a diverse and high-quality question-answer dataset. We utilized this simulator to evaluate the latest conversational agents and analyze their limitations. Our experiments highlight both the strengths and weaknesses of these agents, providing valuable insights for future improvements in the field of conversational AI. DialSim is available at https://dialsim.github.io/.</description>

      <title>ClinicalLab: Aligning Agents for Multi-Departmental Clinical Diagnostics in the Real World</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13890v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: LLMs have achieved significant performance progress in various NLP applications. However, LLMs still struggle to meet the strict requirements for accuracy and reliability in the medical field and face many challenges in clinical applications. Existing clinical diagnostic evaluation benchmarks for evaluating medical agents powered by LLMs have severe limitations. Firstly, most existing medical evaluation benchmarks face the risk of data leakage or contamination. Secondly, existing benchmarks often neglect the characteristics of multiple departments and specializations in modern medical practice. Thirdly, existing evaluation methods are limited to multiple-choice questions, which do not align with the real-world diagnostic scenarios. Lastly, existing evaluation methods lack comprehensive evaluations of end-to-end real clinical scenarios. These limitations in benchmarks in turn obstruct advancements of LLMs and agents for medicine. To address these limitations, we introduce ClinicalLab, a comprehensive clinical diagnosis agent alignment suite. ClinicalLab includes ClinicalBench, an end-to-end multi-departmental clinical diagnostic evaluation benchmark for evaluating medical agents and LLMs. ClinicalBench is based on real cases that cover 24 departments and 150 diseases. ClinicalLab also includes four novel metrics (ClinicalMetrics) for evaluating the effectiveness of LLMs in clinical diagnostic tasks. We evaluate 17 LLMs and find that their performance varies significantly across different departments. Based on these findings, in ClinicalLab, we propose ClinicalAgent, an end-to-end clinical agent that aligns with real-world clinical diagnostic practices. We systematically investigate the performance and applicable scenarios of variants of ClinicalAgent on ClinicalBench. Our findings demonstrate the importance of aligning with modern medical practices in designing medical agents.</description>

      <title>Knowledge-Aware Parsimony Learning: A Perspective from Relational Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00478v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The scaling law, which involves the brute-force expansion of training datasets and learnable parameters, has become a prevalent strategy for developing more robust learning models. However, due to bottlenecks in data, computation, and trust, the sustainability of the scaling law is a serious concern for the future of deep learning. In this paper, we address this issue by developing next-generation models in a parsimonious manner (i.e., achieving greater potential with simpler models). The key is to drive models using domain-specific knowledge, such as symbols, logic, and formulas, instead of relying on the scaling law. This approach allows us to build a framework that uses this knowledge as "building blocks" to achieve parsimony in model design, training, and interpretation. Empirical results show that our methods surpass those that typically follow the scaling law. We also demonstrate the application of our framework in AI for science, specifically in the problem of drug-drug interaction prediction. We hope our research can foster more diverse technical roadmaps in the era of foundation models.</description>

      <title>VFIMamba: Video Frame Interpolation with State Space Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02315v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inter-frame modeling is pivotal in generating intermediate frames for video frame interpolation (VFI). Current approaches predominantly rely on convolution or attention-based models, which often either lack sufficient receptive fields or entail significant computational overheads. Recently, Selective State Space Models (S6) have emerged, tailored specifically for long sequence modeling, offering both linear complexity and data-dependent modeling capabilities. In this paper, we propose VFIMamba, a novel frame interpolation method for efficient and dynamic inter-frame modeling by harnessing the S6 model. Our approach introduces the Mixed-SSM Block (MSB), which initially rearranges tokens from adjacent frames in an interleaved fashion and subsequently applies multi-directional S6 modeling. This design facilitates the efficient transmission of information across frames while upholding linear complexity. Furthermore, we introduce a novel curriculum learning strategy that progressively cultivates proficiency in modeling inter-frame dynamics across varying motion magnitudes, fully unleashing the potential of the S6 model. Experimental findings showcase that our method attains state-of-the-art performance across diverse benchmarks, particularly excelling in high-resolution scenarios. In particular, on the X-TEST dataset, VFIMamba demonstrates a noteworthy improvement of 0.80 dB for 4K frames and 0.96 dB for 2K frames.</description>

      <title>AnySR: Realizing Image Super-Resolution as Any-Scale, Any-Resource</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04241v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In an effort to improve the efficiency and scalability of single-image super-resolution (SISR) applications, we introduce AnySR, to rebuild existing arbitrary-scale SR methods into any-scale, any-resource implementation. As a contrast to off-the-shelf methods that solve SR tasks across various scales with the same computing costs, our AnySR innovates in: 1) building arbitrary-scale tasks as any-resource implementation, reducing resource requirements for smaller scales without additional parameters; 2) enhancing any-scale performance in a feature-interweaving fashion, inserting scale pairs into features at regular intervals and ensuring correct feature/scale processing. The efficacy of our AnySR is fully demonstrated by rebuilding most existing arbitrary-scale SISR methods and validating on five popular SISR test datasets. The results show that our AnySR implements SISR tasks in a computing-more-efficient fashion, and performs on par with existing arbitrary-scale SISR methods. For the first time, we realize SISR tasks as not only any-scale in literature, but also as any-resource. Code is available at https://github.com/CrispyFeSo4/AnySR.</description>

      <title>It Cannot Be Right If It Was Written by AI: On Lawyers' Preferences of Documents Perceived as Authored by an LLM vs a Human</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06798v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) enable a future in which certain types of legal documents may be generated automatically. This has a great potential to streamline legal processes, lower the cost of legal services, and dramatically increase access to justice. While many researchers focus on proposing and evaluating LLM-based applications supporting tasks in the legal domain, there is a notable lack of investigations into how legal professionals perceive content if they believe an LLM has generated it. Yet, this is a critical point as over-reliance or unfounded scepticism may influence whether such documents bring about appropriate legal consequences. This study is the necessary analysis of the ongoing transition towards mature generative AI systems. Specifically, we examined whether the perception of legal documents' by lawyers and law students (n=75) varies based on their assumed origin (human-crafted vs AI-generated). The participants evaluated the documents, focusing on their correctness and language quality. Our analysis revealed a clear preference for documents perceived as crafted by a human over those believed to be generated by AI. At the same time, most participants expect the future in which documents will be generated automatically. These findings could be leveraged by legal practitioners, policymakers, and legislators to implement and adopt legal document generation technology responsibly and to fuel the necessary discussions on how legal processes should be updated to reflect recent technological developments.</description>

Abstract: A rapidly growing number of applications rely on a small set of closed-source language models (LMs). This dependency might introduce novel security risks if LMs develop self-recognition capabilities. Inspired by human identity verification methods, we propose a novel approach for assessing self-recognition in LMs using model-generated "security questions". Our test can be externally administered to monitor frontier models as it does not require access to internal model parameters or output probabilities. We use our test to examine self-recognition in ten of the most capable open- and closed-source LMs currently publicly available. Our extensive experiments found no empirical evidence of general or consistent self-recognition in any examined LM. Instead, our results suggest that given a set of alternatives, LMs seek to pick the "best" answer, regardless of its origin. Moreover, we find indications that preferences about which models produce the best answers are consistent across LMs. We additionally uncover novel insights on position bias considerations for LMs in multiple-choice settings.</description>

      <title>How to Leverage Predictive Uncertainty Estimates for Reducing Catastrophic Forgetting in Online Continual Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07668v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many real-world applications require machine-learning models to be able to deal with non-stationary data distributions and thus learn autonomously over an extended period of time, often in an online setting. One of the main challenges in this scenario is the so-called catastrophic forgetting (CF) for which the learning model tends to focus on the most recent tasks while experiencing predictive degradation on older ones. In the online setting, the most effective solutions employ a fixed-size memory buffer to store old samples used for replay when training on new tasks. Many approaches have been presented to tackle this problem. However, it is not clear how predictive uncertainty information for memory management can be leveraged in the most effective manner and conflicting strategies are proposed to populate the memory. Are the easiest-to-forget or the easiest-to-remember samples more effective in combating CF? Starting from the intuition that predictive uncertainty provides an idea of the samples' location in the decision space, this work presents an in-depth analysis of different uncertainty estimates and strategies for populating the memory. The investigation provides a better understanding of the characteristics data points should have for alleviating CF. Then, we propose an alternative method for estimating predictive uncertainty via the generalised variance induced by the negative log-likelihood. Finally, we demonstrate that the use of predictive uncertainty measures helps in reducing CF in different settings.</description>

      <title>Key-Point-Driven Mathematical Reasoning Distillation of Large Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10167v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional proficiency in mathematical reasoning tasks due to their extensive parameter counts and training on vast datasets. Despite these capabilities, deploying LLMs is hindered by their computational demands. Distilling LLM mathematical reasoning into Smaller Language Models (SLMs) has emerged as a solution to this challenge, although these smaller models often suffer from errors in calculation and semantic understanding. Prior work has proposed Program-of-Thought Distillation (PoTD) to avoid calculation error. To further address semantic understanding errors, we propose Key-Point-Driven Mathematical Reasoning Distillation (KPDD). KPDD enhances the reasoning performance of SLMs by breaking down the problem-solving process into three stages: Core Question Extraction, Problem-Solving Information Extraction, and Step-by-Step Solution. This method is further divided into KPDD-CoT, which generates Chain-of-Thought rationales, and KPDD-PoT, which creates Program-of-Thought rationales. The experiment results show that KPDD-CoT significantly improves reasoning abilities, while KPDD-PoT achieves state-of-the-art performance in mathematical reasoning tasks. Our approach effectively mitigates misunderstanding errors, advancing the deployment of efficient and capable SLMs.</description>

      <title>ECCO: Can We Improve Model-Generated Code Efficiency Without Sacrificing Functional Correctness?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14044v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) have been largely successful in generating functionally correct programs, conditioning models to produce efficient solutions while ensuring correctness remains a challenge. Further, unreliability in benchmarking code efficiency is a hurdle across varying hardware specifications for popular interpreted languages such as Python. In this paper, we present ECCO, a reproducible benchmark for evaluating program efficiency via two paradigms: natural language (NL) based code generation and history-based code editing. On ECCO, we adapt and thoroughly investigate the three most promising existing LLM-based approaches: in-context learning, iterative refinement with execution or NL feedback, and fine-tuning conditioned on execution and editing history. While most methods degrade functional correctness and moderately increase program efficiency, we find that adding execution information often helps maintain functional correctness, and NL feedback enhances more on efficiency. We release our benchmark to support future work on LLM-based generation of efficient code.</description>

      <title>Wonderful Matrices: More Efficient and Effective Architecture for Language Modeling Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16958v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have shown that, relative position encoding performs well in selective state space model scanning algorithms, and the architecture that balances SSM and Attention enhances the efficiency and effectiveness of the algorithm, while the sparse activation of the mixture of experts reduces the training cost. We studied the effectiveness of using different position encodings in structured state space dual algorithms, and the more effective SSD-Attn internal and external function mixing method, and designed a more efficient cross domain mixture of experts. We found that the same matrix is very wonderful in different algorithms, which allows us to establish a new hybrid sparse architecture: Cheems. Compared with other hybrid architectures, it is more efficient and more effective in language modeling tasks.</description>

      <title>Mini-batch Coresets for Memory-efficient Training of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19580v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Training with larger mini-batches improves the convergence rate and can yield superior performance. However, training with large mini-batches becomes prohibitive for Large Language Models (LLMs), due to the large GPU memory requirement. To address this problem, an effective approach is finding small mini-batch coresets that closely match the gradient of larger mini-batches. However, this approach becomes infeasible and ineffective for LLMs, due to the highly imbalanced nature of the sources in language data, use of the Adam optimizer, and the very large gradient dimensionality of LLMs. In this work, we address the above challenges by proposing Coresets for Training LLMs (CoLM). First, we show that mini-batch coresets found by gradient matching do not contain representative examples of the small sources w.h.p., and thus including all examples of the small sources in the mini-batch coresets is crucial for optimal performance. Second, we normalize the gradients by their historical exponential to find mini-batch coresets for training with Adam. Finally, we leverage zeroth-order methods to find smooth gradient of the last V -projection matrix and sparsify it to keep the dimensions with the largest normalized gradient magnitude. We apply CoLM to fine-tuning Phi-2, Phi-3, and Zephyr with LoRA on MathInstruct and SuperGLUE benchmark. Remarkably, CoLM reduces the memory requirement of fine-tuning by 2x and even outperforms training with 4x larger mini-batches. Notably, CoLM easily stack with existing memory-efficient training methods, such as LoRA.</description>

      <title>Theia: Distilling Diverse Vision Foundation Models for Robot Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20179v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vision-based robot policy learning, which maps visual inputs to actions, necessitates a holistic understanding of diverse visual tasks beyond single-task needs like classification or segmentation. Inspired by this, we introduce Theia, a vision foundation model for robot learning that distills multiple off-the-shelf vision foundation models trained on varied vision tasks. Theia's rich visual representations encode diverse visual knowledge, enhancing downstream robot learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Theia outperforms its teacher models and prior robot learning models using less training data and smaller model sizes. Additionally, we quantify the quality of pre-trained visual representations and hypothesize that higher entropy in feature norm distributions leads to improved robot learning performance. Code, models, and demo are available at https://theia.theaiinstitute.com.</description>

      <title>Prompt-Agnostic Adversarial Perturbation for Customized Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10571v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have revolutionized customized text-to-image generation, allowing for efficient synthesis of photos from personal data with textual descriptions. However, these advancements bring forth risks including privacy breaches and unauthorized replication of artworks. Previous researches primarily center around using prompt-specific methods to generate adversarial examples to protect personal images, yet the effectiveness of existing methods is hindered by constrained adaptability to different prompts. In this paper, we introduce a Prompt-Agnostic Adversarial Perturbation (PAP) method for customized diffusion models. PAP first models the prompt distribution using a Laplace Approximation, and then produces prompt-agnostic perturbations by maximizing a disturbance expectation based on the modeled distribution. This approach effectively tackles the prompt-agnostic attacks, leading to improved defense stability. Extensive experiments in face privacy and artistic style protection, demonstrate the superior generalization of PAP in comparison to existing techniques.

      <title>MUSES: 3D-Controllable Image Generation via Multi-Modal Agent Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10605v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite recent advancements in text-to-image generation, most existing methods struggle to create images with multiple objects and complex spatial relationships in the 3D world. To tackle this limitation, we introduce a generic AI system, namely MUSES, for 3D-controllable image generation from user queries. Specifically, our MUSES addresses this challenging task by developing a progressive workflow with three key components, including (1) Layout Manager for 2D-to-3D layout lifting, (2) Model Engineer for 3D object acquisition and calibration, (3) Image Artist for 3D-to-2D image rendering. By mimicking the collaboration of human professionals, this multi-modal agent pipeline facilitates the effective and automatic creation of images with 3D-controllable objects, through an explainable integration of top-down planning and bottom-up generation. Additionally, we find that existing benchmarks lack detailed descriptions of complex 3D spatial relationships of multiple objects. To fill this gap, we further construct a new benchmark of T2I-3DisBench (3D image scene), which describes diverse 3D image scenes with 50 detailed prompts. Extensive experiments show the state-of-the-art performance of MUSES on both T2I-CompBench and T2I-3DisBench, outperforming recent strong competitors such as DALL-E 3 and Stable Diffusion 3. These results demonstrate a significant step of MUSES forward in bridging natural language, 2D image generation, and 3D world.

      <description>arXiv:2408.11824v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLM), LLM-driven visual agents are increasingly impacting software interfaces, particularly those with graphical user interfaces. This work introduces a novel LLM-based multimodal agent framework for mobile devices. This framework, capable of navigating mobile devices, emulates human-like interactions. Our agent constructs a flexible action space that enhances adaptability across various applications including parser, text and vision descriptions. The agent operates through two main phases: exploration and deployment. During the exploration phase, functionalities of user interface elements are documented either through agent-driven or manual explorations into a customized structured knowledge base. In the deployment phase, RAG technology enables efficient retrieval and update from this knowledge base, thereby empowering the agent to perform tasks effectively and accurately. This includes performing complex, multi-step operations across various applications, thereby demonstrating the framework's adaptability and precision in handling customized task workflows. Our experimental results across various benchmarks demonstrate the framework's superior performance, confirming its effectiveness in real-world scenarios. Our code will be open source soon.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Counterfactual Interpretability in Deep Learning Models for Time Series Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12666v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The popularity of deep learning methods in the time series domain boosts interest in interpretability studies, including counterfactual (CF) methods. CF methods identify minimal changes in instances to alter the model predictions. Despite extensive research, no existing work benchmarks CF methods in the time series domain. Additionally, the results reported in the literature are inconclusive due to the limited number of datasets and inadequate metrics. In this work, we redesign quantitative metrics to accurately capture desirable characteristics in CFs. We specifically redesign the metrics for sparsity and plausibility and introduce a new metric for consistency. Combined with validity, generation time, and proximity, we form a comprehensive metric set. We systematically benchmark 6 different CF methods on 20 univariate datasets and 10 multivariate datasets with 3 different classifiers. Results indicate that the performance of CF methods varies across metrics and among different models. Finally, we provide case studies and a guideline for practical usage.</description>

      <title>Safety Layers in Aligned Large Language Models: The Key to LLM Security</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17003v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Aligned LLMs are secure, capable of recognizing and refusing to answer malicious questions. However, the role of internal parameters in maintaining such security is not well understood yet, further these models can be vulnerable to security degradation when fine-tuned with non-malicious backdoor or normal data. To address these challenges, our work uncovers the mechanism behind security in aligned LLMs at the parameter level, identifying a small set of contiguous layers in the middle of the model that are crucial for distinguishing malicious queries from normal ones, referred to as "safety layers". We first confirm the existence of these safety layers by analyzing variations in input vectors within the model's internal layers. Additionally, we leverage the over-rejection phenomenon and parameters scaling analysis to precisely locate the safety layers. Building on these findings, we propose a novel fine-tuning approach, Safely Partial-Parameter Fine-Tuning (SPPFT), that fixes the gradient of the safety layers during fine-tuning to address the security degradation. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach can significantly preserve LLM security while maintaining performance and reducing computational resources compared to full fine-tuning.</description>

      <title>Causal Reasoning in Software Quality Assurance: A Systematic Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17183v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Context: Software Quality Assurance (SQA) is a fundamental part of software engineering to ensure stakeholders that software products work as expected after release in operation. Machine Learning (ML) has proven to be able to boost SQA activities and contribute to the development of quality software systems. In this context, Causal Reasoning is gaining increasing interest as a methodology to go beyond a purely data-driven approach by exploiting the use of causality for more effective SQA strategies. Objective: Provide a broad and detailed overview of the use of causal reasoning for SQA activities, in order to support researchers to access this research field, identifying room for application, main challenges and research opportunities. Methods: A systematic review of the scientific literature on causal reasoning for SQA. The study has found, classified, and analyzed 86 articles, according to established guidelines for software engineering secondary studies. Results: Results highlight the primary areas within SQA where causal reasoning has been applied, the predominant methodologies used, and the level of maturity of the proposed solutions. Fault localization is the activity where causal reasoning is more exploited, especially in the web services/microservices domain, but other tasks like testing are rapidly gaining popularity. Both causal inference and causal discovery are exploited, with the Pearl's graphical formulation of causality being preferred, likely due to its intuitiveness. Tools to favour their application are appearing at a fast pace - most of them after 2021. Conclusions: The findings show that causal reasoning is a valuable means for SQA tasks with respect to multiple quality attributes, especially during V&amp;V, evolution and maintenance to ensure reliability, while it is not yet fully exploited for phases like ...</description>

      <title>Open-Vocabulary Action Localization with Iterative Visual Prompting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17422v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Video action localization aims to find the timings of specific actions from a long video. Although existing learning-based approaches have been successful, they require annotating videos, which comes with a considerable labor cost. This paper proposes a learning-free, open-vocabulary approach based on emerging off-the-shelf vision-language models (VLMs). The challenge stems from the fact that VLMs are neither designed to process long videos nor tailored for finding actions. We overcome these problems by extending an iterative visual prompting technique. Specifically, we sample video frames and create a concatenated image with frame index labels, making a VLM guess a frame that is considered to be closest to the start and end of the action. Iterating this process by narrowing a sampling time window results in finding the specific frames corresponding to the start and end of an action. We demonstrate that this technique yields reasonable performance, achieving results comparable to state-of-the-art zero-shot action localization. These results illustrate a practical extension of VLMs for understanding videos. A sample code is available at https://microsoft.github.io/VLM-Video-Action-Localization/.</description>

      <title>Web Retrieval Agents for Evidence-Based Misinformation Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00009v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper develops an agent-based automated fact-checking approach for detecting misinformation. We demonstrate that combining a powerful LLM agent, which does not have access to the internet for searches, with an online web search agent yields better results than when each tool is used independently. Our approach is robust across multiple models, outperforming alternatives and increasing the macro F1 of misinformation detection by as much as 20 percent compared to LLMs without search. We also conduct extensive analyses on the sources our system leverages and their biases, decisions in the construction of the system like the search tool and the knowledge base, the type of evidence needed and its impact on the results, and other parts of the overall process. By combining strong performance with in-depth understanding, we hope to provide building blocks for future search-enabled misinformation mitigation systems.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Hypercomplex Network for Multimodal Emotion Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09194v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Emotion recognition is relevant in various domains, ranging from healthcare to human-computer interaction. Physiological signals, being beyond voluntary control, offer reliable information for this purpose, unlike speech and facial expressions which can be controlled at will. They reflect genuine emotional responses, devoid of conscious manipulation, thereby enhancing the credibility of emotion recognition systems. Nonetheless, multimodal emotion recognition with deep learning models remains a relatively unexplored field. In this paper, we introduce a fully hypercomplex network with a hierarchical learning structure to fully capture correlations. Specifically, at the encoder level, the model learns intra-modal relations among the different channels of each input signal. Then, a hypercomplex fusion module learns inter-modal relations among the embeddings of the different modalities. The main novelty is in exploiting intra-modal relations by endowing the encoders with parameterized hypercomplex convolutions (PHCs) that thanks to hypercomplex algebra can capture inter-channel interactions within single modalities. Instead, the fusion module comprises parameterized hypercomplex multiplications (PHMs) that can model inter-modal correlations. The proposed architecture surpasses state-of-the-art models on the MAHNOB-HCI dataset for emotion recognition, specifically in classifying valence and arousal from electroencephalograms (EEGs) and peripheral physiological signals.

      <title>BNEM: A Boltzmann Sampler Based on Bootstrapped Noised Energy Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09787v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Developing an efficient sampler capable of generating independent and identically distributed (IID) samples from a Boltzmann distribution is a crucial challenge in scientific research, e.g. molecular dynamics. In this work, we intend to learn neural samplers given energy functions instead of data sampled from the Boltzmann distribution. By learning the energies of the noised data, we propose a diffusion-based sampler, Noised Energy Matching, which theoretically has lower variance and more complexity compared to related works. Furthermore, a novel bootstrapping technique is applied to NEM to balance between bias and variance. We evaluate NEM and BNEM on a 2-dimensional 40 Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and a 4-particle double-well potential (DW-4). The experimental results demonstrate that BNEM can achieve state-of-the-art performance while being more robust.</description>

      <title>Automated test generation to evaluate tool-augmented LLMs as conversational AI agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15934v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tool-augmented LLMs are a promising approach to create AI agents that can have realistic conversations, follow procedures, and call appropriate functions. However, evaluating them is challenging due to the diversity of possible conversations, and existing datasets focus only on single interactions and function-calling. We present a test generation pipeline to evaluate LLMs as conversational AI agents. Our framework uses LLMs to generate diverse tests grounded on user-defined procedures. For that, we use intermediate graphs to limit the LLM test generator's tendency to hallucinate content that is not grounded on input procedures, and enforces high coverage of the possible conversations. Additionally, we put forward ALMITA, a manually curated dataset for evaluating AI agents in customer support, and use it to evaluate existing LLMs. Our results show that while tool-augmented LLMs perform well in single interactions, they often struggle to handle complete conversations. While our focus is on customer support, our method is general and capable of AI agents for different domains.</description>

      <title>Beyond Scores: A Modular RAG-Based System for Automatic Short Answer Scoring with Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20042v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Automatic short answer scoring (ASAS) helps reduce the grading burden on educators but often lacks detailed, explainable feedback. Existing methods in ASAS with feedback (ASAS-F) rely on fine-tuning language models with limited datasets, which is resource-intensive and struggles to generalize across contexts. Recent approaches using large language models (LLMs) have focused on scoring without extensive fine-tuning. However, they often rely heavily on prompt engineering and either fail to generate elaborated feedback or do not adequately evaluate it. In this paper, we propose a modular retrieval augmented generation based ASAS-F system that scores answers and generates feedback in strict zero-shot and few-shot learning scenarios. We design our system to be adaptable to various educational tasks without extensive prompt engineering using an automatic prompt generation framework. Results show an improvement in scoring accuracy by 9\% on unseen questions compared to fine-tuning, offering a scalable and cost-effective solution.</description>

      <title>AUCSeg: AUC-oriented Pixel-level Long-tail Semantic Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20398v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) is a well-known metric for evaluating instance-level long-tail learning problems. In the past two decades, many AUC optimization methods have been proposed to improve model performance under long-tail distributions. In this paper, we explore AUC optimization methods in the context of pixel-level long-tail semantic segmentation, a much more complicated scenario. This task introduces two major challenges for AUC optimization techniques. On one hand, AUC optimization in a pixel-level task involves complex coupling across loss terms, with structured inner-image and pairwise inter-image dependencies, complicating theoretical analysis. On the other hand, we find that mini-batch estimation of AUC loss in this case requires a larger batch size, resulting in an unaffordable space complexity. To address these issues, we develop a pixel-level AUC loss function and conduct a dependency-graph-based theoretical analysis of the algorithm's generalization ability. Additionally, we design a Tail-Classes Memory Bank (T-Memory Bank) to manage the significant memory demand. Finally, comprehensive experiments across various benchmarks confirm the effectiveness of our proposed AUCSeg method. The code is available at https://github.com/boyuh/AUCSeg.</description>

      <title>Sparse Attention Decomposition Applied to Circuit Tracing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00340v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many papers have shown that attention heads work in conjunction with each other to perform complex tasks. It's frequently assumed that communication between attention heads is via the addition of specific features to token residuals. In this work we seek to isolate and identify the features used to effect communication and coordination among attention heads in GPT-2 small. Our key leverage on the problem is to show that these features are very often sparsely coded in the singular vectors of attention head matrices. We characterize the dimensionality and occurrence of these signals across the attention heads in GPT-2 small when used for the Indirect Object Identification (IOI) task. The sparse encoding of signals, as provided by attention head singular vectors, allows for efficient separation of signals from the residual background and straightforward identification of communication paths between attention heads. We explore the effectiveness of this approach by tracing portions of the circuits used in the IOI task. Our traces reveal considerable detail not present in previous studies, shedding light on the nature of redundant paths present in GPT-2. And our traces go beyond previous work by identifying features used to communicate between attention heads when performing IOI.</description>

      <title>Towards Full-parameter and Parameter-efficient Self-learning For Endoscopic Camera Depth Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00979v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Adaptation methods are developed to adapt depth foundation models to endoscopic depth estimation recently. However, such approaches typically under-perform training since they limit the parameter search to a low-rank subspace and alter the training dynamics. Therefore, we propose a full-parameter and parameter-efficient learning framework for endoscopic depth estimation. At the first stage, the subspace of attention, convolution and multi-layer perception are adapted simultaneously within different sub-spaces. At the second stage, a memory-efficient optimization is proposed for subspace composition and the performance is further improved in the united sub-space. Initial experiments on the SCARED dataset demonstrate that results at the first stage improves the performance from 10.2% to 4.1% for Sq Rel, Abs Rel, RMSE and RMSE log in the comparison with the state-of-the-art models.</description>

      <title>Dog-IQA: Standard-guided Zero-shot MLLM for Mix-grained Image Quality Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02505v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Image quality assessment (IQA) serves as the golden standard for all models' performance in nearly all computer vision fields. However, it still suffers from poor out-of-distribution generalization ability and expensive training costs. To address these problems, we propose Dog-IQA, a standard-guided zero-shot mix-grained IQA method, which is training-free and utilizes the exceptional prior knowledge of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). To obtain accurate IQA scores, namely scores consistent with humans, we design an MLLM-based inference pipeline that imitates human experts. In detail, Dog-IQA applies two techniques. First, Dog-IQA objectively scores with specific standards that utilize MLLM's behavior pattern and minimize the influence of subjective factors. Second, Dog-IQA comprehensively takes local semantic objects and the whole image as input and aggregates their scores, leveraging local and global information. Our proposed Dog-IQA achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance compared with training-free methods, and competitive performance compared with training-based methods in cross-dataset scenarios. Our code will be available at https://github.com/Kai-Liu001/Dog-IQA.</description>

      <title>Boosting Sample Efficiency and Generalization in Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning via Equivariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02581v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) struggles with sample inefficiency and poor generalization [1]. These challenges are partially due to a lack of structure or inductive bias in the neural networks typically used in learning the policy. One such form of structure that is commonly observed in multi-agent scenarios is symmetry. The field of Geometric Deep Learning has developed Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (EGNN) that are equivariant (or symmetric) to rotations, translations, and reflections of nodes. Incorporating equivariance has been shown to improve learning efficiency and decrease error [ 2 ]. In this paper, we demonstrate that EGNNs improve the sample efficiency and generalization in MARL. However, we also show that a naive application of EGNNs to MARL results in poor early exploration due to a bias in the EGNN structure. To mitigate this bias, we present Exploration-enhanced Equivariant Graph Neural Networks or E2GN2. We compare E2GN2 to other common function approximators using common MARL benchmarks MPE and SMACv2. E2GN2 demonstrates a significant improvement in sample efficiency, greater final reward convergence, and a 2x-5x gain in over standard GNNs in our generalization tests. These results pave the way for more reliable and effective solutions in complex multi-agent systems.</description>

      <title>IC3M: In-Car Multimodal Multi-object Monitoring for Abnormal Status of Both Driver and Passengers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02592v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, in-car monitoring has emerged as a promising technology for detecting early-stage abnormal status of the driver and providing timely alerts to prevent traffic accidents. Although training models with multimodal data enhances the reliability of abnormal status detection, the scarcity of labeled data and the imbalance of class distribution impede the extraction of critical abnormal state features, significantly deteriorating training performance. Furthermore, missing modalities due to environment and hardware limitations further exacerbate the challenge of abnormal status identification. More importantly, monitoring abnormal health conditions of passengers, particularly in elderly care, is of paramount importance but remains underexplored. To address these challenges, we introduce our IC3M, an efficient camera-rotation-based multimodal framework for monitoring both driver and passengers in a car. Our IC3M comprises two key modules: an adaptive threshold pseudo-labeling strategy and a missing modality reconstruction. The former customizes pseudo-labeling thresholds for different classes based on the class distribution, generating class-balanced pseudo labels to guide model training effectively, while the latter leverages crossmodality relationships learned from limited labels to accurately recover missing modalities by distribution transferring from available modalities. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that IC3M outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks in accuracy, precision, and recall while exhibiting superior robustness under limited labeled data and severe missing modality.</description>

      <title>HELMET: How to Evaluate Long-Context Language Models Effectively and Thoroughly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02694v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There have been many benchmarks for evaluating long-context language models (LCLMs), but developers often rely on synthetic tasks like needle-in-a-haystack (NIAH) or arbitrary subsets of tasks. It remains unclear whether they translate to the diverse downstream applications of LCLMs, and the inconsistency further complicates model comparison. We investigate the underlying reasons behind current practices and find that existing benchmarks often provide noisy signals due to low coverage of applications, insufficient lengths, unreliable metrics, and incompatibility with base models. In this work, we present HELMET (How to Evaluate Long-context Models Effectively and Thoroughly), a comprehensive benchmark encompassing seven diverse, application-centric categories. We also address many issues in previous benchmarks by adding controllable lengths up to 128k tokens, model-based evaluation for reliable metrics, and few-shot prompting for robustly evaluating base models. Consequently, we demonstrate that HELMET offers more reliable and consistent rankings of frontier LCLMs. Through a comprehensive study of 51 LCLMs, we find that (1) synthetic tasks like NIAH are not good predictors of downstream performance; (2) the diverse categories in HELMET exhibit distinct trends and low correlation with each other; and (3) while most LCLMs achieve perfect NIAH scores, open-source models significantly lag behind closed ones when the task requires full-context reasoning or following complex instructions -- the gap widens with increased lengths. Finally, we recommend using our RAG tasks for fast model development, as they are easy to run and more predictive of other downstream performance; ultimately, we advocate for a holistic evaluation across diverse tasks.</description>

      <title>CriSPO: Multi-Aspect Critique-Suggestion-guided Automatic Prompt Optimization for Text Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02748v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing automatic prompt engineering methods are typically designed for discriminative tasks, where new task prompts are iteratively refined with limited feedback from a single metric reflecting a single aspect. However, these approaches are suboptimal for generative tasks, which require more nuanced guidance beyond a single numeric metric to improve the prompt and optimize multiple aspects of the generated text. To address these challenges, we propose a novel multi-aspect Critique-Suggestion-guided automatic Prompt Optimization (CriSPO) approach. CriSPO introduces a critique-suggestion module as its core component. This module spontaneously discovers aspects, and compares generated and reference texts across these aspects, providing specific suggestions for prompt modification. These clear critiques and actionable suggestions guide a receptive optimizer module to make more substantial changes, exploring a broader and more effective search space. To further improve CriSPO with multi-metric optimization, we introduce an Automatic Suffix Tuning (AST) extension to enhance the performance of task prompts across multiple metrics. We evaluate CriSPO on 4 state-of-the-art LLMs across 4 summarization and 5 QA datasets. Extensive experiments show 3-4\% ROUGE score improvement on summarization and substantial improvement of various metrics on QA.</description>

      <title>Visual Editing with LLM-based Tool Chaining: An Efficient Distillation Approach for Real-Time Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02952v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a practical distillation approach to fine-tune LLMs for invoking tools in real-time applications. We focus on visual editing tasks; specifically, we modify images and videos by interpreting user stylistic requests, specified in natural language ("golden hour"), using an LLM to select the appropriate tools and their parameters to achieve the desired visual effect. We found that proprietary LLMs such as GPT-3.5-Turbo show potential in this task, but their high cost and latency make them unsuitable for real-time applications. In our approach, we fine-tune a (smaller) student LLM with guidance from a (larger) teacher LLM and behavioral signals. We introduce offline metrics to evaluate student LLMs. Both online and offline experiments show that our student models manage to match the performance of our teacher model (GPT-3.5-Turbo), significantly reducing costs and latency. Lastly, we show that fine-tuning was improved by 25% in low-data regimes using augmentation.</description>

      <title>ARB-LLM: Alternating Refined Binarizations for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03129v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have greatly pushed forward advancements in natural language processing, yet their high memory and computational demands hinder practical deployment. Binarization, as an effective compression technique, can shrink model weights to just 1 bit, significantly reducing the high demands on computation and memory. However, current binarization methods struggle to narrow the distribution gap between binarized and full-precision weights, while also overlooking the column deviation in LLM weight distribution. To tackle these issues, we propose ARB-LLM, a novel 1-bit post-training quantization (PTQ) technique tailored for LLMs. To narrow the distribution shift between binarized and full-precision weights, we first design an alternating refined binarization (ARB) algorithm to progressively update the binarization parameters, which significantly reduces the quantization error. Moreover, considering the pivot role of calibration data and the column deviation in LLM weights, we further extend ARB to ARB-X and ARB-RC. In addition, we refine the weight partition strategy with column-group bitmap (CGB), which further enhance performance. Equipping ARB-X and ARB-RC with CGB, we obtain ARB-LLM$_\text{X}$ and ARB-LLM$_\text{RC}$ respectively, which significantly outperform state-of-the-art (SOTA) binarization methods for LLMs. As a binary PTQ method, our ARB-LLM$_\text{RC}$ is the first to surpass FP16 models of the same size. The code and models will be available at https://github.com/ZHITENGLI/ARB-LLM.</description>

      <title>Towards Real-time Intrahepatic Vessel Identification in Intraoperative Ultrasound-Guided Liver Surgery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03420v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While laparoscopic liver resection is less prone to complications and maintains patient outcomes compared to traditional open surgery, its complexity hinders widespread adoption due to challenges in representing the liver's internal structure. Laparoscopic intraoperative ultrasound offers efficient, cost-effective and radiation-free guidance. Our objective is to aid physicians in identifying internal liver structures using laparoscopic intraoperative ultrasound. We propose a patient-specific approach using preoperative 3D ultrasound liver volume to train a deep learning model for real-time identification of portal tree and branch structures. Our personalized AI model, validated on ex vivo swine livers, achieved superior precision (0.95) and recall (0.93) compared to surgeons, laying groundwork for precise vessel identification in ultrasound-based liver resection. Its adaptability and potential clinical impact promise to advance surgical interventions and improve patient care.</description>

      <title>Not All Diffusion Model Activations Have Been Evaluated as Discriminative Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03558v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models are initially designed for image generation. Recent research shows that the internal signals within their backbones, named activations, can also serve as dense features for various discriminative tasks such as semantic segmentation. Given numerous activations, selecting a small yet effective subset poses a fundamental problem. To this end, the early study of this field performs a large-scale quantitative comparison of the discriminative ability of the activations. However, we find that many potential activations have not been evaluated, such as the queries and keys used to compute attention scores. Moreover, recent advancements in diffusion architectures bring many new activations, such as those within embedded ViT modules. Both combined, activation selection remains unresolved but overlooked. To tackle this issue, this paper takes a further step with a much broader range of activations evaluated. Considering the significant increase in activations, a full-scale quantitative comparison is no longer operational. Instead, we seek to understand the properties of these activations, such that the activations that are clearly inferior can be filtered out in advance via simple qualitative evaluation. After careful analysis, we discover three properties universal among diffusion models, enabling this study to go beyond specific models. On top of this, we present effective feature selection solutions for several popular diffusion models. Finally, the experiments across multiple discriminative tasks validate the superiority of our method over the SOTA competitors.

      <title>SONAR: A Synthetic AI-Audio Detection Framework and Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04324v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in Text-to-Speech (TTS) and Voice-Conversion (VC) using generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology have made it possible to generate high-quality and realistic human-like audio. This introduces significant challenges to distinguishing AI-synthesized speech from the authentic human voice and could raise potential issues of misuse for malicious purposes such as impersonation and fraud, spreading misinformation, deepfakes, and scams. However, existing detection techniques for AI-synthesized audio have not kept pace and often exhibit poor generalization across diverse datasets. In this paper, we introduce SONAR, a synthetic AI-Audio Detection Framework and Benchmark, aiming to provide a comprehensive evaluation for distinguishing cutting-edge AI-synthesized auditory content. SONAR includes a novel evaluation dataset sourced from 9 diverse audio synthesis platforms, including leading TTS providers and state-of-the-art TTS models. It is the first framework to uniformly benchmark AI-audio detection across both traditional and foundation model-based deepfake detection systems. Through extensive experiments, we reveal the generalization limitations of existing detection methods and demonstrate that foundation models exhibit stronger generalization capabilities, which can be attributed to their model size and the scale and quality of pretraining data. Additionally, we explore the effectiveness and efficiency of few-shot fine-tuning in improving generalization, highlighting its potential for tailored applications, such as personalized detection systems for specific entities or individuals. Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/Jessegator/SONAR.</description>

      <title>Towards Understanding and Enhancing Security of Proof-of-Training for DNN Model Ownership Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04397v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The great economic values of deep neural networks (DNNs) urge AI enterprises to protect their intellectual property (IP) for these models. Recently, proof-of-training (PoT) has been proposed as a promising solution to DNN IP protection, through which AI enterprises can utilize the record of DNN training process as their ownership proof. To prevent attackers from forging ownership proof, a secure PoT scheme should be able to distinguish honest training records from those forged by attackers. Although existing PoT schemes provide various distinction criteria, these criteria are based on intuitions or observations. The effectiveness of these criteria lacks clear and comprehensive analysis, resulting in existing schemes initially deemed secure being swiftly compromised by simple ideas. In this paper, we make the first move to identify distinction criteria in the style of formal methods, so that their effectiveness can be explicitly demonstrated. Specifically, we conduct systematic modeling to cover a wide range of attacks and then theoretically analyze the distinctions between honest and forged training records. The analysis results not only induce a universal distinction criterion, but also provide detailed reasoning to demonstrate its effectiveness in defending against attacks covered by our model. Guided by the criterion, we propose a generic PoT construction that can be instantiated into concrete schemes. This construction sheds light on the realization that trajectory matching algorithms, previously employed in data distillation, possess significant advantages in PoT construction. Experimental results demonstrate that our scheme can resist attacks that have compromised existing PoT schemes, which corroborates its superiority in security.</description>

      <title>Hammer: Robust Function-Calling for On-Device Language Models via Function Masking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04587v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated impressive value in performing as autonomous agents when equipped with external tools and API calls. Nonetheless, effectively harnessing their potential for executing complex tasks crucially relies on enhancements in their function calling capabilities. This paper identifies a critical gap in existing function calling models, where performance varies significantly across benchmarks, often due to being misled by specific naming conventions. To address such an issue, we introduce Hammer, a novel family of foundation models specifically engineered for on-device function calling. Hammer employs an augmented dataset that enhances models' sensitivity to irrelevant functions and incorporates function masking techniques to minimize misleading. Our empirical evaluations reveal that Hammer not only outperforms larger models but also demonstrates robust generalization across diverse benchmarks, achieving sota results. Our open source contributions include a specialized dataset for irrelevance detection, a tuning framework for enhanced generalization, and the Hammer models, establishing a new standard for function calling performance.</description>

      <title>Detecting and Approximating Redundant Computational Blocks in Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04941v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks often learn similar internal representations, both across different models and within their own layers. While inter-network similarities have enabled techniques such as model stitching and merging, intra-network similarities present new opportunities for designing more efficient architectures. In this paper, we investigate the emergence of these internal similarities across different layers in diverse neural architectures, showing that similarity patterns emerge independently of the datataset used. We introduce a simple metric, Block Redundancy, to detect redundant blocks, providing a foundation for future architectural optimization methods. Building on this, we propose Redundant Blocks Approximation (RBA), a general framework that identifies and approximates one or more redundant computational blocks using simpler transformations. We show that the transformation $\mathcal{T}$ between two representations can be efficiently computed in closed-form, and it is enough to replace the redundant blocks from the network. RBA reduces model parameters and time complexity while maintaining good performance. We validate our method on classification tasks in the vision domain using a variety of pretrained foundational models and datasets.</description>

      <title>6DGS: Enhanced Direction-Aware Gaussian Splatting for Volumetric Rendering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04974v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Novel view synthesis has advanced significantly with the development of neural radiance fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS). However, achieving high quality without compromising real-time rendering remains challenging, particularly for physically-based ray tracing with view-dependent effects. Recently, N-dimensional Gaussians (N-DG) introduced a 6D spatial-angular representation to better incorporate view-dependent effects, but the Gaussian representation and control scheme are sub-optimal. In this paper, we revisit 6D Gaussians and introduce 6D Gaussian Splatting (6DGS), which enhances color and opacity representations and leverages the additional directional information in the 6D space for optimized Gaussian control. Our approach is fully compatible with the 3DGS framework and significantly improves real-time radiance field rendering by better modeling view-dependent effects and fine details. Experiments demonstrate that 6DGS significantly outperforms 3DGS and N-DG, achieving up to a 15.73 dB improvement in PSNR with a reduction of 66.5% Gaussian points compared to 3DGS.

      <description>arXiv:2410.05354v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Wireless networks supporting artificial intelligence have gained significant attention, with Over-the-Air Federated Learning emerging as a key application due to its unique transmission and distributed computing characteristics. This paper derives error bounds for Over-the-Air Federated Learning in a Cell-free MIMO system and formulates an optimization problem to minimize optimality gap via joint optimization of power control and beamforming. We introduce the MOP-LOFPC algorithm, which employs Lyapunov optimization to decouple long-term constraints across rounds while requiring only causal channel state information. Experimental results demonstrate that MOP-LOFPC achieves a better and more flexible trade-off between the model's training loss and adherence to long-term power constraints compared to existing baselines.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05575v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Automatic refinement of patent claims in patent applications is crucial from the perspective of intellectual property strategy. In this paper, we propose ClaimBrush, a novel framework for automated patent claim refinement that includes a dataset and a rewriting model. We constructed a dataset for training and evaluating patent claim rewriting models by collecting a large number of actual patent claim rewriting cases from the patent examination process. Using the constructed dataset, we built an automatic patent claim rewriting model by fine-tuning a large language model. Furthermore, we enhanced the performance of the automatic patent claim rewriting model by applying preference optimization based on a prediction model of patent examiners' Office Actions. The experimental results showed that our proposed rewriting model outperformed heuristic baselines and zero-shot learning in state-of-the-art large language models. Moreover, preference optimization based on patent examiners' preferences boosted the performance of patent claim refinement.</description>

      <title>Copiloting Diagnosis of Autism in Real Clinical Scenarios via LLMs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05684v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autism spectrum disorder(ASD) is a pervasive developmental disorder that significantly impacts the daily functioning and social participation of individuals. Despite the abundance of research focused on supporting the clinical diagnosis of ASD, there is still a lack of systematic and comprehensive exploration in the field of methods based on Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly regarding the real-world clinical diagnostic scenarios based on Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule, Second Edition (ADOS-2). Therefore, we have proposed a framework called ADOS-Copilot, which strikes a balance between scoring and explanation and explored the factors that influence the performance of LLMs in this task. The experimental results indicate that our proposed framework is competitive with the diagnostic results of clinicians, with a minimum MAE of 0.4643, binary classification F1-score of 81.79\%, and ternary classification F1-score of 78.37\%. Furthermore, we have systematically elucidated the strengths and limitations of current LLMs in this task from the perspectives of ADOS-2, LLMs' capabilities, language, and model scale aiming to inspire and guide the future application of LLMs in a broader fields of mental health disorders. We hope for more research to be transferred into real clinical practice, opening a window of kindness to the world for eccentric children.</description>

      <title>KnowledgeSG: Privacy-Preserving Synthetic Text Generation with Knowledge Distillation from Server</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05725v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The success of large language models (LLMs) facilitate many parties to fine-tune LLMs on their own private data. However, this practice raises privacy concerns due to the memorization of LLMs. Existing solutions, such as utilizing synthetic data for substitution, struggle to simultaneously improve performance and preserve privacy. They either rely on a local model for generation, resulting in a performance decline, or take advantage of APIs, directly exposing the data to API servers. To address this issue, we propose KnowledgeSG, a novel client-server framework which enhances synthetic data quality and improves model performance while ensuring privacy. We achieve this by learning local knowledge from the private data with differential privacy (DP) and distilling professional knowledge from the server. Additionally, inspired by federated learning, we transmit models rather than data between the client and server to prevent privacy leakage. Extensive experiments in medical and financial domains demonstrate the effectiveness of KnowledgeSG. Our code is now publicly available at https://github.com/wwh0411/KnowledgeSG.</description>

      <title>From Tokens to Words: On the Inner Lexicon of LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05864v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Natural language is composed of words, but modern LLMs process sub-words as input. A natural question raised by this discrepancy is whether LLMs encode words internally, and if so how. We present evidence that LLMs engage in an intrinsic detokenization process, where sub-word sequences are combined into coherent word representations. Our experiments show that this process takes place primarily within the early and middle layers of the model. They also show that it is robust to non-morphemic splits, typos and perhaps importantly-to out-of-vocabulary words: when feeding the inner representation of such words to the model as input vectors, it can "understand" them despite never seeing them during training. Our findings suggest that LLMs maintain a latent vocabulary beyond the tokenizer's scope. These insights provide a practical, finetuning-free application for expanding the vocabulary of pre-trained models. By enabling the addition of new vocabulary words, we reduce input length and inference iterations, which reduces both space and model latency, with little to no loss in model accuracy.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06355v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel hybrid algorithm designed to interpret natural human commands in tabletop scenarios. By integrating multiple sources of information, including speech, gestures, and scene context, the system extracts actionable instructions for a robot, identifying relevant objects and actions. The system operates in a zero-shot fashion, without reliance on predefined object models, enabling flexible and adaptive use in various environments. We assess the integration of multiple deep learning models, evaluating their suitability for deployment in real-world robotic setups. Our algorithm performs robustly across different tasks, combining language processing with visual grounding. In addition, we release a small dataset of video recordings used to evaluate the system. This dataset captures real-world interactions in which a human provides instructions in natural language to a robot, a contribution to future research on human-robot interaction. We discuss the strengths and limitations of the system, with particular focus on how it handles multimodal command interpretation, and its ability to be integrated into symbolic robotic frameworks for safe and explainable decision-making.</description>

      <title>Grounding Robot Policies with Visuomotor Language Guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06473v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in the fields of natural language processing and computer vision have shown great potential in understanding the underlying dynamics of the world from large-scale internet data. However, translating this knowledge into robotic systems remains an open challenge, given the scarcity of human-robot interactions and the lack of large-scale datasets of real-world robotic data. Previous robot learning approaches such as behavior cloning and reinforcement learning have shown great capabilities in learning robotic skills from human demonstrations or from scratch in specific environments. However, these approaches often require task-specific demonstrations or designing complex simulation environments, which limits the development of generalizable and robust policies for new settings. Aiming to address these limitations, we propose an agent-based framework for grounding robot policies to the current context, considering the constraints of a current robot and its environment using visuomotor-grounded language guidance. The proposed framework is composed of a set of conversational agents designed for specific roles -- namely, high-level advisor, visual grounding, monitoring, and robotic agents. Given a base policy, the agents collectively generate guidance at run time to shift the action distribution of the base policy towards more desirable future states. We demonstrate that our approach can effectively guide manipulation policies to achieve significantly higher success rates both in simulation and in real-world experiments without the need for additional human demonstrations or extensive exploration.

      <title>Task-oriented Time Series Imputation Evaluation via Generalized Representers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06652v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time series analysis is widely used in many fields such as power energy, economics, and transportation, including different tasks such as forecasting, anomaly detection, classification, etc. Missing values are widely observed in these tasks, and often leading to unpredictable negative effects on existing methods, hindering their further application. In response to this situation, existing time series imputation methods mainly focus on restoring sequences based on their data characteristics, while ignoring the performance of the restored sequences in downstream tasks. Considering different requirements of downstream tasks (e.g., forecasting), this paper proposes an efficient downstream task-oriented time series imputation evaluation approach. By combining time series imputation with neural network models used for downstream tasks, the gain of different imputation strategies on downstream tasks is estimated without retraining, and the most favorable imputation value for downstream tasks is given by combining different imputation strategies according to the estimated gain.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models as Code Executors: An Exploratory Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06667v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly evolved, extending from natural language processing to complex tasks like code understanding and generation. We expand the scope of LLMs' capabilities to a broader context, using LLMs to execute code snippets to obtain the output. This paper pioneers the exploration of LLMs as code executors, where code snippets are directly fed to the models for execution, and outputs are returned. We are the first to comprehensively examine this feasibility across various LLMs, including OpenAI's o1, GPT-4o, GPT-3.5, DeepSeek, and Qwen-Coder. Notably, the o1 model achieved over 90% accuracy in code execution, while others demonstrated lower accuracy levels. Furthermore, we introduce an Iterative Instruction Prompting (IIP) technique that processes code snippets line by line, enhancing the accuracy of weaker models by an average of 7.22% (with the highest improvement of 18.96%) and an absolute average improvement of 3.86% against CoT prompting (with the highest improvement of 19.46%). Our study not only highlights the transformative potential of LLMs in coding but also lays the groundwork for future advancements in automated programming and the completion of complex tasks.</description>

      <title>Suppress Content Shift: Better Diffusion Features via Off-the-Shelf Generation Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06719v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models are powerful generative models, and this capability can also be applied to discrimination. The inner activations of a pre-trained diffusion model can serve as features for discriminative tasks, namely, diffusion feature. We discover that diffusion feature has been hindered by a hidden yet universal phenomenon that we call content shift. To be specific, there are content differences between features and the input image, such as the exact shape of a certain object. We locate the cause of content shift as one inherent characteristic of diffusion models, which suggests the broad existence of this phenomenon in diffusion feature. Further empirical study also indicates that its negative impact is not negligible even when content shift is not visually perceivable. Hence, we propose to suppress content shift to enhance the overall quality of diffusion features. Specifically, content shift is related to the information drift during the process of recovering an image from the noisy input, pointing out the possibility of turning off-the-shelf generation techniques into tools for content shift suppression. We further propose a practical guideline named GATE to efficiently evaluate the potential benefit of a technique and provide an implementation of our methodology. Despite the simplicity, the proposed approach has achieved superior results on various tasks and datasets, validating its potential as a generic booster for diffusion features. Our code is available at https://github.com/Darkbblue/diffusion-content-shift.</description>

      <title>Degree Distribution based Spiking Graph Networks for Domain Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06883v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spiking Graph Networks (SGNs) have garnered significant attraction from both researchers and industry due to their ability to address energy consumption challenges in graph classification. However, SGNs are only effective for in-distribution data and cannot tackle out-of-distribution data. In this paper, we first propose the domain adaptation problem in SGNs, and introduce a novel framework named Degree-aware Spiking Graph Domain Adaptation for Classification. The proposed DeSGDA addresses the spiking graph domain adaptation problem by three aspects: node degree-aware personalized spiking representation, adversarial feature distribution alignment, and pseudo-label distillation. First, we introduce the personalized spiking representation method for generating degree-dependent spiking signals. Specifically, the threshold of triggering a spike is determined by the node degree, allowing this personalized approach to capture more expressive information for classification. Then, we propose the graph feature distribution alignment module that is adversarially trained using membrane potential against a domain discriminator. Such an alignment module can efficiently maintain high performance and low energy consumption in the case of inconsistent distribution. Additionally, we extract consistent predictions across two spaces to create reliable pseudo-labels, effectively leveraging unlabeled data to enhance graph classification performance. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets validate the superiority of the proposed DeSGDA compared with competitive baselines.</description>

      <title>Quanda: An Interpretability Toolkit for Training Data Attribution Evaluation and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07158v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, training data attribution (TDA) methods have emerged as a promising direction for the interpretability of neural networks. While research around TDA is thriving, limited effort has been dedicated to the evaluation of attributions. Similar to the development of evaluation metrics for traditional feature attribution approaches, several standalone metrics have been proposed to evaluate the quality of TDA methods across various contexts. However, the lack of a unified framework that allows for systematic comparison limits trust in TDA methods and stunts their widespread adoption. To address this research gap, we introduce Quanda, a Python toolkit designed to facilitate the evaluation of TDA methods. Beyond offering a comprehensive set of evaluation metrics, Quanda provides a uniform interface for seamless integration with existing TDA implementations across different repositories, thus enabling systematic benchmarking. The toolkit is user-friendly, thoroughly tested, well-documented, and available as an open-source library on PyPi and under https://github.com/dilyabareeva/quanda.</description>
