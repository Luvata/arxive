      <title>Python Agent in Ludii</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ludii is a Java general game system with a considerable number of board games, with an API for developing new agents and a game description language to create new games. To improve versatility and ease development, we provide Python interfaces for agent programming. This allows the use of Python modules to implement general game playing agents.
  As a means of enabling Python for creating Ludii agents, the interfaces are implemented using different Java libraries: jpy and Py4J. The main goal of this work is to determine which version is faster. To do so, we conducted a performance analysis of two different GGP algorithms, Minimax adapted to GGP and MCTS. The analysis was performed across several combinatorial games with varying depth, branching factor, and ply time. For reproducibility, we provide tutorials and repositories.
  Our analysis includes predictive models using regression, which suggest that jpy is faster than Py4J, however slower than a native Java Ludii agent, as expected.</description>

      <title>Balans: Multi-Armed Bandits-based Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search for Mixed-Integer Programming Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP) is a powerful paradigm for modeling and solving various important combinatorial optimization problems. Recently, learning-based approaches have shown potential to speed up MIP solving via offline training that then guides important design decisions during search. However, a significant drawback of these methods is their heavy reliance on offline training, which requires collecting training datasets and computationally costly training epochs yet offering only limited generalization to unseen (larger) instances. In this paper, we propose Balans, an adaptive meta-solver for MIPs with online learning capability that does not require any supervision or apriori training. At its core, Balans is based on adaptive large-neighborhood search, operating on top of a MIP solver by successive applications of destroy and repair neighborhood operators. During the search, the selection among different neighborhood definitions is guided on the fly for the instance at hand via multi-armed bandit algorithms. Our extensive experiments on hard optimization instances show that Balans offers significant performance gains over the default MIP solver, is better than committing to any single best neighborhood, and improves over the state-of-the-art large-neighborhood search for MIPs. Finally, we release Balans as a highly configurable, MIP solver agnostic, open-source software.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Managing clinical trial information is currently a significant challenge for the medical industry, as traditional methods are both time-consuming and costly. This paper proposes a simple yet effective methodology to extract and integrate clinical trial data in a cost-effective and time-efficient manner. Allowing the medical industry to stay up-to-date with medical developments. Comparing time, cost, and quality of the ontologies created by humans, GPT3.5, GPT4, and Llama3 (8b &amp; 70b). Findings suggest that large language models (LLM) are a viable option to automate this process both from a cost and time perspective. This study underscores significant implications for medical research where real-time data integration from clinical trials could become the norm.</description>

      <title>Multi-task Representation Learning for Mixed Integer Linear Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mixed Integer Linear Programs (MILPs) are highly flexible and powerful tools for modeling and solving complex real-world combinatorial optimization problems. Recently, machine learning (ML)-guided approaches have demonstrated significant potential in improving MILP-solving efficiency. However, these methods typically rely on separate offline data collection and training processes, which limits their scalability and adaptability. This paper introduces the first multi-task learning framework for ML-guided MILP solving. The proposed framework provides MILP embeddings helpful in guiding MILP solving across solvers (e.g., Gurobi and SCIP) and across tasks (e.g., Branching and Solver configuration). Through extensive experiments on three widely used MILP benchmarks, we demonstrate that our multi-task learning model performs similarly to specialized models within the same distribution. Moreover, it significantly outperforms them in generalization across problem sizes and tasks.</description>

      <title>Towards Projected and Incremental Pseudo-Boolean Model Counting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model counting is a fundamental task that involves determining the number of satisfying assignments to a logical formula, typically in conjunctive normal form (CNF). While CNF model counting has received extensive attention over recent decades, interest in Pseudo-Boolean (PB) model counting is just emerging partly due to the greater flexibility of PB formulas. As such, we observed feature gaps in existing PB counters such as a lack of support for projected and incremental settings, which could hinder adoption.
  In this work, our main contribution is the introduction of the PB model counter PBCount2, the first exact PB model counter with support for projected and incremental model counting. Our counter, PBCount2, uses our Least Occurrence Weighted Min Degree (LOW-MD) computation ordering heuristic to support projected model counting and a cache mechanism to enable incremental model counting. In our evaluations, PBCount2 completed at least 1.40x the number of benchmarks of competing methods for projected model counting and at least 1.18x of competing methods in incremental model counting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Probabilities of causation (PoC) offer valuable insights for informed decision-making. This paper introduces novel variants of PoC-controlled direct, natural direct, and natural indirect probability of necessity and sufficiency (PNS). These metrics quantify the necessity and sufficiency of a treatment for producing an outcome, accounting for different causal pathways. We develop identification theorems for these new PoC measures, allowing for their estimation from observational data. We demonstrate the practical application of our results through an analysis of a real-world psychology dataset.</description>

      <title>FaultExplainer: Leveraging Large Language Models for Interpretable Fault Detection and Diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning algorithms are increasingly being applied to fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) in chemical processes. However, existing data-driven FDD platforms often lack interpretability for process operators and struggle to identify root causes of previously unseen faults. This paper presents FaultExplainer, an interactive tool designed to improve fault detection, diagnosis, and explanation in the Tennessee Eastman Process (TEP). FaultExplainer integrates real-time sensor data visualization, Principal Component Analysis (PCA)-based fault detection, and identification of top contributing variables within an interactive user interface powered by large language models (LLMs). We evaluate the LLMs' reasoning capabilities in two scenarios: one where historical root causes are provided, and one where they are not to mimic the challenge of previously unseen faults. Experimental results using GPT-4o and o1-preview models demonstrate the system's strengths in generating plausible and actionable explanations, while also highlighting its limitations, including reliance on PCA-selected features and occasional hallucinations.</description>

      <title>The Digital Ecosystem of Beliefs: does evolution favour AI over humans?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As AI systems are integrated into social networks, there are AI safety concerns that AI-generated content may dominate the web, e.g. in popularity or impact on beliefs.To understand such questions, this paper proposes the Digital Ecosystem of Beliefs (Digico), the first evolutionary framework for controlled experimentation with multi-population interactions in simulated social networks. The framework models a population of agents which change their messaging strategies due to evolutionary updates following a Universal Darwinism approach, interact via messages, influence each other's beliefs through dynamics based on a contagion model, and maintain their beliefs through cognitive Lamarckian inheritance. Initial experiments with an abstract implementation of Digico show that: a) when AIs have faster messaging, evolution, and more influence in the recommendation algorithm, they get 80% to 95% of the views, depending on the size of the influence benefit; b) AIs designed for propaganda can typically convince 50% of humans to adopt extreme beliefs, and up to 85% when agents believe only a limited number of channels; c) a penalty for content that violates agents' beliefs reduces propaganda effectiveness by up to 8%. We further discuss implications for control (e.g. legislation) and Digico as a means of studying evolutionary principles.</description>

      <title>Relational Programming with Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foundation models have vast potential to enable diverse AI applications. The powerful yet incomplete nature of these models has spurred a wide range of mechanisms to augment them with capabilities such as in-context learning, information retrieval, and code interpreting. We propose Vieira, a declarative framework that unifies these mechanisms in a general solution for programming with foundation models. Vieira follows a probabilistic relational paradigm and treats foundation models as stateless functions with relational inputs and outputs. It supports neuro-symbolic applications by enabling the seamless combination of such models with logic programs, as well as complex, multi-modal applications by streamlining the composition of diverse sub-models. We implement Vieira by extending the Scallop compiler with a foreign interface that supports foundation models as plugins. We implement plugins for 12 foundation models including GPT, CLIP, and SAM. We evaluate Vieira on 9 challenging tasks that span language, vision, and structured and vector databases. Our evaluation shows that programs in Vieira are concise, can incorporate modern foundation models, and have comparable or better accuracy than competitive baselines.</description>

      <title>Bel Esprit: Multi-Agent Framework for Building AI Model Pipelines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the demand for artificial intelligence (AI) grows to address complex real-world tasks, single models are often insufficient, requiring the integration of multiple models into pipelines. This paper introduces Bel Esprit, a conversational agent designed to construct AI model pipelines based on user-defined requirements. Bel Esprit employs a multi-agent framework where subagents collaborate to clarify requirements, build, validate, and populate pipelines with appropriate models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework in generating pipelines from ambiguous user queries, using both human-curated and synthetic data. A detailed error analysis highlights ongoing challenges in pipeline construction. Bel Esprit is available for a free trial at https://belesprit.aixplain.com.</description>

      <title>Creation of AI-driven Smart Spaces for Enhanced Indoor Environments -- A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Smart spaces are ubiquitous computing environments that integrate diverse sensing and communication technologies to enhance space functionality, optimize energy utilization, and improve user comfort and well-being. The integration of emerging AI methodologies into these environments facilitates the formation of AI-driven smart spaces, which further enhance functionalities of the spaces by enabling advanced applications such as personalized comfort settings, interactive living spaces, and automatization of the space systems, all resulting in enhanced indoor experiences of the users. In this paper, we present a systematic survey of existing research on the foundational components of AI-driven smart spaces, including sensor technologies, data communication protocols, sensor network management and maintenance strategies, as well as the data collection, processing and analytics. Given the pivotal role of AI in establishing AI-powered smart spaces, we explore the opportunities and challenges associated with traditional machine learning (ML) approaches, such as deep learning (DL), and emerging methodologies including large language models (LLMs). Finally, we provide key insights necessary for the development of AI-driven smart spaces, propose future research directions, and sheds light on the path forward.</description>

      <title>LTLf Synthesis Under Unreliable Input</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of realizing strategies for an LTLf goal specification while ensuring that at least an LTLf backup specification is satisfied in case of unreliability of certain input variables. We formally define the problem and characterize its worst-case complexity as 2EXPTIME-complete, like standard LTLf synthesis. Then we devise three different solution techniques: one based on direct automata manipulation, which is 2EXPTIME, one disregarding unreliable input variables by adopting a belief construction, which is 3EXPTIME, and one leveraging second-order quantified LTLf (QLTLf), which is 2EXPTIME and allows for a direct encoding into monadic second-order logic, which in turn is worst-case nonelementary. We prove their correctness and evaluate them against each other empirically. Interestingly, theoretical worst-case bounds do not translate into observed performance; the MSO technique performs best, followed by belief construction and direct automata manipulation. As a byproduct of our study, we provide a general synthesis procedure for arbitrary QLTLf specifications.</description>

      <title>Answer Set Networks: Casting Answer Set Programming into Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although Answer Set Programming (ASP) allows constraining neural-symbolic (NeSy) systems, its employment is hindered by the prohibitive costs of computing stable models and the CPU-bound nature of state-of-the-art solvers. To this end, we propose Answer Set Networks (ASN), a NeSy solver. Based on Graph Neural Networks (GNN), ASNs are a scalable approach to ASP-based Deep Probabilistic Logic Programming (DPPL). Specifically, we show how to translate ASPs into ASNs and demonstrate how ASNs can efficiently solve the encoded problem by leveraging GPU's batching and parallelization capabilities. Our experimental evaluations demonstrate that ASNs outperform state-of-the-art CPU-bound NeSy systems on multiple tasks. Simultaneously, we make the following two contributions based on the strengths of ASNs. Namely, we are the first to show the finetuning of Large Language Models (LLM) with DPPLs, employing ASNs to guide the training with logic. Further, we show the "constitutional navigation" of drones, i.e., encoding public aviation laws in an ASN for routing Unmanned Aerial Vehicles in uncertain environments.</description>

      <title>Generalizing Constraint Models in Constraint Acquisition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Constraint Acquisition (CA) aims to widen the use of constraint programming by assisting users in the modeling process. However, most CA methods suffer from a significant drawback: they learn a single set of individual constraints for a specific problem instance, but cannot generalize these constraints to the parameterized constraint specifications of the problem. In this paper, we address this limitation by proposing GenCon, a novel approach to learn parameterized constraint models capable of modeling varying instances of the same problem. To achieve this generalization, we make use of statistical learning techniques at the level of individual constraints. Specifically, we propose to train a classifier to predict, for any possible constraint and parameterization, whether the constraint belongs to the problem. We then show how, for some classes of classifiers, we can extract decision rules to construct interpretable constraint specifications. This enables the generation of ground constraints for any parameter instantiation. Additionally, we present a generate-and-test approach that can be used with any classifier, to generate the ground constraints on the fly. Our empirical results demonstrate that our approach achieves high accuracy and is robust to noise in the input instances.</description>

      <title>Towards Friendly AI: A Comprehensive Review and New Perspectives on Human-AI Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As Artificial Intelligence (AI) continues to advance rapidly, Friendly AI (FAI) has been proposed to advocate for more equitable and fair development of AI. Despite its importance, there is a lack of comprehensive reviews examining FAI from an ethical perspective, as well as limited discussion on its potential applications and future directions. This paper addresses these gaps by providing a thorough review of FAI, focusing on theoretical perspectives both for and against its development, and presenting a formal definition in a clear and accessible format. Key applications are discussed from the perspectives of eXplainable AI (XAI), privacy, fairness and affective computing (AC). Additionally, the paper identifies challenges in current technological advancements and explores future research avenues. The findings emphasise the significance of developing FAI and advocate for its continued advancement to ensure ethical and beneficial AI development.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Strategy Logic with Degrees of Observability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There has been considerable work on reasoning about the strategic ability of agents under imperfect information. However, existing logics such as Probabilistic Strategy Logic are unable to express properties relating to information transparency. Information transparency concerns the extent to which agents' actions and behaviours are observable by other agents. Reasoning about information transparency is useful in many domains including security, privacy, and decision-making. In this paper, we present a formal framework for reasoning about information transparency properties in stochastic multi-agent systems. We extend Probabilistic Strategy Logic with new observability operators that capture the degree of observability of temporal properties by agents. We show that the model checking problem for the resulting logic is decidable.</description>

      <title>Critical-Questions-of-Thought: Steering LLM reasoning with Argumentative Querying</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studies have underscored how, regardless of the recent breakthrough and swift advances in AI research, even state-of-the-art Large Language models (LLMs) continue to struggle when performing logical and mathematical reasoning. The results seem to suggest that LLMs still work as (highly advanced) data pattern identifiers, scoring poorly when attempting to generalise and solve reasoning problems the models have never previously seen or that are not close to samples presented in their training data. To address this compelling concern, this paper makes use of the notion of critical questions from the literature on argumentation theory, focusing in particular on Toulmin's model of argumentation. We show that employing these critical questions can improve the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. By probing the rationale behind the models' reasoning process, the LLM can assess whether some logical mistake is occurring and correct it before providing the final reply to the user prompt. The underlying idea is drawn from the gold standard of any valid argumentative procedure: the conclusion is valid if it is entailed by accepted premises. Or, to paraphrase such Aristotelian principle in a real-world approximation, characterised by incomplete information and presumptive logic, the conclusion is valid if not proved otherwise. This approach successfully steers the models' output through a reasoning pipeline, resulting in better performance against the baseline and its Chain-of-Thought (CoT) implementation. To this end, an extensive evaluation of the proposed approach on the MT-Bench Reasoning and Math tasks across a range of LLMs is provided.</description>

      <title>Goal Space Abstraction in Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning via Set-Based Reachability Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.07675v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Open-ended learning benefits immensely from the use of symbolic methods for goal representation as they offer ways to structure knowledge for efficient and transferable learning. However, the existing Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) approaches relying on symbolic reasoning are often limited as they require a manual goal representation. The challenge in autonomously discovering a symbolic goal representation is that it must preserve critical information, such as the environment dynamics. In this paper, we propose a developmental mechanism for goal discovery via an emergent representation that abstracts (i.e., groups together) sets of environment states that have similar roles in the task. We introduce a Feudal HRL algorithm that concurrently learns both the goal representation and a hierarchical policy. The algorithm uses symbolic reachability analysis for neural networks to approximate the transition relation among sets of states and to refine the goal representation. We evaluate our approach on complex navigation tasks, showing the learned representation is interpretable, transferrable and results in data efficient learning.</description>

      <title>A Medical Low-Back Pain Physical Rehabilitation Dataset for Human Body Movement Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While automatic monitoring and coaching of exercises are showing encouraging results in non-medical applications, they still have limitations such as errors and limited use contexts. To allow the development and assessment of physical rehabilitation by an intelligent tutoring system, we identify in this article four challenges to address and propose a medical dataset of clinical patients carrying out low back-pain rehabilitation exercises. The dataset includes 3D Kinect skeleton positions and orientations, RGB videos, 2D skeleton data, and medical annotations to assess the correctness, and error classification and localisation of body part and timespan. Along this dataset, we perform a complete research path, from data collection to processing, and finally a small benchmark. We evaluated on the dataset two baseline movement recognition algorithms, pertaining to two different approaches: the probabilistic approach with a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), and the deep learning approach with a Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM).
  This dataset is valuable because it includes rehabilitation relevant motions in a clinical setting with patients in their rehabilitation program, using a cost-effective, portable, and convenient sensor, and because it shows the potential for improvement on these challenges.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Harmonized Tariff Schedule Classification Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Harmonized Tariff System (HTS) classification industry, essential to e-commerce and international trade, currently lacks standardized benchmarks for evaluating the effectiveness of classification solutions. This study establishes and tests a benchmark framework for imports to the United States, inspired by the benchmarking approaches used in language model evaluation, to systematically compare prominent HTS classification tools. The framework assesses key metrics--such as speed, accuracy, rationality, and HTS code alignment--to provide a comprehensive performance comparison. The study evaluates several industry-leading solutions, including those provided by Zonos, Tarifflo, Avalara, and WCO BACUDA, identifying each tool's strengths and limitations. Results highlight areas for industry-wide improvement and innovation, paving the way for more effective and standardized HTS classification solutions across the international trade and e-commerce sectors.</description>

      <title>Towards AI-$45^{\circ}$ Law: A Roadmap to Trustworthy AGI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ensuring Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) reliably avoids harmful behaviors is a critical challenge, especially for systems with high autonomy or in safety-critical domains. Despite various safety assurance proposals and extreme risk warnings, comprehensive guidelines balancing AI safety and capability remain lacking. In this position paper, we propose the \textit{AI-\textbf{$45^{\circ}$} Law} as a guiding principle for a balanced roadmap toward trustworthy AGI, and introduce the \textit{Causal Ladder of Trustworthy AGI} as a practical framework. This framework provides a systematic taxonomy and hierarchical structure for current AI capability and safety research, inspired by Judea Pearl's ``Ladder of Causation''. The Causal Ladder comprises three core layers: the Approximate Alignment Layer, the Intervenable Layer, and the Reflectable Layer. These layers address the key challenges of safety and trustworthiness in AGI and contemporary AI systems. Building upon this framework, we define five levels of trustworthy AGI: perception, reasoning, decision-making, autonomy, and collaboration trustworthiness. These levels represent distinct yet progressive aspects of trustworthy AGI. Finally, we present a series of potential governance measures to support the development of trustworthy AGI.\footnote{In this paper, trustworthiness is generally considered a broad form of safety, and no explicit distinction is made between the two. However, in some contexts, safety and trustworthiness are treated as distinct: safety involves assurance of correct behavior, while trustworthiness refers to user confidence in the system's decision-making. In such cases, different terms or both may be used depending on the context.</description>

      <title>CogSimulator: A Model for Simulating User Cognition &amp; Behavior with Minimal Data for Tailored Cognitive Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interplay between cognition and gaming, notably through educational games enhancing cognitive skills, has garnered significant attention in recent years. This research introduces the CogSimulator, a novel algorithm for simulating user cognition in small-group settings with minimal data, as the educational game Wordle exemplifies. The CogSimulator employs Wasserstein-1 distance and coordinates search optimization for hyperparameter tuning, enabling precise few-shot predictions in new game scenarios. Comparative experiments with the Wordle dataset illustrate that our model surpasses most conventional machine learning models in mean Wasserstein-1 distance, mean squared error, and mean accuracy, showcasing its efficacy in cognitive enhancement through tailored game design.</description>

      <title>Lessons From an App Update at Replika AI: Identity Discontinuity in Human-AI Relationships</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Can consumers form especially deep emotional bonds with AI and be vested in AI identities over time? We leverage a natural app-update event at Replika AI, a popular US-based AI companion, to shed light on these questions. We find that, after the app removed its erotic role play (ERP) feature, preventing intimate interactions between consumers and chatbots that were previously possible, this event triggered perceptions in customers that their AI companion's identity had discontinued. This in turn predicted negative consumer welfare and marketing outcomes related to loss, including mourning the loss, and devaluing the "new" AI relative to the "original". Experimental evidence confirms these findings. Further experiments find that AI companions users feel closer to their AI companion than even their best human friend, and mourn a loss of their AI companion more than a loss of various other inanimate products. In short, consumers are forming human-level relationships with AI companions; disruptions to these relationships trigger real patterns of mourning as well as devaluation of the offering; and the degree of mourning and devaluation are explained by perceived discontinuity in the AIs identity. Our results illustrate that relationships with AI are truly personal, creating unique benefits and risks for consumers and firms alike.</description>

      <title>Ontology-Aware RAG for Improved Question-Answering in Cybersecurity Education</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrating AI into education has the potential to transform the teaching of science and technology courses, particularly in the field of cybersecurity. AI-driven question-answering (QA) systems can actively manage uncertainty in cybersecurity problem-solving, offering interactive, inquiry-based learning experiences. Large language models (LLMs) have gained prominence in AI-driven QA systems, offering advanced language understanding and user engagement. However, they face challenges like hallucinations and limited domain-specific knowledge, which reduce their reliability in educational settings. To address these challenges, we propose CyberRAG, an ontology-aware retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) approach for developing a reliable and safe QA system in cybersecurity education. CyberRAG employs a two-step approach: first, it augments the domain-specific knowledge by retrieving validated cybersecurity documents from a knowledge base to enhance the relevance and accuracy of the response. Second, it mitigates hallucinations and misuse by integrating a knowledge graph ontology to validate the final answer. Experiments on publicly available cybersecurity datasets show that CyberRAG delivers accurate, reliable responses aligned with domain knowledge, demonstrating the potential of AI tools to enhance education.</description>

      <title>Whom do Explanations Serve? A Systematic Literature Survey of User Characteristics in Explainable Recommender Systems Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adding explanations to recommender systems is said to have multiple benefits, such as increasing user trust or system transparency. Previous work from other application areas suggests that specific user characteristics impact the users' perception of the explanation. However, we rarely find this type of evaluation for recommender systems explanations. This paper addresses this gap by surveying 124 papers in which recommender systems explanations were evaluated in user studies. We analyzed their participant descriptions and study results where the impact of user characteristics on the explanation effects was measured. Our findings suggest that the results from the surveyed studies predominantly cover specific users who do not necessarily represent the users of recommender systems in the evaluation domain. This may seriously hamper the generalizability of any insights we may gain from current studies on explanations in recommender systems. We further find inconsistencies in the data reporting, which impacts the reproducibility of the reported results. Hence, we recommend actions to move toward a more inclusive and reproducible evaluation.</description>

      <title>Detecting Cognitive Impairment and Psychological Well-being among Older Adults Using Facial, Acoustic, Linguistic, and Cardiovascular Patterns Derived from Remote Conversations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: INTRODUCTION: The aging society urgently requires scalable methods to monitor cognitive decline and identify social and psychological factors indicative of dementia risk in older adults. METHODS: Our machine learning models captured facial, acoustic, linguistic, and cardiovascular features from 39 individuals with normal cognition or Mild Cognitive Impairment derived from remote video conversations and classified cognitive status, social isolation, neuroticism, and psychological well-being. RESULTS: Our model could distinguish Clinical Dementia Rating Scale of 0.5 (vs. 0) with 0.78 area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), social isolation with 0.75 AUC, neuroticism with 0.71 AUC, and negative affect scales with 0.79 AUC. DISCUSSION: Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of remotely monitoring cognitive status, social isolation, neuroticism, and psychological well-being. Speech and language patterns were more useful for quantifying cognitive impairment, whereas facial expression and cardiovascular patterns using remote photoplethysmography were more useful for quantifying personality and psychological well-being.</description>

      <title>BlenderLLM: Training Large Language Models for Computer-Aided Design with Self-improvement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in Computer-Aided Design (CAD) remains an underexplored area, despite their remarkable advancements in other domains. In this paper, we present BlenderLLM, a novel framework for training LLMs specifically for CAD tasks leveraging a self-improvement methodology. To support this, we developed a bespoke training dataset, BlendNet, and introduced a comprehensive evaluation suite, CADBench. Our results reveal that existing models demonstrate significant limitations in generating accurate CAD scripts. However, through minimal instruction-based fine-tuning and iterative self-improvement, BlenderLLM significantly surpasses these models in both functionality and accuracy of CAD script generation. This research establishes a strong foundation for the application of LLMs in CAD while demonstrating the transformative potential of self-improving models in advancing CAD automation. We encourage further exploration and adoption of these methodologies to drive innovation in the field. The dataset, model, benchmark, and source code are publicly available at https://github.com/FreedomIntelligence/BlenderLLM</description>

      <title>Large-scale Group Brainstorming using Conversational Swarm Intelligence (CSI) versus Traditional Chat</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conversational Swarm Intelligence (CSI) is an AI-facilitated method for enabling real-time conversational deliberations and prioritizations among networked human groups of potentially unlimited size. Based on the biological principle of Swarm Intelligence and modelled on the decision-making dynamics of fish schools, CSI has been shown in prior studies to amplify group intelligence, increase group participation, and facilitate productive collaboration among hundreds of participants at once. It works by dividing a large population into a set of small subgroups that are woven together by real-time AI agents called Conversational Surrogates. The present study focuses on the use of a CSI platform called Thinkscape to enable real-time brainstorming and prioritization among groups of 75 networked users. The study employed a variant of a common brainstorming intervention called an Alternative Use Task (AUT) and was designed to compare through subjective feedback, the experience of participants brainstorming using a CSI structure vs brainstorming in a single large chat room. This comparison revealed that participants significantly preferred brainstorming with the CSI structure and reported that it felt (i) more collaborative, (ii) more productive, and (iii) was better at surfacing quality answers. In addition, participants using the CSI structure reported (iv) feeling more ownership and more buy-in in the final answers the group converged on and (v) reported feeling more heard as compared to brainstorming in a traditional text chat environment. Overall, the results suggest that CSI is a very promising AI-facilitated method for brainstorming and prioritization among large-scale, networked human groups.</description>

      <title>Integrating Evidence into the Design of XAI and AI-based Decision Support Systems: A Means-End Framework for End-users in Construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A narrative review is used to develop a theoretical evidence-based means-end framework to build an epistemic foundation to uphold explainable artificial intelligence instruments so that the reliability of outcomes generated from decision support systems can be assured and better explained to end-users. The implications of adopting an evidence-based approach to designing decision support systems in construction are discussed with emphasis placed on evaluating the strength, value, and utility of evidence needed to develop meaningful human explanations for end-users. While the developed means-end framework is focused on end-users, stakeholders can also utilize it to create meaningful human explanations. However, they will vary due to their different epistemic goals. Including evidence in the design and development of explainable artificial intelligence and decision support systems will improve decision-making effectiveness, enabling end-users' epistemic goals to be achieved. The proposed means-end framework is developed from a broad spectrum of literature. Thus, it is suggested that it can be used in construction and other engineering domains where there is a need to integrate evidence into the design of explainable artificial intelligence and decision support systems.</description>

Abstract: The exceptional capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have substantially accelerated the rapid rise and widespread adoption of agents. Recent studies have demonstrated that generating Python code to consolidate LLM-based agents' actions into a unified action space (CodeAct) is a promising approach for developing real-world LLM agents. However, this step-by-step code generation approach often lacks consistency and robustness, leading to instability in agent applications, particularly for complex reasoning and out-of-domain tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called Tree-of-Code (ToC) to tackle the challenges of complex problem planning and execution with an end-to-end mechanism. By integrating key ideas from both Tree-of-Thought and CodeAct, ToC combines their strengths to enhance solution exploration. In our framework, each final code execution result is treated as a node in the decision tree, with a breadth-first search strategy employed to explore potential solutions. The final outcome is determined through a voting mechanism based on the outputs of the nodes.</description>

      <title>GraphicsDreamer: Image to 3D Generation with Physical Consistency</title>

Abstract: Recently, the surge of efficient and automated 3D AI-generated content (AIGC) methods has increasingly illuminated the path of transforming human imagination into complex 3D structures. However, the automated generation of 3D content is still significantly lags in industrial application. This gap exists because 3D modeling demands high-quality assets with sharp geometry, exquisite topology, and physically based rendering (PBR), among other criteria. To narrow the disparity between generated results and artists' expectations, we introduce GraphicsDreamer, a method for creating highly usable 3D meshes from single images. To better capture the geometry and material details, we integrate the PBR lighting equation into our cross-domain diffusion model, concurrently predicting multi-view color, normal, depth images, and PBR materials. In the geometry fusion stage, we continue to enforce the PBR constraints, ensuring that the generated 3D objects possess reliable texture details, supporting realistic relighting. Furthermore, our method incorporates topology optimization and fast UV unwrapping capabilities, allowing the 3D products to be seamlessly imported into graphics engines. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model can produce high quality 3D assets in a reasonable time cost compared to previous methods.</description>

      <title>Generative AI Toolkit -- a framework for increasing the quality of LLM-based applications over their whole life cycle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As LLM-based applications reach millions of customers, ensuring their scalability and continuous quality improvement is critical for success. However, the current workflows for developing, maintaining, and operating (DevOps) these applications are predominantly manual, slow, and based on trial-and-error. With this paper we introduce the Generative AI Toolkit, which automates essential workflows over the whole life cycle of LLM-based applications. The toolkit helps to configure, test, continuously monitor and optimize Generative AI applications such as agents, thus significantly improving quality while shortening release cycles. We showcase the effectiveness of our toolkit on representative use cases, share best practices, and outline future enhancements. Since we are convinced that our Generative AI Toolkit is helpful for other teams, we are open sourcing it on and hope that others will use, forward, adapt and improve</description>

      <title>Heterogeneous Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Distributed Channel Access in WLANs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the use of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to address distributed channel access in wireless local area networks. In particular, we consider the challenging yet more practical case where the agents heterogeneously adopt value-based or policy-based reinforcement learning algorithms to train the model. We propose a heterogeneous MARL training framework, named QPMIX, which adopts a centralized training with distributed execution paradigm to enable heterogeneous agents to collaborate. Moreover, we theoretically prove the convergence of the proposed heterogeneous MARL method when using the linear value function approximation. Our method maximizes the network throughput and ensures fairness among stations, therefore, enhancing the overall network performance. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed QPMIX algorithm improves throughput, mean delay, delay jitter, and collision rates compared with conventional carrier-sense multiple access with collision avoidance in the saturated traffic scenario. Furthermore, the QPMIX is shown to be robust in unsaturated and delay-sensitive traffic scenarios, and promotes cooperation among heterogeneous agents.</description>

      <title>A Survey on Inference Optimization Techniques for Mixture of Experts Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emergence of large-scale Mixture of Experts (MoE) models has marked a significant advancement in artificial intelligence, offering enhanced model capacity and computational efficiency through conditional computation. However, the deployment and inference of these models present substantial challenges in terms of computational resources, latency, and energy efficiency. This comprehensive survey systematically analyzes the current landscape of inference optimization techniques for MoE models across the entire system stack. We first establish a taxonomical framework that categorizes optimization approaches into model-level, system-level, and hardware-level optimizations. At the model level, we examine architectural innovations including efficient expert design, attention mechanisms, various compression techniques such as pruning, quantization, and knowledge distillation, as well as algorithm improvement including dynamic routing strategies and expert merging methods. At the system level, we investigate distributed computing approaches, load balancing mechanisms, and efficient scheduling algorithms that enable scalable deployment. Furthermore, we delve into hardware-specific optimizations and co-design strategies that maximize throughput and energy efficiency. This survey not only provides a structured overview of existing solutions but also identifies key challenges and promising research directions in MoE inference optimization. Our comprehensive analysis serves as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners working on large-scale deployment of MoE models in resource-constrained environments. To facilitate ongoing updates and the sharing of cutting-edge advances in MoE inference optimization research, we have established a repository accessible at \url{https://github.com/MoE-Inf/awesome-moe-inference/}.</description>

      <title>Syzygy: Dual Code-Test C to (safe) Rust Translation using LLMs and Dynamic Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite extensive usage in high-performance, low-level systems programming applications, C is susceptible to vulnerabilities due to manual memory management and unsafe pointer operations. Rust, a modern systems programming language, offers a compelling alternative. Its unique ownership model and type system ensure memory safety without sacrificing performance.
  In this paper, we present Syzygy, an automated approach to translate C to safe Rust. Our technique uses a synergistic combination of LLM-driven code and test translation guided by dynamic-analysis-generated execution information. This paired translation runs incrementally in a loop over the program in dependency order of the code elements while maintaining per-step correctness. Our approach exposes novel insights on combining the strengths of LLMs and dynamic analysis in the context of scaling and combining code generation with testing. We apply our approach to successfully translate Zopfli, a high-performance compression library with ~3000 lines of code and 98 functions. We validate the translation by testing equivalence with the source C program on a set of inputs. To our knowledge, this is the largest automated and test-validated C to safe Rust code translation achieved so far.</description>

      <title>Split Learning in Computer Vision for Semantic Segmentation Delay Minimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel approach to minimize the inference delay in semantic segmentation using split learning (SL), tailored to the needs of real-time computer vision (CV) applications for resource-constrained devices. Semantic segmentation is essential for applications such as autonomous vehicles and smart city infrastructure, but faces significant latency challenges due to high computational and communication loads. Traditional centralized processing methods are inefficient for such scenarios, often resulting in unacceptable inference delays. SL offers a promising alternative by partitioning deep neural networks (DNNs) between edge devices and a central server, enabling localized data processing and reducing the amount of data required for transmission. Our contribution includes the joint optimization of bandwidth allocation, cut layer selection of the edge devices' DNN, and the central server's processing resource allocation. We investigate both parallel and serial data processing scenarios and propose low-complexity heuristic solutions that maintain near-optimal performance while reducing computational requirements. Numerical results show that our approach effectively reduces inference delay, demonstrating the potential of SL for improving real-time CV applications in dynamic, resource-constrained environments.</description>

      <title>Fake News Detection: Comparative Evaluation of BERT-like Models and Large Language Models with Generative AI-Annotated Data</title>

Abstract: Fake news poses a significant threat to public opinion and social stability in modern society. This study presents a comparative evaluation of BERT-like encoder-only models and autoregressive decoder-only large language models (LLMs) for fake news detection. We introduce a dataset of news articles labeled with GPT-4 assistance (an AI-labeling method) and verified by human experts to ensure reliability. Both BERT-like encoder-only models and LLMs were fine-tuned on this dataset. Additionally, we developed an instruction-tuned LLM approach with majority voting during inference for label generation. Our analysis reveals that BERT-like models generally outperform LLMs in classification tasks, while LLMs demonstrate superior robustness against text perturbations. Compared to weak labels (distant supervision) data, the results show that AI labels with human supervision achieve better classification results. This study highlights the effectiveness of combining AI-based annotation with human oversight and demonstrates the performance of different families of machine learning models for fake news detection</description>

      <title>PixelMan: Consistent Object Editing with Diffusion Models via Pixel Manipulation and Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent research explores the potential of Diffusion Models (DMs) for consistent object editing, which aims to modify object position, size, and composition, etc., while preserving the consistency of objects and background without changing their texture and attributes. Current inference-time methods often rely on DDIM inversion, which inherently compromises efficiency and the achievable consistency of edited images. Recent methods also utilize energy guidance which iteratively updates the predicted noise and can drive the latents away from the original image, resulting in distortions. In this paper, we propose PixelMan, an inversion-free and training-free method for achieving consistent object editing via Pixel Manipulation and generation, where we directly create a duplicate copy of the source object at target location in the pixel space, and introduce an efficient sampling approach to iteratively harmonize the manipulated object into the target location and inpaint its original location, while ensuring image consistency by anchoring the edited image to be generated to the pixel-manipulated image as well as by introducing various consistency-preserving optimization techniques during inference. Experimental evaluations based on benchmark datasets as well as extensive visual comparisons show that in as few as 16 inference steps, PixelMan outperforms a range of state-of-the-art training-based and training-free methods (usually requiring 50 steps) on multiple consistent object editing tasks.</description>

      <title>Temporally Consistent Object-Centric Learning by Contrasting Slots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unsupervised object-centric learning from videos is a promising approach to extract structured representations from large, unlabeled collections of videos. To support downstream tasks like autonomous control, these representations must be both compositional and temporally consistent. Existing approaches based on recurrent processing often lack long-term stability across frames because their training objective does not enforce temporal consistency. In this work, we introduce a novel object-level temporal contrastive loss for video object-centric models that explicitly promotes temporal consistency. Our method significantly improves the temporal consistency of the learned object-centric representations, yielding more reliable video decompositions that facilitate challenging downstream tasks such as unsupervised object dynamics prediction. Furthermore, the inductive bias added by our loss strongly improves object discovery, leading to state-of-the-art results on both synthetic and real-world datasets, outperforming even weakly-supervised methods that leverage motion masks as additional cues.</description>

      <title>SAFERec: Self-Attention and Frequency Enriched Model for Next Basket Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transformer-based approaches such as BERT4Rec and SASRec demonstrate strong performance in Next Item Recommendation (NIR) tasks. However, applying these architectures to Next-Basket Recommendation (NBR) tasks, which often involve highly repetitive interactions, is challenging due to the vast number of possible item combinations in a basket. Moreover, frequency-based methods such as TIFU-KNN and UP-CF still demonstrate strong performance in NBR tasks, frequently outperforming deep-learning approaches. This paper introduces SAFERec, a novel algorithm for NBR that enhances transformer-based architectures from NIR by incorporating item frequency information, consequently improving their applicability to NBR tasks. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets show that SAFERec outperforms all other baselines, specifically achieving an 8\% improvement in Recall@10.</description>

      <title>Multi-OphthaLingua: A Multilingual Benchmark for Assessing and Debiasing LLM Ophthalmological QA in LMICs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current ophthalmology clinical workflows are plagued by over-referrals, long waits, and complex and heterogeneous medical records. Large language models (LLMs) present a promising solution to automate various procedures such as triaging, preliminary tests like visual acuity assessment, and report summaries. However, LLMs have demonstrated significantly varied performance across different languages in natural language question-answering tasks, potentially exacerbating healthcare disparities in Low and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs). This study introduces the first multilingual ophthalmological question-answering benchmark with manually curated questions parallel across languages, allowing for direct cross-lingual comparisons. Our evaluation of 6 popular LLMs across 7 different languages reveals substantial bias across different languages, highlighting risks for clinical deployment of LLMs in LMICs. Existing debiasing methods such as Translation Chain-of-Thought or Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) by themselves fall short of closing this performance gap, often failing to improve performance across all languages and lacking specificity for the medical domain. To address this issue, We propose CLARA (Cross-Lingual Reflective Agentic system), a novel inference time de-biasing method leveraging retrieval augmented generation and self-verification. Our approach not only improves performance across all languages but also significantly reduces the multilingual bias gap, facilitating equitable LLM application across the globe.</description>

Abstract: Translating between languages with drastically different grammatical conventions poses challenges, not just for human interpreters but also for machine translation systems. In this work, we specifically target the translation challenges posed by attributive nouns in Chinese, which frequently cause ambiguities in English translation. By manually inserting the omitted particle X ('DE'). In news article titles from the Penn Chinese Discourse Treebank, we developed a targeted dataset to fine-tune Hugging Face Chinese to English translation models, specifically improving how this critical function word is handled. This focused approach not only complements the broader strategies suggested by previous studies but also offers a practical enhancement by specifically addressing a common error type in Chinese-English translation.</description>

      <title>Embedding Cultural Diversity in Prototype-based Recommender Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Popularity bias in recommender systems can increase cultural overrepresentation by favoring norms from dominant cultures and marginalizing underrepresented groups. This issue is critical for platforms offering cultural products, as they influence consumption patterns and human perceptions. In this work, we address popularity bias by identifying demographic biases within prototype-based matrix factorization methods. Using the country of origin as a proxy for cultural identity, we link this demographic attribute to popularity bias by refining the embedding space learning process. First, we propose filtering out irrelevant prototypes to improve representativity. Second, we introduce a regularization technique to enforce a uniform distribution of prototypes within the embedding space. Across four datasets, our results demonstrate a 27\% reduction in the average rank of long-tail items and a 2\% reduction in the average rank of items from underrepresented countries. Additionally, our model achieves a 2\% improvement in HitRatio@10 compared to the state-of-the-art, highlighting that fairness is enhanced without compromising recommendation quality. Moreover, the distribution of prototypes leads to more inclusive explanations by better aligning items with diverse prototypes.</description>

      <title>A Unifying Information-theoretic Perspective on Evaluating Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Considering the difficulty of interpreting generative model output, there is significant current research focused on determining meaningful evaluation metrics. Several recent approaches utilize "precision" and "recall," borrowed from the classification domain, to individually quantify the output fidelity (realism) and output diversity (representation of the real data variation), respectively. With the increase in metric proposals, there is a need for a unifying perspective, allowing for easier comparison and clearer explanation of their benefits and drawbacks. To this end, we unify a class of kth-nearest-neighbors (kNN)-based metrics under an information-theoretic lens using approaches from kNN density estimation. Additionally, we propose a tri-dimensional metric composed of Precision Cross-Entropy (PCE), Recall Cross-Entropy (RCE), and Recall Entropy (RE), which separately measure fidelity and two distinct aspects of diversity, inter- and intra-class. Our domain-agnostic metric, derived from the information-theoretic concepts of entropy and cross-entropy, can be dissected for both sample- and mode-level analysis. Our detailed experimental results demonstrate the sensitivity of our metric components to their respective qualities and reveal undesirable behaviors of other metrics.</description>

      <title>Is Peer-Reviewing Worth the Effort?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14351v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How effective is peer-reviewing in identifying important papers? We treat this question as a forecasting task. Can we predict which papers will be highly cited in the future based on venue and "early returns" (citations soon after publication)? We show early returns are more predictive than venue. Finally, we end with constructive suggestions to address scaling challenges: (a) too many submissions and (b) too few qualified reviewers.</description>

      <title>Enabling Realtime Reinforcement Learning at Scale with Staggered Asynchronous Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Realtime environments change even as agents perform action inference and learning, thus requiring high interaction frequencies to effectively minimize regret. However, recent advances in machine learning involve larger neural networks with longer inference times, raising questions about their applicability in realtime systems where reaction time is crucial. We present an analysis of lower bounds on regret in realtime reinforcement learning (RL) environments to show that minimizing long-term regret is generally impossible within the typical sequential interaction and learning paradigm, but often becomes possible when sufficient asynchronous compute is available. We propose novel algorithms for staggering asynchronous inference processes to ensure that actions are taken at consistent time intervals, and demonstrate that use of models with high action inference times is only constrained by the environment's effective stochasticity over the inference horizon, and not by action frequency. Our analysis shows that the number of inference processes needed scales linearly with increasing inference times while enabling use of models that are multiple orders of magnitude larger than existing approaches when learning from a realtime simulation of Game Boy games such as Pok\'emon and Tetris.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in generative AI make it convenient to create different types of content, including text, images, and code. In this paper, we explore the generation of images in the style of paintings in the surrealism movement using vision-language generative models, including DALL-E, Deep Dream Generator, and DreamStudio. Our investigation starts with the generation of images under various image generation settings and different models. The primary objective is to identify the most suitable model and settings for producing such images. Additionally, we aim to understand the impact of using edited base images on the generated resulting images. Through these experiments, we evaluate the performance of selected models and gain valuable insights into their capabilities in generating such images. Our analysis shows that Dall-E 2 performs the best when using the generated prompt by ChatGPT.</description>

      <title>I0T: Embedding Standardization Method Towards Zero Modality Gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) enables zero-shot inference in downstream tasks such as image-text retrieval and classification. However, recent works extending CLIP suffer from the issue of modality gap, which arises when the image and text embeddings are projected to disparate manifolds, deviating from the intended objective of image-text contrastive learning. We discover that this phenomenon is linked to the modality-specific characteristic that each image/text encoder independently possesses and propose two methods to address the modality gap: (1) a post-hoc embedding standardization method, $\text{I0T}_{\text{post}}$ that reduces the modality gap approximately to zero and (2) a trainable method, $\text{I0T}_{\text{async}}$, to alleviate the modality gap problem by adding two normalization layers for each encoder. Our I0T framework can significantly reduce the modality gap while preserving the original embedding representations of trained models with their locked parameters. In practice, $\text{I0T}_{\text{post}}$ can serve as an alternative explainable automatic evaluation metric of widely used CLIPScore (CLIP-S).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present DriveGPT, a scalable behavior model for autonomous driving. We model driving as a sequential decision making task, and learn a transformer model to predict future agent states as tokens in an autoregressive fashion. We scale up our model parameters and training data by multiple orders of magnitude, enabling us to explore the scaling properties in terms of dataset size, model parameters, and compute. We evaluate DriveGPT across different scales in a planning task, through both quantitative metrics and qualitative examples including closed-loop driving in complex real-world scenarios. In a separate prediction task, DriveGPT outperforms a state-of-the-art baseline and exhibits improved performance by pretraining on a large-scale dataset, further validating the benefits of data scaling.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Diffusion Models for High-Quality Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This report presents the comprehensive implementation, evaluation, and optimization of Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) and Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIMs), which are state-of-the-art generative models. During inference, these models take random noise as input and iteratively generate high-quality images as output. The study focuses on enhancing their generative capabilities by incorporating advanced techniques such as Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG), Latent Diffusion Models with Variational Autoencoders (VAE), and alternative noise scheduling strategies. The motivation behind this work is the growing demand for efficient and scalable generative AI models that can produce realistic images across diverse datasets, addressing challenges in applications such as art creation, image synthesis, and data augmentation. Evaluations were conducted on datasets including CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-100, with a focus on improving inference speed, computational efficiency, and image quality metrics like Frechet Inception Distance (FID). Results demonstrate that DDIM + CFG achieves faster inference and superior image quality. Challenges with VAE and noise scheduling are also highlighted, suggesting opportunities for future optimization. This work lays the groundwork for developing scalable, efficient, and high-quality generative AI systems to benefit industries ranging from entertainment to robotics.</description>

      <title>FedPIA -- Permuting and Integrating Adapters leveraging Wasserstein Barycenters for Finetuning Foundation Models in Multi-Modal Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models typically require large text and image datasets for effective fine-tuning. However, collecting data from various sites, especially in healthcare, is challenging due to strict privacy regulations. An alternative is to fine-tune these models on end-user devices, such as in medical clinics, without sending data to a server. These local clients typically have limited computing power and small datasets, which are not enough for fully fine-tuning large VLMs on their own. A naive solution to these scenarios is to leverage parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) strategies and apply federated learning (FL) algorithms to combine the learned adapter weights, thereby respecting the resource limitations and data privacy. However, this approach does not fully leverage the knowledge from multiple adapters trained on diverse data distributions and for diverse tasks. The adapters are adversely impacted by data heterogeneity and task heterogeneity across clients resulting in suboptimal convergence. To this end, we propose a novel framework called FedPIA that improves upon the naive combinations of FL and PEFT by introducing Permutation and Integration of the local Adapters in the server and global Adapters in the clients exploiting Wasserstein barycenters for improved blending of client-specific and client-agnostic knowledge. This layerwise permutation helps to bridge the gap in the parameter space of local and global adapters before integration. We conduct over 2000 client-level experiments utilizing 48 medical image datasets across five different medical vision-language FL task settings encompassing visual question answering as well as image and report-based multi-label disease detection. Our experiments involving diverse client settings, ten different modalities, and two VLM backbones demonstrate that FedPIA consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art PEFT-FL baselines.</description>

      <title>All-in-One Tuning and Structural Pruning for Domain-Specific LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing pruning techniques for large language models (LLMs) targeting domain-specific applications typically follow a two-stage process: pruning the pretrained general-purpose LLMs and then fine-tuning the pruned LLMs on specific domains. However, the pruning decisions, derived from the pretrained weights, remain unchanged during fine-tuning, even if the weights have been updated. Therefore, such a combination of the pruning decisions and the finetuned weights may be suboptimal, leading to non-negligible performance degradation. To address these limitations, we propose ATP: All-in-One Tuning and Structural Pruning, a unified one-stage structural pruning and fine-tuning approach that dynamically identifies the current optimal substructure throughout the fine-tuning phase via a trainable pruning decision generator. Moreover, given the limited available data for domain-specific applications, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) becomes a common technique to fine-tune the LLMs. In ATP, we introduce LoRA-aware forward and sparsity regularization to ensure that the substructures corresponding to the learned pruning decisions can be directly removed after the ATP process. ATP outperforms the state-of-the-art two-stage pruning methods on tasks in the legal and healthcare domains. More specifically, ATP recovers up to 88% and 91% performance of the dense model when pruning 40% parameters of LLaMA2-7B and LLaMA3-8B models, respectively.</description>

      <title>Cherry-Picking in Time Series Forecasting: How to Select Datasets to Make Your Model Shine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The importance of time series forecasting drives continuous research and the development of new approaches to tackle this problem. Typically, these methods are introduced through empirical studies that frequently claim superior accuracy for the proposed approaches. Nevertheless, concerns are rising about the reliability and generalizability of these results due to limitations in experimental setups. This paper addresses a critical limitation: the number and representativeness of the datasets used. We investigate the impact of dataset selection bias, particularly the practice of cherry-picking datasets, on the performance evaluation of forecasting methods. Through empirical analysis with a diverse set of benchmark datasets, our findings reveal that cherry-picking datasets can significantly distort the perceived performance of methods, often exaggerating their effectiveness. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that by selectively choosing just four datasets - what most studies report - 46% of methods could be deemed best in class, and 77% could rank within the top three. Additionally, recent deep learning-based approaches show high sensitivity to dataset selection, whereas classical methods exhibit greater robustness. Finally, our results indicate that, when empirically validating forecasting algorithms on a subset of the benchmarks, increasing the number of datasets tested from 3 to 6 reduces the risk of incorrectly identifying an algorithm as the best one by approximately 40%. Our study highlights the critical need for comprehensive evaluation frameworks that more accurately reflect real-world scenarios. Adopting such frameworks will ensure the development of robust and reliable forecasting methods.</description>

      <title>ORBIT: Cost-Effective Dataset Curation for Large Language Model Domain Adaptation with an Astronomy Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in language modeling demonstrate the need for high-quality domain-specific training data, especially for tasks that require specialized knowledge. General-purpose models, while versatile, often lack the depth needed for expert-level tasks because of limited domain-specific information. Domain adaptation training can enhance these models, but it demands substantial, high-quality data. To address this, we propose ORBIT, a cost-efficient methodology for curating massive, high-quality domain-specific datasets from noisy web sources, tailored for training specialist large language models. Using astronomy as a primary case study, we refined the 1.3T-token FineWeb-Edu dataset into a high-quality, 10B-token subset focused on astronomy. Fine-tuning \textsc{LLaMA-3-8B} on a 1B-token astronomy subset improved performance on the MMLU astronomy benchmark from 69\% to 76\% and achieved top results on AstroBench, an astronomy-specific benchmark. Moreover, our model (Orbit-LLaMA) outperformed \textsc{LLaMA-3-8B-base}, with GPT-4o evaluations preferring it in 73\% of cases across 1000 astronomy-specific questions. Additionally, we validated ORBIT's generalizability by applying it to law and medicine, achieving a significant improvement of data quality compared to an unfiltered baseline. We open-source the ORBIT methodology, including the curated datasets, the codebase, and the resulting model at \href{https://github.com/ModeEric/ORBIT-Llama}{https://github.com/ModeEric/ORBIT-Llama}.</description>

      <title>GenHMR: Generative Human Mesh Recovery</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human mesh recovery (HMR) is crucial in many computer vision applications; from health to arts and entertainment. HMR from monocular images has predominantly been addressed by deterministic methods that output a single prediction for a given 2D image. However, HMR from a single image is an ill-posed problem due to depth ambiguity and occlusions. Probabilistic methods have attempted to address this by generating and fusing multiple plausible 3D reconstructions, but their performance has often lagged behind deterministic approaches. In this paper, we introduce GenHMR, a novel generative framework that reformulates monocular HMR as an image-conditioned generative task, explicitly modeling and mitigating uncertainties in the 2D-to-3D mapping process. GenHMR comprises two key components: (1) a pose tokenizer to convert 3D human poses into a sequence of discrete tokens in a latent space, and (2) an image-conditional masked transformer to learn the probabilistic distributions of the pose tokens, conditioned on the input image prompt along with randomly masked token sequence. During inference, the model samples from the learned conditional distribution to iteratively decode high-confidence pose tokens, thereby reducing 3D reconstruction uncertainties. To further refine the reconstruction, a 2D pose-guided refinement technique is proposed to directly fine-tune the decoded pose tokens in the latent space, which forces the projected 3D body mesh to align with the 2D pose clues. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that GenHMR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

      <title>CLDG: Contrastive Learning on Dynamic Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The graph with complex annotations is the most potent data type, whose constantly evolving motivates further exploration of the unsupervised dynamic graph representation. One of the representative paradigms is graph contrastive learning. It constructs self-supervised signals by maximizing the mutual information between the statistic graph's augmentation views. However, the semantics and labels may change within the augmentation process, causing a significant performance drop in downstream tasks. This drawback becomes greatly magnified on dynamic graphs. To address this problem, we designed a simple yet effective framework named CLDG. Firstly, we elaborate that dynamic graphs have temporal translation invariance at different levels. Then, we proposed a sampling layer to extract the temporally-persistent signals. It will encourage the node to maintain consistent local and global representations, i.e., temporal translation invariance under the timespan views. The extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the method on seven datasets by outperforming eight unsupervised state-of-the-art baselines and showing competitiveness against four semi-supervised methods. Compared with the existing dynamic graph method, the number of model parameters and training time is reduced by an average of 2,001.86 times and 130.31 times on seven datasets, respectively.</description>

      <title>HashAttention: Semantic Sparsity for Faster Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Utilizing longer contexts is increasingly essential to power better AI systems. However, the cost of attending to long contexts is high due to the involved softmax computation. While the scaled dot-product attention (SDPA) exhibits token sparsity, with only a few pivotal tokens significantly contributing to attention, leveraging this sparsity effectively remains an open challenge. Previous methods either suffer from model degradation or require considerable additional resources. We propose HashAttention --a principled approach casting pivotal token identification as a recommendation problem. Given a query, HashAttention encodes keys and queries in Hamming space capturing the required semantic similarity using learned mapping functions. HashAttention efficiently identifies pivotal tokens for a given query in this Hamming space using bitwise operations, and only these pivotal tokens are used for attention computation, significantly improving overall attention efficiency. HashAttention can reduce the number of tokens used by a factor of $1/32\times$ for the Llama-3.1-8B model with LongBench, keeping average quality loss within 0.6 points, while using only 32 bits per token auxiliary memory. At $32\times$ sparsity, HashAttention is $3{-}6\times$ faster than LightLLM and $2.5{-}4.5\times$ faster than gpt-fast on Nvidia-L4 GPU.</description>

      <title>Stochastic first-order methods with multi-extrapolated momentum for highly smooth unconstrained optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we consider an unconstrained stochastic optimization problem where the objective function exhibits a high order of smoothness. In particular, we propose a stochastic first-order method (SFOM) with multi-extrapolated momentum, in which multiple extrapolations are performed in each iteration, followed by a momentum step based on these extrapolations. We show that our proposed SFOM with multi-extrapolated momentum can accelerate optimization by exploiting the high-order smoothness of the objective function $f$. Specifically, assuming that the gradient and the $p$th-order derivative of $f$ are Lipschitz continuous for some $p\ge2$, and under some additional mild assumptions, we establish that our method achieves a sample complexity of $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-(3p+1)/p})$ for finding a point $x$ satisfying $\mathbb{E}[\|\nabla f(x)\|]\le\epsilon$. To the best of our knowledge, our method is the first SFOM to leverage arbitrary order smoothness of the objective function for acceleration, resulting in a sample complexity that strictly improves upon the best-known results without assuming the average smoothness condition. Finally, preliminary numerical experiments validate the practical performance of our method and corroborate our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Treatment Effects Estimation on Networked Observational Data using Disentangled Variational Graph Autoencoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estimating individual treatment effect (ITE) from observational data has gained increasing attention across various domains, with a key challenge being the identification of latent confounders affecting both treatment and outcome. Networked observational data offer new opportunities to address this issue by utilizing network information to infer latent confounders. However, most existing approaches assume observed variables and network information serve only as proxy variables for latent confounders, which often fails in practice, as some variables influence treatment but not outcomes, and vice versa. Recent advances in disentangled representation learning, which disentangle latent factors into instrumental, confounding, and adjustment factors, have shown promise for ITE estimation. Building on this, we propose a novel disentangled variational graph autoencoder that learns disentangled factors for treatment effect estimation on networked observational data. Our graph encoder further ensures factor independence using the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion. Extensive experiments on two semi-synthetic datasets derived from real-world social networks and one synthetic dataset demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.</description>

      <title>PA-RAG: RAG Alignment via Multi-Perspective Preference Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emergence of Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has alleviated the issues of outdated and hallucinatory content in the generation of large language models (LLMs), yet it still reveals numerous limitations. When a general-purpose LLM serves as the RAG generator, it often suffers from inadequate response informativeness, response robustness, and citation quality. Past approaches to tackle these limitations, either by incorporating additional steps beyond generating responses or optimizing the generator through supervised fine-tuning (SFT), still failed to align with the RAG requirement thoroughly. Consequently, optimizing the RAG generator from multiple preference perspectives while maintaining its end-to-end LLM form remains a challenge. To bridge this gap, we propose Multiple Perspective Preference Alignment for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (PA-RAG), a method for optimizing the generator of RAG systems to align with RAG requirements comprehensively. Specifically, we construct high-quality instruction fine-tuning data and multi-perspective preference data by sampling varied quality responses from the generator across different prompt documents quality scenarios. Subsequently, we optimize the generator using SFT and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Extensive experiments conducted on four question-answer datasets across three LLMs demonstrate that PA-RAG can significantly enhance the performance of RAG generators. Our code and datasets are available at https://github.com/wujwyi/PA-RAG.</description>

      <title>CAE-T: A Channelwise AutoEncoder with Transformer for EEG Abnormality Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are critical for detecting abnormal brain activity, but their high dimensionality and complexity pose significant challenges for effective analysis. In this paper, we propose CAE-T, a novel framework that combines a channelwise CNN-based autoencoder with a single-head transformer classifier for efficient EEG abnormality detection. The channelwise autoencoder compresses raw EEG signals while preserving channel independence, reducing computational costs and retaining biologically meaningful features. The compressed representations are then fed into the transformer-based classifier, which efficiently models long-term dependencies to distinguish between normal and abnormal signals. Evaluated on the TUH Abnormal EEG Corpus, the proposed model achieves 85.0% accuracy, 76.2% sensitivity, and 91.2% specificity at the per-case level, outperforming baseline models such as EEGNet, Deep4Conv, and FusionCNN. Furthermore, CAE-T requires only 202M FLOPs and 2.9M parameters, making it significantly more efficient than transformer-based alternatives. The framework retains interpretability through its channelwise design, demonstrating great potential for future applications in neuroscience research and clinical practice.

      <title>Overview of AI and Communication for 6G Network: Fundamentals, Challenges, and Future Research Opportunities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the increasing demand for seamless connectivity and intelligent communication, the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and communication for sixth-generation (6G) network is emerging as a revolutionary architecture. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of AI and communication for 6G networks, emphasizing their foundational principles, inherent challenges, and future research opportunities. We commence with a retrospective analysis of AI and the evolution of large-scale AI models, underscoring their pivotal roles in shaping contemporary communication technologies. The discourse then transitions to a detailed exposition of the envisioned integration of AI within 6G networks, delineated across three progressive developmental stages. The initial stage, AI for Network, focuses on employing AI to augment network performance, optimize efficiency, and enhance user service experiences. The subsequent stage, Network for AI, highlights the role of the network in facilitating and buttressing AI operations and presents key enabling technologies, including digital twins for AI and semantic communication. In the final stage, AI as a Service, it is anticipated that future 6G networks will innately provide AI functions as services and support application scenarios like immersive communication and intelligent industrial robots. Specifically, we have defined the quality of AI service, which refers to the measurement framework system of AI services within the network. In addition to these developmental stages, we thoroughly examine the standardization processes pertinent to AI in network contexts, highlighting key milestones and ongoing efforts. Finally, we outline promising future research opportunities that could drive the evolution and refinement of AI and communication for 6G, positioning them as a cornerstone of next-generation communication infrastructure.</description>

Abstract: This study introduces a federated learning-based approach to predict HER2 status from hematoxylin and eosin (HE)-stained whole slide images (WSIs), reducing costs and speeding up treatment decisions. To address label imbalance and feature representation challenges in multisite datasets, a point transformer is proposed, incorporating dynamic label distribution, an auxiliary classifier, and farthest cosine sampling.

      <title>AIArena: A Blockchain-Based Decentralized AI Training Platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of AI has underscored critical challenges in its development and implementation, largely due to centralized control by a few major corporations. This concentration of power intensifies biases within AI models, resulting from inadequate governance and oversight mechanisms. Additionally, it limits public involvement and heightens concerns about the integrity of model generation. Such monopolistic control over data and AI outputs threatens both innovation and fair data usage, as users inadvertently contribute data that primarily benefits these corporations. In this work, we propose AIArena, a blockchain-based decentralized AI training platform designed to democratize AI development and alignment through on-chain incentive mechanisms. AIArena fosters an open and collaborative environment where participants can contribute models and computing resources. Its on-chain consensus mechanism ensures fair rewards for participants based on their contributions. We instantiate and implement AIArena on the public Base blockchain Sepolia testnet, and the evaluation results demonstrate the feasibility of AIArena in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Global Spatio-Temporal Fusion-based Traffic Prediction Algorithm with Anomaly Aware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traffic prediction is an indispensable component of urban planning and traffic management. Achieving accurate traffic prediction hinges on the ability to capture the potential spatio-temporal relationships among road sensors. However, the majority of existing works focus on local short-term spatio-temporal correlations, failing to fully consider the interactions of different sensors in the long-term state. In addition, these works do not analyze the influences of anomalous factors, or have insufficient ability to extract personalized features of anomalous factors, which make them ineffectively capture their spatio-temporal influences on traffic prediction. To address the aforementioned issues, We propose a global spatio-temporal fusion-based traffic prediction algorithm that incorporates anomaly awareness. Initially, based on the designed anomaly detection network, we construct an efficient anomalous factors impacting module (AFIM), to evaluate the spatio-temporal impact of unexpected external events on traffic prediction. Furthermore, we propose a multi-scale spatio-temporal feature fusion module (MTSFFL) based on the transformer architecture, to obtain all possible both long and short term correlations among different sensors in a wide-area traffic environment for accurate prediction of traffic flow. Finally, experiments are implemented based on real-scenario public transportation datasets (PEMS04 and PEMS08) to demonstrate that our approach can achieve state-of-the-art performance.</description>

      <title>Characterising Simulation-Based Program Equilibria</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Tennenholtz's program equilibrium, players of a game submit programs to play on their behalf. Each program receives the other programs' source code and outputs an action. This can model interactions involving AI agents, mutually transparent institutions, or commitments. Tennenholtz (2004) proves a folk theorem for program games, but the equilibria constructed are very brittle. We therefore consider simulation-based programs -- i.e., programs that work by running opponents' programs. These are relatively robust (in particular, two programs that act the same are treated the same) and are more practical than proof-based approaches. Oesterheld's (2019) $\epsilon$Grounded$\pi$Bot is such an approach. Unfortunately, it is not generally applicable to games of three or more players, and only allows for a limited range of equilibria in two player games. In this paper, we propose a generalisation to Oesterheld's (2019) $\epsilon$Grounded$\pi$Bot. We prove a folk theorem for our programs in a setting with access to a shared source of randomness. We then characterise their equilibria in a setting without shared randomness. Both with and without shared randomness, we achieve a much wider range of equilibria than Oesterheld's (2019) $\epsilon$Grounded$\pi$Bot. Finally, we explore the limits of simulation-based program equilibrium, showing that the Tennenholtz folk theorem cannot be attained by simulation-based programs without access to shared randomness.</description>

      <title>SCKD: Semi-Supervised Cross-Modality Knowledge Distillation for 4D Radar Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 3D object detection is one of the fundamental perception tasks for autonomous vehicles. Fulfilling such a task with a 4D millimeter-wave radar is very attractive since the sensor is able to acquire 3D point clouds similar to Lidar while maintaining robust measurements under adverse weather. However, due to the high sparsity and noise associated with the radar point clouds, the performance of the existing methods is still much lower than expected. In this paper, we propose a novel Semi-supervised Cross-modality Knowledge Distillation (SCKD) method for 4D radar-based 3D object detection. It characterizes the capability of learning the feature from a Lidar-radar-fused teacher network with semi-supervised distillation. We first propose an adaptive fusion module in the teacher network to boost its performance. Then, two feature distillation modules are designed to facilitate the cross-modality knowledge transfer. Finally, a semi-supervised output distillation is proposed to increase the effectiveness and flexibility of the distillation framework. With the same network structure, our radar-only student trained by SCKD boosts the mAP by 10.38% over the baseline and outperforms the state-of-the-art works on the VoD dataset. The experiment on ZJUODset also shows 5.12% mAP improvements on the moderate difficulty level over the baseline when extra unlabeled data are available.

      <title>GSRender: Deduplicated Occupancy Prediction via Weakly Supervised 3D Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 3D occupancy perception is gaining increasing attention due to its capability to offer detailed and precise environment representations. Previous weakly-supervised NeRF methods balance efficiency and accuracy, with mIoU varying by 5-10 points due to sampling count along camera rays. Recently, real-time Gaussian splatting has gained widespread popularity in 3D reconstruction, and the occupancy prediction task can also be viewed as a reconstruction task. Consequently, we propose GSRender, which naturally employs 3D Gaussian Splatting for occupancy prediction, simplifying the sampling process. In addition, the limitations of 2D supervision result in duplicate predictions along the same camera ray. We implemented the Ray Compensation (RC) module, which mitigates this issue by compensating for features from adjacent frames. Finally, we redesigned the loss to eliminate the impact of dynamic objects from adjacent frames. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves SOTA (state-of-the-art) results in RayIoU (+6.0), while narrowing the gap with 3D supervision methods. Our code will be released soon.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have a low-power advantage but perform poorly in image segmentation tasks. The reason is that directly converting neural networks with complex architectural designs for segmentation tasks into spiking versions leads to performance degradation and non-convergence. To address this challenge, we first identify the modules in the architecture design that lead to the severe reduction in spike firing, make targeted improvements, and propose Spike2Former architecture. Second, we propose normalized integer spiking neurons to solve the training stability problem of SNNs with complex architectures. We set a new state-of-the-art for SNNs in various semantic segmentation datasets, with a significant improvement of +12.7% mIoU and 5.0 efficiency on ADE20K, +14.3% mIoU and 5.2 efficiency on VOC2012, and +9.1% mIoU and 6.6 efficiency on CityScapes.</description>

      <title>Towards Scalable and Deep Graph Neural Networks via Noise Masking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success in many graph mining tasks. However, scaling them to large graphs is challenging due to the high computational and storage costs of repeated feature propagation and non-linear transformation during training. One commonly employed approach to address this challenge is model-simplification, which only executes the Propagation (P) once in the pre-processing, and Combine (C) these receptive fields in different ways and then feed them into a simple model for better performance. Despite their high predictive performance and scalability, these methods still face two limitations. First, existing approaches mainly focus on exploring different C methods from the model perspective, neglecting the crucial problem of performance degradation with increasing P depth from the data-centric perspective, known as the over-smoothing problem. Second, pre-processing overhead takes up most of the end-to-end processing time, especially for large-scale graphs. To address these limitations, we present random walk with noise masking (RMask), a plug-and-play module compatible with the existing model-simplification works. This module enables the exploration of deeper GNNs while preserving their scalability. Unlike the previous model-simplification works, we focus on continuous P and found that the noise existing inside each P is the cause of the over-smoothing issue, and use the efficient masking mechanism to eliminate them. Experimental results on six real-world datasets demonstrate that model-simplification works equipped with RMask yield superior performance compared to their original version and can make a good trade-off between accuracy and efficiency.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown impressive abilities in text and image understanding. However, existing metrics for evaluating the text generated by VLMs focus exclusively on overall quality, leading to two limitations: 1) it is challenging to identify which aspects of the text need improvement from the overall score; 2) metrics may overlook specific evaluation criteria when predicting an overall score. To address these limitations, we propose HarmonicEval, a reference-free evaluation metric that aggregates criterion-wise scores to produce the overall score in a bottom-up manner. Furthermore, we construct the Multi-task Multi-criteria Human Evaluation (MMHE) dataset, which comprises 18,000 expert human judgments across four vision-language tasks. Our experiments demonstrate that HarmonicEval achieves higher correlations with human judgments than conventional metrics while providing numerical scores for each criterion.</description>

      <title>How good is GPT at writing political speeches for the White House?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using large language models (LLMs), computers are able to generate a written text in response to a us er request. As this pervasive technology can be applied in numerous contexts, this study analyses the written style of one LLM called GPT by comparing its generated speeches with those of the recent US presidents. To achieve this objective, the State of the Union (SOTU) addresses written by Reagan to Biden are contrasted to those produced by both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4.o versions. Compared to US presidents, GPT tends to overuse the lemma "we" and produce shorter messages with, on average, longer sentences. Moreover, GPT opts for an optimistic tone, opting more often for political (e.g., president, Congress), symbolic (e.g., freedom), and abstract terms (e.g., freedom). Even when imposing an author's style to GPT, the resulting speech remains distinct from addresses written by the target author. Finally, the two GPT versions present distinct characteristics, but both appear overall dissimilar to true presidential messages.</description>

      <title>Pitfalls of topology-aware image segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological correctness, i.e., the preservation of structural integrity and specific characteristics of shape, is a fundamental requirement for medical imaging tasks, such as neuron or vessel segmentation. Despite the recent surge in topology-aware methods addressing this challenge, their real-world applicability is hindered by flawed benchmarking practices. In this paper, we identify critical pitfalls in model evaluation that include inadequate connectivity choices, overlooked topological artifacts in ground truth annotations, and inappropriate use of evaluation metrics. Through detailed empirical analysis, we uncover these issues' profound impact on the evaluation and ranking of segmentation methods. Drawing from our findings, we propose a set of actionable recommendations to establish fair and robust evaluation standards for topology-aware medical image segmentation methods.</description>

      <title>Learning to Generate Research Idea with Dynamic Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their potential to accelerate scientific discovery, particularly in automating the process of research ideation. LLM-based systems have shown promise in generating hypotheses and research ideas. However, current approaches predominantly rely on prompting-based pre-trained models, limiting their ability to optimize generated content effectively. Moreover, they also lack the capability to deal with the complex interdependence and inherent restrictions among novelty, feasibility, and effectiveness, which remains challenging due to the inherent trade-offs among these dimensions, such as the innovation-feasibility conflict. To address these limitations, we for the first time propose fine-tuning LLMs to be better idea proposers and introduce a novel framework that employs a two-stage approach combining Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and controllable Reinforcement Learning (RL). In the SFT stage, the model learns foundational patterns from pairs of research papers and follow-up ideas. In the RL stage, multi-dimensional reward modeling, guided by fine-grained feedback, evaluates and optimizes the generated ideas across key metrics. Dimensional controllers enable dynamic adjustment of generation, while a sentence-level decoder ensures context-aware emphasis during inference. Our framework provides a balanced approach to research ideation, achieving high-quality outcomes by dynamically navigating the trade-offs among novelty, feasibility, and effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Progressive Fine-to-Coarse Reconstruction for Accurate Low-Bit Post-Training Quantization in Vision Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to its efficiency, Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) has been widely adopted for compressing Vision Transformers (ViTs). However, when quantized into low-bit representations, there is often a significant performance drop compared to their full-precision counterparts. To address this issue, reconstruction methods have been incorporated into the PTQ framework to improve performance in low-bit quantization settings. Nevertheless, existing related methods predefine the reconstruction granularity and seldom explore the progressive relationships between different reconstruction granularities, which leads to sub-optimal quantization results in ViTs. To this end, in this paper, we propose a Progressive Fine-to-Coarse Reconstruction (PFCR) method for accurate PTQ, which significantly improves the performance of low-bit quantized vision transformers. Specifically, we define multi-head self-attention and multi-layer perceptron modules along with their shortcuts as the finest reconstruction units. After reconstructing these two fine-grained units, we combine them to form coarser blocks and reconstruct them at a coarser granularity level. We iteratively perform this combination and reconstruction process, achieving progressive fine-to-coarse reconstruction. Additionally, we introduce a Progressive Optimization Strategy (POS) for PFCR to alleviate the difficulty of training, thereby further enhancing model performance. Experimental results on the ImageNet dataset demonstrate that our proposed method achieves the best Top-1 accuracy among state-of-the-art methods, particularly attaining 75.61% for 3-bit quantized ViT-B in PTQ. Besides, quantization results on the COCO dataset reveal the effectiveness and generalization of our proposed method on other computer vision tasks like object detection and instance segmentation.</description>

      <title>A Shapley Value Estimation Speedup for Efficient Explainable Quantum AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work focuses on developing efficient post-hoc explanations for quantum AI algorithms. In classical contexts, the cooperative game theory concept of the Shapley value adapts naturally to post-hoc explanations, where it can be used to identify which factors are important in an AI's decision-making process. An interesting question is how to translate Shapley values to the quantum setting and whether quantum effects could be used to accelerate their calculation. We propose quantum algorithms that can extract Shapley values within some confidence interval. Our method is capable of quadratically outperforming classical Monte Carlo approaches to approximating Shapley values up to polylogarithmic factors in various circumstances. We demonstrate the validity of our approach empirically with specific voting games and provide rigorous proofs of performance for general cooperative games.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Prompt Tuning: Vision Guided Prompt Tuning with Cross-Attention for Fine-Grained Few-Shot Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Few-shot, fine-grained classification in computer vision poses significant challenges due to the need to differentiate subtle class distinctions with limited data. This paper presents a novel method that enhances the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) model through adaptive prompt tuning, guided by real-time visual inputs. Unlike existing techniques such as Context Optimization (CoOp) and Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT), which are constrained by static prompts or visual token reliance, the proposed approach leverages a cross-attention mechanism to dynamically refine text prompts for the image at hand. This enables an image-specific alignment of textual features with image patches extracted from the Vision Transformer, making the model more effective for datasets with high intra-class variance and low inter-class differences. The method is evaluated on several datasets, including CUBirds, Oxford Flowers, and FGVC Aircraft, showing significant performance gains over static prompt tuning approaches. To ensure these performance gains translate into trustworthy predictions, we integrate Monte-Carlo Dropout in our approach to improve the reliability of the model predictions and uncertainty estimates. This integration provides valuable insights into the model's predictive confidence, helping to identify when predictions can be trusted and when additional verification is necessary. This dynamic approach offers a robust solution, advancing the state-of-the-art for few-shot fine-grained classification.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Uncertainty: A Deep Dive into Calibration and Performance of Multimodal Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) combine visual and textual data for tasks such as image captioning and visual question answering. Proper uncertainty calibration is crucial, yet challenging, for reliable use in areas like healthcare and autonomous driving. This paper investigates representative MLLMs, focusing on their calibration across various scenarios, including before and after visual fine-tuning, as well as before and after multimodal training of the base LLMs. We observed miscalibration in their performance, and at the same time, no significant differences in calibration across these scenarios. We also highlight how uncertainty differs between text and images and how their integration affects overall uncertainty. To better understand MLLMs' miscalibration and their ability to self-assess uncertainty, we construct the IDK (I don't know) dataset, which is key to evaluating how they handle unknowns. Our findings reveal that MLLMs tend to give answers rather than admit uncertainty, but this self-assessment improves with proper prompt adjustments. Finally, to calibrate MLLMs and enhance model reliability, we propose techniques such as temperature scaling and iterative prompt optimization. Our results provide insights into improving MLLMs for effective and responsible deployment in multimodal applications.

      <title>IOHunter: Graph Foundation Model to Uncover Online Information Operations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Social media platforms have become vital spaces for public discourse, serving as modern agor\'as where a wide range of voices influence societal narratives. However, their open nature also makes them vulnerable to exploitation by malicious actors, including state-sponsored entities, who can conduct information operations (IOs) to manipulate public opinion. The spread of misinformation, false news, and misleading claims threatens democratic processes and societal cohesion, making it crucial to develop methods for the timely detection of inauthentic activity to protect the integrity of online discourse. In this work, we introduce a methodology designed to identify users orchestrating information operations, a.k.a. \textit{IO drivers}, across various influence campaigns. Our framework, named \texttt{IOHunter}, leverages the combined strengths of Language Models and Graph Neural Networks to improve generalization in \emph{supervised}, \emph{scarcely-supervised}, and \emph{cross-IO} contexts. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple sets of IOs originating from six countries, significantly surpassing existing approaches. This research marks a step toward developing Graph Foundation Models specifically tailored for the task of IO detection on social media platforms.</description>

      <title>LoLaFL: Low-Latency Federated Learning via Forward-only Propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a widely adopted paradigm for enabling edge learning with distributed data while ensuring data privacy. However, the traditional FL with deep neural networks trained via backpropagation can hardly meet the low-latency learning requirements in the sixth generation (6G) mobile networks. This challenge mainly arises from the high-dimensional model parameters to be transmitted and the numerous rounds of communication required for convergence due to the inherent randomness of the training process. To address this issue, we adopt the state-of-the-art principle of maximal coding rate reduction to learn linear discriminative features and extend the resultant white-box neural network into FL, yielding the novel framework of Low-Latency Federated Learning (LoLaFL) via forward-only propagation. LoLaFL enables layer-wise transmissions and aggregation with significantly fewer communication rounds, thereby considerably reducing latency. Additionally, we propose two \emph{nonlinear} aggregation schemes for LoLaFL. The first scheme is based on the proof that the optimal NN parameter aggregation in LoLaFL should be harmonic-mean-like. The second scheme further exploits the low-rank structures of the features and transmits the low-rank-approximated covariance matrices of features to achieve additional latency reduction. Theoretic analysis and experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of LoLaFL. In comparison with traditional FL, the two nonlinear aggregation schemes for LoLaFL can achieve reductions in latency of over 91\% and 98\%, respectively, while maintaining comparable accuracies.</description>

      <title>Analysis and Visualization of Linguistic Structures in Large Language Models: Neural Representations of Verb-Particle Constructions in BERT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the internal representations of verb-particle combinations within transformer-based large language models (LLMs), specifically examining how these models capture lexical and syntactic nuances at different neural network layers. Employing the BERT architecture, we analyse the representational efficacy of its layers for various verb-particle constructions such as 'agree on', 'come back', and 'give up'. Our methodology includes a detailed dataset preparation from the British National Corpus, followed by extensive model training and output analysis through techniques like multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) and generalized discrimination value (GDV) calculations. Results show that BERT's middle layers most effectively capture syntactic structures, with significant variability in representational accuracy across different verb categories. These findings challenge the conventional uniformity assumed in neural network processing of linguistic elements and suggest a complex interplay between network architecture and linguistic representation. Our research contributes to a better understanding of how deep learning models comprehend and process language, offering insights into the potential and limitations of current neural approaches to linguistic analysis. This study not only advances our knowledge in computational linguistics but also prompts further research into optimizing neural architectures for enhanced linguistic precision.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved significant progress in integrating visual and textual inputs for multimodal reasoning. However, a recurring challenge is ensuring these models utilize visual information as effectively as linguistic content when both modalities are necessary to formulate an accurate answer. We hypothesize that hallucinations arise due to the lack of effective visual grounding in current LVLMs. This issue extends to vision-language benchmarks, where it is difficult to make the image indispensable for accurate answer generation, particularly in vision question-answering tasks. In this work, we introduce FiVL, a novel method for constructing datasets designed to train LVLMs for enhanced visual grounding and to evaluate their effectiveness in achieving it. These datasets can be utilized for both training and assessing an LVLM's ability to use image content as substantive evidence rather than relying solely on linguistic priors, providing insights into the model's reliance on visual information. To demonstrate the utility of our dataset, we introduce an innovative training task that outperforms baselines alongside a validation method and application for explainability.

      <title>A Light-Weight Framework for Open-Set Object Detection with Decoupled Feature Alignment in Joint Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Open-set object detection (OSOD) is highly desirable for robotic manipulation in unstructured environments. However, existing OSOD methods often fail to meet the requirements of robotic applications due to their high computational burden and complex deployment. To address this issue, this paper proposes a light-weight framework called Decoupled OSOD (DOSOD), which is a practical and highly efficient solution to support real-time OSOD tasks in robotic systems. Specifically, DOSOD builds upon the YOLO-World pipeline by integrating a vision-language model (VLM) with a detector. A Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) adaptor is developed to transform text embeddings extracted by the VLM into a joint space, within which the detector learns the region representations of class-agnostic proposals. Cross-modality features are directly aligned in the joint space, avoiding the complex feature interactions and thereby improving computational efficiency. DOSOD operates like a traditional closed-set detector during the testing phase, effectively bridging the gap between closed-set and open-set detection. Compared to the baseline YOLO-World, the proposed DOSOD significantly enhances real-time performance while maintaining comparable accuracy. The slight DOSOD-S model achieves a Fixed AP of $26.7\%$, compared to $26.2\%$ for YOLO-World-v1-S and $22.7\%$ for YOLO-World-v2-S, using similar backbones on the LVIS minival dataset. Meanwhile, the FPS of DOSOD-S is $57.1\%$ higher than YOLO-World-v1-S and $29.6\%$ higher than YOLO-World-v2-S. Meanwhile, we demonstrate that the DOSOD model facilitates the deployment of edge devices. The codes and models are publicly available at https://github.com/D-Robotics-AI-Lab/DOSOD.</description>

      <title>Each Fake News is Fake in its Own Way: An Attribution Multi-Granularity Benchmark for Multimodal Fake News Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Social platforms, while facilitating access to information, have also become saturated with a plethora of fake news, resulting in negative consequences. Automatic multimodal fake news detection is a worthwhile pursuit. Existing multimodal fake news datasets only provide binary labels of real or fake. However, real news is alike, while each fake news is fake in its own way. These datasets fail to reflect the mixed nature of various types of multimodal fake news. To bridge the gap, we construct an attributing multi-granularity multimodal fake news detection dataset \amg, revealing the inherent fake pattern. Furthermore, we propose a multi-granularity clue alignment model \our to achieve multimodal fake news detection and attribution. Experimental results demonstrate that \amg is a challenging dataset, and its attribution setting opens up new avenues for future research.</description>

      <title>How to Synthesize Text Data without Model Collapse?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Model collapse in synthetic data indicates that iterative training on self-generated data leads to a gradual decline in performance. With the proliferation of AI models, synthetic data will fundamentally reshape the web data ecosystem. Future GPT-$\{n\}$ models will inevitably be trained on a blend of synthetic and human-produced data. In this paper, we focus on two questions: what is the impact of synthetic data on language model training, and how to synthesize data without model collapse? We first pre-train language models across different proportions of synthetic data, revealing a negative correlation between the proportion of synthetic data and model performance. We further conduct statistical analysis on synthetic data to uncover distributional shift phenomenon and over-concentration of n-gram features. Inspired by the above findings, we propose token editing on human-produced data to obtain semi-synthetic data. As a proof of concept, we theoretically demonstrate that token-level editing can prevent model collapse, as the test error is constrained by a finite upper bound. We conduct extensive experiments on pre-training from scratch, continual pre-training, and supervised fine-tuning. The results validate our theoretical proof that token-level editing improves data quality and enhances model performance.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Hype: A Comprehensive Review of Current Trends in Generative AI Research, Teaching Practices, and Tools</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) is advancing rapidly, and the literature in computing education is expanding almost as quickly. Initial responses to GenAI tools were mixed between panic and utopian optimism. Many were fast to point out the opportunities and challenges of GenAI. Researchers reported that these new tools are capable of solving most introductory programming tasks and are causing disruptions throughout the curriculum. These tools can write and explain code, enhance error messages, create resources for instructors, and even provide feedback and help for students like a traditional teaching assistant. In 2024, new research started to emerge on the effects of GenAI usage in the computing classroom. These new data involve the use of GenAI to support classroom instruction at scale and to teach students how to code with GenAI. In support of the former, a new class of tools is emerging that can provide personalized feedback to students on their programming assignments or teach both programming and prompting skills at the same time. With the literature expanding so rapidly, this report aims to summarize and explain what is happening on the ground in computing classrooms. We provide a systematic literature review; a survey of educators and industry professionals; and interviews with educators using GenAI in their courses, educators studying GenAI, and researchers who create GenAI tools to support computing education. The triangulation of these methods and data sources expands the understanding of GenAI usage and perceptions at this critical moment for our community.</description>

      <title>CodeRepoQA: A Large-scale Benchmark for Software Engineering Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce CodeRepoQA, a large-scale benchmark specifically designed for evaluating repository-level question-answering capabilities in the field of software engineering. CodeRepoQA encompasses five programming languages and covers a wide range of scenarios, enabling comprehensive evaluation of language models. To construct this dataset, we crawl data from 30 well-known repositories in GitHub, the largest platform for hosting and collaborating on code, and carefully filter raw data. In total, CodeRepoQA is a multi-turn question-answering benchmark with 585,687 entries, covering a diverse array of software engineering scenarios, with an average of 6.62 dialogue turns per entry.
  We evaluate ten popular large language models on our dataset and provide in-depth analysis. We find that LLMs still have limitations in question-answering capabilities in the field of software engineering, and medium-length contexts are more conducive to LLMs' performance. The entire benchmark is publicly available at https://github.com/kinesiatricssxilm14/CodeRepoQA.</description>

      <title>ALKAFI-LLAMA3: Fine-Tuning LLMs for Precise Legal Understanding in Palestine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in diverse domains, yet their application in the legal sector, particularly in low-resource contexts, remains limited. This study addresses the challenges of adapting LLMs to the Palestinian legal domain, where political instability, fragmented legal frameworks, and limited AI resources hinder effective machine-learning applications. We present a fine-tuned model based on a quantized version of Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct, trained on a synthetic data set derived from Palestinian legal texts. Using smaller-scale models and strategically generated question-answer pairs, we achieve a cost-effective, locally sustainable solution that provides accurate and contextually relevant legal guidance. Our experiments demonstrate promising performance on various query types, ranging from yes/no questions and narrative explanations to complex legal differentiations, while highlighting areas for improvement, such as handling calculation-based inquiries and structured list formatting. This work provides a pathway for the deployment of AI-driven legal assistance tools tailored to the needs of resource-constrained environments.</description>

      <title>Energy and polarization based on-line interference mitigation in radio interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radio frequency interference (RFI) is a persistent contaminant in terrestrial radio astronomy. While new radio interferometers are becoming operational, novel sources of RFI are also emerging. In order to strengthen the mitigation of RFI in modern radio interferometers, we propose an on-line RFI mitigation scheme that can be run in the correlator of such interferometers. We combine statistics based on the energy as well as the polarization alignment of the correlated signal to develop an on-line RFI mitigation scheme that can be applied to a data stream produced by the correlator in real-time, especially targeted at low duty-cycle or transient RFI detection. In order to improve the computational efficiency, we explore the use of both single precision and half precision floating point operations in implementing the RFI mitigation algorithm. This ideally suits its deployment in accelerator computing devices such as graphics processing units (GPUs) as used by the LOFAR correlator. We provide results based on real data to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Agent-Temporal Credit Assignment for Optimal Policy Preservation in Sparse Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In multi-agent environments, agents often struggle to learn optimal policies due to sparse or delayed global rewards, particularly in long-horizon tasks where it is challenging to evaluate actions at intermediate time steps. We introduce Temporal-Agent Reward Redistribution (TAR$^2$), a novel approach designed to address the agent-temporal credit assignment problem by redistributing sparse rewards both temporally and across agents. TAR$^2$ decomposes sparse global rewards into time-step-specific rewards and calculates agent-specific contributions to these rewards. We theoretically prove that TAR$^2$ is equivalent to potential-based reward shaping, ensuring that the optimal policy remains unchanged. Empirical results demonstrate that TAR$^2$ stabilizes and accelerates the learning process. Additionally, we show that when TAR$^2$ is integrated with single-agent reinforcement learning algorithms, it performs as well as or better than traditional multi-agent reinforcement learning methods.</description>

      <title>Stack Trace Deduplication: Faster, More Accurately, and in More Realistic Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In large-scale software systems, there are often no fully-fledged bug reports with human-written descriptions when an error occurs. In this case, developers rely on stack traces, i.e., series of function calls that led to the error. Since there can be tens and hundreds of thousands of them describing the same issue from different users, automatic deduplication into categories is necessary to allow for processing. Recent works have proposed powerful deep learning-based approaches for this, but they are evaluated and compared in isolation from real-life workflows, and it is not clear whether they will actually work well at scale.
  To overcome this gap, this work presents three main contributions: a novel model, an industry-based dataset, and a multi-faceted evaluation. Our model consists of two parts - (1) an embedding model with byte-pair encoding and approximate nearest neighbor search to quickly find the most relevant stack traces to the incoming one, and (2) a reranker that re-ranks the most fitting stack traces, taking into account the repeated frames between them. To complement the existing datasets collected from open-source projects, we share with the community SlowOps - a dataset of stack traces from IntelliJ-based products developed by JetBrains, which has an order of magnitude more stack traces per category. Finally, we carry out an evaluation that strives to be realistic: measuring not only the accuracy of categorization, but also the operation time and the ability to create new categories. The evaluation shows that our model strikes a good balance - it outperforms other models on both open-source datasets and SlowOps, while also being faster on time than most. We release all of our code and data, and hope that our work can pave the way to further practice-oriented research in the area.</description>

      <title>MARIA: a Multimodal Transformer Model for Incomplete Healthcare Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In healthcare, the integration of multimodal data is pivotal for developing comprehensive diagnostic and predictive models. However, managing missing data remains a significant challenge in real-world applications. We introduce MARIA (Multimodal Attention Resilient to Incomplete datA), a novel transformer-based deep learning model designed to address these challenges through an intermediate fusion strategy. Unlike conventional approaches that depend on imputation, MARIA utilizes a masked self-attention mechanism, which processes only the available data without generating synthetic values. This approach enables it to effectively handle incomplete datasets, enhancing robustness and minimizing biases introduced by imputation methods. We evaluated MARIA against 10 state-of-the-art machine learning and deep learning models across 8 diagnostic and prognostic tasks. The results demonstrate that MARIA outperforms existing methods in terms of performance and resilience to varying levels of data incompleteness, underscoring its potential for critical healthcare applications.</description>

      <title>Progressive Multimodal Reasoning via Active Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-step multimodal reasoning tasks pose significant challenges for multimodal large language models (MLLMs), and finding effective ways to enhance their performance in such scenarios remains an unresolved issue. In this paper, we propose AR-MCTS, a universal framework designed to progressively improve the reasoning capabilities of MLLMs through Active Retrieval (AR) and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). Our approach begins with the development of a unified retrieval module that retrieves key supporting insights for solving complex reasoning problems from a hybrid-modal retrieval corpus. To bridge the gap in automated multimodal reasoning verification, we employ the MCTS algorithm combined with an active retrieval mechanism, which enables the automatic generation of step-wise annotations. This strategy dynamically retrieves key insights for each reasoning step, moving beyond traditional beam search sampling to improve the diversity and reliability of the reasoning space. Additionally, we introduce a process reward model that aligns progressively to support the automatic verification of multimodal reasoning tasks. Experimental results across three complex multimodal reasoning benchmarks confirm the effectiveness of the AR-MCTS framework in enhancing the performance of various multimodal models. Further analysis demonstrates that AR-MCTS can optimize sampling diversity and accuracy, yielding reliable multimodal reasoning.</description>

      <title>Helping LLMs Improve Code Generation Using Feedback from Testing and Static Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are one of the most promising developments in the field of artificial intelligence, and the software engineering community has readily noticed their potential role in the software development life-cycle. Developers routinely ask LLMs to generate code snippets, increasing productivity but also potentially introducing ownership, privacy, correctness, and security issues. Previous work highlighted how code generated by mainstream commercial LLMs is often not safe, containing vulnerabilities, bugs, and code smells. In this paper, we present a framework that leverages testing and static analysis to assess the quality, and guide the self-improvement, of code generated by general-purpose, open-source LLMs.
  First, we ask LLMs to generate C code to solve a number of programming tasks. Then we employ ground-truth tests to assess the (in)correctness of the generated code, and a static analysis tool to detect potential safety vulnerabilities. Next, we assess the models ability to evaluate the generated code, by asking them to detect errors and vulnerabilities. Finally, we test the models ability to fix the generated code, providing the reports produced during the static analysis and incorrectness evaluation phases as feedback.
  Our results show that models often produce incorrect code, and that the generated code can include safety issues. Moreover, they perform very poorly at detecting either issue. On the positive side, we observe a substantial ability to fix flawed code when provided with information about failed tests or potential vulnerabilities, indicating a promising avenue for improving the safety of LLM-based code generation tools.</description>

      <title>Mapping and Influencing the Political Ideology of Large Language Models using Synthetic Personas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The analysis of political biases in large language models (LLMs) has primarily examined these systems as single entities with fixed viewpoints. While various methods exist for measuring such biases, the impact of persona-based prompting on LLMs' political orientation remains unexplored. In this work we leverage PersonaHub, a collection of synthetic persona descriptions, to map the political distribution of persona-based prompted LLMs using the Political Compass Test (PCT). We then examine whether these initial compass distributions can be manipulated through explicit ideological prompting towards diametrically opposed political orientations: right-authoritarian and left-libertarian. Our experiments reveal that synthetic personas predominantly cluster in the left-libertarian quadrant, with models demonstrating varying degrees of responsiveness when prompted with explicit ideological descriptors. While all models demonstrate significant shifts towards right-authoritarian positions, they exhibit more limited shifts towards left-libertarian positions, suggesting an asymmetric response to ideological manipulation that may reflect inherent biases in model training.</description>

      <title>Head and Neck Tumor Segmentation of MRI from Pre- and Mid-radiotherapy with Pre-training, Data Augmentation and Dual Flow UNet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Head and neck tumors and metastatic lymph nodes are crucial for treatment planning and prognostic analysis. Accurate segmentation and quantitative analysis of these structures require pixel-level annotation, making automated segmentation techniques essential for the diagnosis and treatment of head and neck cancer. In this study, we investigated the effects of multiple strategies on the segmentation of pre-radiotherapy (pre-RT) and mid-radiotherapy (mid-RT) images. For the segmentation of pre-RT images, we utilized: 1) a fully supervised learning approach, and 2) the same approach enhanced with pre-trained weights and the MixUp data augmentation technique. For mid-RT images, we introduced a novel computational-friendly network architecture that features separate encoders for mid-RT images and registered pre-RT images with their labels. The mid-RT encoder branch integrates information from pre-RT images and labels progressively during the forward propagation. We selected the highest-performing model from each fold and used their predictions to create an ensemble average for inference. In the final test, our models achieved a segmentation performance of 82.38% for pre-RT and 72.53% for mid-RT on aggregated Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) as HiLab. Our code is available at https://github.com/WltyBY/HNTS-MRG2024_train_code.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV) model offers a novel alternative to the Transformer architecture, merging the benefits of recurrent and attention-based systems. Unlike conventional Transformers, which depend heavily on self-attention, RWKV adeptly captures long-range dependencies with minimal computational demands. By utilizing a recurrent framework, RWKV addresses some computational inefficiencies found in Transformers, particularly in tasks with long sequences. RWKV has recently drawn considerable attention for its robust performance across multiple domains. Despite its growing popularity, no systematic review of the RWKV model exists. This paper seeks to fill this gap as the first comprehensive review of the RWKV architecture, its core principles, and its varied applications, such as natural language generation, natural language understanding, and computer vision. We assess how RWKV compares to traditional Transformer models, highlighting its capability to manage long sequences efficiently and lower computational costs. Furthermore, we explore the challenges RWKV encounters and propose potential directions for future research and advancement. We consistently maintain the related open-source materials at: https://github.com/MLGroupJLU/RWKV-Survey.</description>

      <title>AI-Powered Intracranial Hemorrhage Detection: A Co-Scale Convolutional Attention Model with Uncertainty-Based Fuzzy Integral Operator and Feature Screening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) refers to the leakage or accumulation of blood within the skull, which occurs due to the rupture of blood vessels in or around the brain. If this condition is not diagnosed in a timely manner and appropriately treated, it can lead to serious complications such as decreased consciousness, permanent neurological disabilities, or even death.The primary aim of this study is to detect the occurrence or non-occurrence of ICH, followed by determining the type of subdural hemorrhage (SDH). These tasks are framed as two separate binary classification problems. By adding two layers to the co-scale convolutional attention (CCA) classifier architecture, we introduce a novel approach for ICH detection. In the first layer, after extracting features from different slices of computed tomography (CT) scan images, we combine these features and select the 50 components that capture the highest variance in the data, considering them as informative features. We then assess the discriminative power of these features using the bootstrap forest algorithm, discarding those that lack sufficient discriminative ability between different classes. This algorithm explicitly determines the contribution of each feature to the final prediction, assisting us in developing an explainable AI model. The features feed into a boosting neural network as a latent feature space. In the second layer, we introduce a novel uncertainty-based fuzzy integral operator to fuse information from different CT scan slices. This operator, by accounting for the dependencies between consecutive slices, significantly improves detection accuracy.</description>

      <title>Dehallucinating Parallel Context Extension for Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are susceptible to generating hallucinated information, despite the integration of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Parallel context extension (PCE) is a line of research attempting to effectively integrating parallel (unordered) contexts, while it still suffers from hallucinations when adapted to RAG scenarios. In this paper, we propose DePaC (Dehallucinating Parallel Context Extension), which alleviates the hallucination problem with context-aware negative training and information-calibrated aggregation. DePaC is designed to alleviate two types of in-context hallucination: fact fabrication (i.e., LLMs present claims that are not supported by the contexts) and fact omission (i.e., LLMs fail to present claims that can be supported by the contexts). Specifically, (1) for fact fabrication, we apply the context-aware negative training that fine-tunes the LLMs with negative supervisions, thus explicitly guiding the LLMs to refuse to answer when contexts are not related to questions; (2) for fact omission, we propose the information-calibrated aggregation which prioritizes context windows with higher information increment from their contexts. The experimental results on nine RAG tasks demonstrate that DePaC significantly alleviates the two types of hallucination and consistently achieves better performances on these tasks.</description>

      <title>RobustFT: Robust Supervised Fine-tuning for Large Language Models under Noisy Response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) plays a crucial role in adapting large language models (LLMs) to specific domains or tasks. However, as demonstrated by empirical experiments, the collected data inevitably contains noise in practical applications, which poses significant challenges to model performance on downstream tasks. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a noise-robust SFT framework to enhance model capabilities in downstream tasks. To address this challenge, we introduce a robust SFT framework (RobustFT) that performs noise detection and relabeling on downstream task data. For noise identification, our approach employs a multi-expert collaborative system with inference-enhanced models to achieve superior noise detection. In the denoising phase, we utilize a context-enhanced strategy, which incorporates the most relevant and confident knowledge followed by careful assessment to generate reliable annotations. Additionally, we introduce an effective data selection mechanism based on response entropy, ensuring only high-quality samples are retained for fine-tuning. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple LLMs across five datasets demonstrate RobustFT's exceptional performance in noisy scenarios.</description>

      <title>Cirbo: A New Tool for Boolean Circuit Analysis and Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an open-source tool for manipulating Boolean circuits. It implements efficient algorithms, both existing and novel, for a rich variety of frequently used circuit tasks such as satisfiability, synthesis, and minimization. We tested the tool on a wide range of practically relevant circuits (computing, in particular, symmetric and arithmetic functions) that have been optimized intensively by the community for the last three years. The tool helped us to win the IWLS 2024 Programming Contest. In 2023, it was Google DeepMind who took the first place in the competition. We were able to reduce the size of the best circuits from 2023 by 12\% on average, whereas for some individual circuits, our size reduction was as large as 83\%.</description>

      <title>Movie2Story: A framework for understanding videos and telling stories in the form of novel text</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal video-to-text models have made considerable progress, primarily in generating brief descriptions of video content. However, there is still a deficiency in generating rich long-form text descriptions that integrate both video and audio. In this paper, we introduce a framework called M2S, designed to generate novel-length text by combining audio, video, and character recognition. M2S includes modules for video long-form text description and comprehension, audio-based analysis of emotion, speech rate, and character alignment, and visual-based character recognition alignment. By integrating multimodal information using the large language model GPT4o, M2S stands out in the field of multimodal text generation. We demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of M2S through comparative experiments and human evaluation. Additionally, the model framework has good scalability and significant potential for future research.</description>

      <title>HSEvo: Elevating Automatic Heuristic Design with Diversity-Driven Harmony Search and Genetic Algorithm Using LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automatic Heuristic Design (AHD) is an active research area due to its utility in solving complex search and NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems in the real world. The recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) introduce new possibilities by coupling LLMs with evolutionary computation to automatically generate heuristics, known as LLM-based Evolutionary Program Search (LLM-EPS). While previous LLM-EPS studies obtained great performance on various tasks, there is still a gap in understanding the properties of heuristic search spaces and achieving a balance between exploration and exploitation, which is a critical factor in large heuristic search spaces. In this study, we address this gap by proposing two diversity measurement metrics and perform an analysis on previous LLM-EPS approaches, including FunSearch, EoH, and ReEvo. Results on black-box AHD problems reveal that while EoH demonstrates higher diversity than FunSearch and ReEvo, its objective score is unstable. Conversely, ReEvo's reflection mechanism yields good objective scores but fails to optimize diversity effectively. With this finding in mind, we introduce HSEvo, an adaptive LLM-EPS framework that maintains a balance between diversity and convergence with a harmony search algorithm. Through experimentation, we find that HSEvo achieved high diversity indices and good objective scores while remaining cost-effective. These results underscore the importance of balancing exploration and exploitation and understanding heuristic search spaces in designing frameworks in LLM-EPS.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models and Code Security: A Systematic Literature Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for automating various programming tasks, including security-related ones, such as detecting and fixing vulnerabilities. Despite their promising capabilities, when required to produce or modify pre-existing code, LLMs could introduce vulnerabilities unbeknown to the programmer. When analyzing code, they could miss clear vulnerabilities or signal nonexistent ones. In this Systematic Literature Review (SLR), we aim to investigate both the security benefits and potential drawbacks of using LLMs for a variety of code-related tasks. In particular, first we focus on the types of vulnerabilities that could be introduced by LLMs, when used for producing code. Second, we analyze the capabilities of LLMs to detect and fix vulnerabilities, in any given code, and how the prompting strategy of choice impacts their performance in these two tasks. Last, we provide an in-depth analysis on how data poisoning attacks on LLMs can impact performance in the aforementioned tasks.</description>

      <title>Measuring, Modeling, and Helping People Account for Privacy Risks in Online Self-Disclosures with AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In pseudonymous online fora like Reddit, the benefits of self-disclosure are often apparent to users (e.g., I can vent about my in-laws to understanding strangers), but the privacy risks are more abstract (e.g., will my partner be able to tell that this is me?). Prior work has sought to develop natural language processing (NLP) tools that help users identify potentially risky self-disclosures in their text, but none have been designed for or evaluated with the users they hope to protect. Absent this assessment, these tools will be limited by the social-technical gap: users need assistive tools that help them make informed decisions, not paternalistic tools that tell them to avoid self-disclosure altogether. To bridge this gap, we conducted a study with N = 21 Reddit users; we had them use a state-of-the-art NLP disclosure detection model on two of their authored posts and asked them questions to understand if and how the model helped, where it fell short, and how it could be improved to help them make more informed decisions. Despite its imperfections, users responded positively to the model and highlighted its use as a tool that can help them catch mistakes, inform them of risks they were unaware of, and encourage self-reflection. However, our work also shows how, to be useful and usable, AI for supporting privacy decision-making must account for posting context, disclosure norms, and users' lived threat models, and provide explanations that help contextualize detected risks.</description>

      <title>GIRAFE: Glottal Imaging Dataset for Advanced Segmentation, Analysis, and Facilitative Playbacks Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advances in the development of Facilitative Playbacks extracted from High-Speed videoendoscopic sequences of the vocal folds are hindered by a notable lack of publicly available datasets annotated with the semantic segmentations corresponding to the area of the glottal gap. This fact also limits the reproducibility and further exploration of existing research in this field.
  To address this gap, GIRAFE is a data repository designed to facilitate the development of advanced techniques for the semantic segmentation, analysis, and fast evaluation of High-Speed videoendoscopic sequences of the vocal folds. The repository includes 65 high-speed videoendoscopic recordings from a cohort of 50 patients (30 female, 20 male). The dataset comprises 15 recordings from healthy controls, 26 from patients with diagnosed voice disorders, and 24 with an unknown health condition. All of them were manually annotated by an expert, including the masks corresponding to the semantic segmentation of the glottal gap. The repository is also complemented with the automatic segmentation of the glottal area using different state-of-the-art approaches.
  This data set has already supported several studies, which demonstrates its usefulness for the development of new glottal gap segmentation algorithms from High-Speed-Videoendoscopic sequences to improve or create new Facilitative Playbacks. Despite these advances and others in the field, the broader challenge of performing an accurate and completely automatic semantic segmentation method of the glottal area remains open.</description>

      <title>AceMath: Advancing Frontier Math Reasoning with Post-Training and Reward Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce AceMath, a suite of frontier math models that excel in solving complex math problems, along with highly effective reward models capable of evaluating generated solutions and reliably identifying the correct ones. To develop the instruction-tuned math models, we propose a supervised fine-tuning (SFT) process that first achieves competitive performance across general domains, followed by targeted fine-tuning for the math domain using a carefully curated set of prompts and synthetically generated responses. The resulting model, AceMath-72B-Instruct greatly outperforms Qwen2.5-Math-72B-Instruct, GPT-4o and Claude-3.5 Sonnet. To develop math-specialized reward model, we first construct AceMath-RewardBench, a comprehensive and robust benchmark for evaluating math reward models across diverse problems and difficulty levels. After that, we present a systematic approach to build our math reward models. The resulting model, AceMath-72B-RM, consistently outperforms state-of-the-art reward models. Furthermore, when combining AceMath-72B-Instruct with AceMath-72B-RM, we achieve the highest average rm@8 score across the math reasoning benchmarks. We will release model weights, training data, and evaluation benchmarks at: https://research.nvidia.com/labs/adlr/acemath</description>

      <title>Learning Disentangled Equivariant Representation for Explicitly Controllable 3D Molecule Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the conditional generation of 3D drug-like molecules with \textit{explicit control} over molecular properties such as drug-like properties (e.g., Quantitative Estimate of Druglikeness or Synthetic Accessibility score) and effectively binding to specific protein sites. To tackle this problem, we propose an E(3)-equivariant Wasserstein autoencoder and factorize the latent space of our generative model into two disentangled aspects: molecular properties and the remaining structural context of 3D molecules. Our model ensures explicit control over these molecular attributes while maintaining equivariance of coordinate representation and invariance of data likelihood. Furthermore, we introduce a novel alignment-based coordinate loss to adapt equivariant networks for auto-regressive de-novo 3D molecule generation from scratch. Extensive experiments validate our model's effectiveness on property-guided and context-guided molecule generation, both for de-novo 3D molecule design and structure-based drug discovery against protein targets.</description>

      <title>A Cross-Domain Study of the Use of Persuasion Techniques in Online Disinformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Disinformation, irrespective of domain or language, aims to deceive or manipulate public opinion, typically through employing advanced persuasion techniques. Qualitative and quantitative research on the weaponisation of persuasion techniques in disinformation has been mostly topic-specific (e.g., COVID-19) with limited cross-domain studies, resulting in a lack of comprehensive understanding of these strategies. This study employs a state-of-the-art persuasion technique classifier to conduct a large-scale, multi-domain analysis of the role of 16 persuasion techniques in disinformation narratives. It shows how different persuasion techniques are employed disproportionately in different disinformation domains. We also include a detailed case study on climate change disinformation, highlighting how linguistic, psychological, and cultural factors shape the adaptation of persuasion strategies to fit unique thematic contexts.</description>

      <title>Exploiting sparse structures and synergy designs to advance situational awareness of electrical power grid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growing threats of uncertainties, anomalies, and cyberattacks on power grids are driving a critical need to advance situational awareness which allows system operators to form a complete and accurate picture of the present and future state. Simulation and estimation are foundational tools in this process. However, existing tools lack the robustness and efficiency required to achieve the level of situational awareness needed for the ever-evolving threat landscape. Industry-standard (steady-state) simulators are not robust to blackouts, often leading to non-converging or non-actionable results. Estimation tools lack robustness to anomalous data, returning erroneous system states. Efficiency is the other major concern as nonlinearities and scalability issues make large systems slow to converge.
  This thesis addresses robustness and efficiency gaps through a dual-fold contribution. We first address the inherent limitations in the existing physics-based and data-driven worlds; and then transcend the boundaries of conventional algorithmic design in the direction of a new paradigm -- Physics-ML Synergy -- which integrates the strengths of the two worlds. Our approaches are built on circuit formulation which provides a unified framework that applies to both transmission and distribution. Sparse optimization acts as the key enabler to make these tools intrinsically robust and immune to random threats, pinpointing dominant sources of (random) blackouts and data errors. Further, we explore sparsity-exploiting optimizations to develop lightweight ML models whose prediction and detection capabilities are a complement to physics-based tools; and whose lightweight designs advance generalization and scalability. Finally, Physics-ML Synergy brings robustness and efficiency further against targeted cyberthreats, by interconnecting our physics-based tools with lightweight ML.</description>

      <title>Associative memory inspires improvements for in-context learning using a novel attention residual stream architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate an impressive ability to utilise information within the context of their input sequences to appropriately respond to data unseen by the LLM during its training procedure. This ability is known as in-context learning (ICL). Humans and non-human animals demonstrate similar abilities, however their neural architectures differ substantially from LLMs. Despite this, a critical component within LLMs, the attention mechanism, resembles modern associative memory models, widely used in and influenced by the computational neuroscience community to model biological memory systems. Using this connection, we introduce an associative memory model capable of performing ICL. We use this as inspiration for a novel residual stream architecture which allows information to directly flow between attention heads. We test this architecture during training within a two-layer Transformer and show its ICL abilities manifest more quickly than without this modification. We then apply our architecture in small language models with 8 million parameters, focusing on attention head values, with results also indicating improved ICL performance at this larger and more naturalistic scale.</description>

      <title>Outcome-Refining Process Supervision for Code Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in code generation, yet they often struggle with complex programming tasks that require deep algorithmic reasoning. While process supervision through learned reward models shows promise in guiding reasoning steps, it requires expensive training data and suffers from unreliable evaluation. We propose Outcome-Refining Process Supervision, a novel paradigm that treats outcome refinement itself as the process to be supervised. Our framework leverages concrete execution signals to ground the supervision of reasoning steps, while using tree-structured exploration to maintain multiple solution trajectories simultaneously. Experiments demonstrate that our approach enables even smaller models to achieve high success accuracy and performance metrics on competitive programming tasks, creates more reliable verification than traditional reward models without requiring training PRMs. Our approach achieves significant improvements across 5 models and 3 datasets: an average of 26.9% increase in correctness and 42.2% in efficiency. The results suggest that providing structured reasoning space with concrete verification signals is crucial for solving complex programming tasks.

      <title>Adaptive Pruning for Large Language Models with Structural Importance Awareness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved language understanding and generation capabilities. However, it is difficult to deploy LLMs on resource-constrained edge devices due to their high computational and storage resource demands. To address this issue, we propose a novel LLM model pruning method, namely structurally-aware adaptive pruning (SAAP), to significantly reduce the computational and memory costs while maintaining model performance. We first define an adaptive importance fusion metric to evaluate the importance of all coupled structures in LLMs by considering their homoscedastic uncertainty. Then, we rank the importance of all modules to determine the specific layers that should be pruned to meet particular performance requirements. Furthermore, we develop a new group fine-tuning strategy to improve the inference efficiency of LLMs. Finally, we evaluate the proposed SAAP method on multiple LLMs across two common tasks, i.e., zero-shot classification and text generation. Experimental results show that our SAAP method outperforms several state-of-the-art baseline methods, achieving 2.17%, 2.37%, and 2.39% accuracy gains on LLaMA-7B, Vicuna-7B, and LLaMA-13B. Additionally, SAAP improves the token generation speed by 5%, showcasing its practical advantages in resource-constrained scenarios.</description>

      <title>Jet: A Modern Transformer-Based Normalizing Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the past, normalizing generative flows have emerged as a promising class of generative models for natural images. This type of model has many modeling advantages: the ability to efficiently compute log-likelihood of the input data, fast generation and simple overall structure. Normalizing flows remained a topic of active research but later fell out of favor, as visual quality of the samples was not competitive with other model classes, such as GANs, VQ-VAE-based approaches or diffusion models. In this paper we revisit the design of the coupling-based normalizing flow models by carefully ablating prior design choices and using computational blocks based on the Vision Transformer architecture, not convolutional neural networks. As a result, we achieve state-of-the-art quantitative and qualitative performance with a much simpler architecture. While the overall visual quality is still behind the current state-of-the-art models, we argue that strong normalizing flow models can help advancing research frontier by serving as building components of more powerful generative models.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Color Channel Independence for Improved Unsupervised Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Object-centric architectures can learn to extract distinct object representations from visual scenes, enabling downstream applications on the object level. Similarly to autoencoder-based image models, object-centric approaches have been trained on the unsupervised reconstruction loss of images encoded by RGB color spaces. In our work, we challenge the common assumption that RGB images are the optimal color space for unsupervised learning in computer vision. We discuss conceptually and empirically that other color spaces, such as HSV, bear essential characteristics for object-centric representation learning, like robustness to lighting conditions. We further show that models improve when requiring them to predict additional color channels. Specifically, we propose to transform the predicted targets to the RGB-S space, which extends RGB with HSV's saturation component and leads to markedly better reconstruction and disentanglement for five common evaluation datasets. The use of composite color spaces can be implemented with basically no computational overhead, is agnostic of the models' architecture, and is universally applicable across a wide range of visual computing tasks and training types. The findings of our approach encourage additional investigations in computer vision tasks beyond object-centric learning.</description>

      <title>Language Models as Continuous Self-Evolving Data Engineers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities on various tasks, while the further evolvement is limited to the lack of high-quality training data. In addition, traditional training approaches rely too much on expert-labeled data, setting an upper limit on the performance of LLMs. To address this issue, we propose a novel paradigm that enables LLMs to train itself by autonomously generating, cleaning, reviewing, and annotating data with preference information, named LANCE. Our approach demonstrates that LLMs can serve as continuous self-evolving data engineers, significantly reducing the time and cost of the post-training data construction process. Through iterative fine-tuning on different variants of the Qwen2, we validate the effectiveness of LANCE across various tasks, showing that it can continuously improve model performance and maintain high-quality data generation. Across eight benchmark dimensions, LANCE resulted in an average score enhancement of 3.36 for Qwen2-7B and 2.70 for Qwen2-7B-Instruct. This training paradigm with autonomous data construction not only reduces the reliance on human experts or external models but also ensures that the data aligns with human values and preferences, paving the way for the development of future superintelligent systems that can exceed human capabilities.</description>

      <title>Operationalising Rawlsian Ethics for Fairness in Norm-Learning Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Social norms are standards of behaviour common in a society. However, when agents make decisions without considering how others are impacted, norms can emerge that lead to the subjugation of certain agents. We present RAWL-E, a method to create ethical norm-learning agents. RAWL-E agents operationalise maximin, a fairness principle from Rawlsian ethics, in their decision-making processes to promote ethical norms by balancing societal well-being with individual goals. We evaluate RAWL-E agents in simulated harvesting scenarios. We find that norms emerging in RAWL-E agent societies enhance social welfare, fairness, and robustness, and yield higher minimum experience compared to those that emerge in agent societies that do not implement Rawlsian ethics.</description>

      <title>Human-Humanoid Robots Cross-Embodiment Behavior-Skill Transfer Using Decomposed Adversarial Learning from Demonstration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Humanoid robots are envisioned as embodied intelligent agents capable of performing a wide range of human-level loco-manipulation tasks, particularly in scenarios requiring strenuous and repetitive labor. However, learning these skills is challenging due to the high degrees of freedom of humanoid robots, and collecting sufficient training data for humanoid is a laborious process. Given the rapid introduction of new humanoid platforms, a cross-embodiment framework that allows generalizable skill transfer is becoming increasingly critical. To address this, we propose a transferable framework that reduces the data bottleneck by using a unified digital human model as a common prototype and bypassing the need for re-training on every new robot platform. The model learns behavior primitives from human demonstrations through adversarial imitation, and the complex robot structures are decomposed into functional components, each trained independently and dynamically coordinated. Task generalization is achieved through a human-object interaction graph, and skills are transferred to different robots via embodiment-specific kinematic motion retargeting and dynamic fine-tuning. Our framework is validated on five humanoid robots with diverse configurations, demonstrating stable loco-manipulation and highlighting its effectiveness in reducing data requirements and increasing the efficiency of skill transfer across platforms.</description>

      <title>LlamaFusion: Adapting Pretrained Language Models for Multimodal Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present LlamaFusion, a framework for empowering pretrained text-only large language models (LLMs) with multimodal generative capabilities, enabling them to understand and generate both text and images in arbitrary sequences. LlamaFusion leverages existing Llama-3's weights for processing texts autoregressively while introducing additional and parallel transformer modules for processing images with diffusion. During training, the data from each modality is routed to its dedicated modules: modality-specific feedforward layers, query-key-value projections, and normalization layers process each modality independently, while the shared self-attention layers allow interactions across text and image features. By freezing the text-specific modules and only training the image-specific modules, LlamaFusion preserves the language capabilities of text-only LLMs while developing strong visual understanding and generation abilities. Compared to methods that pretrain multimodal generative models from scratch, our experiments demonstrate that, LlamaFusion improves image understanding by 20% and image generation by 3.6% using only 50% of the FLOPs while maintaining Llama-3's language capabilities. We also demonstrate that this framework can adapt existing vision-language models with multimodal generation ability. Overall, this framework not only leverages existing computational investments in text-only LLMs but also enables the parallel development of language and vision capabilities, presenting a promising direction for efficient multimodal model development.</description>

      <title>DI-PCG: Diffusion-based Efficient Inverse Procedural Content Generation for High-quality 3D Asset Creation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Procedural Content Generation (PCG) is powerful in creating high-quality 3D contents, yet controlling it to produce desired shapes is difficult and often requires extensive parameter tuning. Inverse Procedural Content Generation aims to automatically find the best parameters under the input condition. However, existing sampling-based and neural network-based methods still suffer from numerous sample iterations or limited controllability. In this work, we present DI-PCG, a novel and efficient method for Inverse PCG from general image conditions. At its core is a lightweight diffusion transformer model, where PCG parameters are directly treated as the denoising target and the observed images as conditions to control parameter generation. DI-PCG is efficient and effective. With only 7.6M network parameters and 30 GPU hours to train, it demonstrates superior performance in recovering parameters accurately, and generalizing well to in-the-wild images. Quantitative and qualitative experiment results validate the effectiveness of DI-PCG in inverse PCG and image-to-3D generation tasks. DI-PCG offers a promising approach for efficient inverse PCG and represents a valuable exploration step towards a 3D generation path that models how to construct a 3D asset using parametric models.</description>

      <title>LongBench v2: Towards Deeper Understanding and Reasoning on Realistic Long-context Multitasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces LongBench v2, a benchmark designed to assess the ability of LLMs to handle long-context problems requiring deep understanding and reasoning across real-world multitasks. LongBench v2 consists of 503 challenging multiple-choice questions, with contexts ranging from 8k to 2M words, across six major task categories: single-document QA, multi-document QA, long in-context learning, long-dialogue history understanding, code repository understanding, and long structured data understanding. To ensure the breadth and the practicality, we collect data from nearly 100 highly educated individuals with diverse professional backgrounds. We employ both automated and manual review processes to maintain high quality and difficulty, resulting in human experts achieving only 53.7% accuracy under a 15-minute time constraint. Our evaluation reveals that the best-performing model, when directly answers the questions, achieves only 50.1% accuracy. In contrast, the o1-preview model, which includes longer reasoning, achieves 57.7%, surpassing the human baseline by 4%. These results highlight the importance of enhanced reasoning ability and scaling inference-time compute to tackle the long-context challenges in LongBench v2. The project is available at https://longbench2.github.io.</description>

      <title>PRIMA: Multi-Image Vision-Language Models for Reasoning Segmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite significant advancements in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), existing pixel-grounding models operate on single-image settings, limiting their ability to perform detailed, fine-grained comparisons across multiple images. Conversely, current multi-image understanding models lack pixel-level grounding. Our work addresses this gap by introducing the task of multi-image pixel-grounded reasoning segmentation, and PRIMA, a novel LVLM that integrates pixel-level grounding with robust multi-image reasoning capabilities to produce contextually rich, pixel-grounded explanations. Central to PRIMA is an efficient vision module that queries fine-grained visual representations across multiple images, reducing TFLOPs by $25.3\%$. To support training and evaluation, we curate $M^4Seg$, a new reasoning segmentation benchmark consisting of $\sim$224K question-answer pairs that require fine-grained visual understanding across multiple images. Experimental results demonstrate PRIMA outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.</description>

      <title>Scaling 4D Representations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scaling has not yet been convincingly demonstrated for pure self-supervised learning from video. However, prior work has focused evaluations on semantic-related tasks $\unicode{x2013}$ action classification, ImageNet classification, etc. In this paper we focus on evaluating self-supervised learning on non-semantic vision tasks that are more spatial (3D) and temporal (+1D = 4D), such as camera pose estimation, point and object tracking, and depth estimation. We show that by learning from very large video datasets, masked auto-encoding (MAE) with transformer video models actually scales, consistently improving performance on these 4D tasks, as model size increases from 20M all the way to the largest by far reported self-supervised video model $\unicode{x2013}$ 22B parameters. Rigorous apples-to-apples comparison with many recent image and video models demonstrates the benefits of scaling 4D representations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.00326v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ontology matching (OM) enables semantic interoperability between different ontologies and resolves their conceptual heterogeneity by aligning related entities. OM systems currently have two prevailing design paradigms: conventional knowledge-based expert systems and newer machine learning-based predictive systems. While large language models (LLMs) and LLM agents have revolutionised data engineering and have been applied creatively in many domains, their potential for OM remains underexplored. This study introduces a novel agent-powered LLM-based design paradigm for OM systems. With consideration of several specific challenges in leveraging LLM agents for OM, we propose a generic framework, namely Agent-OM (Agent for Ontology Matching), consisting of two Siamese agents for retrieval and matching, with a set of simple OM tools. Our framework is implemented in a proof-of-concept system. Evaluations of three Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative (OAEI) tracks over state-of-the-art OM systems show that our system can achieve results very close to the long-standing best performance on simple OM tasks and can significantly improve the performance on complex and few-shot OM tasks.</description>

      <title>Developing and Evaluating a Design Method for Positive Artificial Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01499v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) continues advancing, ensuring positive societal impacts becomes critical, especially as AI systems become increasingly ubiquitous in various aspects of life. However, developing "AI for good" poses substantial challenges around aligning systems with complex human values. Presently, we lack mature methods for addressing these challenges. This article presents and evaluates the Positive AI design method aimed at addressing this gap. The method provides a human-centered process to translate wellbeing aspirations into concrete practices. First, we explain the method's four key steps: contextualizing, operationalizing, optimizing, and implementing wellbeing supported by continuous measurement for feedback cycles. We then present a multiple case study where novice designers applied the method, revealing strengths and weaknesses related to efficacy and usability. Next, an expert evaluation study assessed the quality of the resulting concepts, rating them moderately high for feasibility, desirability, and plausibility of achieving intended wellbeing benefits. Together, these studies provide preliminary validation of the method's ability to improve AI design, while surfacing areas needing refinement like developing support for complex steps. Proposed adaptations such as examples and evaluation heuristics could address weaknesses. Further research should examine sustained application over multiple projects. This human-centered approach shows promise for realizing the vision of 'AI for Wellbeing' that does not just avoid harm, but actively benefits humanity.</description>

      <title>Hypothesis Generation with Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Effective generation of novel hypotheses is instrumental to scientific progress. So far, researchers have been the main powerhouse behind hypothesis generation by painstaking data analysis and thinking (also known as the Eureka moment). In this paper, we examine the potential of large language models (LLMs) to generate hypotheses. We focus on hypothesis generation based on data (i.e., labeled examples). To enable LLMs to handle arbitrarily long contexts, we generate initial hypotheses from a small number of examples and then update them iteratively to improve the quality of hypotheses. Inspired by multi-armed bandits, we design a reward function to inform the exploitation-exploration tradeoff in the update process. Our algorithm is able to generate hypotheses that enable much better predictive performance than few-shot prompting in classification tasks, improving accuracy by 31.7% on a synthetic dataset and by 13.9%, 3.3% and, 24.9% on three real-world datasets. We also outperform supervised learning by 12.8% and 11.2% on two challenging real-world datasets. Furthermore, we find that the generated hypotheses not only corroborate human-verified theories but also uncover new insights for the tasks.</description>

      <title>AndroidWorld: A Dynamic Benchmarking Environment for Autonomous Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14573v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Autonomous agents that execute human tasks by controlling computers can enhance human productivity and application accessibility. However, progress in this field will be driven by realistic and reproducible benchmarks. We present AndroidWorld, a fully functional Android environment that provides reward signals for 116 programmatic tasks across 20 real-world Android apps. Unlike existing interactive environments, which provide a static test set, AndroidWorld dynamically constructs tasks that are parameterized and expressed in natural language in unlimited ways, thus enabling testing on a much larger and more realistic suite of tasks. To ensure reproducibility, each task includes dedicated initialization, success-checking, and tear-down logic, which modifies and inspects the device's system state. We experiment with baseline agents to test AndroidWorld and provide initial results on the benchmark. Our best agent can complete 30.6% of AndroidWorld's tasks, leaving ample room for future work. Furthermore, we adapt a popular desktop web agent to work on Android, which we find to be less effective on mobile, suggesting future research is needed to achieve universal, cross-platform agents. Finally, we also conduct a robustness analysis, showing that task variations can significantly affect agent performance, demonstrating that without such testing, agent performance metrics may not fully reflect practical challenges. AndroidWorld and the experiments in this paper are available at github.com/google-research/android_world.</description>

      <title>IDEA: Enhancing the Rule Learning Ability of Large Language Model Agent through Induction, Deduction, and Abduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10455v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have been thoroughly evaluated for deductive and inductive reasoning, their proficiency in holistic rule learning in interactive environments remains less explored. We introduce RULEARN, a novel benchmark to assess the rule-learning abilities of LLM agents in interactive settings. In RULEARN, agents strategically interact with simulated environments to gather observations, discern patterns, and solve complex problems. To enhance the rule-learning capabilities for LLM agents, we propose IDEA, a novel reasoning framework that integrates the process of Induction, Deduction, and Abduction. The IDEA agent generates initial hypotheses from limited observations through abduction, devises plans to validate these hypotheses or leverages them to solve problems via deduction, and refines previous hypotheses through induction, dynamically establishing and applying rules that mimic human rule-learning behaviors. Our evaluation of the IDEA framework, which involves five representative LLMs, demonstrates significant improvements over the baseline. Furthermore, our study with human participants reveals notable discrepancies in rule-learning behaviors between humans and LLMs. We believe our benchmark will serve as a valuable and challenging resource, and IDEA will provide crucial insights for the development of LLM agents capable of human-like rule learning in real-world scenarios. Our code and data is publicly available.</description>

      <title>A Deployed Online Reinforcement Learning Algorithm In An Oral Health Clinical Trial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02069v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dental disease is a prevalent chronic condition associated with substantial financial burden, personal suffering, and increased risk of systemic diseases. Despite widespread recommendations for twice-daily tooth brushing, adherence to recommended oral self-care behaviors remains sub-optimal due to factors such as forgetfulness and disengagement. To address this, we developed Oralytics, a mHealth intervention system designed to complement clinician-delivered preventative care for marginalized individuals at risk for dental disease. Oralytics incorporates an online reinforcement learning algorithm to determine optimal times to deliver intervention prompts that encourage oral self-care behaviors. We have deployed Oralytics in a registered clinical trial. The deployment required careful design to manage challenges specific to the clinical trials setting in the U.S. In this paper, we (1) highlight key design decisions of the RL algorithm that address these challenges and (2) conduct a re-sampling analysis to evaluate algorithm design decisions. A second phase (randomized control trial) of Oralytics is planned to start in spring 2025.</description>

      <title>Why Is Anything Conscious?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14545v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We tackle the hard problem of consciousness taking the naturally selected, embodied organism as our starting point. We provide a formalism describing how biological systems self-organise to hierarchically interpret unlabelled sensory information according to valence. Such interpretations imply behavioural policies which are differentiated from each other only by the qualitative aspect of information processing. Natural selection favours systems that intervene in the world to achieve homeostatic and reproductive goals. Quality is a property arising in such systems to link cause to affect to motivate interventions. This produces interoceptive and exteroceptive classifiers and determines priorities. In formalising the seminal distinction between access and phenomenal consciousness, we claim that access consciousness at the human level requires the ability to hierarchically model i) the self, ii) the world/others and iii) the self as modelled by others, and that this requires phenomenal consciousness. Phenomenal without access consciousness is likely common, but the reverse is implausible. To put it provocatively: death grounds meaning, and Nature does not like zombies. We then describe the multilayered architecture of self-organisation from rocks to Einstein, illustrating how our argument applies. Our proposal lays the foundation of a formal science of consciousness, closer to human fact than zombie fiction.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Planning for LLM-based Graphical User Interface Automation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00467v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The advent of large language models (LLMs) has spurred considerable interest in advancing autonomous LLMs-based agents, particularly in intriguing applications within smartphone graphical user interfaces (GUIs). When presented with a task goal, these agents typically emulate human actions within a GUI environment until the task is completed. However, a key challenge lies in devising effective plans to guide action prediction in GUI tasks, though planning have been widely recognized as effective for decomposing complex tasks into a series of steps. Specifically, given the dynamic nature of environmental GUIs following action execution, it is crucial to dynamically adapt plans based on environmental feedback and action history.We show that the widely-used ReAct approach fails due to the excessively long historical dialogues. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach called Dynamic Planning of Thoughts (D-PoT) for LLM-based GUI agents.D-PoT involves the dynamic adjustment of planning based on the environmental feedback and execution history. Experimental results reveal that the proposed D-PoT significantly surpassed the strong GPT-4V baseline by +12.7% (34.66% $\rightarrow$ 47.36%) in accuracy. The analysis highlights the generality of dynamic planning in different backbone LLMs, as well as the benefits in mitigating hallucinations and adapting to unseen tasks.

      <title>SafeDrive: Knowledge- and Data-Driven Risk-Sensitive Decision-Making for Autonomous Vehicles with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13238v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in autonomous vehicles (AVs) use Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform well in normal driving scenarios. However, ensuring safety in dynamic, high-risk environments and managing safety-critical long-tail events remain significant challenges. To address these issues, we propose SafeDrive, a knowledge- and data-driven risk-sensitive decision-making framework to enhance AV safety and adaptability. The proposed framework introduces a modular system comprising: (1) a Risk Module for quantifying multi-factor coupled risks involving driver, vehicle, and road interactions; (2) a Memory Module for storing and retrieving typical scenarios to improve adaptability; (3) a LLM-powered Reasoning Module for context-aware safety decision-making; and (4) a Reflection Module for refining decisions through iterative learning. By integrating knowledge-driven insights with adaptive learning mechanisms, the framework ensures robust decision-making under uncertain conditions. Extensive evaluations on real-world traffic datasets, including highways (HighD), intersections (InD), and roundabouts (RounD), validate the framework's ability to enhance decision-making safety (achieving a 100% safety rate), replicate human-like driving behaviors (with decision alignment exceeding 85%), and adapt effectively to unpredictable scenarios. SafeDrive establishes a novel paradigm for integrating knowledge- and data-driven methods, highlighting significant potential to improve safety and adaptability of autonomous driving in high-risk traffic scenarios.

      <title>Selective Uncertainty Propagation in Offline RL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.00284v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the finite-horizon offline reinforcement learning (RL) setting, and are motivated by the challenge of learning the policy at any step h in dynamic programming (DP) algorithms. To learn this, it is sufficient to evaluate the treatment effect of deviating from the behavioral policy at step h after having optimized the policy for all future steps. Since the policy at any step can affect next-state distributions, the related distributional shift challenges can make this problem far more statistically hard than estimating such treatment effects in the stochastic contextual bandit setting. However, the hardness of many real-world RL instances lies between the two regimes. We develop a flexible and general method called selective uncertainty propagation for confidence interval construction that adapts to the hardness of the associated distribution shift challenges. We show benefits of our approach on toy environments and demonstrate the benefits of these techniques for offline policy learning.</description>

      <title>Towards Fair Machine Learning Software: Understanding and Addressing Model Bias Through Counterfactual Thinking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.08018v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The increasing use of Machine Learning (ML) software can lead to unfair and unethical decisions, thus fairness bugs in software are becoming a growing concern. Addressing these fairness bugs often involves sacrificing ML performance, such as accuracy. To address this issue, we present a novel counterfactual approach that uses counterfactual thinking to tackle the root causes of bias in ML software. In addition, our approach combines models optimized for both performance and fairness, resulting in an optimal solution in both aspects. We conducted a thorough evaluation of our approach on 10 benchmark tasks using a combination of 5 performance metrics, 3 fairness metrics, and 15 measurement scenarios, all applied to 8 real-world datasets. The conducted extensive evaluations show that the proposed method significantly improves the fairness of ML software while maintaining competitive performance, outperforming state-of-the-art solutions in 84.6% of overall cases based on a recent benchmarking tool.</description>

      <title>UOR: Universal Backdoor Attacks on Pre-trained Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.09574v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Backdoors implanted in pre-trained language models (PLMs) can be transferred to various downstream tasks, which exposes a severe security threat. However, most existing backdoor attacks against PLMs are un-targeted and task-specific. Few targeted and task-agnostic methods use manually pre-defined triggers and output representations, which prevent the attacks from being more effective and general. In this paper, we first summarize the requirements that a more threatening backdoor attack against PLMs should satisfy, and then propose a new backdoor attack method called UOR, which breaks the bottleneck of the previous approach by turning manual selection into automatic optimization. Specifically, we define poisoned supervised contrastive learning which can automatically learn the more uniform and universal output representations of triggers for various PLMs. Moreover, we use gradient search to select appropriate trigger words which can be adaptive to different PLMs and vocabularies. Experiments show that our method can achieve better attack performance on various text classification tasks compared to manual methods. Further, we tested our method on PLMs with different architectures, different usage paradigms, and more difficult tasks, which demonstrated the universality of our method.</description>

      <title>Scaling Laws for Imitation Learning in Single-Agent Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.09423v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Imitation Learning (IL) is one of the most widely used methods in machine learning. Yet, many works find it is often unable to fully recover the underlying expert behavior, even in constrained environments like single-agent games. However, none of these works deeply investigate the role of scaling up the model and data size. Inspired by recent work in Natural Language Processing (NLP) where "scaling up" has resulted in increasingly more capable LLMs, we investigate whether carefully scaling up model and data size can bring similar improvements in the imitation learning setting for single-agent games. We first demonstrate our findings on a variety of Atari games, and thereafter focus on the extremely challenging game of NetHack. In all games, we find that IL loss and mean return scale smoothly with the compute budget (FLOPs) and are strongly correlated, resulting in power laws for training compute-optimal IL agents. Finally, we forecast and train several NetHack agents with IL and find they outperform prior state-of-the-art by 1.5x in all settings. Our work both demonstrates the scaling behavior of imitation learning in a variety of single-agent games, as well as the viability of scaling up current approaches for increasingly capable agents in NetHack, a game that remains elusively hard for current AI systems.</description>

      <title>DTW+S: Shape-based Comparison of Time-series with Ordered Local Trend</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.03579v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Measuring distance or similarity between time-series data is a fundamental aspect of many applications including classification, clustering, and ensembling/alignment. Existing measures may fail to capture similarities among local trends (shapes) and may even produce misleading results. Our goal is to develop a measure that looks for similar trends occurring around similar times and is easily interpretable for researchers in applied domains. This is particularly useful for applications where time-series have a sequence of meaningful local trends that are ordered, such as in epidemics (a surge to an increase to a peak to a decrease). We propose a novel measure, DTW+S, which creates an interpretable "closeness-preserving" matrix representation of the time-series, where each column represents local trends, and then it applies Dynamic Time Warping to compute distances between these matrices. We present a theoretical analysis that supports the choice of this representation. We demonstrate the utility of DTW+S in several tasks. For the clustering of epidemic curves, we show that DTW+S is the only measure able to produce good clustering compared to the baselines. For ensemble building, we propose a combination of DTW+S and barycenter averaging that results in the best preservation of characteristics of the underlying trajectories. We also demonstrate that our approach results in better classification compared to Dynamic Time Warping for a class of datasets, particularly when local trends rather than scale play a decisive role.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.13008v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce DavIR, a model-based data selection method for post-training Large Language Models. DavIR generalizes Reducible Holdout Loss to core-set selection problem of causal language modeling, and quantifies the learnability of a given datum with respect to a pre-trained LLM based on relative reduction in loss during fine-tuning, a metric we show to be closely related to the implicit reward model described in Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). We show that 6% of Alpaca dataset selected with DavIR can steer both the LLaMA and Gemma model family to produce superior performance compared to the same models trained on the full 52K dataset. We also show that Alpaca dataset compressed with DavIR can be combined with GSM8K dataset to effectively balance open-domain freeform QA and mathematical reasoning capabilities. Finally, we apply the DavIR objective to DPO and develop a normalized DavIR-DPO objective which improves alignment performance of Zephyr-7B-SFT model by 8% (relative) on AlpacaEval, compared against training on vanilla DPO objective.</description>

      <title>MetaSymNet: A Tree-like Symbol Network with Adaptive Architecture and Activation Functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.07326v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mathematical formulas serve as the means of communication between humans and nature, encapsulating the operational laws governing natural phenomena. The concise formulation of these laws is a crucial objective in scientific research and an important challenge for artificial intelligence (AI). While traditional artificial neural networks (MLP) excel at data fitting, they often yield uninterpretable black box results that hinder our understanding of the relationship between variables x and predicted values y. Moreover, the fixed network architecture in MLP often gives rise to redundancy in both network structure and parameters. To address these issues, we propose MetaSymNet, a novel neural network that dynamically adjusts its structure in real-time, allowing for both expansion and contraction. This adaptive network employs the PANGU meta function as its activation function, which is a unique type capable of evolving into various basic functions during training to compose mathematical formulas tailored to specific needs. We then evolve the neural network into a concise, interpretable mathematical expression. To evaluate MetaSymNet's performance, we compare it with four state-of-the-art symbolic regression algorithms across more than 10 public datasets comprising 222 formulas. Our experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms others consistently regardless of noise presence or absence. Furthermore, we assess MetaSymNet against MLP and SVM regarding their fitting ability and extrapolation capability, these are two essential aspects of machine learning algorithms. The findings reveal that our algorithm excels in both areas. Finally, we compared MetaSymNet with MLP using iterative pruning in network structure complexity. The results show that MetaSymNet's network structure complexity is obviously less than MLP under the same goodness of fit.</description>

      <title>DualDynamics: Synergizing Implicit and Explicit Methods for Robust Irregular Time Series Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04979v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Real-world time series analysis faces significant challenges when dealing with irregular and incomplete data. While Neural Differential Equation (NDE) based methods have shown promise, they struggle with limited expressiveness, scalability issues, and stability concerns. Conversely, Neural Flows offer stability but falter with irregular data. We introduce 'DualDynamics', a novel framework that synergistically combines NDE-based method and Neural Flow-based method. This approach enhances expressive power while balancing computational demands, addressing critical limitations of existing techniques. We demonstrate DualDynamics' effectiveness across diverse tasks: classification of robustness to dataset shift, irregularly-sampled series analysis, interpolation of missing data, and forecasting with partial observations. Our results show consistent outperformance over state-of-the-art methods, indicating DualDynamics' potential to advance irregular time series analysis significantly.</description>

      <title>From Training-Free to Adaptive: Empirical Insights into MLLMs' Understanding of Detection Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17981v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the impressive capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in integrating text and image modalities, challenges remain in accurately interpreting detailed visual elements. Vision detection models excel at recognizing fine-grained image details, prompting researchers to use them to enhance MLLMs. One effective strategy is to infuse detection information in text format, which has proven simple and effective. However, most studies utilize this method without training, leaving the potential of adaptive training largely unexplored. Adaptive training could significantly enhance MLLMs' comprehension of unique inputs while filtering out irrelevant information. This paper addresses the crucial question: How does training impact MLLMs' understanding of infused textual detection information? We systematically experiment with various representative models to evaluate the effects of training-free, retraining, and fine-tuning strategies. We also examine the influence of training on MLLMs' original abilities and the interchangeability of detection models. Our findings indicate that fine-tuning a pre-trained MLLM to incorporate textual detection information delivers superior results compared to training-free and retraining methods, improving performance by 6.71% across 10 widely recognized benchmarks. Furthermore, fine-tuning enables MLLMs to retain performance enhancements even when detection models are swapped, indicating improved understanding of formatted textual data. We release our codes to support further exploration of fusion strategies for vision detection models and the enhancement of MLLMs' fine-grained multimodal capabilities.</description>

      <title>DNS-Rec: Data-aware Neural Architecture Search for Recommender Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.00390v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the era of data proliferation, efficiently sifting through vast information to extract meaningful insights has become increasingly crucial. This paper addresses the computational overhead and resource inefficiency prevalent in existing Sequential Recommender Systems (SRSs). We introduce an innovative approach combining pruning methods with advanced model designs. Furthermore, we delve into resource-constrained Neural Architecture Search (NAS), an emerging technique in recommender systems, to optimize models in terms of FLOPs, latency, and energy consumption while maintaining or enhancing accuracy. Our principal contribution is the development of a Data-aware Neural Architecture Search for Recommender System (DNS-Rec). DNS-Rec is specifically designed to tailor compact network architectures for attention-based SRS models, thereby ensuring accuracy retention. It incorporates data-aware gates to enhance the performance of the recommendation network by learning information from historical user-item interactions. Moreover, DNS-Rec employs a dynamic resource constraint strategy, stabilizing the search process and yielding more suitable architectural solutions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through rigorous experiments conducted on three benchmark datasets, which highlight the superiority of DNS-Rec in SRSs. Our findings set a new standard for future research in efficient and accurate recommendation systems, marking a significant step forward in this rapidly evolving field.</description>

      <title>XTSFormer: Cross-Temporal-Scale Transformer for Irregular-Time Event Prediction in Clinical Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02258v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Adverse clinical events related to unsafe care are among the top ten causes of death in the U.S. Accurate modeling and prediction of clinical events from electronic health records (EHRs) play a crucial role in patient safety enhancement. An example is modeling de facto care pathways that characterize common step-by-step plans for treatment or care. However, clinical event data pose several unique challenges, including the irregularity of time intervals between consecutive events, the existence of cycles, periodicity, multi-scale event interactions, and the high computational costs associated with long event sequences. Existing neural temporal point processes (TPPs) methods do not effectively capture the multi-scale nature of event interactions, which is common in many real-world clinical applications. To address these issues, we propose the cross-temporal-scale transformer (XTSFormer), specifically designed for irregularly timed event data. Our model consists of two vital components: a novel Feature-based Cycle-aware Time Positional Encoding (FCPE) that adeptly captures the cyclical nature of time, and a hierarchical multi-scale temporal attention mechanism, where different temporal scales are determined by a bottom-up clustering approach. Extensive experiments on several real-world EHR datasets show that our XTSFormer outperforms multiple baseline methods. The code is available at https://github.com/spatialdatasciencegroup/XTSFormer.</description>

      <title>Hands-Free VR</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15083v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The paper introduces Hands-Free VR, a voice-based natural-language interface for VR. The user gives a command using their voice, the speech audio data is converted to text using a speech-to-text deep learning model that is fine-tuned for robustness to word phonetic similarity and to spoken English accents, and the text is mapped to an executable VR command using a large language model that is robust to natural language diversity. Hands-Free VR was evaluated in a controlled within-subjects study (N = 22) that asked participants to find specific objects and to place them in various configurations. In the control condition participants used a conventional VR user interface to grab, carry, and position the objects using the handheld controllers. In the experimental condition participants used Hands-Free VR. The results confirm that: (1) Hands-Free VR is robust to spoken English accents, as for 20 of our participants English was not their first language, and to word phonetic similarity, correctly transcribing the voice command 96.71% of the time; (2) Hands-Free VR is robust to natural language diversity, correctly mapping the transcribed command to an executable command in 97.83% of the time; (3) Hands-Free VR had a significant efficiency advantage over the conventional VR interface in terms of task completion time, total viewpoint translation, total view direction rotation, and total left and right hand translations; (4) Hands-Free VR received high user preference ratings in terms of ease of use, intuitiveness, ergonomics, reliability, and desirability.</description>

      <title>Spectral Motion Alignment for Video Motion Transfer using Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15249v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The evolution of diffusion models has greatly impacted video generation and understanding. Particularly, text-to-video diffusion models (VDMs) have significantly facilitated the customization of input video with target appearance, motion, etc. Despite these advances, challenges persist in accurately distilling motion information from video frames. While existing works leverage the consecutive frame residual as the target motion vector, they inherently lack global motion context and are vulnerable to frame-wise distortions. To address this, we present Spectral Motion Alignment (SMA), a novel framework that refines and aligns motion vectors using Fourier and wavelet transforms. SMA learns motion patterns by incorporating frequency-domain regularization, facilitating the learning of whole-frame global motion dynamics, and mitigating spatial artifacts. Extensive experiments demonstrate SMA's efficacy in improving motion transfer while maintaining computational efficiency and compatibility across various video customization frameworks.</description>

      <title>Analyzing Consumer IoT Traffic from Security and Privacy Perspectives: a Comprehensive Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16149v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Consumer Internet of Things (CIoT), a notable segment within the IoT domain, involves the integration of IoT technology into consumer electronics and devices, such as smart homes and smart wearables. Compared to traditional IoT fields, CIoT differs notably in target users, product types, and design approaches. While offering convenience to users, it also raises new security and privacy concerns. Network traffic analysis, a widely used technique in the security community, has been extensively applied to investigate these concerns about CIoT. Compared to network traffic analysis in other fields such as mobile apps and websites, CIoT presents unique characteristics, introducing new challenges and research opportunities. Researchers have made significant contributions in this area. To aid researchers in understanding the application of traffic analysis tools for studying CIoT security and privacy risks, this survey reviews 303 publications on traffic analysis within the CIoT security and privacy domain from January 2018 to June 2024, focusing on three research questions. Our work: 1) outlines the CIoT traffic analysis process and highlights its differences from general network traffic analysis. 2) summarizes and classifies existing research into four categories according to its application objectives: device fingerprinting, user activity inference, malicious traffic detection, and measurement. 3) explores emerging challenges and potential future research directions based on each step of the CIoT traffic analysis process. This will provide new insights to the community and guide the industry towards safer product designs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01349v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success across various domains. However, despite their promising performance in numerous real-world applications, most of these algorithms lack fairness considerations. Consequently, they may lead to discriminatory outcomes against certain communities, particularly marginalized populations, prompting extensive study in fair LLMs. On the other hand, fairness in LLMs, in contrast to fairness in traditional machine learning, entails exclusive backgrounds, taxonomies, and fulfillment techniques. To this end, this survey presents a comprehensive overview of recent advances in the existing literature concerning fair LLMs. Specifically, a brief introduction to LLMs is provided, followed by an analysis of factors contributing to bias in LLMs. Additionally, the concept of fairness in LLMs is discussed categorically, summarizing metrics for evaluating bias in LLMs and existing algorithms for promoting fairness. Furthermore, resources for evaluating bias in LLMs, including toolkits and datasets, are summarized. Finally, existing research challenges and open questions are discussed.</description>

      <title>Clustering of timed sequences -- Application to the analysis of care pathways</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15379v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Improving the future of healthcare starts by better understanding the current actual practices in hospital settings. This motivates the objective of discovering typical care pathways from patient data. Revealing typical care pathways can be achieved through clustering. The difficulty in clustering care pathways, represented by sequences of timestamped events, lies in defining a semantically appropriate metric and clustering algorithms. In this article, we adapt two methods developed for time series to the clustering of timed sequences: the drop-DTW metric and the DBA approach for the construction of averaged time sequences. These methods are then applied in clustering algorithms to propose original and sound clustering algorithms for timed sequences. This approach is experimented with and evaluated on synthetic and real-world data.</description>

      <title>Towards trustable SHAP scores</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00076v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: SHAP scores represent the proposed use of the well-known Shapley values in eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI). Recent work has shown that the exact computation of SHAP scores can produce unsatisfactory results. Concretely, for some ML models, SHAP scores will mislead with respect to relative feature influence. To address these limitations, recently proposed alternatives exploit different axiomatic aggregations, all of which are defined in terms of abductive explanations. However, the proposed axiomatic aggregations are not Shapley values. This paper investigates how SHAP scores can be modified so as to extend axiomatic aggregations to the case of Shapley values in XAI. More importantly, the proposed new definition of SHAP scores avoids all the known cases where unsatisfactory results have been identified. The paper also characterizes the complexity of computing the novel definition of SHAP scores, highlighting families of classifiers for which computing these scores is tractable. Furthermore, the paper proposes modifications to the existing implementations of SHAP scores. These modifications eliminate some of the known limitations of SHAP scores, and have negligible impact in terms of performance.</description>

      <title>SCONE: A Novel Stochastic Sampling to Generate Contrastive Views and Hard Negative Samples for Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00287v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph-based collaborative filtering (CF) has emerged as a promising approach in recommender systems. Despite its achievements, graph-based CF models face challenges due to data sparsity and negative sampling. In this paper, we propose a novel Stochastic sampling for i) COntrastive views and ii) hard NEgative samples (SCONE) to overcome these issues. SCONE generates dynamic augmented views and diverse hard negative samples via a unified stochastic sampling approach based on score-based generative models. Our extensive experiments on 6 benchmark datasets show that SCONE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. SCONE shows efficacy in addressing user sparsity and item popularity issues, while enhancing performance for both cold-start users and long-tail items. Furthermore, our approach improves the diversity of the recommendation and the uniformity of the representations. The code is available at https://github.com/jeongwhanchoi/SCONE.</description>

      <title>A Unified Framework for Human-Allied Learning of Probabilistic Circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02413v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Probabilistic Circuits (PCs) have emerged as an efficient framework for representing and learning complex probability distributions. Nevertheless, the existing body of research on PCs predominantly concentrates on data-driven parameter learning, often neglecting the potential of knowledge-intensive learning, a particular issue in data-scarce/knowledge-rich domains such as healthcare. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel unified framework that can systematically integrate diverse domain knowledge into the parameter learning process of PCs. Experiments on several benchmarks as well as real world datasets show that our proposed framework can both effectively and efficiently leverage domain knowledge to achieve superior performance compared to purely data-driven learning approaches.</description>

      <title>Mitigating federated learning contribution allocation instability through randomized aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08044v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a collaborative and privacy-preserving Machine Learning paradigm, allowing the development of robust models without the need to centralise sensitive data. A critical challenge in FL lies in fairly and accurately allocating contributions from diverse participants. Inaccurate allocation can undermine trust, lead to unfair compensation, and thus participants may lack the incentive to join or actively contribute to the federation.
  Various remuneration strategies have been proposed to date, including auction-based approaches and Shapley-value based methods, the latter offering a means to quantify the contribution of each participant. However, little to no work has studied the stability of these contribution evaluation methods.
  In this paper, we focus on calculating contributions using gradient-based model reconstruction techniques with Shapley values. We first show that baseline Shapley values do not accurately reflect clients' contributions, leading to unstable reward allocations amongst participants in a cross-silo federation. We then introduce \textsc{FedRandom}, a new method that mitigates these shortcomings with additional data samplings, and show its efficacy at increasing the stability of contribution evaluation in federated learning.</description>

Abstract: Recent endeavors towards directly using large language models (LLMs) as agent models to execute interactive planning tasks have shown commendable results. Despite their achievements, however, they still struggle with brainless trial-and-error in global planning and generating hallucinatory actions in local planning due to their poor understanding of the ``real'' physical world. Imitating humans' mental world knowledge model which provides global prior knowledge before the task and maintains local dynamic knowledge during the task, in this paper, we introduce parametric World Knowledge Model (WKM) to facilitate agent planning. Concretely, we steer the agent model to self-synthesize knowledge from both expert and sampled trajectories. Then we develop WKM, providing prior task knowledge to guide the global planning and dynamic state knowledge to assist the local planning. Experimental results on three complex real-world simulated datasets with three state-of-the-art open-source LLMs, Mistral-7B, Gemma-7B, and Llama-3-8B, demonstrate that our method can achieve superior performance compared to various strong baselines. Besides, we analyze to illustrate that our WKM can effectively alleviate the blind trial-and-error and hallucinatory action issues, providing strong support for the agent's understanding of the world. Other interesting findings include: 1) our instance-level task knowledge can generalize better to unseen tasks, 2) weak WKM can guide strong agent model planning, and 3) unified WKM training has promising potential for further development.

      <title>SLIFER: Investigating Performance and Robustness of Malware Detection Pipelines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14478v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As a result of decades of research, Windows malware detection is approached through a plethora of techniques. However, there is an ongoing mismatch between academia -- which pursues an optimal performances in terms of detection rate and low false alarms -- and the requirements of real-world scenarios. In particular, academia focuses on combining static and dynamic analysis within a single or ensemble of models, falling into several pitfalls like (i) firing dynamic analysis without considering the computational burden it requires; (ii) discarding impossible-to-analyze samples; and (iii) analyzing robustness against adversarial attacks without considering that malware detectors are complemented with more non-machine-learning components. Thus, in this paper we bridge these gaps, by investigating the properties of malware detectors built with multiple and different types of analysis. To do so, we develop SLIFER, a Windows malware detection pipeline sequentially leveraging both static and dynamic analysis, interrupting computations as soon as one module triggers an alarm, requiring dynamic analysis only when needed. Contrary to the state of the art, we investigate how to deal with samples that impede analyzes, showing how much they impact performances, concluding that it is better to flag them as legitimate to not drastically increase false alarms. Lastly, we perform a robustness evaluation of SLIFER. Counter-intuitively, the injection of new content is either blocked more by signatures than dynamic analysis, due to byte artifacts created by the attack, or it is able to avoid detection from signatures, as they rely on constraints on file size disrupted by attacks. As far as we know, we are the first to investigate the properties of sequential malware detectors, shedding light on their behavior in real production environment.</description>

      <title>WISE: Rethinking the Knowledge Memory for Lifelong Model Editing of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14768v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) need knowledge updates to meet the ever-growing world facts and correct the hallucinated responses, facilitating the methods of lifelong model editing. Where the updated knowledge resides in memories is a fundamental question for model editing. In this paper, we find that editing either long-term memory (direct model parameters) or working memory (non-parametric knowledge of neural network activations/representations by retrieval) will result in an impossible triangle -- reliability, generalization, and locality can not be realized together in the lifelong editing settings. For long-term memory, directly editing the parameters will cause conflicts with irrelevant pretrained knowledge or previous edits (poor reliability and locality). For working memory, retrieval-based activations can hardly make the model understand the edits and generalize (poor generalization). Therefore, we propose WISE to bridge the gap between memories. In WISE, we design a dual parametric memory scheme, which consists of the main memory for the pretrained knowledge and a side memory for the edited knowledge. We only edit the knowledge in the side memory and train a router to decide which memory to go through when given a query. For continual editing, we devise a knowledge-sharding mechanism where different sets of edits reside in distinct subspaces of parameters, and are subsequently merged into a shared memory without conflicts. Extensive experiments show that WISE can outperform previous model editing methods and overcome the impossible triangle under lifelong model editing of question answering, hallucination, and out-of-distribution settings across trending LLM architectures, e.g., GPT, LLaMA, and Mistral.

      <title>Knowledge Circuits in Pretrained Transformers</title>

Abstract: The remarkable capabilities of modern large language models are rooted in their vast repositories of knowledge encoded within their parameters, enabling them to perceive the world and engage in reasoning. The inner workings of how these models store knowledge have long been a subject of intense interest and investigation among researchers. To date, most studies have concentrated on isolated components within these models, such as the Multilayer Perceptrons and attention head. In this paper, we delve into the computation graph of the language model to uncover the knowledge circuits that are instrumental in articulating specific knowledge. The experiments, conducted with GPT2 and TinyLLAMA, have allowed us to observe how certain information heads, relation heads, and Multilayer Perceptrons collaboratively encode knowledge within the model. Moreover, we evaluate the impact of current knowledge editing techniques on these knowledge circuits, providing deeper insights into the functioning and constraints of these editing methodologies. Finally, we utilize knowledge circuits to analyze and interpret language model behaviors such as hallucinations and in-context learning. We believe the knowledge circuits hold potential for advancing our understanding of Transformers and guiding the improved design of knowledge editing.

      <title>Guiding a Diffusion Model with a Bad Version of Itself</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02507v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The primary axes of interest in image-generating diffusion models are image quality, the amount of variation in the results, and how well the results align with a given condition, e.g., a class label or a text prompt. The popular classifier-free guidance approach uses an unconditional model to guide a conditional model, leading to simultaneously better prompt alignment and higher-quality images at the cost of reduced variation. These effects seem inherently entangled, and thus hard to control. We make the surprising observation that it is possible to obtain disentangled control over image quality without compromising the amount of variation by guiding generation using a smaller, less-trained version of the model itself rather than an unconditional model. This leads to significant improvements in ImageNet generation, setting record FIDs of 1.01 for 64x64 and 1.25 for 512x512, using publicly available networks. Furthermore, the method is also applicable to unconditional diffusion models, drastically improving their quality.</description>

      <title>RU-AI: A Large Multimodal Dataset for Machine-Generated Content Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04906v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent generative AI models' capability of creating realistic and human-like content is significantly transforming the ways in which people communicate, create and work. The appropriate use of generative AI models can benefit society, while their misuse poses threats to the society. However, the lack of aligned multimodal datasets has inhibited the development of effective and robust methods for detecting machine-generated content, particularly in triple-modality settings (e.g., text, image, and voice). In this paper, we introduce RU-AI, a new large-scale multimodal dataset for robust and efficient detection of machine-generated content in text, image and voice. Our dataset is constructed on the basis of three large publicly available datasets: Flickr8K, COCO and Places205, by adding their corresponding AI duplicates, resulting total of 1,475,370 data instances. In addition, we create a noise variant of each modality of the datasets aiming to analyse the models' robustness. Given our dataset, we conduct extensive experiments with the current SOTA detection methods. The results reveal that existing models still struggle to achieve accurate and robust classification after training on our dataset. The RU-AI dataset is designed to support the development of detection methods across modalities and can be effectively utilised for identifying machine-generated content.

      <title>Do Parameters Reveal More than Loss for Membership Inference?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11544v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Membership inference attacks are used as a key tool for disclosure auditing. They aim to infer whether an individual record was used to train a model. While such evaluations are useful to demonstrate risk, they are computationally expensive and often make strong assumptions about potential adversaries' access to models and training environments, and thus do not provide tight bounds on leakage from potential attacks. We show how prior claims around black-box access being sufficient for optimal membership inference do not hold for stochastic gradient descent, and that optimal membership inference indeed requires white-box access. Our theoretical results lead to a new white-box inference attack, IHA (Inverse Hessian Attack), that explicitly uses model parameters by taking advantage of computing inverse-Hessian vector products. Our results show that both auditors and adversaries may be able to benefit from access to model parameters, and we advocate for further research into white-box methods for membership inference.</description>

      <title>DialSim: A Real-Time Simulator for Evaluating Long-Term Multi-Party Dialogue Understanding of Conversational Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13144v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced the capabilities of conversational agents, making them applicable to various fields (e.g., education). Despite their progress, the evaluation of the agents often overlooks the complexities of real-world conversations, such as real-time interactions, multi-party dialogues, and extended contextual dependencies. To bridge this gap, we introduce DialSim, a real-time dialogue simulator. In this simulator, an agent is assigned the role of a character from popular TV shows, requiring it to respond to spontaneous questions using past dialogue information and to distinguish between known and unknown information. Key features of DialSim include assessing the agent's ability to respond within a reasonable time limit, handling long-term multi-party dialogues, and evaluating performance under randomized questioning with LongDialQA, a novel, high-quality question-answering dataset. Our experiments using DialSim reveal the strengths and weaknesses of the latest conversational agents, offering valuable insights for future advancements in conversational AI. DialSim is available at https://dialsim.github.io/.</description>

      <title>AI-Driven Mobility Management for High-Speed Railway Communications: Compressed Measurements and Proactive Handover</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04336v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-speed railway (HSR) communications are pivotal for ensuring rail safety, operations, maintenance, and delivering passenger information services. The high speed of trains creates rapidly time-varying wireless channels, increases the signaling overhead, and reduces the system throughput, making it difficult to meet the growing and stringent needs of HSR applications. In this article, we explore artificial intelligence (AI)-based beam-level and cell-level mobility management suitable for HSR communications. Particularly, we propose a compressed spatial multi-beam measurements scheme via compressive sensing for beam-level mobility management in HSR communications. In comparison to traditional down-sampling spatial beam measurements, this method leads to improved spatial-temporal beam prediction accuracy with the same measurement overhead. Moreover, we propose a novel AI-based proactive handover scheme to predict handover events and reduce radio link failure (RLF) rates in HSR communications. Compared with the traditional event A3-based handover mechanism, the proposed approach significantly reduces the RLF rates which saves 50% beam measurement overhead.</description>

      <title>ANAH-v2: Scaling Analytical Hallucination Annotation of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04693v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit hallucinations in long-form question-answering tasks across various domains and wide applications. Current hallucination detection and mitigation datasets are limited in domains and sizes, which struggle to scale due to prohibitive labor costs and insufficient reliability of existing hallucination annotators. To facilitate the scalable oversight of LLM hallucinations, this paper introduces an iterative self-training framework that simultaneously and progressively scales up the hallucination annotation dataset and improves the accuracy of the hallucination annotator. Based on the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm, in each iteration, the framework first applies a hallucination annotation pipeline to annotate a scaled dataset and then trains a more accurate hallucination annotator on the dataset. This new hallucination annotator is adopted in the hallucination annotation pipeline used for the next iteration. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the finally obtained hallucination annotator with only 7B parameters surpasses the performance of GPT-4 and obtains new state-of-the-art hallucination detection results on HaluEval and HalluQA by zero-shot inference. Such an annotator can not only evaluate the hallucination levels of various LLMs on the large-scale dataset but also help to mitigate the hallucination of LLMs generations, with the Natural Language Inference (NLI) metric increasing from 25% to 37% on HaluEval.</description>

      <title>Exploring Scalability of Self-Training for Open-Vocabulary Temporal Action Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07024v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The vocabulary size in temporal action localization (TAL) is limited by the scarcity of large-scale annotated datasets. To overcome this, recent works integrate vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, for open-vocabulary TAL (OV-TAL). However, despite the success of VLMs trained on extensive datasets, existing OV-TAL methods still rely on human-labeled TAL datasets of limited size to train action localizers, limiting their generalizability. In this paper, we explore the scalability of self-training with unlabeled YouTube videos for OV-TAL. Our approach consists of two stages: (1) a class-agnostic action localizer is trained on a human-labeled TAL dataset to generate pseudo-labels for unlabeled videos, and (2) the large-scale pseudo-labeled dataset is then used to train the localizer. Extensive experiments demonstrate that leveraging web-scale videos in self-training significantly enhances the generalizability of an action localizer. Additionally, we identify limitations in existing OV-TAL evaluation schemes and propose a new benchmark for thorough assessment. Finally, we showcase the TAL performance of the large multimodal model Gemini-1.5 on our new benchmark. Code is released at https://github.com/HYUNJS/STOV-TAL.</description>

      <title>Almost-linear Time Approximation Algorithm to Euclidean $k$-median and $k$-means</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11217v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Clustering is one of the staples of data analysis and unsupervised learning. As such, clustering algorithms are often used on massive data sets, and they need to be extremely fast. We focus on the Euclidean $k$-median and $k$-means problems, two of the standard ways to model the task of clustering.
  For these, the go-to algorithm is $k$-means++, which yields an $O(\log k)$-approximation in time $\tilde O(nkd)$. While it is possible to improve either the approximation factor [Lattanzi and Sohler, ICML19] or the running time [Cohen-Addad et al., NeurIPS 20], it is unknown how precise a linear-time algorithm can be.
  In this paper, we almost answer this question by presenting an almost linear-time algorithm to compute a constant-factor approximation.</description>

      <title>Multi-Agent Trajectory Prediction with Difficulty-Guided Feature Enhancement Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18551v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Trajectory prediction is crucial for autonomous driving as it aims to forecast the future movements of traffic participants. Traditional methods usually perform holistic inference on the trajectories of agents, neglecting the differences in prediction difficulty among agents. This paper proposes a novel Difficulty-Guided Feature Enhancement Network (DGFNet), which leverages the prediction difficulty differences among agents for multi-agent trajectory prediction. Firstly, we employ spatio-temporal feature encoding and interaction to capture rich spatio-temporal features. Secondly, a difficulty-guided decoder controls the flow of future trajectories into subsequent modules, obtaining reliable future trajectories. Then, feature interaction and fusion are performed through the future feature interaction module. Finally, the fused agent features are fed into the final predictor to generate the predicted trajectory distributions for multiple participants. Experimental results demonstrate that our DGFNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Argoverse 1\&amp;2 motion forecasting benchmarks. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of each module. Moreover, compared with SOTA methods, our method balances trajectory prediction accuracy and real-time inference speed.</description>

      <title>Improving Retrieval Augmented Language Model with Self-Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19813v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Retrieval-Augmented Language Model (RALM) has shown remarkable performance on knowledge-intensive tasks by incorporating external knowledge during inference, which mitigates the factual hallucinations inherited in large language models (LLMs). Despite these advancements, challenges persist in the implementation of RALMs, particularly concerning their reliability and traceability. To be specific, the irrelevant document retrieval may result in unhelpful response generation or even deteriorate the performance of LLMs, while the lack of proper citations in generated outputs complicates efforts to verify the trustworthiness of the models. To this end, we propose a novel self-reasoning framework aimed at improving the reliability and traceability of RALMs, whose core idea is to leverage reasoning trajectories generated by the LLM itself. The framework involves constructing self-reason trajectories with three processes: a relevance-aware process, an evidence-aware selective process, and a trajectory analysis process. We have evaluated our framework across four public datasets (two short-form QA datasets, one long-form QA dataset, and one fact verification dataset) to demonstrate the superiority of our method, which can outperform existing state-of-the-art models and can achieve comparable performance with GPT-4, while only using 2,000 training samples.</description>

      <title>Safetywashing: Do AI Safety Benchmarks Actually Measure Safety Progress?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21792v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As artificial intelligence systems grow more powerful, there has been increasing interest in "AI safety" research to address emerging and future risks. However, the field of AI safety remains poorly defined and inconsistently measured, leading to confusion about how researchers can contribute. This lack of clarity is compounded by the unclear relationship between AI safety benchmarks and upstream general capabilities (e.g., general knowledge and reasoning). To address these issues, we conduct a comprehensive meta-analysis of AI safety benchmarks, empirically analyzing their correlation with general capabilities across dozens of models and providing a survey of existing directions in AI safety. Our findings reveal that many safety benchmarks highly correlate with both upstream model capabilities and training compute, potentially enabling "safetywashing" -- where capability improvements are misrepresented as safety advancements. Based on these findings, we propose an empirical foundation for developing more meaningful safety metrics and define AI safety in a machine learning research context as a set of clearly delineated research goals that are empirically separable from generic capabilities advancements. In doing so, we aim to provide a more rigorous framework for AI safety research, advancing the science of safety evaluations and clarifying the path towards measurable progress.</description>

      <title>Img-Diff: Contrastive Data Synthesis for Multimodal Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04594v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-performance Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are heavily dependent on data quality. To advance fine-grained image recognition within MLLMs, we introduce a novel data synthesis method inspired by contrastive learning and image difference captioning. Our key idea involves challenging the model to discern both matching and distinct elements by scrutinizing object differences in detailed regions across similar images. We begin by generating pairs of similar images that emphasize object variations. Following this, we employ a Difference Area Generator to pinpoint object differences, and subsequently, a Difference Captions Generator to articulate these differences. This process results in a high-quality dataset of "object replacement" samples, termed Img-Diff, which can be scaled as needed due to its automated nature. We leverage this generated dataset to fine-tune state-of-the-art (SOTA) MLLMs, such as InternVL2, achieving substantial improvements across various image difference and Visual Question Answering tasks. Notably, the trained models significantly outperform existing SOTA models like GPT-4V and Gemini on the MMVP benchmark. Additionally, we conduct comprehensive evaluations to validate the dataset's diversity, quality, and robustness, offering several insights into the synthesis of such contrastive datasets. We release our codes and dataset to encourage further research on multimodal data synthesis and MLLMs' fundamental capabilities for image understanding.</description>

      <title>Super-intelligence or Superstition? Exploring Psychological Factors Influencing Belief in AI Predictions about Personal Behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06602v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Could belief in AI predictions be just another form of superstition? This study investigates psychological factors that influence belief in AI predictions about personal behavior, comparing it to belief in astrology- and personality-based predictions. Through an experiment with 238 participants, we examined how cognitive style, paranormal beliefs, AI attitudes, personality traits, and other factors affect perceived validity, reliability, usefulness, and personalization of predictions from different sources. Our findings reveal that belief in AI predictions is positively correlated with belief in predictions based on astrology and personality psychology. Notably, paranormal beliefs and positive attitudes about AI significantly increased perceived validity, reliability, usefulness, and personalization of AI predictions. Conscientiousness was negatively correlated with belief in predictions across all sources, and interest in the prediction topic increased believability across predictions. Surprisingly, we found no evidence that cognitive style has an impact on belief in fictitious AI-generated predictions. These results highlight the "rational superstition" phenomenon in AI, where belief is driven more by mental heuristics and intuition than critical evaluation. This research advances our understanding of the psychology of human-AI interaction, offering insights into designing and promoting AI systems that foster appropriate trust and skepticism, critical for responsible integration in an increasingly AI-driven world.</description>

      <title>Alignment-Enhanced Decoding:Defending via Token-Level Adaptive Refining of Probability Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07663v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models are susceptible to jailbreak attacks, which can result in the generation of harmful content. While prior defenses mitigate these risks by perturbing or inspecting inputs, they ignore competing objectives, the underlying cause of alignment failures. In this paper, we propose Alignment-Enhanced Decoding (AED), a novel defense that employs adaptive decoding to address the root causes of jailbreak issues. We first define the Competitive Index to quantify alignment failures and utilize feedback from self-evaluation to compute post-alignment logits. Then, AED adaptively combines AED and post-alignment logits with the original logits to obtain harmless and helpful distributions. Consequently, our method enhances safety alignment while maintaining helpfulness. We conduct experiments across five models and four common jailbreaks, with the results validating the effectiveness of our approach. Code is available at https://github.com/GIGABaozi/AED.git.</description>

      <title>OCTCube-M: A 3D multimodal optical coherence tomography foundation model for retinal and systemic diseases with cross-cohort and cross-device validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11227v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present OCTCube-M, a 3D OCT-based multi-modal foundation model for jointly analyzing OCT and en face images. OCTCube-M first developed OCTCube, a 3D foundation model pre-trained on 26,685 3D OCT volumes encompassing 1.62 million 2D OCT images. It then exploits a novel multi-modal contrastive learning framework COEP to integrate other retinal imaging modalities, such as fundus autofluorescence and infrared retinal imaging, into OCTCube, efficiently extending it into multi-modal foundation models. OCTCube achieves best performance on predicting 8 retinal diseases, demonstrating strong generalizability on cross-cohort, cross-device and cross-modality prediction. OCTCube can also predict cross-organ nodule malignancy (CT) and low cardiac ejection fraction as well as systemic diseases, such as diabetes and hypertension, revealing its wide applicability beyond retinal diseases. We further develop OCTCube-IR using COEP with 26,685 OCT and IR image pairs. OCTCube-IR can accurately retrieve between OCT and IR images, allowing joint analysis between 3D and 2D retinal imaging modalities. Finally, we trained a tri-modal foundation model OCTCube-EF from 4 million 2D OCT images and 400K en face retinal images. OCTCube-EF attains the best performance on predicting the growth rate of geographic atrophy (GA) across datasets collected from 6 multi-center global trials conducted in 23 countries. This improvement is statistically equivalent to running a clinical trial with more than double the size of the original study. Our analysis based on another retrospective case study reveals OCTCube-EF's ability to avoid false positive Phase-III results according to its accurate treatment effect estimation on the Phase-II results. In sum, OCTCube-M is a 3D multi-modal foundation model framework that integrates OCT and other retinal imaging modalities revealing substantial diagnostic and prognostic benefits.</description>

      <title>Sum of Squares Circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11778v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Designing expressive generative models that support exact and efficient inference is a core question in probabilistic ML. Probabilistic circuits (PCs) offer a framework where this tractability-vs-expressiveness trade-off can be analyzed theoretically. Recently, squared PCs encoding subtractive mixtures via negative parameters have emerged as tractable models that can be exponentially more expressive than monotonic PCs, i.e., PCs with positive parameters only. In this paper, we provide a more precise theoretical characterization of the expressiveness relationships among these models. First, we prove that squared PCs can be less expressive than monotonic ones. Second, we formalize a novel class of PCs -- sum of squares PCs -- that can be exponentially more expressive than both squared and monotonic PCs. Around sum of squares PCs, we build an expressiveness hierarchy that allows us to precisely unify and separate different tractable model classes such as Born Machines and PSD models, and other recently introduced tractable probabilistic models by using complex parameters. Finally, we empirically show the effectiveness of sum of squares circuits in performing distribution estimation.</description>

      <title>LLMs as Zero-shot Graph Learners: Alignment of GNN Representations with LLM Token Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14512v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Zero-shot graph machine learning, especially with graph neural networks (GNNs), has garnered significant interest due to the challenge of scarce labeled data. While methods like self-supervised learning and graph prompt learning have been extensively explored, they often rely on fine-tuning with task-specific labels, limiting their effectiveness in zero-shot scenarios. Inspired by the zero-shot capabilities of instruction-fine-tuned large language models (LLMs), we introduce a novel framework named Token Embedding-Aligned Graph Language Model (TEA-GLM) that leverages LLMs as cross-dataset and cross-task zero-shot learners for graph machine learning. Concretely, we pretrain a GNN, aligning its representations with token embeddings of an LLM. We then train a linear projector that transforms the GNN's representations into a fixed number of graph token embeddings without tuning the LLM. A unified instruction is designed for various graph tasks at different levels, such as node classification (node-level) and link prediction (edge-level). These design choices collectively enhance our method's effectiveness in zero-shot learning, setting it apart from existing methods. Experiments show that our graph token embeddings help the LLM predictor achieve state-of-the-art performance on unseen datasets and tasks compared to other methods using LLMs as predictors.</description>

      <title>Cycle Pixel Difference Network for Crisp Edge Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04272v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Edge detection, as a fundamental task in computer vision, has garnered increasing attention. The advent of deep learning has significantly advanced this field. However, recent deep learning-based methods generally face two significant issues: 1) reliance on large-scale pre-trained weights, and 2) generation of thick edges. We construct a U-shape encoder-decoder model named CPD-Net that successfully addresses these two issues simultaneously. In response to issue 1), we propose a novel cycle pixel difference convolution (CPDC), which effectively integrates edge prior knowledge with modern convolution operations, consequently successfully eliminating the dependence on large-scale pre-trained weights. As for issue 2), we construct a multi-scale information enhancement module (MSEM) and a dual residual connection-based (DRC) decoder to enhance the edge location ability of the model, thereby generating crisp and clean contour maps. Comprehensive experiments conducted on four standard benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance on the BSDS500 dataset (ODS=0.813 and AC=0.352), NYUD-V2 (ODS=0.760 and AC=0.223), BIPED dataset (ODS=0.898 and AC=0.426), and CID (ODS=0.59). Our approach provides a novel perspective for addressing these challenges in edge detection.</description>

      <title>Alt-MoE: Multimodal Alignment via Alternating Optimization of Multi-directional MoE with Unimodal Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05929v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent Large Multi-Modal Models (LMMs) have made significant advancements in multi-modal alignment by employing lightweight connection modules to facilitate the representation and fusion of knowledge from existing pre-trained uni-modal models. However, these methods still rely on modality-specific and direction-specific connectors, leading to compartmentalized knowledge representations and reduced computational efficiency, which limits the model's ability to form unified multi-modal representations. To address these issues, we introduce a novel training framework, Alt-MoE, which employs the Mixture of Experts (MoE) as a unified multi-directional connector across modalities, and employs a multi-step sequential alternating unidirectional alignment strategy, which converges to bidirectional alignment over iterations. The extensive empirical studies revealed the following key points: 1) Alt-MoE achieves competitive results by integrating diverse knowledge representations from uni-modal models. This approach seamlessly fuses the specialized expertise of existing high-performance uni-modal models, effectively synthesizing their domain-specific knowledge into a cohesive multi-modal representation. 2) Alt-MoE efficiently scales to new tasks and modalities without altering its model architecture or training strategy. Furthermore, Alt-MoE operates in latent space, supporting vector pre-storage and real-time retrieval via lightweight multi-directional MoE, thereby facilitating massive data processing. Our methodology has been validated on several well-performing uni-modal models (LLAMA3, Qwen2, and DINOv2), achieving competitive results on a wide range of downstream tasks and datasets.</description>

      <title>Knowledge Tagging with Large Language Model based Multi-Agent System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08406v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Knowledge tagging for questions is vital in modern intelligent educational applications, including learning progress diagnosis, practice question recommendations, and course content organization. Traditionally, these annotations have been performed by pedagogical experts, as the task demands not only a deep semantic understanding of question stems and knowledge definitions but also a strong ability to link problem-solving logic with relevant knowledge concepts. With the advent of advanced natural language processing (NLP) algorithms, such as pre-trained language models and large language models (LLMs), pioneering studies have explored automating the knowledge tagging process using various machine learning models. In this paper, we investigate the use of a multi-agent system to address the limitations of previous algorithms, particularly in handling complex cases involving intricate knowledge definitions and strict numerical constraints. By demonstrating its superior performance on the publicly available math question knowledge tagging dataset, MathKnowCT, we highlight the significant potential of an LLM-based multi-agent system in overcoming the challenges that previous methods have encountered. Finally, through an in-depth discussion of the implications of automating knowledge tagging, we underscore the promising results of deploying LLM-based algorithms in educational contexts.</description>

      <title>Distribution-Level Feature Distancing for Machine Unlearning: Towards a Better Trade-off Between Model Utility and Forgetting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14747v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the explosive growth of deep learning applications and increasing privacy concerns, the right to be forgotten has become a critical requirement in various AI industries. For example, given a facial recognition system, some individuals may wish to remove their personal data that might have been used in the training phase. Unfortunately, deep neural networks sometimes unexpectedly leak personal identities, making this removal challenging. While recent machine unlearning algorithms aim to enable models to forget specific data, we identify an unintended utility drop-correlation collapse-in which the essential correlations between image features and true labels weaken during the forgetting process. To address this challenge, we propose Distribution-Level Feature Distancing (DLFD), a novel method that efficiently forgets instances while preserving task-relevant feature correlations. Our method synthesizes data samples by optimizing the feature distribution to be distinctly different from that of forget samples, achieving effective results within a single training epoch. Through extensive experiments on facial recognition datasets, we demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art machine unlearning methods in both forgetting performance and model utility preservation.</description>

      <title>Erase then Rectify: A Training-Free Parameter Editing Approach for Cost-Effective Graph Unlearning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16684v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph unlearning, which aims to eliminate the influence of specific nodes, edges, or attributes from a trained Graph Neural Network (GNN), is essential in applications where privacy, bias, or data obsolescence is a concern. However, existing graph unlearning techniques often necessitate additional training on the remaining data, leading to significant computational costs, particularly with large-scale graphs. To address these challenges, we propose a two-stage training-free approach, Erase then Rectify (ETR), designed for efficient and scalable graph unlearning while preserving the model utility. Specifically, we first build a theoretical foundation showing that masking parameters critical for unlearned samples enables effective unlearning. Building on this insight, the Erase stage strategically edits model parameters to eliminate the impact of unlearned samples and their propagated influence on intercorrelated nodes. To further ensure the GNN's utility, the Rectify stage devises a gradient approximation method to estimate the model's gradient on the remaining dataset, which is then used to enhance model performance. Overall, ETR achieves graph unlearning without additional training or full training data access, significantly reducing computational overhead and preserving data privacy. Extensive experiments on seven public datasets demonstrate the consistent superiority of ETR in model utility, unlearning efficiency, and unlearning effectiveness, establishing it as a promising solution for real-world graph unlearning challenges.</description>

      <title>Unleashing the Unseen: Harnessing Benign Datasets for Jailbreaking Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00451v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite significant ongoing efforts in safety alignment, large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 and LLaMA 3 remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks that can induce harmful behaviors, including through the use of adversarial suffixes. Building on prior research, we hypothesize that these adversarial suffixes are not mere bugs but may represent features that can dominate the LLM's behavior. To evaluate this hypothesis, we conduct several experiments. First, we demonstrate that benign features can be effectively made to function as adversarial suffixes, i.e., we develop a feature extraction method to extract sample-agnostic features from benign dataset in the form of suffixes and show that these suffixes may effectively compromise safety alignment. Second, we show that adversarial suffixes generated from jailbreak attacks may contain meaningful features, i.e., appending the same suffix to different prompts results in responses exhibiting specific characteristics. Third, we show that such benign-yet-safety-compromising features can be easily introduced through fine-tuning using only benign datasets. As a result, we are able to completely eliminate GPT's safety alignment in a blackbox setting through finetuning with only benign data. Our code and data is available at \url{https://github.com/suffix-maybe-feature/adver-suffix-maybe-features}.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Diffusion Transformers with Token-wise Feature Caching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05317v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion transformers have shown significant effectiveness in both image and video synthesis at the expense of huge computation costs. To address this problem, feature caching methods have been introduced to accelerate diffusion transformers by caching the features in previous timesteps and reusing them in the following timesteps. However, previous caching methods ignore that different tokens exhibit different sensitivities to feature caching, and feature caching on some tokens may lead to 10$\times$ more destruction to the overall generation quality compared with other tokens. In this paper, we introduce token-wise feature caching, allowing us to adaptively select the most suitable tokens for caching, and further enable us to apply different caching ratios to neural layers in different types and depths. Extensive experiments on PixArt-$\alpha$, OpenSora, and DiT demonstrate our effectiveness in both image and video generation with no requirements for training. For instance, 2.36$\times$ and 1.93$\times$ acceleration are achieved on OpenSora and PixArt-$\alpha$ with almost no drop in generation quality.</description>

      <title>Human and LLM Biases in Hate Speech Annotations: A Socio-Demographic Analysis of Annotators and Targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07991v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rise of online platforms exacerbated the spread of hate speech, demanding scalable and effective detection. However, the accuracy of hate speech detection systems heavily relies on human-labeled data, which is inherently susceptible to biases. While previous work has examined the issue, the interplay between the characteristics of the annotator and those of the target of the hate are still unexplored. We fill this gap by leveraging an extensive dataset with rich socio-demographic information of both annotators and targets, uncovering how human biases manifest in relation to the target's attributes. Our analysis surfaces the presence of widespread biases, which we quantitatively describe and characterize based on their intensity and prevalence, revealing marked differences. Furthermore, we compare human biases with those exhibited by persona-based LLMs. Our findings indicate that while persona-based LLMs do exhibit biases, these differ significantly from those of human annotators. Overall, our work offers new and nuanced results on human biases in hate speech annotations, as well as fresh insights into the design of AI-driven hate speech detection systems.</description>

      <title>Audio Captioning RAG via Generative Pair-to-Pair Retrieval with Refined Knowledge Base</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10913v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in audio understanding tasks leverage the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. However, adapting LLMs to learn audio concepts requires massive training data and substantial computational resources. To address these challenges, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) retrieves audio-text pairs from a knowledge base (KB) and augments them with query audio to generate accurate textual responses. In RAG, the relevance of the retrieved information plays a crucial role in effectively processing the input. In this paper, we analyze how different retrieval methods and knowledge bases impact the relevance of audio-text pairs and the performance of audio captioning with RAG. We propose generative pair-to-pair retrieval, which uses the generated caption as a text query to accurately find relevant audio-text pairs to the query audio, thereby improving the relevance and accuracy of retrieved information. Additionally, we refine the large-scale knowledge base to retain only audio-text pairs that align with the contextualized intents. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on benchmarks including AudioCaps, Clotho, and Auto-ACD, with detailed ablation studies validating the effectiveness of our retrieval and KB construction methods.</description>

      <title>ETF: An Entity Tracing Framework for Hallucination Detection in Code Summaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14748v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced their ability to understand both natural language and code, driving their use in tasks like natural language-to-code (NL2Code) and code summarization. However, LLMs are prone to hallucination-outputs that stray from intended meanings. Detecting hallucinations in code summarization is especially difficult due to the complex interplay between programming and natural languages. We introduce a first-of-its-kind dataset with $\sim$10K samples, curated specifically for hallucination detection in code summarization. We further propose a novel Entity Tracing Framework (ETF) that a) utilizes static program analysis to identify code entities from the program and b) uses LLMs to map and verify these entities and their intents within generated code summaries. Our experimental analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of the framework, leading to a 0.73 F1 score. This approach provides an interpretable method for detecting hallucinations by grounding entities, allowing us to evaluate summary accuracy.</description>

      <title>Accelerating AI Performance using Anderson Extrapolation on GPUs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19460v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel approach for accelerating AI performance by leveraging Anderson extrapolation, a vector-to-vector mapping technique based on a window of historical iterations. By identifying the crossover point (Fig. 1) where a mixing penalty is incurred, the method focuses on reducing iterations to convergence, with fewer more compute-intensive but generally cacheable iterations, balancing speed and memory usage with accuracy and algorithmic stability, respectively. We demonstrate significant improvements, in both training and inference, motivated by scalability and efficiency extensions to the realm of high-performance computing (HPC).</description>

      <title>Learning Infinitesimal Generators of Continuous Symmetries from Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21853v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Exploiting symmetry inherent in data can significantly improve the sample efficiency of a learning procedure and the generalization of learned models. When data clearly reveals underlying symmetry, leveraging this symmetry can naturally inform the design of model architectures or learning strategies. Yet, in numerous real-world scenarios, identifying the specific symmetry within a given data distribution often proves ambiguous. To tackle this, some existing works learn symmetry in a data-driven manner, parameterizing and learning expected symmetry through data. However, these methods often rely on explicit knowledge, such as pre-defined Lie groups, which are typically restricted to linear or affine transformations. In this paper, we propose a novel symmetry learning algorithm based on transformations defined with one-parameter groups, continuously parameterized transformations flowing along the directions of vector fields called infinitesimal generators. Our method is built upon minimal inductive biases, encompassing not only commonly utilized symmetries rooted in Lie groups but also extending to symmetries derived from nonlinear generators. To learn these symmetries, we introduce a notion of a validity score that examine whether the transformed data is still valid for the given task. The validity score is designed to be fully differentiable and easily computable, enabling effective searches for transformations that achieve symmetries innate to the data. We apply our method mainly in two domains: image data and partial differential equations, and demonstrate its advantages. Our codes are available at \url{https://github.com/kogyeonghoon/learning-symmetry-from-scratch.git}.</description>

      <title>DECRL: A Deep Evolutionary Clustering Jointed Temporal Knowledge Graph Representation Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22631v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Temporal Knowledge Graph (TKG) representation learning aims to map temporal evolving entities and relations to embedded representations in a continuous low-dimensional vector space. However, existing approaches cannot capture the temporal evolution of high-order correlations in TKGs. To this end, we propose a Deep Evolutionary Clustering jointed temporal knowledge graph Representation Learning approach (DECRL). Specifically, a deep evolutionary clustering module is proposed to capture the temporal evolution of high-order correlations among entities. Furthermore, a cluster-aware unsupervised alignment mechanism is introduced to ensure the precise one-to-one alignment of soft overlapping clusters across timestamps, thereby maintaining the temporal smoothness of clusters. In addition, an implicit correlation encoder is introduced to capture latent correlations between any pair of clusters under the guidance of a global graph. Extensive experiments on seven real-world datasets demonstrate that DECRL achieves the state-of-the-art performances, outperforming the best baseline by an average of 9.53%, 12.98%, 10.42%, and 14.68% in MRR, Hits@1, Hits@3, and Hits@10, respectively.</description>

      <title>Conditioned quantum-assisted deep generative surrogate for particle-calorimeter interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22870v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Particle collisions at accelerators such as the Large Hadron Collider, recorded and analyzed by experiments such as ATLAS and CMS, enable exquisite measurements of the Standard Model and searches for new phenomena. Simulations of collision events at these detectors have played a pivotal role in shaping the design of future experiments and analyzing ongoing ones. However, the quest for accuracy in Large Hadron Collider (LHC) collisions comes at an imposing computational cost, with projections estimating the need for millions of CPU-years annually during the High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) run \cite{collaboration2022atlas}. Simulating a single LHC event with \textsc{Geant4} currently devours around 1000 CPU seconds, with simulations of the calorimeter subdetectors in particular imposing substantial computational demands \cite{rousseau2023experimental}. To address this challenge, we propose a conditioned quantum-assisted deep generative model. Our model integrates a conditioned variational autoencoder (VAE) on the exterior with a conditioned Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) in the latent space, providing enhanced expressiveness compared to conventional VAEs. The RBM nodes and connections are meticulously engineered to enable the use of qubits and couplers on D-Wave's Pegasus-structured \textit{Advantage} quantum annealer (QA) for sampling. We introduce a novel method for conditioning the quantum-assisted RBM using \textit{flux biases}. We further propose a novel adaptive mapping to estimate the effective inverse temperature in quantum annealers. The effectiveness of our framework is illustrated using Dataset 2 of the CaloChallenge \cite{calochallenge}.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Spurious Correlations via Disagreement Probability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01757v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Models trained with empirical risk minimization (ERM) are prone to be biased towards spurious correlations between target labels and bias attributes, which leads to poor performance on data groups lacking spurious correlations. It is particularly challenging to address this problem when access to bias labels is not permitted. To mitigate the effect of spurious correlations without bias labels, we first introduce a novel training objective designed to robustly enhance model performance across all data samples, irrespective of the presence of spurious correlations. From this objective, we then derive a debiasing method, Disagreement Probability based Resampling for debiasing (DPR), which does not require bias labels. DPR leverages the disagreement between the target label and the prediction of a biased model to identify bias-conflicting samples-those without spurious correlations-and upsamples them according to the disagreement probability. Empirical evaluations on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that DPR achieves state-of-the-art performance over existing baselines that do not use bias labels. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical analysis that details how DPR reduces dependency on spurious correlations.</description>

      <title>Explanations that reveal all through the definition of encoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02664v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Feature attributions attempt to highlight what inputs drive predictive power. Good attributions or explanations are thus those that produce inputs that retain this predictive power; accordingly, evaluations of explanations score their quality of prediction. However, evaluations produce scores better than what appears possible from the values in the explanation for a class of explanations, called encoding explanations. Probing for encoding remains a challenge because there is no general characterization of what gives the extra predictive power. We develop a definition of encoding that identifies this extra predictive power via conditional dependence and show that the definition fits existing examples of encoding. This definition implies, in contrast to encoding explanations, that non-encoding explanations contain all the informative inputs used to produce the explanation, giving them a "what you see is what you get" property, which makes them transparent and simple to use. Next, we prove that existing scores (ROAR, FRESH, EVAL-X) do not rank non-encoding explanations above encoding ones, and develop STRIPE-X which ranks them correctly. After empirically demonstrating the theoretical insights, we use STRIPE-X to show that despite prompting an LLM to produce non-encoding explanations for a sentiment analysis task, the LLM-generated explanations encode.</description>

      <title>ZAHA: Introducing the Level of Facade Generalization and the Large-Scale Point Cloud Facade Semantic Segmentation Benchmark Dataset</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04865v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Facade semantic segmentation is a long-standing challenge in photogrammetry and computer vision. Although the last decades have witnessed the influx of facade segmentation methods, there is a lack of comprehensive facade classes and data covering the architectural variability. In ZAHA, we introduce Level of Facade Generalization (LoFG), novel hierarchical facade classes designed based on international urban modeling standards, ensuring compatibility with real-world challenging classes and uniform methods' comparison. Realizing the LoFG, we present to date the largest semantic 3D facade segmentation dataset, providing 601 million annotated points at five and 15 classes of LoFG2 and LoFG3, respectively. Moreover, we analyze the performance of baseline semantic segmentation methods on our introduced LoFG classes and data, complementing it with a discussion on the unresolved challenges for facade segmentation. We firmly believe that ZAHA shall facilitate further development of 3D facade semantic segmentation methods, enabling robust segmentation indispensable in creating urban digital twins.</description>

      <title>SageAttention2: Efficient Attention with Thorough Outlier Smoothing and Per-thread INT4 Quantization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10958v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although quantization for linear layers has been widely used, its application to accelerate the attention process remains limited. To further enhance the efficiency of attention computation compared to SageAttention while maintaining precision, we propose SageAttention2, which utilizes significantly faster 4-bit matrix multiplication (Matmul) alongside additional precision-enhancing techniques. First, we propose to quantize matrixes $(Q, K)$ to INT4 in a hardware-friendly thread-level granularity and quantize matrixes $(\widetilde P, V)$ to FP8. Second, we propose a method to smooth $Q$, enhancing the accuracy of INT4 $QK$. Third, we propose to use an FP32 Matmul buffer for $PV$ to enhance the accuracy of FP8 $\widetilde PV$. The operations per second (OPS) of SageAttention2 surpass FlashAttention2 and xformers by about 3x and 5x on RTX4090, respectively. Comprehensive experiments confirm that our approach incurs negligible end-to-end metrics loss across diverse models, including those for large language processing, image generation, and video generation. The codes are available at https://github.com/thu-ml/SageAttention.</description>

      <title>Video-RAG: Visually-aligned Retrieval-Augmented Long Video Comprehension</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13093v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing large video-language models (LVLMs) struggle to comprehend long videos correctly due to limited context. To address this problem, fine-tuning long-context LVLMs and employing GPT-based agents have emerged as promising solutions. However, fine-tuning LVLMs would require extensive high-quality data and substantial GPU resources, while GPT-based agents would rely on proprietary models (e.g., GPT-4o). In this paper, we propose Video Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Video-RAG), a training-free and cost-effective pipeline that employs visually-aligned auxiliary texts to help facilitate cross-modality alignment while providing additional information beyond the visual content. Specifically, we leverage open-source external tools to extract visually-aligned information from pure video data (e.g., audio, optical character, and object detection), and incorporate the extracted information into an existing LVLM as auxiliary texts, alongside video frames and queries, in a plug-and-play manner. Our Video-RAG offers several key advantages: (i) lightweight with low computing overhead due to single-turn retrieval; (ii) easy implementation and compatibility with any LVLM; and (iii) significant, consistent performance gains across long video understanding benchmarks, including Video-MME, MLVU, and LongVideoBench. Notably, our model demonstrates superior performance over proprietary models like Gemini-1.5-Pro and GPT-4o when utilized with a 72B model.</description>

      <title>BayLing 2: A Multilingual Large Language Model with Efficient Language Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16300v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), with their powerful generative capabilities and vast knowledge, empower various tasks in everyday life. However, these abilities are primarily concentrated in high-resource languages, leaving low-resource languages with weaker generative capabilities and relatively limited knowledge. Enhancing the multilingual capabilities of LLMs is therefore crucial for serving over 100 linguistic communities worldwide. An intuitive approach to enhance the multilingual capabilities would be to construct instruction data for various languages, but constructing instruction data for over 100 languages is prohibitively costly. In this paper, we introduce BayLing 2, which efficiently transfers generative capabilities and knowledge from high-resource languages to low-resource languages through language alignment. To achieve this, we constructed a dataset of 3.2 million instructions, comprising high-resource language instructions (Chinese and English) and cross-lingual instructions for 100+ languages and performed instruction tuning based on the dataset to facilitate the capability transfer between languages. Using Llama as the foundation model, we developed BayLing-2-7B, BayLing-2-13B, and BayLing-2-8B, and conducted a comprehensive evaluation of BayLing. For multilingual translation across 100+ languages, BayLing shows superior performance compared to open-source models of similar scale. For multilingual knowledge and understanding benchmarks, BayLing achieves significant improvements across over 20 low-resource languages, demonstrating its capability of effective knowledge transfer from high-resource to low-resource languages. Furthermore, results on English benchmarks indicate that BayLing maintains high performance in highresource languages while enhancing the performance in low-resource languages. Demo, homepage, code and models of BayLing are available.</description>

      <title>Self-Generated Critiques Boost Reward Modeling for Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16646v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reward modeling is crucial for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences, especially in reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). However, current reward models mainly produce scalar scores and struggle to incorporate critiques in a natural language format. We hypothesize that predicting both critiques and the scalar reward would improve reward modeling ability. Motivated by this, we propose Critic-RM, a framework that improves reward models using self-generated critiques without extra supervision. Critic-RM employs a two-stage process: generating and filtering high-quality critiques, followed by joint fine-tuning on reward prediction and critique generation. Experiments across benchmarks show that Critic-RM improves reward modeling accuracy by 3.7%-7.3% compared to standard reward models and LLM judges, demonstrating strong performance and data efficiency. Additional studies further validate the effectiveness of generated critiques in rectifying flawed reasoning steps with 2.5%-3.2% gains in improving reasoning accuracy.</description>

      <title>SoK: Watermarking for AI-Generated Content</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18479v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As the outputs of generative AI (GenAI) techniques improve in quality, it becomes increasingly challenging to distinguish them from human-created content. Watermarking schemes are a promising approach to address the problem of distinguishing between AI and human-generated content. These schemes embed hidden signals within AI-generated content to enable reliable detection. While watermarking is not a silver bullet for addressing all risks associated with GenAI, it can play a crucial role in enhancing AI safety and trustworthiness by combating misinformation and deception. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of watermarking techniques for GenAI, beginning with the need for watermarking from historical and regulatory perspectives. We formalize the definitions and desired properties of watermarking schemes and examine the key objectives and threat models for existing approaches. Practical evaluation strategies are also explored, providing insights into the development of robust watermarking techniques capable of resisting various attacks. Additionally, we review recent representative works, highlight open challenges, and discuss potential directions for this emerging field. By offering a thorough understanding of watermarking in GenAI, this work aims to guide researchers in advancing watermarking methods and applications, and support policymakers in addressing the broader implications of GenAI.</description>

      <title>PEFT-as-an-Attack! Jailbreaking Language Models during Federated Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19335v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (FedPEFT) has emerged as a promising paradigm for privacy-preserving and efficient adaptation of Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) in Federated Learning (FL) settings. It preserves data privacy by keeping the data decentralized and training the model on local devices, ensuring that raw data never leaves the user's device. Moreover, the integration of PEFT methods such as LoRA significantly reduces the number of trainable parameters compared to fine-tuning the entire model, thereby minimizing communication costs and computational overhead. Despite its potential, the security implications of FedPEFT remain underexplored. This paper introduces a novel security threat to FedPEFT, termed PEFT-as-an-Attack (PaaA), which exposes how PEFT can be exploited as an attack vector to circumvent PLMs' safety alignment and generate harmful content in response to malicious prompts. Our evaluation of PaaA reveals that with less than 1% of the model's parameters set as trainable, and a small subset of clients acting maliciously, the attack achieves an approximate 80% attack success rate using representative PEFT methods such as LoRA. To mitigate this threat, we further investigate potential defense strategies, including Robust Aggregation Schemes (RASs) and Post-PEFT Safety Alignment (PPSA). However, our empirical analysis highlights the limitations of these defenses, i.e., even the most advanced RASs, such as DnC and ClippedClustering, struggle to defend against PaaA in scenarios with highly heterogeneous data distributions. Similarly, while PPSA can reduce attack success rates to below 10%, it severely degrades the model's accuracy on the target task. Our results underscore the urgent need for more effective defense mechanisms that simultaneously ensure security and maintain the performance of the FedPEFT paradigm.</description>

      <title>KnowledgePrompts: Exploring the Abilities of Large Language Models to Solve Proportional Analogies via Knowledge-Enhanced Prompting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00869v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Making analogies is fundamental to cognition. Proportional analogies, which consist of four terms, are often used to assess linguistic and cognitive abilities. For instance, completing analogies like "Oxygen is to Gas as &lt;blank&gt; is to &lt;blank&gt;" requires identifying the semantic relationship (e.g., "type of") between the first pair of terms ("Oxygen" and "Gas") and finding a second pair that shares the same relationship (e.g., "Aluminum" and "Metal"). In this work, we introduce a 15K Multiple-Choice Question Answering (MCQA) dataset for proportional analogy completion and evaluate the performance of contemporary Large Language Models (LLMs) in various knowledge-enhanced prompt settings. Specifically, we augment prompts with three types of knowledge: exemplar, structured, and targeted. Our results show that despite extensive training data, solving proportional analogies remains challenging for current LLMs, with the best model achieving an accuracy of 55%. Notably, we find that providing targeted knowledge can better assist models in completing proportional analogies compared to providing exemplars or collections of structured knowledge.

      <title>Su-RoBERTa: A Semi-supervised Approach to Predicting Suicide Risk through Social Media using Base Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01353v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent times, more and more people are posting about their mental states across various social media platforms. Leveraging this data, AI-based systems can be developed that help in assessing the mental health of individuals, such as suicide risk. This paper is a study done on suicidal risk assessments using Reddit data leveraging Base language models to identify patterns from social media posts. We have demonstrated that using smaller language models, i.e., less than 500M parameters, can also be effective in contrast to LLMs with greater than 500M parameters. We propose Su-RoBERTa, a fine-tuned RoBERTa on suicide risk prediction task that utilized both the labeled and unlabeled Reddit data and tackled class imbalance by data augmentation using GPT-2 model. Our Su-RoBERTa model attained a 69.84% weighted F1 score during the Final evaluation. This paper demonstrates the effectiveness of Base language models for the analysis of the risk factors related to mental health with an efficient computation pipeline</description>

      <title>S$^{2}$FT: Efficient, Scalable and Generalizable LLM Fine-tuning by Structured Sparsity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06289v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current PEFT methods for LLMs can achieve either high quality, efficient training, or scalable serving, but not all three simultaneously. To address this limitation, we investigate sparse fine-tuning and observe a remarkable improvement in generalization ability. Utilizing this key insight, we propose a family of Structured Sparse Fine-Tuning (S$^{2}$FT) methods for LLMs, which concurrently achieve state-of-the-art fine-tuning performance, training efficiency, and inference scalability. S$^{2}$FT accomplishes this by "selecting sparsely and computing densely". It selects a few heads and channels in the MHA and FFN modules for each Transformer block, respectively. Next, it co-permutes weight matrices on both sides of the coupled structures in LLMs to connect the selected components in each layer into a dense submatrix. Finally, S$^{2}$FT performs in-place gradient updates on all submatrices. Through theoretical analysis and empirical results, our method prevents forgetting while simplifying optimization, delivers SOTA performance on both commonsense and arithmetic reasoning with 4.6% and 1.3% average improvements compared to LoRA, and surpasses full FT by 11.5% when generalizing to various domains after instruction tuning. Using our partial backpropagation algorithm, S$^{2}$FT saves training memory up to 3$\times$ and improves latency by 1.5-2.7$\times$ compared to full FT, while delivering an average 10% improvement over LoRA on both metrics. We further demonstrate that the weight updates in S$^{2}$FT can be decoupled into adapters, enabling effective fusion, fast switch, and efficient parallelism for serving multiple fine-tuned models.</description>

      <title>When Every Token Counts: Optimal Segmentation for Low-Resource Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06926v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traditional greedy tokenization methods have been a critical step in Natural Language Processing (NLP), influencing how text is converted into tokens and directly impacting model performance. While subword tokenizers like Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) are widely used, questions remain about their optimality across model scales and languages. In this work, we demonstrate through extensive experiments that an optimal BPE configuration significantly reduces token count compared to greedy segmentation, yielding improvements in token-saving percentages and performance benefits, particularly for smaller models. We evaluate tokenization performance across various intrinsic and extrinsic tasks, including generation and classification. Our findings suggest that compression-optimized tokenization strategies could provide substantial advantages for multilingual and low-resource language applications, highlighting a promising direction for further research and inclusive NLP.</description>

      <title>Contextualized Counterspeech: Strategies for Adaptation, Personalization, and Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07338v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: AI-generated counterspeech offers a promising and scalable strategy to curb online toxicity through direct replies that promote civil discourse. However, current counterspeech is one-size-fits-all, lacking adaptation to the moderation context and the users involved. We propose and evaluate multiple strategies for generating tailored counterspeech that is adapted to the moderation context and personalized for the moderated user. We instruct an LLaMA2-13B model to generate counterspeech, experimenting with various configurations based on different contextual information and fine-tuning strategies. We identify the configurations that generate persuasive counterspeech through a combination of quantitative indicators and human evaluations collected via a pre-registered mixed-design crowdsourcing experiment. Results show that contextualized counterspeech can significantly outperform state-of-the-art generic counterspeech in adequacy and persuasiveness, without compromising other characteristics. Our findings also reveal a poor correlation between quantitative indicators and human evaluations, suggesting that these methods assess different aspects and highlighting the need for nuanced evaluation methodologies. The effectiveness of contextualized AI-generated counterspeech and the divergence between human and algorithmic evaluations underscore the importance of increased human-AI collaboration in content moderation.</description>

      <title>Piece of Table: A Divide-and-Conquer Approach for Selecting Sub-Tables in Table Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07629v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Applying language models (LMs) to tables is challenging due to the inherent structural differences between two-dimensional tables and one-dimensional text for which the LMs were originally designed. Furthermore, when applying linearized tables to LMs, the maximum token lengths often imposed in self-attention calculations make it difficult to comprehensively understand the context spread across large tables. To address these challenges, we present PieTa (Piece of Table), a new framework for sub-table-based question answering (QA). PieTa operates through an iterative process of dividing tables into smaller windows, using LMs to select relevant cells within each window, and merging these cells into a sub-table. This multi-resolution approach captures dependencies across multiple rows and columns while avoiding the limitations caused by long context inputs. Instantiated as a simple iterative sub-table union algorithm, PieTa demonstrates improved performance over previous sub-table-based QA approaches.</description>

      <title>How Does the Smoothness Approximation Method Facilitate Generalization for Federated Adversarial Learning?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08282v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated Adversarial Learning (FAL) is a robust framework for resisting adversarial attacks on federated learning. Although some FAL studies have developed efficient algorithms, they primarily focus on convergence performance and overlook generalization. Generalization is crucial for evaluating algorithm performance on unseen data. However, generalization analysis is more challenging due to non-smooth adversarial loss functions. A common approach to addressing this issue is to leverage smoothness approximation. In this paper, we develop algorithm stability measures to evaluate the generalization performance of two popular FAL algorithms: \textit{Vanilla FAL (VFAL)} and {\it Slack FAL (SFAL)}, using three different smooth approximation methods: 1) \textit{Surrogate Smoothness Approximation (SSA)}, (2) \textit{Randomized Smoothness Approximation (RSA)}, and (3) \textit{Over-Parameterized Smoothness Approximation (OPSA)}. Based on our in-depth analysis, we answer the question of how to properly set the smoothness approximation method to mitigate generalization error in FAL. Moreover, we identify RSA as the most effective method for reducing generalization error. In highly data-heterogeneous scenarios, we also recommend employing SFAL to mitigate the deterioration of generalization performance caused by heterogeneity. Based on our theoretical results, we provide insights to help develop more efficient FAL algorithms, such as designing new metrics and dynamic aggregation rules to mitigate heterogeneity.</description>

      <title>AniSora: Exploring the Frontiers of Animation Video Generation in the Sora Era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10255v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Animation has gained significant interest in the recent film and TV industry. Despite the success of advanced video generation models like Sora, Kling, and CogVideoX in generating natural videos, they lack the same effectiveness in handling animation videos. Evaluating animation video generation is also a great challenge due to its unique artist styles, violating the laws of physics and exaggerated motions. In this paper, we present a comprehensive system, AniSora, designed for animation video generation, which includes a data processing pipeline, a controllable generation model, and an evaluation dataset. Supported by the data processing pipeline with over 10M high-quality data, the generation model incorporates a spatiotemporal mask module to facilitate key animation production functions such as image-to-video generation, frame interpolation, and localized image-guided animation. We also collect an evaluation benchmark of 948 various animation videos, the evaluation on VBench and human double-blind test demonstrates consistency in character and motion, achieving state-of-the-art results in animation video generation. Our evaluation benchmark will be publicly available at https://github.com/bilibili/Index-anisora.</description>

      <title>Distribution-Consistency-Guided Multi-modal Hashing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11216v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-modal hashing methods have gained popularity due to their fast speed and low storage requirements. Among them, the supervised methods demonstrate better performance by utilizing labels as supervisory signals compared with unsupervised methods. Currently, for almost all supervised multi-modal hashing methods, there is a hidden assumption that training sets have no noisy labels. However, labels are often annotated incorrectly due to manual labeling in real-world scenarios, which will greatly harm the retrieval performance. To address this issue, we first discover a significant distribution consistency pattern through experiments, i.e., the 1-0 distribution of the presence or absence of each category in the label is consistent with the high-low distribution of similarity scores of the hash codes relative to category centers. Then, inspired by this pattern, we propose a novel Distribution-Consistency-Guided Multi-modal Hashing (DCGMH), which aims to filter and reconstruct noisy labels to enhance retrieval performance. Specifically, the proposed method first randomly initializes several category centers, which are used to compute the high-low distribution of similarity scores; Noisy and clean labels are then separately filtered out via the discovered distribution consistency pattern to mitigate the impact of noisy labels; Subsequently, a correction strategy, which is indirectly designed via the distribution consistency pattern, is applied to the filtered noisy labels, correcting high-confidence ones while treating low-confidence ones as unlabeled for unsupervised learning, thereby further enhancing the model's performance. Extensive experiments on three widely used datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method compared to state-of-the-art baselines in multi-modal retrieval tasks. The code is available at https://github.com/LiuJinyu1229/DCGMH.</description>

      <title>TrimLLM: Progressive Layer Dropping for Domain-Specific LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11242v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Specializing large language models (LLMs) for local deployment in domain-specific use cases is necessary for strong performance while meeting latency and privacy constraints. However, conventional task-specific adaptation approaches do not show simultaneous memory saving and inference speedup at deployment time. Practical compression techniques like quantization and pruning require dedicated hardware or kernel support to achieve measured inference speedup. We develop TrimLLM based on the layer-wise specialization phenomenon we empirically observed and verified on contemporary LLMs. TrimLLM reduces the depth of LLMs via progressive layer dropping. We show it retains LLMs' capacity in specific domains and achieves inference speedup irrespective of hardware and deep learning frameworks. We evaluated TrimLLM on LLMs of various sizes for inference; models adapted on medical, legal, and financial datasets all demonstrate $2.1-5.7\times$ inference speedup on consumer GPUs and up to $3.1\times$ speedup on A100 when compared to state-of-the-art model compression algorithms, with no loss in accuracy at 50$\sim$60\% model compression ratio.</description>

      <title>TRAIL: Trust-Aware Client Scheduling for Semi-Decentralized Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11448v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Due to the sensitivity of data, Federated Learning (FL) is employed to enable distributed machine learning while safeguarding data privacy and accommodating the requirements of various devices. However, in the context of semi-decentralized FL, clients' communication and training states are dynamic. This variability arises from local training fluctuations, heterogeneous data distributions, and intermittent client participation. Most existing studies primarily focus on stable client states, neglecting the dynamic challenges inherent in real-world scenarios. To tackle this issue, we propose a TRust-Aware clIent scheduLing mechanism called TRAIL, which assesses client states and contributions, enhancing model training efficiency through selective client participation. We focus on a semi-decentralized FL framework where edge servers and clients train a shared global model using unreliable intra-cluster model aggregation and inter-cluster model consensus. First, we propose an adaptive hidden semi-Markov model to estimate clients' communication states and contributions. Next, we address a client-server association optimization problem to minimize global training loss. Using convergence analysis, we propose a greedy client scheduling algorithm. Finally, our experiments conducted on real-world datasets demonstrate that TRAIL outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving an improvement of 8.7% in test accuracy and a reduction of 15.3% in training loss.</description>

      <title>Smoothness Really Matters: A Simple Yet Effective Approach for Unsupervised Graph Domain Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11654v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unsupervised Graph Domain Adaptation (UGDA) seeks to bridge distribution shifts between domains by transferring knowledge from labeled source graphs to given unlabeled target graphs. Existing UGDA methods primarily focus on aligning features in the latent space learned by graph neural networks (GNNs) across domains, often overlooking structural shifts, resulting in limited effectiveness when addressing structurally complex transfer scenarios. Given the sensitivity of GNNs to local structural features, even slight discrepancies between source and target graphs could lead to significant shifts in node embeddings, thereby reducing the effectiveness of knowledge transfer. To address this issue, we introduce a novel approach for UGDA called Target-Domain Structural Smoothing (TDSS). TDSS is a simple and effective method designed to perform structural smoothing directly on the target graph, thereby mitigating structural distribution shifts and ensuring the consistency of node representations. Specifically, by integrating smoothing techniques with neighborhood sampling, TDSS maintains the structural coherence of the target graph while mitigating the risk of over-smoothing. Our theoretical analysis shows that TDSS effectively reduces target risk by improving model smoothness. Empirical results on three real-world datasets demonstrate that TDSS outperforms recent state-of-the-art baselines, achieving significant improvements across six transfer scenarios. The code is available in https://github.com/cwei01/TDSS.</description>

      <title>G-VEval: A Versatile Metric for Evaluating Image and Video Captions Using GPT-4o</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13647v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Evaluation metric of visual captioning is important yet not thoroughly explored. Traditional metrics like BLEU, METEOR, CIDEr, and ROUGE often miss semantic depth, while trained metrics such as CLIP-Score, PAC-S, and Polos are limited in zero-shot scenarios. Advanced Language Model-based metrics also struggle with aligning to nuanced human preferences. To address these issues, we introduce G-VEval, a novel metric inspired by G-Eval and powered by the new GPT-4o. G-VEval uses chain-of-thought reasoning in large multimodal models and supports three modes: reference-free, reference-only, and combined, accommodating both video and image inputs. We also propose MSVD-Eval, a new dataset for video captioning evaluation, to establish a more transparent and consistent framework for both human experts and evaluation metrics. It is designed to address the lack of clear criteria in existing datasets by introducing distinct dimensions of Accuracy, Completeness, Conciseness, and Relevance (ACCR). Extensive results show that G-VEval outperforms existing methods in correlation with human annotations, as measured by Kendall tau-b and Kendall tau-c. This provides a flexible solution for diverse captioning tasks and suggests a straightforward yet effective approach for large language models to understand video content, paving the way for advancements in automated captioning.

      <title>Smarter, Better, Faster, Longer: A Modern Bidirectional Encoder for Fast, Memory Efficient, and Long Context Finetuning and Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13663v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Encoder-only transformer models such as BERT offer a great performance-size tradeoff for retrieval and classification tasks with respect to larger decoder-only models. Despite being the workhorse of numerous production pipelines, there have been limited Pareto improvements to BERT since its release. In this paper, we introduce ModernBERT, bringing modern model optimizations to encoder-only models and representing a major Pareto improvement over older encoders. Trained on 2 trillion tokens with a native 8192 sequence length, ModernBERT models exhibit state-of-the-art results on a large pool of evaluations encompassing diverse classification tasks and both single and multi-vector retrieval on different domains (including code). In addition to strong downstream performance, ModernBERT is also the most speed and memory efficient encoder and is designed for inference on common GPUs.</description>

      <title>Typhoon 2: A Family of Open Text and Multimodal Thai Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13702v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces Typhoon 2, a series of text and multimodal large language models optimized for the Thai language. The series includes models for text, vision, and audio. Typhoon2-Text builds on state-of-the-art open models, such as Llama 3 and Qwen2, and we perform continual pre-training on a mixture of English and Thai data. We employ post-training techniques to enhance Thai language performance while preserving the base models' original capabilities. We release text models across a range of sizes, from 1 to 70 billion parameters, available in both base and instruction-tuned variants. To guardrail text generation, we release Typhoon2-Safety, a classifier enhanced for Thai cultures and language. Typhoon2-Vision improves Thai document understanding while retaining general visual capabilities, such as image captioning. Typhoon2-Audio introduces an end-to-end speech-to-speech model architecture capable of processing audio, speech, and text inputs and generating both text and speech outputs.</description>

      <title>LLM-SEM: A Sentiment-Based Student Engagement Metric Using LLMS for E-Learning Platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13765v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current methods for analyzing student engagement in e-learning platforms, including automated systems, often struggle with challenges such as handling fuzzy sentiment in text comments and relying on limited metadata. Traditional approaches, such as surveys and questionnaires, also face issues like small sample sizes and scalability. In this paper, we introduce LLM-SEM (Language Model-Based Student Engagement Metric), a novel approach that leverages video metadata and sentiment analysis of student comments to measure engagement. By utilizing recent Large Language Models (LLMs), we generate high-quality sentiment predictions to mitigate text fuzziness and normalize key features such as views and likes. Our holistic method combines comprehensive metadata with sentiment polarity scores to gauge engagement at both the course and lesson levels. Extensive experiments were conducted to evaluate various LLM models, demonstrating the effectiveness of LLM-SEM in providing a scalable and accurate measure of student engagement. We fine-tuned TXLM-RoBERTa using human-annotated sentiment datasets to enhance prediction accuracy and utilized LLama 3B, and Gemma 9B from Ollama.</description>

      <title>M$^3$-VOS: Multi-Phase, Multi-Transition, and Multi-Scenery Video Object Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13803v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Intelligent robots need to interact with diverse objects across various environments. The appearance and state of objects frequently undergo complex transformations depending on the object properties, e.g., phase transitions. However, in the vision community, segmenting dynamic objects with phase transitions is overlooked. In light of this, we introduce the concept of phase in segmentation, which categorizes real-world objects based on their visual characteristics and potential morphological and appearance changes. Then, we present a new benchmark, Multi-Phase, Multi-Transition, and Multi-Scenery Video Object Segmentation (M$^3$-VOS), to verify the ability of models to understand object phases, which consists of 479 high-resolution videos spanning over 10 distinct everyday scenarios. It provides dense instance mask annotations that capture both object phases and their transitions. We evaluate state-of-the-art methods on M$^3$-VOS, yielding several key insights. Notably, current appearancebased approaches show significant room for improvement when handling objects with phase transitions. The inherent changes in disorder suggest that the predictive performance of the forward entropy-increasing process can be improved through a reverse entropy-reducing process. These findings lead us to propose ReVOS, a new plug-andplay model that improves its performance by reversal refinement. Our data and code will be publicly available at https://zixuan-chen.github.io/M-cubeVOS.github.io/.</description>

      <title>From Expectation to Habit: Why Do Software Practitioners Adopt Fairness Toolkits?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13846v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As the adoption of machine learning (ML) systems continues to grow across industries, concerns about fairness and bias in these systems have taken center stage. Fairness toolkits, designed to mitigate bias in ML models, serve as critical tools for addressing these ethical concerns. However, their adoption in the context of software development remains underexplored, especially regarding the cognitive and behavioral factors driving their usage. As a deeper understanding of these factors could be pivotal in refining tool designs and promoting broader adoption, this study investigates the factors influencing the adoption of fairness toolkits from an individual perspective. Guided by the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT2), we examined the factors shaping the intention to adopt and actual use of fairness toolkits. Specifically, we employed Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) to analyze data from a survey study involving practitioners in the software industry. Our findings reveal that performance expectancy and habit are the primary drivers of fairness toolkit adoption. These insights suggest that by emphasizing the effectiveness of these tools in mitigating bias and fostering habitual use, organizations can encourage wider adoption. Practical recommendations include improving toolkit usability, integrating bias mitigation processes into routine development workflows, and providing ongoing support to ensure professionals see clear benefits from regular use.</description>

      <title>Gauss-Newton Dynamics for Neural Networks: A Riemannian Optimization Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14031v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the convergence of Gauss-Newton dynamics for training neural networks with smooth activation functions. In the underparameterized regime, the Gauss-Newton gradient flow induces a Riemannian gradient flow on a low-dimensional, smooth, embedded submanifold of the Euclidean output space. Using tools from Riemannian optimization, we prove \emph{last-iterate} convergence of the Riemannian gradient flow to the optimal in-class predictor at an \emph{exponential rate} that is independent of the conditioning of the Gram matrix, \emph{without} requiring explicit regularization. We further characterize the critical impacts of the neural network scaling factor and the initialization on the convergence behavior. In the overparameterized regime, we show that the Levenberg-Marquardt dynamics with an appropriately chosen damping factor yields robustness to ill-conditioned kernels, analogous to the underparameterized regime. These findings demonstrate the potential of Gauss-Newton methods for efficiently optimizing neural networks, particularly in ill-conditioned problems where kernel and Gram matrices have small singular values.</description>

      <title>E-CAR: Efficient Continuous Autoregressive Image Generation via Multistage Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14170v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in autoregressive (AR) models with continuous tokens for image generation show promising results by eliminating the need for discrete tokenization. However, these models face efficiency challenges due to their sequential token generation nature and reliance on computationally intensive diffusion-based sampling. We present ECAR (Efficient Continuous Auto-Regressive Image Generation via Multistage Modeling), an approach that addresses these limitations through two intertwined innovations: (1) a stage-wise continuous token generation strategy that reduces computational complexity and provides progressively refined token maps as hierarchical conditions, and (2) a multistage flow-based distribution modeling method that transforms only partial-denoised distributions at each stage comparing to complete denoising in normal diffusion models. Holistically, ECAR operates by generating tokens at increasing resolutions while simultaneously denoising the image at each stage. This design not only reduces token-to-image transformation cost by a factor of the stage number but also enables parallel processing at the token level. Our approach not only enhances computational efficiency but also aligns naturally with image generation principles by operating in continuous token space and following a hierarchical generation process from coarse to fine details. Experimental results demonstrate that ECAR achieves comparable image quality to DiT Peebles &amp; Xie [2023] while requiring 10$\times$ FLOPs reduction and 5$\times$ speedup to generate a 256$\times$256 image.</description>
