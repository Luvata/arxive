      <title>LVTINO: LAtent Video consisTency INverse sOlver for High Definition Video Restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computational imaging methods increasingly rely on powerful generative diffusion models to tackle challenging image restoration tasks. In particular, state-of-the-art zero-shot image inverse solvers leverage distilled text-to-image latent diffusion models (LDMs) to achieve unprecedented accuracy and perceptual quality with high computational efficiency. However, extending these advances to high-definition video restoration remains a significant challenge, due to the need to recover fine spatial detail while capturing subtle temporal dependencies. Consequently, methods that naively apply image-based LDM priors on a frame-by-frame basis often result in temporally inconsistent reconstructions. We address this challenge by leveraging recent advances in Video Consistency Models (VCMs), which distill video latent diffusion models into fast generators that explicitly capture temporal causality. Building on this foundation, we propose LVTINO, the first zero-shot or plug-and-play inverse solver for high definition video restoration with priors encoded by VCMs. Our conditioning mechanism bypasses the need for automatic differentiation and achieves state-of-the-art video reconstruction quality with only a few neural function evaluations, while ensuring strong measurement consistency and smooth temporal transitions across frames. Extensive experiments on a diverse set of video inverse problems show significant perceptual improvements over current state-of-the-art methods that apply image LDMs frame by frame, establishing a new benchmark in both reconstruction fidelity and computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Image Generation Based on Image Style Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image generation based on text-to-image generation models is a task with practical application scenarios that fine-grained styles cannot be precisely described and controlled in natural language, while the guidance information of stylized reference images is difficult to be directly aligned with the textual conditions of traditional textual guidance generation. This study focuses on how to maximize the generative capability of the pretrained generative model, by obtaining fine-grained stylistic representations from a single given stylistic reference image, and injecting the stylistic representations into the generative body without changing the structural framework of the downstream generative model, so as to achieve fine-grained controlled stylized image generation. In this study, we propose a three-stage training style extraction-based image generation method, which uses a style encoder and a style projection layer to align the style representations with the textual representations to realize fine-grained textual cue-based style guide generation. In addition, this study constructs the Style30k-captions dataset, whose samples contain a triad of images, style labels, and text descriptions, to train the style encoder and style projection layer in this experiment.</description>

      <title>EvoStruggle: A Dataset Capturing the Evolution of Struggle across Activities and Skill Levels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to determine when a person struggles during skill acquisition is crucial for both optimizing human learning and enabling the development of effective assistive systems. As skills develop, the type and frequency of struggles tend to change, and understanding this evolution is key to determining the user's current stage of learning. However, existing manipulation datasets have not focused on how struggle evolves over time. In this work, we collect a dataset for struggle determination, featuring 61.68 hours of video recordings, 2,793 videos, and 5,385 annotated temporal struggle segments collected from 76 participants. The dataset includes 18 tasks grouped into four diverse activities -- tying knots, origami, tangram puzzles, and shuffling cards, representing different task variations. In addition, participants repeated the same task five times to capture their evolution of skill. We define the struggle determination problem as a temporal action localization task, focusing on identifying and precisely localizing struggle segments with start and end times. Experimental results show that Temporal Action Localization models can successfully learn to detect struggle cues, even when evaluated on unseen tasks or activities. The models attain an overall average mAP of 34.56% when generalizing across tasks and 19.24% across activities, indicating that struggle is a transferable concept across various skill-based tasks while still posing challenges for further improvement in struggle detection. Our dataset is available at https://github.com/FELIXFENG2019/EvoStruggle.</description>

      <title>SPUS: A Lightweight and Parameter-Efficient Foundation Model for PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Small PDE U-Net Solver (SPUS), a compact and efficient foundation model (FM) designed as a unified neural operator for solving a wide range of partial differential equations (PDEs). Unlike existing state-of-the-art PDE FMs-primarily based on large complex transformer architectures with high computational and parameter overhead-SPUS leverages a lightweight residual U-Net-based architecture that has been largely underexplored as a foundation model architecture in this domain. To enable effective learning in this minimalist framework, we utilize a simple yet powerful auto-regressive pretraining strategy which closely replicates the behavior of numerical solvers to learn the underlying physics. SPUS is pretrained on a diverse set of fluid dynamics PDEs and evaluated across 6 challenging unseen downstream PDEs spanning various physical systems. Experimental results demonstrate that SPUS using residual U-Net based architecture achieves state-of-the-art generalization on these downstream tasks while requiring significantly fewer parameters and minimal fine-tuning data, highlighting its potential as a highly parameter-efficient FM for solving diverse PDE systems.</description>

      <title>DisCo: Reinforcement with Diversity Constraints for Multi-Human Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-image models excel at realism but collapse on multi-human prompts - duplicating faces, merging identities, and miscounting individuals. We introduce DisCo (Reinforcement with Diversity Constraints), the first RL-based framework to directly optimize identity diversity in multi-human generation. DisCo fine-tunes flow-matching models via Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a compositional reward that (i) penalizes intra-image facial similarity, (ii) discourages cross-sample identity repetition, (iii) enforces accurate person counts, and (iv) preserves visual fidelity through human preference scores. A single-stage curriculum stabilizes training as complexity scales, requiring no extra annotations. On the DiverseHumans Testset, DisCo achieves 98.6 Unique Face Accuracy and near-perfect Global Identity Spread - surpassing both open-source and proprietary methods (e.g., Gemini, GPT-Image) while maintaining competitive perceptual quality. Our results establish DisCo as a scalable, annotation-free solution that resolves the long-standing identity crisis in generative models and sets a new benchmark for compositional multi-human generation.</description>

      <title>GeoSURGE: Geo-localization using Semantic Fusion with Hierarchy of Geographic Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Worldwide visual geo-localization seeks to determine the geographic location of an image anywhere on Earth using only its visual content. Learned representations of geography for visual geo-localization remain an active research topic despite much progress. We formulate geo-localization as aligning the visual representation of the query image with a learned geographic representation. Our novel geographic representation explicitly models the world as a hierarchy of geographic embeddings. Additionally, we introduce an approach to efficiently fuse the appearance features of the query image with its semantic segmentation map, forming a robust visual representation. Our main experiments demonstrate improved all-time bests in 22 out of 25 metrics measured across five benchmark datasets compared to prior state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods and recent Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). Additional ablation studies support the claim that these gains are primarily driven by the combination of geographic and visual representations.</description>

      <title>Data Selection for Fine-tuning Vision Language Models via Cross Modal Alignment Trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data-efficient learning aims to eliminate redundancy in large training datasets by training models on smaller subsets of the most informative examples. While data selection has been extensively explored for vision models and large language models (LLMs), it remains underexplored for Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). Notably, none of existing methods can outperform random selection at different subset sizes. In this work, we propose the first principled method for data-efficient instruction tuning of LVLMs. We prove that examples with similar cross-modal attention matrices during instruction tuning have similar gradients. Thus, they influence model parameters in a similar manner and convey the same information to the model during training. Building on this insight, we propose XMAS, which clusters examples based on the trajectories of the top singular values of their attention matrices obtained from fine-tuning a small proxy LVLM. By sampling a balanced subset from these clusters, XMAS effectively removes redundancy in large-scale LVLM training data. Extensive experiments show that XMAS can discard 50% of the LLaVA-665k dataset and 85% of the Vision-Flan dataset while fully preserving performance of LLaVA-1.5-7B on 10 downstream benchmarks and speeding up its training by 1.2x. This is 30% more data reduction compared to the best baseline for LLaVA-665k. The project's website can be found at https://bigml-cs-ucla.github.io/XMAS-project-page/.</description>

      <title>Purrception: Variational Flow Matching for Vector-Quantized Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Purrception, a variational flow matching approach for vector-quantized image generation that provides explicit categorical supervision while maintaining continuous transport dynamics. Our method adapts Variational Flow Matching to vector-quantized latents by learning categorical posteriors over codebook indices while computing velocity fields in the continuous embedding space. This combines the geometric awareness of continuous methods with the discrete supervision of categorical approaches, enabling uncertainty quantification over plausible codes and temperature-controlled generation. We evaluate Purrception on ImageNet-1k 256x256 generation. Training converges faster than both continuous flow matching and discrete flow matching baselines while achieving competitive FID scores with state-of-the-art models. This demonstrates that Variational Flow Matching can effectively bridge continuous transport and discrete supervision for improved training efficiency in image generation.</description>

      <title>AortaDiff: A Unified Multitask Diffusion Framework For Contrast-Free AAA Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) is standard for assessing abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA), the required iodinated contrast agents pose significant risks, including nephrotoxicity, patient allergies, and environmental harm. To reduce contrast agent use, recent deep learning methods have focused on generating synthetic CECT from non-contrast CT (NCCT) scans. However, most adopt a multi-stage pipeline that first generates images and then performs segmentation, which leads to error accumulation and fails to leverage shared semantic and anatomical structures. To address this, we propose a unified deep learning framework that generates synthetic CECT images from NCCT scans while simultaneously segmenting the aortic lumen and thrombus. Our approach integrates conditional diffusion models (CDM) with multi-task learning, enabling end-to-end joint optimization of image synthesis and anatomical segmentation. Unlike previous multitask diffusion models, our approach requires no initial predictions (e.g., a coarse segmentation mask), shares both encoder and decoder parameters across tasks, and employs a semi-supervised training strategy to learn from scans with missing segmentation labels, a common constraint in real-world clinical data. We evaluated our method on a cohort of 264 patients, where it consistently outperformed state-of-the-art single-task and multi-stage models. For image synthesis, our model achieved a PSNR of 25.61 dB, compared to 23.80 dB from a single-task CDM. For anatomical segmentation, it improved the lumen Dice score to 0.89 from 0.87 and the challenging thrombus Dice score to 0.53 from 0.48 (nnU-Net). These segmentation enhancements led to more accurate clinical measurements, reducing the lumen diameter MAE to 4.19 mm from 5.78 mm and the thrombus area error to 33.85% from 41.45% when compared to nnU-Net.

      <title>From Videos to Indexed Knowledge Graphs -- Framework to Marry Methods for Multimodal Content Analysis and Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analysis of multi-modal content can be tricky, computationally expensive, and require a significant amount of engineering efforts. Lots of work with pre-trained models on static data is out there, yet fusing these opensource models and methods with complex data such as videos is relatively challenging. In this paper, we present a framework that enables efficiently prototyping pipelines for multi-modal content analysis. We craft a candidate recipe for a pipeline, marrying a set of pre-trained models, to convert videos into a temporal semi-structured data format. We translate this structure further to a frame-level indexed knowledge graph representation that is query-able and supports continual learning, enabling the dynamic incorporation of new domain-specific knowledge through an interactive medium.</description>

      <title>WALT: Web Agents that Learn Tools</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Web agents promise to automate complex browser tasks, but current methods remain brittle -- relying on step-by-step UI interactions and heavy LLM reasoning that break under dynamic layouts and long horizons. Humans, by contrast, exploit website-provided functionality through high-level operations like search, filter, and sort. We introduce WALT (Web Agents that Learn Tools), a framework that reverse-engineers latent website functionality into reusable invocable tools. Rather than hypothesizing ad-hoc skills, WALT exposes robust implementations of automations already designed into websites -- spanning discovery (search, filter, sort), communication (post, comment, upvote), and content management (create, edit, delete). Tools abstract away low-level execution: instead of reasoning about how to click and type, agents simply call search(query) or create(listing). This shifts the computational burden from fragile step-by-step reasoning to reliable tool invocation. On VisualWebArena and WebArena, WALT achieves higher success with fewer steps and less LLM-dependent reasoning, establishing a robust and generalizable paradigm for browser automation.</description>

      <title>MATCH: Multi-faceted Adaptive Topo-Consistency for Semi-Supervised Histopathology Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In semi-supervised segmentation, capturing meaningful semantic structures from unlabeled data is essential. This is particularly challenging in histopathology image analysis, where objects are densely distributed. To address this issue, we propose a semi-supervised segmentation framework designed to robustly identify and preserve relevant topological features. Our method leverages multiple perturbed predictions obtained through stochastic dropouts and temporal training snapshots, enforcing topological consistency across these varied outputs. This consistency mechanism helps distinguish biologically meaningful structures from transient and noisy artifacts. A key challenge in this process is to accurately match the corresponding topological features across the predictions in the absence of ground truth. To overcome this, we introduce a novel matching strategy that integrates spatial overlap with global structural alignment, minimizing discrepancies among predictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach effectively reduces topological errors, resulting in more robust and accurate segmentations essential for reliable downstream analysis.

      <title>Towards Better Optimization For Listwise Preference in Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has proven effectiveness for aligning text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models with human preferences. Although Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is widely adopted for its computational efficiency and avoidance of explicit reward modeling, its applications to diffusion models have primarily relied on pairwise preferences. The precise optimization of listwise preferences remains largely unaddressed. In practice, human feedback on image preferences often contains implicit ranked information, which conveys more precise human preferences than pairwise comparisons. In this work, we propose Diffusion-LPO, a simple and effective framework for Listwise Preference Optimization in diffusion models with listwise data. Given a caption, we aggregate user feedback into a ranked list of images and derive a listwise extension of the DPO objective under the Plackett-Luce model. Diffusion-LPO enforces consistency across the entire ranking by encouraging each sample to be preferred over all of its lower-ranked alternatives. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of Diffusion-LPO across various tasks, including text-to-image generation, image editing, and personalized preference alignment. Diffusion-LPO consistently outperforms pairwise DPO baselines on visual quality and preference alignment.</description>

      <title>Growing Visual Generative Capacity for Pre-Trained MLLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) extend the success of language models to visual understanding, and recent efforts have sought to build unified MLLMs that support both understanding and generation. However, constructing such models remains challenging: hybrid approaches combine continuous embeddings with diffusion or flow-based objectives, producing high-quality images but breaking the autoregressive paradigm, while pure autoregressive approaches unify text and image prediction over discrete visual tokens but often face trade-offs between semantic alignment and pixel-level fidelity. In this work, we present Bridge, a pure autoregressive unified MLLM that augments pre-trained visual understanding models with generative ability through a Mixture-of-Transformers architecture, enabling both image understanding and generation within a single next-token prediction framework. To further improve visual generation fidelity, we propose a semantic-to-pixel discrete representation that integrates compact semantic tokens with fine-grained pixel tokens, achieving strong language alignment and precise description of visual details with only a 7.9% increase in sequence length. Extensive experiments across diverse multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that Bridge achieves competitive or superior results in both understanding and generation benchmarks, while requiring less training data and reduced training time compared to prior unified MLLMs.</description>

      <title>Robust Classification of Oral Cancer with Limited Training Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Oral cancer ranks among the most prevalent cancers globally, with a particularly high mortality rate in regions lacking adequate healthcare access. Early diagnosis is crucial for reducing mortality; however, challenges persist due to limited oral health programs, inadequate infrastructure, and a shortage of healthcare practitioners. Conventional deep learning models, while promising, often rely on point estimates, leading to overconfidence and reduced reliability. Critically, these models require large datasets to mitigate overfitting and ensure generalizability, an unrealistic demand in settings with limited training data. To address these issues, we propose a hybrid model that combines a convolutional neural network (CNN) with Bayesian deep learning for oral cancer classification using small training sets. This approach employs variational inference to enhance reliability through uncertainty quantification. The model was trained on photographic color images captured by smartphones and evaluated on three distinct test datasets. The proposed method achieved 94% accuracy on a test dataset with a distribution similar to that of the training data, comparable to traditional CNN performance. Notably, for real-world photographic image data, despite limitations and variations differing from the training dataset, the proposed model demonstrated superior generalizability, achieving 88% accuracy on diverse datasets compared to 72.94% for traditional CNNs, even with a smaller dataset. Confidence analysis revealed that the model exhibits low uncertainty (high confidence) for correctly classified samples and high uncertainty (low confidence) for misclassified samples. These results underscore the effectiveness of Bayesian inference in data-scarce environments in enhancing early oral cancer diagnosis by improving model reliability and generalizability.</description>

      <title>Consistent Assistant Domains Transformer for Source-free Domain Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) aims to address the challenge of adapting to a target domain without accessing the source domain directly. However, due to the inaccessibility of source domain data, deterministic invariable features cannot be obtained. Current mainstream methods primarily focus on evaluating invariant features in the target domain that closely resemble those in the source domain, subsequently aligning the target domain with the source domain. However, these methods are susceptible to hard samples and influenced by domain bias. In this paper, we propose a Consistent Assistant Domains Transformer for SFDA, abbreviated as CADTrans, which solves the issue by constructing invariable feature representations of domain consistency. Concretely, we develop an assistant domain module for CADTrans to obtain diversified representations from the intermediate aggregated global attentions, which addresses the limitation of existing methods in adequately representing diversity. Based on assistant and target domains, invariable feature representations are obtained by multiple consistent strategies, which can be used to distinguish easy and hard samples. Finally, to align the hard samples to the corresponding easy samples, we construct a conditional multi-kernel max mean discrepancy (CMK-MMD) strategy to distinguish between samples of the same category and those of different categories. Extensive experiments are conducted on various benchmarks such as Office-31, Office-Home, VISDA-C, and DomainNet-126, proving the significant performance improvements achieved by our proposed approaches.

      <title>Guiding Multimodal Large Language Models with Blind and Low Vision People Visual Questions for Proactive Visual Interpretations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have been integrated into visual interpretation applications to support Blind and Low Vision (BLV) users because of their accuracy and ability to provide rich, human-like interpretations. However, these applications often default to comprehensive, lengthy descriptions regardless of context. This leads to inefficient exchanges, as users must go through irrelevant details rather than receiving the specific information they are likely to seek. To deliver more contextually-relevant information, we developed a system that draws on historical BLV users questions. When given an image, our system identifies similar past visual contexts from the VizWiz-LF dataset and uses the associated questions to guide the MLLM generate descriptions more relevant to BLV users. An evaluation with three human labelers who revised 92 context-aware and context-free descriptions showed that context-aware descriptions anticipated and answered users' questions in 76.1% of cases (70 out of 92) and were preferred in 54.4% of comparisons (50 out of 92). Our paper reviews, and data analysis are publicly available in a Github repository at https://github.com/rgonzalezp/guiding-multimodal-large-language-models-with-blind-and-low-vision-people-visual-questions .</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop ImageNet-Think, a multimodal reasoning dataset designed to aid the development of Vision Language Models (VLMs) with explicit reasoning capabilities. Our dataset is built on 250,000 images from ImageNet21k dataset, providing structured thinking tokens and corresponding answers. Our synthetic dataset is generated by two state-of-the-art VLMs: GLM-4.1V-9B-Thinking and Kimi-VL-A3B-Thinking-2506. Each image is accompanied by two pairs of thinking-answer sequences, creating a resource for training and evaluating multimodal reasoning models. We capture the step-by-step reasoning process of VLMs and the final descriptive answers. Our goal with this dataset is to enable the development of more robust VLMs while contributing to the broader understanding of multimodal reasoning mechanisms. The dataset and evaluation benchmarks will be publicly available to aid research in reasoning/thinking multimodal VLMs.</description>

      <title>NPN: Non-Linear Projections of the Null-Space for Imaging Inverse Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Imaging inverse problems aims to recover high-dimensional signals from undersampled, noisy measurements, a fundamentally ill-posed task with infinite solutions in the null-space of the sensing operator. To resolve this ambiguity, prior information is typically incorporated through handcrafted regularizers or learned models that constrain the solution space. However, these priors typically ignore the task-specific structure of that null-space. In this work, we propose \textit{Non-Linear Projections of the Null-Space} (NPN), a novel class of regularization that, instead of enforcing structural constraints in the image domain, promotes solutions that lie in a low-dimensional projection of the sensing matrix's null-space with a neural network. Our approach has two key advantages: (1) Interpretability: by focusing on the structure of the null-space, we design sensing-matrix-specific priors that capture information orthogonal to the signal components that are fundamentally blind to the sensing process. (2) Flexibility: NPN is adaptable to various inverse problems, compatible with existing reconstruction frameworks, and complementary to conventional image-domain priors. We provide theoretical guarantees on convergence and reconstruction accuracy when used within plug-and-play methods. Empirical results across diverse sensing matrices demonstrate that NPN priors consistently enhance reconstruction fidelity in various imaging inverse problems, such as compressive sensing, deblurring, super-resolution, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging, with plug-and-play methods, unrolling networks, deep image prior, and diffusion models.</description>

      <title>Automated Genomic Interpretation via Concept Bottleneck Models for Medical Robotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an automated genomic interpretation module that transforms raw DNA sequences into actionable, interpretable decisions suitable for integration into medical automation and robotic systems. Our framework combines Chaos Game Representation (CGR) with a Concept Bottleneck Model (CBM), enforcing predictions to flow through biologically meaningful concepts such as GC content, CpG density, and k mer motifs. To enhance reliability, we incorporate concept fidelity supervision, prior consistency alignment, KL distribution matching, and uncertainty calibration. Beyond accurate classification of HIV subtypes across both in-house and LANL datasets, our module delivers interpretable evidence that can be directly validated against biological priors. A cost aware recommendation layer further translates predictive outputs into decision policies that balance accuracy, calibration, and clinical utility, reducing unnecessary retests and improving efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed system achieves state of the art classification performance, superior concept prediction fidelity, and more favorable cost benefit trade-offs compared to existing baselines. By bridging the gap between interpretable genomic modeling and automated decision-making, this work establishes a reliable foundation for robotic and clinical automation in genomic medicine.</description>

      <title>VLA-R1: Enhancing Reasoning in Vision-Language-Action Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models aim to unify perception, language understanding, and action generation, offering strong cross-task and cross-scene generalization with broad impact on embodied AI. However, current VLA models often lack explicit step-by-step reasoning, instead emitting final actions without considering affordance constraints or geometric relations. Their post-training pipelines also rarely reinforce reasoning quality, relying primarily on supervised fine-tuning with weak reward design. To address these challenges, we present VLA-R1, a reasoning-enhanced VLA that integrates Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to systematically optimize both reasoning and execution. Specifically, we design an RLVR-based post-training strategy with verifiable rewards for region alignment, trajectory consistency, and output formatting, thereby strengthening reasoning robustness and execution accuracy. Moreover, we develop VLA-CoT-13K, a high-quality dataset that provides chain-of-thought supervision explicitly aligned with affordance and trajectory annotations. Furthermore, extensive evaluations on in-domain, out-of-domain, simulation, and real-robot platforms demonstrate that VLA-R1 achieves superior generalization and real-world performance compared to prior VLA methods. We plan to release the model, code, and dataset following the publication of this work. Code: https://github.com/GigaAI-research/VLA-R1.

      <title>Joint Deblurring and 3D Reconstruction for Macrophotography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Macro lens has the advantages of high resolution and large magnification, and 3D modeling of small and detailed objects can provide richer information. However, defocus blur in macrophotography is a long-standing problem that heavily hinders the clear imaging of the captured objects and high-quality 3D reconstruction of them. Traditional image deblurring methods require a large number of images and annotations, and there is currently no multi-view 3D reconstruction method for macrophotography. In this work, we propose a joint deblurring and 3D reconstruction method for macrophotography. Starting from multi-view blurry images captured, we jointly optimize the clear 3D model of the object and the defocus blur kernel of each pixel. The entire framework adopts a differentiable rendering method to self-supervise the optimization of the 3D model and the defocus blur kernel. Extensive experiments show that from a small number of multi-view images, our proposed method can not only achieve high-quality image deblurring but also recover high-fidelity 3D appearance.</description>

      <title>FideDiff: Efficient Diffusion Model for High-Fidelity Image Motion Deblurring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in image motion deblurring, driven by CNNs and transformers, have made significant progress. Large-scale pre-trained diffusion models, which are rich in true-world modeling, have shown great promise for high-quality image restoration tasks such as deblurring, demonstrating stronger generative capabilities than CNN and transformer-based methods. However, challenges such as unbearable inference time and compromised fidelity still limit the full potential of the diffusion models. To address this, we introduce FideDiff, a novel single-step diffusion model designed for high-fidelity deblurring. We reformulate motion deblurring as a diffusion-like process where each timestep represents a progressively blurred image, and we train a consistency model that aligns all timesteps to the same clean image. By reconstructing training data with matched blur trajectories, the model learns temporal consistency, enabling accurate one-step deblurring. We further enhance model performance by integrating Kernel ControlNet for blur kernel estimation and introducing adaptive timestep prediction. Our model achieves superior performance on full-reference metrics, surpassing previous diffusion-based methods and matching the performance of other state-of-the-art models. FideDiff offers a new direction for applying pre-trained diffusion models to high-fidelity image restoration tasks, establishing a robust baseline for further advancing diffusion models in real-world industrial applications. Our dataset and code will be available at https://github.com/xyLiu339/FideDiff.</description>

      <title>LadderMoE: Ladder-Side Mixture of Experts Adapters for Bronze Inscription Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bronze inscriptions (BI), engraved on ritual vessels, constitute a crucial stage of early Chinese writing and provide indispensable evidence for archaeological and historical studies. However, automatic BI recognition remains difficult due to severe visual degradation, multi-domain variability across photographs, rubbings, and tracings, and an extremely long-tailed character distribution. To address these challenges, we curate a large-scale BI dataset comprising 22454 full-page images and 198598 annotated characters spanning 6658 unique categories, enabling robust cross-domain evaluation. Building on this resource, we develop a two-stage detection-recognition pipeline that first localizes inscriptions and then transcribes individual characters. To handle heterogeneous domains and rare classes, we equip the pipeline with LadderMoE, which augments a pretrained CLIP encoder with ladder-style MoE adapters, enabling dynamic expert specialization and stronger robustness. Comprehensive experiments on single-character and full-page recognition tasks demonstrate that our method substantially outperforms state-of-the-art scene text recognition baselines, achieving superior accuracy across head, mid, and tail categories as well as all acquisition modalities. These results establish a strong foundation for bronze inscription recognition and downstream archaeological analysis.</description>

      <title>VirDA: Reusing Backbone for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation with Visual Reprogramming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing UDA pipelines fine-tune already well-trained backbone parameters for every new source-and-target pair, resulting in the number of training parameters and storage memory growing linearly with each new pair, and also preventing the reuse of these well-trained backbone parameters.
  Inspired by recent implications that existing backbones have textural biases, we propose making use of domain-specific textural bias for domain adaptation via visual reprogramming, namely VirDA.Instead of fine-tuning the full backbone, VirDA prepends a domain-specific visual reprogramming layer to the backbone. This layer produces visual prompts that act as an added textural bias to the input image, adapting its ``style'' to a target domain. To optimize these visual reprogramming layers, we use multiple objective functions that optimize the intra- and inter-domain distribution differences when domain-adapting visual prompts are applied. This process does not require modifying the backbone parameters, allowing the same backbone to be reused across different domains.
  We evaluate VirDA on Office-31 and obtain 92.8% mean accuracy with only 1.5M trainable parameters. VirDA surpasses PDA, the state-of-the-art parameter-efficient UDA baseline, by +1.6% accuracy while using just 46% of its parameters. Compared with full-backbone fine-tuning, VirDA outperforms CDTrans and FixBi by +0.2% and +1.4%, respectively, while requiring only 1.7% and 2.8% of their trainable parameters. Relative to the strongest current methods (PMTrans and TVT), VirDA uses ~1.7% of their parameters and trades off only 2.2% and 1.1% accuracy, respectively.</description>

      <title>Discrete Facial Encoding: : A Framework for Data-driven Facial Display Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Facial expression analysis is central to understanding human behavior, yet existing coding systems such as the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) are constrained by limited coverage and costly manual annotation. In this work, we introduce Discrete Facial Encoding (DFE), an unsupervised, data-driven alternative of compact and interpretable dictionary of facial expressions from 3D mesh sequences learned through a Residual Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (RVQ-VAE). Our approach first extracts identity-invariant expression features from images using a 3D Morphable Model (3DMM), effectively disentangling factors such as head pose and facial geometry. We then encode these features using an RVQ-VAE, producing a sequence of discrete tokens from a shared codebook, where each token captures a specific, reusable facial deformation pattern that contributes to the overall expression. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that Discrete Facial Encoding captures more precise facial behaviors than FACS and other facial encoding alternatives. We evaluate the utility of our representation across three high-level psychological tasks: stress detection, personality prediction, and depression detection. Using a simple Bag-of-Words model built on top of the learned tokens, our system consistently outperforms both FACS-based pipelines and strong image and video representation learning models such as Masked Autoencoders. Further analysis reveals that our representation covers a wider variety of facial displays, highlighting its potential as a scalable and effective alternative to FACS for psychological and affective computing applications.</description>

      <title>Non-Rigid Structure-from-Motion via Differential Geometry with Recoverable Conformal Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-rigid structure-from-motion (NRSfM), a promising technique for addressing the mapping challenges in monocular visual deformable simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), has attracted growing attention. We introduce a novel method, called Con-NRSfM, for NRSfM under conformal deformations, encompassing isometric deformations as a subset. Our approach performs point-wise reconstruction using 2D selected image warps optimized through a graph-based framework. Unlike existing methods that rely on strict assumptions, such as locally planar surfaces or locally linear deformations, and fail to recover the conformal scale, our method eliminates these constraints and accurately computes the local conformal scale. Additionally, our framework decouples constraints on depth and conformal scale, which are inseparable in other approaches, enabling more precise depth estimation. To address the sensitivity of the formulated problem, we employ a parallel separable iterative optimization strategy. Furthermore, a self-supervised learning framework, utilizing an encoder-decoder network, is incorporated to generate dense 3D point clouds with texture. Simulation and experimental results using both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that our method surpasses existing approaches in terms of reconstruction accuracy and robustness. The code for the proposed method will be made publicly available on the project website: https://sites.google.com/view/con-nrsfm.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper tackles the challenge of robust reconstruction, i.e., the task of reconstructing a 3D scene from a set of inconsistent multi-view images. Some recent works have attempted to simultaneously remove image inconsistencies and perform reconstruction by integrating image degradation modeling into neural 3D scene representations.However, these methods rely heavily on dense observations for robustly optimizing model parameters.To address this issue, we propose to decouple robust reconstruction into two subtasks: restoration and reconstruction, which naturally simplifies the optimization process.To this end, we introduce UniVerse, a unified framework for robust reconstruction based on a video diffusion model. Specifically, UniVerse first converts inconsistent images into initial videos, then uses a specially designed video diffusion model to restore them into consistent images, and finally reconstructs the 3D scenes from these restored images.Compared with case-by-case per-view degradation modeling, the diffusion model learns a general scene prior from large-scale data, making it applicable to diverse image inconsistencies.Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the strong generalization capability and superior performance of our method in robust reconstruction. Moreover, UniVerse can control the style of the reconstructed 3D scene. Project page: https://jin-cao-tma.github.io/UniVerse.github.io/</description>

      <title>An Efficient Deep Template Matching and In-Plane Pose Estimation Method via Template-Aware Dynamic Convolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In industrial inspection and component alignment tasks, template matching requires efficient estimation of a target's position and geometric state (rotation and scaling) under complex backgrounds to support precise downstream operations. Traditional methods rely on exhaustive enumeration of angles and scales, leading to low efficiency under compound transformations. Meanwhile, most deep learning-based approaches only estimate similarity scores without explicitly modeling geometric pose, making them inadequate for real-world deployment. To overcome these limitations, we propose a lightweight end-to-end framework that reformulates template matching as joint localization and geometric regression, outputting the center coordinates, rotation angle, and independent horizontal and vertical scales. A Template-Aware Dynamic Convolution Module (TDCM) dynamically injects template features at inference to guide generalizable matching. The compact network integrates depthwise separable convolutions and pixel shuffle for efficient matching. To enable geometric-annotation-free training, we introduce a rotation-shear-based augmentation strategy with structure-aware pseudo labels. A lightweight refinement module further improves angle and scale precision via local optimization. Experiments show our 3.07M model achieves high precision and 14ms inference under compound transformations. It also demonstrates strong robustness in small-template and multi-object scenarios, making it highly suitable for deployment in real-time industrial applications. The code is available at:https://github.com/ZhouJ6610/PoseMatch-TDCM.</description>

      <title>Look Less, Reason More: Rollout-Guided Adaptive Pixel-Space Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at many multimodal tasks, yet they frequently struggle with tasks requiring precise understanding and handling of fine-grained visual elements. This is mainly due to information loss during image encoding or insufficient attention to critical regions. Recent work has shown promise by incorporating pixel-level visual information into the reasoning process, enabling VLMs to access high-resolution visual details during their thought process. However, this pixel-level information is often overused, leading to inefficiency and distraction from irrelevant visual details. To address these challenges, we propose the first framework for adaptive pixel reasoning that dynamically determines necessary pixel-level operations based on the input query. Specifically, we first apply operation-aware supervised fine-tuning to establish baseline competence in textual reasoning and visual operations, then design a novel rollout-guided reinforcement learning framework relying on feedback of the model's own responses, which enables the VLM to determine when pixel operations should be invoked based on query difficulty. Experiments on extensive multimodal reasoning benchmarks show that our model achieves superior performance while significantly reducing unnecessary visual operations. Impressively, our model achieves 73.4\% accuracy on HR-Bench 4K while maintaining a tool usage ratio of only 20.1\%, improving accuracy and simultaneously reducing tool usage by 66.5\% compared to the previous methods.</description>

      <title>Uncovering Overconfident Failures in CXR Models via Augmentation-Sensitivity Risk Scoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning models achieve strong performance in chest radiograph (CXR) interpretation, yet fairness and reliability concerns persist. Models often show uneven accuracy across patient subgroups, leading to hidden failures not reflected in aggregate metrics. Existing error detection approaches -- based on confidence calibration or out-of-distribution (OOD) detection -- struggle with subtle within-distribution errors, while image- and representation-level consistency-based methods remain underexplored in medical imaging. We propose an augmentation-sensitivity risk scoring (ASRS) framework to identify error-prone CXR cases. ASRS applies clinically plausible rotations ($\pm 15^\circ$/$\pm 30^\circ$) and measures embedding shifts with the RAD-DINO encoder. Sensitivity scores stratify samples into stability quartiles, where highly sensitive cases show substantially lower recall ($-0.2$ to $-0.3$) despite high AUROC and confidence. ASRS provides a label-free means for selective prediction and clinician review, improving fairness and safety in medical AI.</description>

      <title>FreeViS: Training-free Video Stylization with Inconsistent References</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video stylization plays a key role in content creation, but it remains a challenging problem. Na\"ively applying image stylization frame-by-frame hurts temporal consistency and reduces style richness. Alternatively, training a dedicated video stylization model typically requires paired video data and is computationally expensive. In this paper, we propose FreeViS, a training-free video stylization framework that generates stylized videos with rich style details and strong temporal coherence. Our method integrates multiple stylized references to a pretrained image-to-video (I2V) model, effectively mitigating the propagation errors observed in prior works, without introducing flickers and stutters. In addition, it leverages high-frequency compensation to constrain the content layout and motion, together with flow-based motion cues to preserve style textures in low-saliency regions. Through extensive evaluations, FreeViS delivers higher stylization fidelity and superior temporal consistency, outperforming recent baselines and achieving strong human preference. Our training-free pipeline offers a practical and economic solution for high-quality, temporally coherent video stylization.

      <title>MedQ-Bench: Evaluating and Exploring Medical Image Quality Assessment Abilities in MLLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medical Image Quality Assessment (IQA) serves as the first-mile safety gate for clinical AI, yet existing approaches remain constrained by scalar, score-based metrics and fail to reflect the descriptive, human-like reasoning process central to expert evaluation. To address this gap, we introduce MedQ-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark that establishes a perception-reasoning paradigm for language-based evaluation of medical image quality with Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs). MedQ-Bench defines two complementary tasks: (1) MedQ-Perception, which probes low-level perceptual capability via human-curated questions on fundamental visual attributes; and (2) MedQ-Reasoning, encompassing both no-reference and comparison reasoning tasks, aligning model evaluation with human-like reasoning on image quality. The benchmark spans five imaging modalities and over forty quality attributes, totaling 2,600 perceptual queries and 708 reasoning assessments, covering diverse image sources including authentic clinical acquisitions, images with simulated degradations via physics-based reconstructions, and AI-generated images. To evaluate reasoning ability, we propose a multi-dimensional judging protocol that assesses model outputs along four complementary axes. We further conduct rigorous human-AI alignment validation by comparing LLM-based judgement with radiologists. Our evaluation of 14 state-of-the-art MLLMs demonstrates that models exhibit preliminary but unstable perceptual and reasoning skills, with insufficient accuracy for reliable clinical use. These findings highlight the need for targeted optimization of MLLMs in medical IQA. We hope that MedQ-Bench will catalyze further exploration and unlock the untapped potential of MLLMs for medical image quality evaluation.</description>

      <title>Holistic Order Prediction in Natural Scenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Even in controlled settings, understanding instance-wise geometries is a challenging task for a wide range of visual models. Although specialized systems exist, modern arts rely on expensive input formats (category labels, binary segmentation masks) and inference costs (a quadratic amount of forward passes). We mitigate these limitations by proposing InstaFormer, a network capable of holistic order prediction. That is, solely given an input RGB image, InstaFormer returns the full occlusion and depth orderings for all the instances in the scene in a single forward pass. At its core, InstaFormer relies on interactions between object queries and latent mask descriptors that semantically represent the same objects while carrying complementary information. We comprehensively benchmark and ablate our approach to highlight its effectiveness. Our code and models are open-source and available at this URL: https://github.com/SNU-VGILab/InstaOrder.</description>

      <title>PyramidStyler: Transformer-Based Neural Style Transfer with Pyramidal Positional Encoding and Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural Style Transfer (NST) has evolved from Gatys et al.'s (2015) CNN-based algorithm, enabling AI-driven artistic image synthesis. However, existing CNN and transformer-based models struggle to scale efficiently to complex styles and high-resolution inputs. We introduce PyramidStyler, a transformer framework with Pyramidal Positional Encoding (PPE): a hierarchical, multi-scale encoding that captures both local details and global context while reducing computational load. We further incorporate reinforcement learning to dynamically optimize stylization, accelerating convergence. Trained on Microsoft COCO and WikiArt, PyramidStyler reduces content loss by 62.6% (to 2.07) and style loss by 57.4% (to 0.86) after 4000 epochs--achieving 1.39 s inference--and yields further improvements (content 2.03; style 0.75) with minimal speed penalty (1.40 s) when using RL. These results demonstrate real-time, high-quality artistic rendering, with broad applications in media and design.</description>

      <title>LOBE-GS: Load-Balanced and Efficient 3D Gaussian Splatting for Large-Scale Scene Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has established itself as an efficient representation for real-time, high-fidelity 3D scene reconstruction. However, scaling 3DGS to large and unbounded scenes such as city blocks remains difficult. Existing divide-and-conquer methods alleviate memory pressure by partitioning the scene into blocks, but introduce new bottlenecks: (i) partitions suffer from severe load imbalance since uniform or heuristic splits do not reflect actual computational demands, and (ii) coarse-to-fine pipelines fail to exploit the coarse stage efficiently, often reloading the entire model and incurring high overhead. In this work, we introduce LoBE-GS, a novel Load-Balanced and Efficient 3D Gaussian Splatting framework, that re-engineers the large-scale 3DGS pipeline. LoBE-GS introduces a depth-aware partitioning method that reduces preprocessing from hours to minutes, an optimization-based strategy that balances visible Gaussians -- a strong proxy for computational load -- across blocks, and two lightweight techniques, visibility cropping and selective densification, to further reduce training cost. Evaluations on large-scale urban and outdoor datasets show that LoBE-GS consistently achieves up to $2\times$ faster end-to-end training time than state-of-the-art baselines, while maintaining reconstruction quality and enabling scalability to scenes infeasible with vanilla 3DGS.</description>

      <title>Pack and Force Your Memory: Long-form and Consistent Video Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-form video generation presents a dual challenge: models must capture long-range dependencies while preventing the error accumulation inherent in autoregressive decoding. To address these challenges, we make two contributions. First, for dynamic context modeling, we propose MemoryPack, a learnable context-retrieval mechanism that leverages both textual and image information as global guidance to jointly model short- and long-term dependencies, achieving minute-level temporal consistency. This design scales gracefully with video length, preserves computational efficiency, and maintains linear complexity. Second, to mitigate error accumulation, we introduce Direct Forcing, an efficient single-step approximating strategy that improves training-inference alignment and thereby curtails error propagation during inference. Together, MemoryPack and Direct Forcing substantially enhance the context consistency and reliability of long-form video generation, advancing the practical usability of autoregressive video models.</description>

      <title>Calibrating the Full Predictive Class Distribution of 3D Object Detectors for Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In autonomous systems, precise object detection and uncertainty estimation are critical for self-aware and safe operation. This work addresses confidence calibration for the classification task of 3D object detectors. We argue that it is necessary to regard the calibration of the full predictive confidence distribution over all classes and deduce a metric which captures the calibration of dominant and secondary class predictions. We propose two auxiliary regularizing loss terms which introduce either calibration of the dominant prediction or the full prediction vector as a training goal. We evaluate a range of post-hoc and train-time methods for CenterPoint, PillarNet and DSVT-Pillar and find that combining our loss term, which regularizes for calibration of the full class prediction, and isotonic regression lead to the best calibration of CenterPoint and PillarNet with respect to both dominant and secondary class predictions. We further find that DSVT-Pillar can not be jointly calibrated for dominant and secondary predictions using the same method.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Prior Knowledge of Diffusion Model for Person Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Person search aims to jointly perform person detection and re-identification by localizing and identifying a query person within a gallery of uncropped scene images. Existing methods predominantly utilize ImageNet pre-trained backbones, which may be suboptimal for capturing the complex spatial context and fine-grained identity cues necessary for person search. Moreover, they rely on a shared backbone feature for both person detection and re-identification, leading to suboptimal features due to conflicting optimization objectives. In this paper, we propose DiffPS (Diffusion Prior Knowledge for Person Search), a novel framework that leverages a pre-trained diffusion model while eliminating the optimization conflict between two sub-tasks. We analyze key properties of diffusion priors and propose three specialized modules: (i) Diffusion-Guided Region Proposal Network (DGRPN) for enhanced person localization, (ii) Multi-Scale Frequency Refinement Network (MSFRN) to mitigate shape bias, and (iii) Semantic-Adaptive Feature Aggregation Network (SFAN) to leverage text-aligned diffusion features. DiffPS sets a new state-of-the-art on CUHK-SYSU and PRW.</description>

      <title>Flow-Matching Guided Deep Unfolding for Hyperspectral Image Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) provides rich spatial-spectral information but remains costly to acquire due to hardware limitations and the difficulty of reconstructing three-dimensional data from compressed measurements. Although compressive sensing systems such as CASSI improve efficiency, accurate reconstruction is still challenged by severe degradation and loss of fine spectral details. We propose the Flow-Matching-guided Unfolding network (FMU), which, to our knowledge, is the first to integrate flow matching into HSI reconstruction by embedding its generative prior within a deep unfolding framework. To further strengthen the learned dynamics, we introduce a mean velocity loss that enforces global consistency of the flow, leading to a more robust and accurate reconstruction. This hybrid design leverages the interpretability of optimization-based methods and the generative capacity of flow matching. Extensive experiments on both simulated and real datasets show that FMU significantly outperforms existing approaches in reconstruction quality. Code and models will be available at https://github.com/YiAi03/FMU.</description>

      <title>Automated Defect Detection for Mass-Produced Electronic Components Based on YOLO Object Detection Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the defect detection of conventional industry components is time-consuming and labor-intensive, it leads to a significant burden on quality inspection personnel and makes it difficult to manage product quality. In this paper, we propose an automated defect detection system for the dual in-line package (DIP) that is widely used in industry, using digital camera optics and a deep learning (DL)-based model. The two most common defect categories of DIP are examined: (1) surface defects, and (2) pin-leg defects. However, the lack of defective component images leads to a challenge for detection tasks. To solve this problem, the ConSinGAN is used to generate a suitable-sized dataset for training and testing. Four varieties of the YOLO model are investigated (v3, v4, v7, and v9), both in isolation and with the ConSinGAN augmentation. The proposed YOLOv7 with ConSinGAN is superior to the other YOLO versions in accuracy of 95.50\%, detection time of 285 ms, and is far superior to threshold-based approaches. In addition, the supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system is developed, and the associated sensor architecture is described. The proposed automated defect detection can be easily established with numerous types of defects or insufficient defect data.</description>

      <title>Foundation Visual Encoders Are Secretly Few-Shot Anomaly Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Few-shot anomaly detection streamlines and simplifies industrial safety inspection. However, limited samples make accurate differentiation between normal and abnormal features challenging, and even more so under category-agnostic conditions. Large-scale pre-training of foundation visual encoders has advanced many fields, as the enormous quantity of data helps to learn the general distribution of normal images. We observe that the anomaly amount in an image directly correlates with the difference in the learnt embeddings and utilize this to design a few-shot anomaly detector termed FoundAD. This is done by learning a nonlinear projection operator onto the natural image manifold. The simple operator acts as an effective tool for anomaly detection to characterize and identify out-of-distribution regions in an image. Extensive experiments show that our approach supports multi-class detection and achieves competitive performance while using substantially fewer parameters than prior methods. Backed up by evaluations with multiple foundation encoders, including fresh DINOv3, we believe this idea broadens the perspective on foundation features and advances the field of few-shot anomaly detection.</description>

      <title>ClustViT: Clustering-based Token Merging for Semantic Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision Transformers can achieve high accuracy and strong generalization across various contexts, but their practical applicability on real-world robotic systems is limited due to their quadratic attention complexity. Recent works have focused on dynamically merging tokens according to the image complexity. Token merging works well for classification but is less suited to dense prediction. We propose ClustViT, where we expand upon the Vision Transformer (ViT) backbone and address semantic segmentation. Within our architecture, a trainable Cluster module merges similar tokens along the network guided by pseudo-clusters from segmentation masks. Subsequently, a Regenerator module restores fine details for downstream heads. Our approach achieves up to 2.18x fewer GFLOPs and 1.64x faster inference on three different datasets, with comparable segmentation accuracy. Our code and models will be made publicly available.</description>

      <title>Patch-as-Decodable-Token: Towards Unified Multi-Modal Vision Tasks in MLLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have advanced rapidly in recent years. However, existing approaches for vision tasks often rely on indirect representations, such as generating coordinates as text for detection, which limits performance and prevents dense prediction tasks like segmentation. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Patch-as-Decodable Token (PaDT), a unified paradigm that enables MLLMs to directly generate both textual and diverse visual outputs. Central to PaDT are Visual Reference Tokens (VRTs), derived from visual patch embeddings of query images and interleaved seamlessly with LLM's output textual tokens. A lightweight decoder then transforms LLM's outputs into detection, segmentation, and grounding predictions. Unlike prior methods, PaDT processes VRTs independently at each forward pass and dynamically expands the embedding table, thus improving localization and differentiation among similar objects. We further tailor a training strategy for PaDT by randomly selecting VRTs for supervised fine-tuning and introducing a robust per-token cross-entropy loss. Our empirical studies across four visual perception and understanding tasks suggest PaDT consistently achieving state-of-the-art performance, even compared with significantly larger MLLM models. The code is available at https://github.com/Gorilla-Lab-SCUT/PaDT.</description>

      <title>TriAlignXA: An Explainable Trilemma Alignment Framework for Trustworthy Agri-product Grading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 'trust deficit' in online fruit and vegetable e-commerce stems from the inability of digital transactions to provide direct sensory perception of product quality. This paper constructs a 'Trust Pyramid' model through 'dual-source verification' of consumer trust. Experiments confirm that quality is the cornerstone of trust. The study reveals an 'impossible triangle' in agricultural product grading, comprising biological characteristics, timeliness, and economic viability, highlighting the limitations of traditional absolute grading standards. To quantitatively assess this trade-off, we propose the 'Triangular Trust Index' (TTI). We redefine the role of algorithms from 'decision-makers' to 'providers of transparent decision-making bases', designing the explainable AI framework--TriAlignXA. This framework supports trustworthy online transactions within agricultural constraints through multi-objective optimization. Its core relies on three engines: the Bio-Adaptive Engine for granular quality description; the Timeliness Optimization Engine for processing efficiency; and the Economic Optimization Engine for cost control. Additionally, the "Pre-Mapping Mechanism" encodes process data into QR codes, transparently conveying quality information. Experiments on grading tasks demonstrate significantly higher accuracy than baseline models. Empirical evidence and theoretical analysis verify the framework's balancing capability in addressing the "impossible triangle". This research provides comprehensive support--from theory to practice--for building a trustworthy online produce ecosystem, establishing a critical pathway from algorithmic decision-making to consumer trust.</description>

      <title>4DGS-Craft: Consistent and Interactive 4D Gaussian Splatting Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) editing still face challenges with view, temporal, and non-editing region consistency, as well as with handling complex text instructions. To address these issues, we propose 4DGS-Craft, a consistent and interactive 4DGS editing framework. We first introduce a 4D-aware InstructPix2Pix model to ensure both view and temporal consistency. This model incorporates 4D VGGT geometry features extracted from the initial scene, enabling it to capture underlying 4D geometric structures during editing. We further enhance this model with a multi-view grid module that enforces consistency by iteratively refining multi-view input images while jointly optimizing the underlying 4D scene. Furthermore, we preserve the consistency of non-edited regions through a novel Gaussian selection mechanism, which identifies and optimizes only the Gaussians within the edited regions. Beyond consistency, facilitating user interaction is also crucial for effective 4DGS editing. Therefore, we design an LLM-based module for user intent understanding. This module employs a user instruction template to define atomic editing operations and leverages an LLM for reasoning. As a result, our framework can interpret user intent and decompose complex instructions into a logical sequence of atomic operations, enabling it to handle intricate user commands and further enhance editing performance. Compared to related works, our approach enables more consistent and controllable 4D scene editing. Our code will be made available upon acceptance.</description>

      <title>Pure-Pass: Fine-Grained, Adaptive Masking for Dynamic Token-Mixing Routing in Lightweight Image Super-Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image Super-Resolution (SR) aims to reconstruct high-resolution images from low-resolution counterparts, but the computational complexity of deep learning-based methods often hinders practical deployment. CAMixer is the pioneering work to integrate the advantages of existing lightweight SR methods and proposes a content-aware mixer to route token mixers of varied complexities according to the difficulty of content recovery. However, several limitations remain, such as poor adaptability, coarse-grained masking and spatial inflexibility, among others. We propose Pure-Pass (PP), a pixel-level masking mechanism that identifies pure pixels and exempts them from expensive computations. PP utilizes fixed color center points to classify pixels into distinct categories, enabling fine-grained, spatially flexible masking while maintaining adaptive flexibility. Integrated into the state-of-the-art ATD-light model, PP-ATD-light achieves superior SR performance with minimal overhead, outperforming CAMixer-ATD-light in reconstruction quality and parameter efficiency when saving a similar amount of computation.</description>

      <title>Generating Findings for Jaw Cysts in Dental Panoramic Radiographs Using GPT-4o: Building a Two-Stage Self-Correction Loop with Structured Output (SLSO) Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we utilized the multimodal capabilities of OpenAI GPT-4o to automatically generate jaw cyst findings on dental panoramic radiographs. To improve accuracy, we constructed a Self-correction Loop with Structured Output (SLSO) framework and verified its effectiveness. A 10-step process was implemented for 22 cases of jaw cysts, including image input and analysis, structured data generation, tooth number extraction and consistency checking, iterative regeneration when inconsistencies were detected, and finding generation with subsequent restructuring and consistency verification. A comparative experiment was conducted using the conventional Chain-of-Thought (CoT) method across seven evaluation items: transparency, internal structure, borders, root resorption, tooth movement, relationships with other structures, and tooth number. The results showed that the proposed SLSO framework improved output accuracy for many items, with 66.9%, 33.3%, and 28.6% improvement rates for tooth number, tooth movement, and root resorption, respectively. In the successful cases, a consistently structured output was achieved after up to five regenerations. Although statistical significance was not reached because of the small size of the dataset, the overall SLSO framework enforced negative finding descriptions, suppressed hallucinations, and improved tooth number identification accuracy. However, the accurate identification of extensive lesions spanning multiple teeth is limited. Nevertheless, further refinement is required to enhance overall performance and move toward a practical finding generation system.</description>

      <title>LiLa-Net: Lightweight Latent LiDAR Autoencoder for 3D Point Cloud Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work proposed a 3D autoencoder architecture, named LiLa-Net, which encodes efficient features from real traffic environments, employing only the LiDAR's point clouds. For this purpose, we have real semi-autonomous vehicle, equipped with Velodyne LiDAR. The system leverage skip connections concept to improve the performance without using extensive resources as the state-of-the-art architectures. Key changes include reducing the number of encoder layers and simplifying the skip connections, while still producing an efficient and representative latent space which allows to accurately reconstruct the original point cloud. Furthermore, an effective balance has been achieved between the information carried by the skip connections and the latent encoding, leading to improved reconstruction quality without compromising performance. Finally, the model demonstrates strong generalization capabilities, successfully reconstructing objects unrelated to the original traffic environment.</description>

      <title>kabr-tools: Automated Framework for Multi-Species Behavioral Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A comprehensive understanding of animal behavior ecology depends on scalable approaches to quantify and interpret complex, multidimensional behavioral patterns. Traditional field observations are often limited in scope, time-consuming, and labor-intensive, hindering the assessment of behavioral responses across landscapes. To address this, we present kabr-tools (Kenyan Animal Behavior Recognition Tools), an open-source package for automated multi-species behavioral monitoring. This framework integrates drone-based video with machine learning systems to extract behavioral, social, and spatial metrics from wildlife footage. Our pipeline leverages object detection, tracking, and behavioral classification systems to generate key metrics, including time budgets, behavioral transitions, social interactions, habitat associations, and group composition dynamics. Compared to ground-based methods, drone-based observations significantly improved behavioral granularity, reducing visibility loss by 15% and capturing more transitions with higher accuracy and continuity. We validate kabr-tools through three case studies, analyzing 969 behavioral sequences, surpassing the capacity of traditional methods for data capture and annotation. We found that, like Plains zebras, vigilance in Grevy's zebras decreases with herd size, but, unlike Plains zebras, habitat has a negligible impact. Plains and Grevy's zebras exhibit strong behavioral inertia, with rare transitions to alert behaviors and observed spatial segregation between Grevy's zebras, Plains zebras, and giraffes in mixed-species herds. By enabling automated behavioral monitoring at scale, kabr-tools offers a powerful tool for ecosystem-wide studies, advancing conservation, biodiversity research, and ecological monitoring.</description>

      <title>GaussianMorphing: Mesh-Guided 3D Gaussians for Semantic-Aware Object Morphing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce GaussianMorphing, a novel framework for semantic-aware 3D shape and texture morphing from multi-view images. Previous approaches usually rely on point clouds or require pre-defined homeomorphic mappings for untextured data. Our method overcomes these limitations by leveraging mesh-guided 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for high-fidelity geometry and appearance modeling. The core of our framework is a unified deformation strategy that anchors 3DGaussians to reconstructed mesh patches, ensuring geometrically consistent transformations while preserving texture fidelity through topology-aware constraints. In parallel, our framework establishes unsupervised semantic correspondence by using the mesh topology as a geometric prior and maintains structural integrity via physically plausible point trajectories. This integrated approach preserves both local detail and global semantic coherence throughout the morphing process with out requiring labeled data. On our proposed TexMorph benchmark, GaussianMorphing substantially outperforms prior 2D/3D methods, reducing color consistency error ($\Delta E$) by 22.2% and EI by 26.2%.

      <title>Zero-shot Human Pose Estimation using Diffusion-based Inverse solvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pose estimation refers to tracking a human's full body posture, including their head, torso, arms, and legs. The problem is challenging in practical settings where the number of body sensors are limited. Past work has shown promising results using conditional diffusion models, where the pose prediction is conditioned on both &lt;location, rotation&gt; measurements from the sensors. Unfortunately, nearly all these approaches generalize poorly across users, primarly because location measurements are highly influenced by the body size of the user. In this paper, we formulate pose estimation as an inverse problem and design an algorithm capable of zero-shot generalization. Our idea utilizes a pre-trained diffusion model and conditions it on rotational measurements alone; the priors from this model are then guided by a likelihood term, derived from the measured locations. Thus, given any user, our proposed InPose method generatively estimates the highly likely sequence of poses that best explains the sparse on-body measurements.</description>

      <title>VGDM: Vision-Guided Diffusion Model for Brain Tumor Detection and Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate detection and segmentation of brain tumors from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are essential for diagnosis, treatment planning, and clinical monitoring. While convolutional architectures such as U-Net have long been the backbone of medical image segmentation, their limited capacity to capture long-range dependencies constrains performance on complex tumor structures. Recent advances in diffusion models have demonstrated strong potential for generating high-fidelity medical images and refining segmentation boundaries.
  In this work, we propose VGDM: Vision-Guided Diffusion Model for Brain Tumor Detection and Segmentation framework, a transformer-driven diffusion framework for brain tumor detection and segmentation. By embedding a vision transformer at the core of the diffusion process, the model leverages global contextual reasoning together with iterative denoising to enhance both volumetric accuracy and boundary precision. The transformer backbone enables more effective modeling of spatial relationships across entire MRI volumes, while diffusion refinement mitigates voxel-level errors and recovers fine-grained tumor details.
  This hybrid design provides a pathway toward improved robustness and scalability in neuro-oncology, moving beyond conventional U-Net baselines. Experimental validation on MRI brain tumor datasets demonstrates consistent gains in Dice similarity and Hausdorff distance, underscoring the potential of transformer-guided diffusion models to advance the state of the art in tumor segmentation.</description>

      <title>Mapping Historic Urban Footprints in France: Balancing Quality, Scalability and AI Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantitative analysis of historical urban sprawl in France before the 1970s is hindered by the lack of nationwide digital urban footprint data. This study bridges this gap by developing a scalable deep learning pipeline to extract urban areas from the Scan Histo historical map series (1925-1950), which produces the first open-access, national-scale urban footprint dataset for this pivotal period. Our key innovation is a dual-pass U-Net approach designed to handle the high radiometric and stylistic complexity of historical maps. The first pass, trained on an initial dataset, generates a preliminary map that identifies areas of confusion, such as text and roads, to guide targeted data augmentation. The second pass uses a refined dataset and the binarized output of the first model to minimize radiometric noise, which significantly reduces false positives. Deployed on a high-performance computing cluster, our method processes 941 high-resolution tiles covering the entirety of metropolitan France. The final mosaic achieves an overall accuracy of 73%, effectively capturing diverse urban patterns while overcoming common artifacts like labels and contour lines. We openly release the code, training datasets, and the resulting nationwide urban raster to support future research in long-term urbanization dynamics.</description>

      <title>When Tracking Fails: Analyzing Failure Modes of SAM2 for Point-Based Tracking in Surgical Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video object segmentation (VOS) models such as SAM2 offer promising zero-shot tracking capabilities for surgical videos using minimal user input. Among the available input types, point-based tracking offers an efficient and low-cost alternative, yet its reliability and failure cases in complex surgical environments are not well understood. In this work, we systematically analyze the failure modes of point-based tracking in laparoscopic cholecystectomy videos. Focusing on three surgical targets, the gallbladder, grasper, and L-hook electrocautery, we compare the performance of point-based tracking with segmentation mask initialization. Our results show that point-based tracking is competitive for surgical tools but consistently underperforms for anatomical targets, where tissue similarity and ambiguous boundaries lead to failure. Through qualitative analysis, we reveal key factors influencing tracking outcomes and provide several actionable recommendations for selecting and placing tracking points to improve performance in surgical video analysis.</description>

      <title>FRIEREN: Federated Learning with Vision-Language Regularization for Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federeated Learning (FL) offers a privacy-preserving solution for Semantic Segmentation (SS) tasks to adapt to new domains, but faces significant challenges from these domain shifts, particularly when client data is unlabeled. However, most existing FL methods unrealistically assume access to labeled data on remote clients or fail to leverage the power of modern Vision Foundation Models (VFMs). Here, we propose a novel and challenging task, FFREEDG, in which a model is pretrained on a server's labeled source dataset and subsequently trained across clients using only their unlabeled data, without ever re-accessing the source. To solve FFREEDG, we propose FRIEREN, a framework that leverages the knowledge of a VFM by integrating vision and language modalities. Our approach employs a Vision-Language decoder guided by CLIP-based text embeddings to improve semantic disambiguation and uses a weak-to-strong consistency learning strategy for robust local training on pseudo-labels. Our experiments on synthetic-to-real and clear-to-adverse-weather benchmarks demonstrate that our framework effectively tackles this new task, achieving competitive performance against established domain generalization and adaptation methods and setting a strong baseline for future research.</description>

      <title>Unlocking Vision-Language Models for Video Anomaly Detection via Fine-Grained Prompting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prompting has emerged as a practical way to adapt frozen vision-language models (VLMs) for video anomaly detection (VAD). Yet, existing prompts are often overly abstract, overlooking the fine-grained human-object interactions or action semantics that define complex anomalies in surveillance videos. We propose ASK-Hint, a structured prompting framework that leverages action-centric knowledge to elicit more accurate and interpretable reasoning from frozen VLMs. Our approach organizes prompts into semantically coherent groups (e.g. violence, property crimes, public safety) and formulates fine-grained guiding questions that align model predictions with discriminative visual cues. Extensive experiments on UCF-Crime and XD-Violence show that ASK-Hint consistently improves AUC over prior baselines, achieving state-of-the-art performance compared to both fine-tuned and training-free methods. Beyond accuracy, our framework provides interpretable reasoning traces towards anomaly and demonstrates strong generalization across datasets and VLM backbones. These results highlight the critical role of prompt granularity and establish ASK-Hint as a new training-free and generalizable solution for explainable video anomaly detection.</description>

      <title>GeoPurify: A Data-Efficient Geometric Distillation Framework for Open-Vocabulary 3D Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent attempts to transfer features from 2D Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to 3D semantic segmentation expose a persistent trade-off. Directly projecting 2D features into 3D yields noisy and fragmented predictions, whereas enforcing geometric coherence necessitates costly training pipelines and large-scale annotated 3D data. We argue that this limitation stems from the dominant segmentation-and-matching paradigm, which fails to reconcile 2D semantics with 3D geometric structure. The geometric cues are not eliminated during the 2D-to-3D transfer but remain latent within the noisy and view-aggregated features. To exploit this property, we propose GeoPurify that applies a small Student Affinity Network to purify 2D VLM-generated 3D point features using geometric priors distilled from a 3D self-supervised teacher model. During inference, we devise a Geometry-Guided Pooling module to further denoise the point cloud and ensure the semantic and structural consistency. Benefiting from latent geometric information and the learned affinity network, GeoPurify effectively mitigates the trade-off and achieves superior data efficiency. Extensive experiments on major 3D benchmarks demonstrate that GeoPurify achieves or surpasses state-of-the-art performance while utilizing only about 1.5% of the training data. Our codes and checkpoints are available at [https://github.com/tj12323/GeoPurify](https://github.com/tj12323/GeoPurify).</description>

      <title>Cross-Breed Pig Identification Using Auricular Vein Pattern Recognition: A Machine Learning Approach for Small-Scale Farming Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate livestock identification is a cornerstone of modern farming: it supports health monitoring, breeding programs, and productivity tracking. However, common pig identification methods, such as ear tags and microchips, are often unreliable, costly, target pure breeds, and thus impractical for small-scale farmers. To address this gap, we propose a noninvasive biometric identification approach that leverages uniqueness of the auricular vein patterns. To this end, we have collected 800 ear images from 20 mixed-breed pigs (Landrace cross Pietrain and Duroc cross Pietrain), captured using a standard smartphone and simple back lighting. A multistage computer vision pipeline was developed to enhance vein visibility, extract structural and spatial features, and generate biometric signatures. These features were then classified using machine learning models. Support Vector Machines (SVM) achieved the highest accuracy: correctly identifying pigs with 98.12% precision across mixed-breed populations. The entire process from image processing to classification was completed in an average of 8.3 seconds, demonstrating feasibility for real-time farm deployment. We believe that by replacing fragile physical identifiers with permanent biological markers, this system provides farmers with a cost-effective and stress-free method of animal identification. More broadly, the findings confirm the practicality of auricular vein biometrics for digitizing livestock management, reinforcing its potential to extend the benefits of precision farming to resource-constrained agricultural communities.</description>

      <title>MMDEW: Multipurpose Multiclass Density Estimation in the Wild</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Density map estimation can be used to estimate object counts in dense and occluded scenes where discrete counting-by-detection methods fail. We propose a multicategory counting framework that leverages a Twins pyramid vision-transformer backbone and a specialised multi-class counting head built on a state-of-the-art multiscale decoding approach. A two-task design adds a segmentation-based Category Focus Module, suppressing inter-category cross-talk at training time. Training and evaluation on the VisDrone and iSAID benchmarks demonstrates superior performance versus prior multicategory crowd-counting approaches (33%, 43% and 64% reduction to MAE), and the comparison with YOLOv11 underscores the necessity of crowd counting methods in dense scenes. The method's regional loss opens up multi-class crowd counting to new domains, demonstrated through the application to a biodiversity monitoring dataset, highlighting its capacity to inform conservation efforts and enable scalable ecological insights.</description>

      <title>TempoControl: Temporal Attention Guidance for Text-to-Video Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in generative video models have enabled the creation of high-quality videos based on natural language prompts. However, these models frequently lack fine-grained temporal control, meaning they do not allow users to specify when particular visual elements should appear within a generated sequence. In this work, we introduce TempoControl, a method that allows for temporal alignment of visual concepts during inference, without requiring retraining or additional supervision. TempoControl utilizes cross-attention maps, a key component of text-to-video diffusion models, to guide the timing of concepts through a novel optimization approach. Our method steers attention using three complementary principles: aligning its temporal shape with a control signal (via correlation), amplifying it where visibility is needed (via energy), and maintaining spatial focus (via entropy). TempoControl allows precise control over timing while ensuring high video quality and diversity. We demonstrate its effectiveness across various video generation applications, including temporal reordering for single and multiple objects, as well as action and audio-aligned generation.</description>

      <title>RewardMap: Tackling Sparse Rewards in Fine-grained Visual Reasoning via Multi-Stage Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fine-grained visual reasoning remains a core challenge for multimodal large language models (MLLMs). The recently introduced ReasonMap highlights this gap by showing that even advanced MLLMs struggle with spatial reasoning in structured and information-rich settings such as transit maps, a task of clear practical and scientific importance. However, standard reinforcement learning (RL) on such tasks is impeded by sparse rewards and unstable optimization. To address this, we first construct ReasonMap-Plus, an extended dataset that introduces dense reward signals through Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks, enabling effective cold-start training of fine-grained visual understanding skills. Next, we propose RewardMap, a multi-stage RL framework designed to improve both visual understanding and reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. RewardMap incorporates two key designs. First, we introduce a difficulty-aware reward design that incorporates detail rewards, directly tackling the sparse rewards while providing richer supervision. Second, we propose a multi-stage RL scheme that bootstraps training from simple perception to complex reasoning tasks, offering a more effective cold-start strategy than conventional Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Experiments on ReasonMap and ReasonMap-Plus demonstrate that each component of RewardMap contributes to consistent performance gains, while their combination yields the best results. Moreover, models trained with RewardMap achieve an average improvement of 3.47% across 6 benchmarks spanning spatial reasoning, fine-grained visual reasoning, and general tasks beyond transit maps, underscoring enhanced visual understanding and reasoning capabilities.</description>

      <title>DragFlow: Unleashing DiT Priors with Region Based Supervision for Drag Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Drag-based image editing has long suffered from distortions in the target region, largely because the priors of earlier base models, Stable Diffusion, are insufficient to project optimized latents back onto the natural image manifold. With the shift from UNet-based DDPMs to more scalable DiT with flow matching (e.g., SD3.5, FLUX), generative priors have become significantly stronger, enabling advances across diverse editing tasks. However, drag-based editing has yet to benefit from these stronger priors. This work proposes the first framework to effectively harness FLUX's rich prior for drag-based editing, dubbed DragFlow, achieving substantial gains over baselines. We first show that directly applying point-based drag editing to DiTs performs poorly: unlike the highly compressed features of UNets, DiT features are insufficiently structured to provide reliable guidance for point-wise motion supervision. To overcome this limitation, DragFlow introduces a region-based editing paradigm, where affine transformations enable richer and more consistent feature supervision. Additionally, we integrate pretrained open-domain personalization adapters (e.g., IP-Adapter) to enhance subject consistency, while preserving background fidelity through gradient mask-based hard constraints. Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are further employed to resolve task ambiguities. For evaluation, we curate a novel Region-based Dragging benchmark (ReD Bench) featuring region-level dragging instructions. Extensive experiments on DragBench-DR and ReD Bench show that DragFlow surpasses both point-based and region-based baselines, setting a new state-of-the-art in drag-based image editing. Code and datasets will be publicly available upon publication.</description>

      <title>From Frames to Clips: Efficient Key Clip Selection for Long-Form Video Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable results on a variety of vision language tasks, yet their practical use is limited by the "needle in a haystack" problem: the massive number of visual tokens produced from raw video frames exhausts the model's context window. Existing solutions alleviate this issue by selecting a sparse set of frames, thereby reducing token count, but such frame-wise selection discards essential temporal dynamics, leading to suboptimal reasoning about motion and event continuity. In this work we systematically explore the impact of temporal information and demonstrate that extending selection from isolated key frames to key clips, which are short, temporally coherent segments, improves video understanding. To maintain a fixed computational budget while accommodating the larger token footprint of clips, we propose an adaptive resolution strategy that dynamically balances spatial resolution and clip length, ensuring a constant token count per video. Experiments on three long-form video benchmarks demonstrate that our training-free approach, F2C, outperforms uniform sampling up to 8.1%, 5.6%, and 10.3% on Video-MME, LongVideoBench and MLVU benchmarks, respectively. These results highlight the importance of preserving temporal coherence in frame selection and provide a practical pathway for scaling Video LLMs to real world video understanding applications.

      <title>Paving the Way Towards Kinematic Assessment Using Monocular Video: A Preclinical Benchmark of State-of-the-Art Deep-Learning-Based 3D Human Pose Estimators Against Inertial Sensors in Daily Living Activities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advances in machine learning and wearable sensors offer new opportunities for capturing and analyzing human movement outside specialized laboratories. Accurate assessment of human movement under real-world conditions is essential for telemedicine, sports science, and rehabilitation. This preclinical benchmark compares monocular video-based 3D human pose estimation models with inertial measurement units (IMUs), leveraging the VIDIMU dataset containing a total of 13 clinically relevant daily activities which were captured using both commodity video cameras and five IMUs. During this initial study only healthy subjects were recorded, so results cannot be generalized to pathological cohorts. Joint angles derived from state-of-the-art deep learning frameworks (MotionAGFormer, MotionBERT, MMPose 2D-to-3D pose lifting, and NVIDIA BodyTrack) were evaluated against joint angles computed from IMU data using OpenSim inverse kinematics following the Human3.6M dataset format with 17 keypoints. Among them, MotionAGFormer demonstrated superior performance, achieving the lowest overall RMSE ($9.27\deg \pm 4.80\deg$) and MAE ($7.86\deg \pm 4.18\deg$), as well as the highest Pearson correlation ($0.86 \pm 0.15$) and the highest coefficient of determination $R^{2}$ ($0.67 \pm 0.28$). The results reveal that both technologies are viable for out-of-the-lab kinematic assessment. However, they also highlight key trade-offs between video- and sensor-based approaches including costs, accessibility, and precision. This study clarifies where off-the-shelf video models already provide clinically promising kinematics in healthy adults and where they lag behind IMU-based estimates while establishing valuable guidelines for researchers and clinicians seeking to develop robust, cost-effective, and user-friendly solutions for telehealth and remote patient monitoring.</description>

      <title>NeuroSwift: A Lightweight Cross-Subject Framework for fMRI Visual Reconstruction of Complex Scenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconstructing visual information from brain activity via computer vision technology provides an intuitive understanding of visual neural mechanisms. Despite progress in decoding fMRI data with generative models, achieving accurate cross-subject reconstruction of visual stimuli remains challenging and computationally demanding. This difficulty arises from inter-subject variability in neural representations and the brain's abstract encoding of core semantic features in complex visual inputs. To address these challenges, we propose NeuroSwift, which integrates complementary adapters via diffusion: AutoKL for low-level features and CLIP for semantics. NeuroSwift's CLIP Adapter is trained on Stable Diffusion generated images paired with COCO captions to emulate higher visual cortex encoding. For cross-subject generalization, we pretrain on one subject and then fine-tune only 17 percent of parameters (fully connected layers) for new subjects, while freezing other components. This enables state-of-the-art performance with only one hour of training per subject on lightweight GPUs (three RTX 4090), and it outperforms existing methods.</description>

      <title>microCLIP: Unsupervised CLIP Adaptation via Coarse-Fine Token Fusion for Fine-Grained Image Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unsupervised adaptation of CLIP-based vision-language models (VLMs) for fine-grained image classification requires sensitivity to microscopic local cues. While CLIP exhibits strong zero-shot transfer, its reliance on coarse global features restricts its performance on fine-grained classification tasks. Prior efforts inject fine-grained knowledge by aligning large language model (LLM) descriptions with the CLIP $\texttt{[CLS]}$ token; however, this approach overlooks spatial precision. We propose $\textbf{microCLIP}$, a self-training framework that jointly refines CLIP's visual and textual representations using fine-grained cues. At its core is Saliency-Oriented Attention Pooling (SOAP) within a lightweight TokenFusion module, which builds a saliency-guided $\texttt{[FG]}$ token from patch embeddings and fuses it with the global $\texttt{[CLS]}$ token for coarse-fine alignment. To stabilize adaptation, we introduce a two-headed LLM-derived classifier: a frozen classifier that, via multi-view alignment, provides a stable text-based prior for pseudo-labeling, and a learnable classifier initialized from LLM descriptions and fine-tuned with TokenFusion. We further develop Dynamic Knowledge Aggregation, which convexly combines fixed LLM/CLIP priors with TokenFusion's evolving logits to iteratively refine pseudo-labels. Together, these components uncover latent fine-grained signals in CLIP, yielding a consistent $2.90\%$ average accuracy gain across 13 fine-grained benchmarks while requiring only light adaptation. Our code is available at https://github.com/sathiiii/microCLIP.</description>

      <title>VidGuard-R1: AI-Generated Video Detection and Explanation via Reasoning MLLMs and RL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of AI-generated videos, there is an urgent need for effective detection tools to mitigate societal risks such as misinformation and reputational harm. In addition to accurate classification, it is essential that detection models provide interpretable explanations to ensure transparency for regulators and end users. To address these challenges, we introduce VidGuard-R1, the first video authenticity detector that fine-tunes a multi-modal large language model (MLLM) using group relative policy optimization (GRPO). Our model delivers both highly accurate judgments and insightful reasoning. We curate a challenging dataset of 140k real and AI-generated videos produced by state-of-the-art generation models, carefully designing the generation process to maximize discrimination difficulty. We then fine-tune Qwen-VL using GRPO with two specialized reward models that target temporal artifacts and generation complexity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VidGuard-R1 achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on existing benchmarks, with additional training pushing accuracy above 95%. Case studies further show that VidGuard-R1 produces precise and interpretable rationales behind its predictions. The code is publicly available at https://VidGuard-R1.github.io.</description>

      <title>Self-Forcing++: Towards Minute-Scale High-Quality Video Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models have revolutionized image and video generation, achieving unprecedented visual quality. However, their reliance on transformer architectures incurs prohibitively high computational costs, particularly when extending generation to long videos. Recent work has explored autoregressive formulations for long video generation, typically by distilling from short-horizon bidirectional teachers. Nevertheless, given that teacher models cannot synthesize long videos, the extrapolation of student models beyond their training horizon often leads to pronounced quality degradation, arising from the compounding of errors within the continuous latent space. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective approach to mitigate quality degradation in long-horizon video generation without requiring supervision from long-video teachers or retraining on long video datasets. Our approach centers on exploiting the rich knowledge of teacher models to provide guidance for the student model through sampled segments drawn from self-generated long videos. Our method maintains temporal consistency while scaling video length by up to 20x beyond teacher's capability, avoiding common issues such as over-exposure and error-accumulation without recomputing overlapping frames like previous methods. When scaling up the computation, our method shows the capability of generating videos up to 4 minutes and 15 seconds, equivalent to 99.9% of the maximum span supported by our base model's position embedding and more than 50x longer than that of our baseline model.

      <title>Learning to Generate Object Interactions with Physics-Guided Video Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent models for video generation have achieved remarkable progress and are now deployed in film, social media production, and advertising. Beyond their creative potential, such models also hold promise as world simulators for robotics and embodied decision making. Despite strong advances, however, current approaches still struggle to generate physically plausible object interactions and lack physics-grounded control mechanisms. To address this limitation, we introduce KineMask, an approach for physics-guided video generation that enables realistic rigid body control, interactions, and effects. Given a single image and a specified object velocity, our method generates videos with inferred motions and future object interactions. We propose a two-stage training strategy that gradually removes future motion supervision via object masks. Using this strategy we train video diffusion models (VDMs) on synthetic scenes of simple interactions and demonstrate significant improvements of object interactions in real scenes. Furthermore, KineMask integrates low-level motion control with high-level textual conditioning via predictive scene descriptions, leading to effective support for synthesis of complex dynamical phenomena. Extensive experiments show that KineMask achieves strong improvements over recent models of comparable size. Ablation studies further highlight the complementary roles of low- and high-level conditioning in VDMs. Our code, model, and data will be made publicly available.</description>

      <title>MultiModal Action Conditioned Video Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current video models fail as world model as they lack fine-graiend control. General-purpose household robots require real-time fine motor control to handle delicate tasks and urgent situations. In this work, we introduce fine-grained multimodal actions to capture such precise control. We consider senses of proprioception, kinesthesia, force haptics, and muscle activation. Such multimodal senses naturally enables fine-grained interactions that are difficult to simulate with text-conditioned generative models. To effectively simulate fine-grained multisensory actions, we develop a feature learning paradigm that aligns these modalities while preserving the unique information each modality provides. We further propose a regularization scheme to enhance causality of the action trajectory features in representing intricate interaction dynamics. Experiments show that incorporating multimodal senses improves simulation accuracy and reduces temporal drift. Extensive ablation studies and downstream applications demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of our work.</description>

      <title>VideoNSA: Native Sparse Attention Scales Video Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video understanding in multimodal language models remains limited by context length: models often miss key transition frames and struggle to maintain coherence across long time scales. To address this, we adapt Native Sparse Attention (NSA) to video-language models. Our method, VideoNSA, adapts Qwen2.5-VL through end-to-end training on a 216K video instruction dataset. We employ a hardware-aware hybrid approach to attention, preserving dense attention for text, while employing NSA for video. Compared to token-compression and training-free sparse baselines, VideoNSA achieves improved performance on long-video understanding, temporal reasoning, and spatial benchmarks. Further ablation analysis reveals four key findings: (1) reliable scaling to 128K tokens; (2) an optimal global-local attention allocation at a fixed budget; (3) task-dependent branch usage patterns; and (4) the learnable combined sparse attention help induce dynamic attention sinks.</description>

      <title>NoiseShift: Resolution-Aware Noise Recalibration for Better Low-Resolution Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models trained on a fixed set of resolutions often fail to generalize, even when asked to generate images at lower resolutions than those seen during training. High-resolution text-to-image generators are currently unable to easily offer an out-of-the-box budget-efficient alternative to their users who might not need high-resolution images. We identify a key technical insight in diffusion models that when addressed can help tackle this limitation: Noise schedulers have unequal perceptual effects across resolutions. The same level of noise removes disproportionately more signal from lower-resolution images than from high-resolution images, leading to a train-test mismatch. We propose NoiseShift, a training-free method that recalibrates the noise level of the denoiser conditioned on resolution size. NoiseShift requires no changes to model architecture or sampling schedule and is compatible with existing models. When applied to Stable Diffusion 3, Stable Diffusion 3.5, and Flux-Dev, quality at low resolutions is significantly improved. On LAION-COCO, NoiseShift improves SD3.5 by 15.89%, SD3 by 8.56%, and Flux-Dev by 2.44% in FID on average. On CelebA, NoiseShift improves SD3.5 by 10.36%, SD3 by 5.19%, and Flux-Dev by 3.02% in FID on average. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of NoiseShift in mitigating resolution-dependent artifacts and enhancing the quality of low-resolution image generation.</description>

      <title>Inferring Dynamic Physical Properties from Video Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the task of predicting dynamic physical properties from videos. More specifically, we consider physical properties that require temporal information to be inferred: elasticity of a bouncing object, viscosity of a flowing liquid, and dynamic friction of an object sliding on a surface. To this end, we make the following contributions: (i) We collect a new video dataset for each physical property, consisting of synthetic training and testing splits, as well as a real split for real world evaluation. (ii) We explore three ways to infer the physical property from videos: (a) an oracle method where we supply the visual cues that intrinsically reflect the property using classical computer vision techniques; (b) a simple read out mechanism using a visual prompt and trainable prompt vector for cross-attention on pre-trained video generative and self-supervised models; and (c) prompt strategies for Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs). (iii) We show that video foundation models trained in a generative or self-supervised manner achieve a similar performance, though behind that of the oracle, and MLLMs are currently inferior to the other models, though their performance can be improved through suitable prompting.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Can a model distinguish between the sound of a spoon hitting a hardwood floor versus a carpeted one? Everyday object interactions produce sounds unique to the objects involved. We introduce the sounding object detection task to evaluate a model's ability to link these sounds to the objects directly involved. Inspired by human perception, our multimodal object-aware framework learns from in-the-wild egocentric videos. To encourage an object-centric approach, we first develop an automatic pipeline to compute segmentation masks of the objects involved to guide the model's focus during training towards the most informative regions of the interaction. A slot attention visual encoder is used to further enforce an object prior. We demonstrate state of the art performance on our new task along with existing multimodal action understanding tasks.</description>

      <title>StealthAttack: Robust 3D Gaussian Splatting Poisoning via Density-Guided Illusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D scene representation methods like Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have significantly advanced novel view synthesis. As these methods become prevalent, addressing their vulnerabilities becomes critical. We analyze 3DGS robustness against image-level poisoning attacks and propose a novel density-guided poisoning method. Our method strategically injects Gaussian points into low-density regions identified via Kernel Density Estimation (KDE), embedding viewpoint-dependent illusory objects clearly visible from poisoned views while minimally affecting innocent views. Additionally, we introduce an adaptive noise strategy to disrupt multi-view consistency, further enhancing attack effectiveness. We propose a KDE-based evaluation protocol to assess attack difficulty systematically, enabling objective benchmarking for future research. Extensive experiments demonstrate our method's superior performance compared to state-of-the-art techniques. Project page: https://hentci.github.io/stealthattack/</description>

      <title>Optimal Control Meets Flow Matching: A Principled Route to Multi-Subject Fidelity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models excel on single-entity prompts but struggle with multi-subject descriptions, often showing attribute leakage, identity entanglement, and subject omissions. We introduce the first theoretical framework with a principled, optimizable objective for steering sampling dynamics toward multi-subject fidelity. Viewing flow matching (FM) through stochastic optimal control (SOC), we formulate subject disentanglement as control over a trained FM sampler. This yields two architecture-agnostic algorithms: (i) a training-free test-time controller that perturbs the base velocity with a single-pass update, and (ii) Adjoint Matching, a lightweight fine-tuning rule that regresses a control network to a backward adjoint signal while preserving base-model capabilities. The same formulation unifies prior attention heuristics, extends to diffusion models via a flow-diffusion correspondence, and provides the first fine-tuning route explicitly designed for multi-subject fidelity. Empirically, on Stable Diffusion 3.5, FLUX, and Stable Diffusion XL, both algorithms consistently improve multi-subject alignment while maintaining base-model style. Test-time control runs efficiently on commodity GPUs, and fine-tuned controllers trained on limited prompts generalize to unseen ones. We further highlight FOCUS (Flow Optimal Control for Unentangled Subjects), which achieves state-of-the-art multi-subject fidelity across models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Access to obstetric ultrasound is often limited in low-resource settings, particularly in rural areas of low- and middle-income countries. This work proposes a human-in-the-loop artificial intelligence (AI) system designed to assist midwives in acquiring diagnostically relevant fetal images using blind sweep protocols. The system incorporates a classification model along with a web-based platform for asynchronous specialist reviews. By identifying key frames in blind sweep studies, the AI system allows specialists to concentrate on interpretation rather than having to review entire videos. To evaluate its performance, blind sweep videos captured by a small group of soft-trained midwives using a low-cost Point-of-Care Ultrasound (POCUS) device were analyzed. The system demonstrated promising results in identifying standard fetal planes from sweeps made by non-experts. A field evaluation indicated good usability and a low cognitive workload, suggesting that it has the potential to expand access to prenatal imaging in underserved regions.</description>

      <title>JaneEye: A 12-nm 2K-FPS 18.9-$\mu$J/Frame Event-based Eye Tracking Accelerator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Eye tracking has become a key technology for gaze-based interactions in Extended Reality (XR). However, conventional frame-based eye-tracking systems often fall short of XR's stringent requirements for high accuracy, low latency, and energy efficiency. Event cameras present a compelling alternative, offering ultra-high temporal resolution and low power consumption. In this paper, we present JaneEye, an energy-efficient event-based eye-tracking hardware accelerator designed specifically for wearable devices, leveraging sparse, high-temporal-resolution event data. We introduce an ultra-lightweight neural network architecture featuring a novel ConvJANET layer, which simplifies the traditional ConvLSTM by retaining only the forget gate, thereby halving computational complexity without sacrificing temporal modeling capability. Our proposed model achieves high accuracy with a pixel error of 2.45 on the 3ET+ dataset, using only 17.6K parameters, with up to 1250 Hz event frame rate. To further enhance hardware efficiency, we employ custom linear approximations of activation functions (hardsigmoid and hardtanh) and fixed-point quantization. Through software-hardware co-design, our 12-nm ASIC implementation operates at 400 MHz, delivering an end-to-end latency of 0.5 ms (equivalent to 2000 Frames Per Second (FPS)) at an energy efficiency of 18.9 $\mu$J/frame. JaneEye sets a new benchmark in low-power, high-performance eye-tracking solutions suitable for integration into next-generation XR wearables.</description>

      <title>Ovi: Twin Backbone Cross-Modal Fusion for Audio-Video Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Audio-video generation has often relied on complex multi-stage architectures or sequential synthesis of sound and visuals. We introduce Ovi, a unified paradigm for audio-video generation that models the two modalities as a single generative process. By using blockwise cross-modal fusion of twin-DiT modules, Ovi achieves natural synchronization and removes the need for separate pipelines or post hoc alignment. To facilitate fine-grained multimodal fusion modeling, we initialize an audio tower with an architecture identical to that of a strong pretrained video model. Trained from scratch on hundreds of thousands of hours of raw audio, the audio tower learns to generate realistic sound effects, as well as speech that conveys rich speaker identity and emotion. Fusion is obtained by jointly training the identical video and audio towers via blockwise exchange of timing (via scaled-RoPE embeddings) and semantics (through bidirectional cross-attention) on a vast video corpus. Our model enables cinematic storytelling with natural speech and accurate, context-matched sound effects, producing movie-grade video clips. All the demos, code and model weights are published at https://aaxwaz.github.io/Ovi</description>

      <title>From 2D to 3D, Deep Learning-based Shape Reconstruction in Magnetic Resonance Imaging: A Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning-based 3-dimensional (3D) shape reconstruction from 2-dimensional (2D) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become increasingly important in medical disease diagnosis, treatment planning, and computational modeling. This review surveys the methodological landscape of 3D MRI reconstruction, focusing on 4 primary approaches: point cloud, mesh-based, shape-aware, and volumetric models. For each category, we analyze the current state-of-the-art techniques, their methodological foundation, limitations, and applications across anatomical structures. We provide an extensive overview ranging from cardiac to neurological to lung imaging. We also focus on the clinical applicability of models to diseased anatomy, and the influence of their training and testing data. We examine publicly available datasets, computational demands, and evaluation metrics. Finally, we highlight the emerging research directions including multimodal integration and cross-modality frameworks. This review aims to provide researchers with a structured overview of current 3D reconstruction methodologies to identify opportunities for advancing deep learning towards more robust, generalizable, and clinically impactful solutions.</description>

      <title>MorphGen: Controllable and Morphologically Plausible Generative Cell-Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulating in silico cellular responses to interventions is a promising direction to accelerate high-content image-based assays, critical for advancing drug discovery and gene editing. To support this, we introduce MorphGen, a state-of-the-art diffusion-based generative model for fluorescent microscopy that enables controllable generation across multiple cell types and perturbations. To capture biologically meaningful patterns consistent with known cellular morphologies, MorphGen is trained with an alignment loss to match its representations to the phenotypic embeddings of OpenPhenom, a state-of-the-art biological foundation model. Unlike prior approaches that compress multichannel stains into RGB images -- thus sacrificing organelle-specific detail -- MorphGen generates the complete set of fluorescent channels jointly, preserving per-organelle structures and enabling a fine-grained morphological analysis that is essential for biological interpretation. We demonstrate biological consistency with real images via CellProfiler features, and MorphGen attains an FID score over $35\%$ lower than the prior state-of-the-art MorphoDiff, which only generates RGB images for a single cell type. Code is available at https://github.com/czi-ai/MorphGen.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Quality Metric for Video Frame Interpolation Based on Motion-Field Divergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Video frame interpolation is a fundamental tool for temporal video enhancement, but existing quality metrics struggle to evaluate the perceptual impact of interpolation artefacts effectively. Metrics like PSNR, SSIM and LPIPS ignore temporal coherence. State-of-the-art quality metrics tailored towards video frame interpolation, like FloLPIPS, have been developed but suffer from computational inefficiency that limits their practical application. We present $\text{PSNR}_{\text{DIV}}$, a novel full-reference quality metric that enhances PSNR through motion divergence weighting, a technique adapted from archival film restoration where it was developed to detect temporal inconsistencies. Our approach highlights singularities in motion fields which is then used to weight image errors. Evaluation on the BVI-VFI dataset (180 sequences across multiple frame rates, resolutions and interpolation methods) shows $\text{PSNR}_{\text{DIV}}$ achieves statistically significant improvements: +0.09 Pearson Linear Correlation Coefficient over FloLPIPS, while being 2.5$\times$ faster and using 4$\times$ less memory. Performance remains consistent across all content categories and are robust to the motion estimator used. The efficiency and accuracy of $\text{PSNR}_{\text{DIV}}$ enables fast quality evaluation and practical use as a loss function for training neural networks for video frame interpolation tasks. An implementation of our metric is available at www.github.com/conalld/psnr-div.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robots must adapt to diverse human instructions and operate safely in unstructured, open-world environments. Recent Vision-Language models (VLMs) offer strong priors for grounding language and perception, but remain difficult to steer for navigation due to differences in action spaces and pretraining objectives that hamper transferability to robotics tasks. Towards addressing this, we introduce VENTURA, a vision-language navigation system that finetunes internet-pretrained image diffusion models for path planning. Instead of directly predicting low-level actions, VENTURA generates a path mask (i.e. a visual plan) in image space that captures fine-grained, context-aware navigation behaviors. A lightweight behavior-cloning policy grounds these visual plans into executable trajectories, yielding an interface that follows natural language instructions to generate diverse robot behaviors. To scale training, we supervise on path masks derived from self-supervised tracking models paired with VLM-augmented captions, avoiding manual pixel-level annotation or highly engineered data collection setups. In extensive real-world evaluations, VENTURA outperforms state-of-the-art foundation model baselines on object reaching, obstacle avoidance, and terrain preference tasks, improving success rates by 33% and reducing collisions by 54% across both seen and unseen scenarios. Notably, we find that VENTURA generalizes to unseen combinations of distinct tasks, revealing emergent compositional capabilities.

      <title>Ultra-Efficient Decoding for End-to-End Neural Compression and Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Image compression and reconstruction are crucial for various digital applications. While contemporary neural compression methods achieve impressive compression rates, the adoption of such technology has been largely hindered by the complexity and large computational costs of the convolution-based decoders during data reconstruction. To address the decoder bottleneck in neural compression, we develop a new compression-reconstruction framework based on incorporating low-rank representation in an autoencoder with vector quantization. We demonstrated that performing a series of computationally efficient low-rank operations on the learned latent representation of images can efficiently reconstruct the data with high quality. Our approach dramatically reduces the computational overhead in the decoding phase of neural compression/reconstruction, essentially eliminating the decoder compute bottleneck while maintaining high fidelity of image outputs.</description>

      <title>On the Role of Domain Experts in Creating Effective Tutoring Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The role that highly curated knowledge, provided by domain experts, could play in creating effective tutoring systems is often overlooked within the AI for education community. In this paper, we highlight this topic by discussing two ways such highly curated expert knowledge could help in creating novel educational systems. First, we will look at how one could use explainable AI (XAI) techniques to automatically create lessons. Most existing XAI methods are primarily aimed at debugging AI systems. However, we will discuss how one could use expert specified rules about solving specific problems along with novel XAI techniques to automatically generate lessons that could be provided to learners. Secondly, we will see how an expert specified curriculum for learning a target concept can help develop adaptive tutoring systems, that can not only provide a better learning experience, but could also allow us to use more efficient algorithms to create these systems. Finally, we will highlight the importance of such methods using a case study of creating a tutoring system for pollinator identification, where such knowledge could easily be elicited from experts.</description>

      <title>Aligning Video Models with Human Social Judgments via Behavior-Guided Fine-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Humans intuitively perceive complex social signals in visual scenes, yet it remains unclear whether state-of-the-art AI models encode the same similarity structure. We study (Q1) whether modern video and language models capture human-perceived similarity in social videos, and (Q2) how to instill this structure into models using human behavioral data. To address this, we introduce a new benchmark of over 49,000 odd-one-out similarity judgments on 250 three-second video clips of social interactions, and discover a modality gap: despite the task being visual, caption-based language embeddings align better with human similarity than any pretrained video model. We close this gap by fine-tuning a TimeSformer video model on these human judgments with our novel hybrid triplet-RSA objective using low-rank adaptation (LoRA), aligning pairwise distances to human similarity. This fine-tuning protocol yields significantly improved alignment with human perceptions on held-out videos in terms of both explained variance and odd-one-out triplet accuracy. Variance partitioning shows that the fine-tuned video model increases shared variance with language embeddings and explains additional unique variance not captured by the language model. Finally, we test transfer via linear probes and find that human-similarity fine-tuning strengthens the encoding of social-affective attributes (intimacy, valence, dominance, communication) relative to the pretrained baseline. Overall, our findings highlight a gap in pretrained video models' social recognition and demonstrate that behavior-guided fine-tuning shapes video representations toward human social perception.</description>

      <title>ActiveUMI: Robotic Manipulation with Active Perception from Robot-Free Human Demonstrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present ActiveUMI, a framework for a data collection system that transfers in-the-wild human demonstrations to robots capable of complex bimanual manipulation. ActiveUMI couples a portable VR teleoperation kit with sensorized controllers that mirror the robot's end-effectors, bridging human-robot kinematics via precise pose alignment. To ensure mobility and data quality, we introduce several key techniques, including immersive 3D model rendering, a self-contained wearable computer, and efficient calibration methods. ActiveUMI's defining feature is its capture of active, egocentric perception. By recording an operator's deliberate head movements via a head-mounted display, our system learns the crucial link between visual attention and manipulation. We evaluate ActiveUMI on six challenging bimanual tasks. Policies trained exclusively on ActiveUMI data achieve an average success rate of 70\% on in-distribution tasks and demonstrate strong generalization, retaining a 56\% success rate when tested on novel objects and in new environments. Our results demonstrate that portable data collection systems, when coupled with learned active perception, provide an effective and scalable pathway toward creating generalizable and highly capable real-world robot policies.</description>

      <title>MPMAvatar: Learning 3D Gaussian Avatars with Accurate and Robust Physics-Based Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While there has been significant progress in the field of 3D avatar creation from visual observations, modeling physically plausible dynamics of humans with loose garments remains a challenging problem. Although a few existing works address this problem by leveraging physical simulation, they suffer from limited accuracy or robustness to novel animation inputs. In this work, we present MPMAvatar, a framework for creating 3D human avatars from multi-view videos that supports highly realistic, robust animation, as well as photorealistic rendering from free viewpoints. For accurate and robust dynamics modeling, our key idea is to use a Material Point Method-based simulator, which we carefully tailor to model garments with complex deformations and contact with the underlying body by incorporating an anisotropic constitutive model and a novel collision handling algorithm. We combine this dynamics modeling scheme with our canonical avatar that can be rendered using 3D Gaussian Splatting with quasi-shadowing, enabling high-fidelity rendering for physically realistic animations. In our experiments, we demonstrate that MPMAvatar significantly outperforms the existing state-of-the-art physics-based avatar in terms of (1) dynamics modeling accuracy, (2) rendering accuracy, and (3) robustness and efficiency. Additionally, we present a novel application in which our avatar generalizes to unseen interactions in a zero-shot manner-which was not achievable with previous learning-based methods due to their limited simulation generalizability.

      <title>Median2Median: Zero-shot Suppression of Structured Noise in Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Image denoising is a fundamental problem in computer vision and medical imaging. However, real-world images are often degraded by structured noise with strong anisotropic correlations that existing methods struggle to remove. Most data-driven approaches rely on large datasets with high-quality labels and still suffer from limited generalizability, whereas existing zero-shot methods avoid this limitation but remain effective only for independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) noise. To address this gap, we propose Median2Median (M2M), a zero-shot denoising framework designed for structured noise. M2M introduces a novel sampling strategy that generates pseudo-independent sub-image pairs from a single noisy input. This strategy leverages directional interpolation and generalized median filtering to adaptively exclude values distorted by structured artifacts. To further enlarge the effective sampling space and eliminate systematic bias, a randomized assignment strategy is employed, ensuring that the sampled sub-image pairs are suitable for Noise2Noise training. In our realistic simulation studies, M2M performs on par with state-of-the-art zero-shot methods under i.i.d. noise, while consistently outperforming them under correlated noise. These findings establish M2M as an efficient, data-free solution for structured noise suppression and mark the first step toward effective zero-shot denoising beyond the strict i.i.d. assumption.</description>

      <title>Beyond Simple Fusion: Adaptive Gated Fusion for Robust Multimodal Sentiment Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal sentiment analysis (MSA) leverages information fusion from diverse modalities (e.g., text, audio, visual) to enhance sentiment prediction. However, simple fusion techniques often fail to account for variations in modality quality, such as those that are noisy, missing, or semantically conflicting. This oversight leads to suboptimal performance, especially in discerning subtle emotional nuances. To mitigate this limitation, we introduce a simple yet efficient \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{G}ated \textbf{F}usion \textbf{N}etwork that adaptively adjusts feature weights via a dual gate fusion mechanism based on information entropy and modality importance. This mechanism mitigates the influence of noisy modalities and prioritizes informative cues following unimodal encoding and cross-modal interaction. Experiments on CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI show that AGFN significantly outperforms strong baselines in accuracy, effectively discerning subtle emotions with robust performance. Visualization analysis of feature representations demonstrates that AGFN enhances generalization by learning from a broader feature distribution, achieved by reducing the correlation between feature location and prediction error, thereby decreasing reliance on specific locations and creating more robust multimodal feature representations.</description>

      <title>VaPR -- Vision-language Preference alignment for Reasoning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Preference finetuning methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with AI-generated feedback have shown promise in aligning Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) with human preferences. However, existing techniques overlook the prevalence of noise in synthetic preference annotations in the form of stylistic and length biases. To this end, we introduce a hard-negative response generation framework based on LLM-guided response editing, that produces rejected responses with targeted errors, maintaining stylistic and length similarity to the accepted ones. Using this framework, we develop the VaPR dataset, comprising 30K high-quality samples, to finetune three LVLM families: LLaVA-V1.5, Qwen2VL &amp; Qwen2.5VL (2B-13B sizes). Our VaPR models deliver significant performance improvements across ten benchmarks, achieving average gains of 6.5% (LLaVA), 4.0% (Qwen2VL), and 1.5% (Qwen2.5VL), with notable improvements on reasoning tasks. A scaling analysis shows that performance consistently improves with data size, with LLaVA models benefiting even at smaller scales. Moreover, VaPR reduces the tendency to answer "Yes" in binary questions - addressing a common failure mode in LVLMs like LLaVA. Lastly, we show that the framework generalizes to open-source LLMs as editors, with models trained on VaPR-OS achieving ~99% of the performance of models trained on \name, which is synthesized using GPT-4o. Our data, models, and code can be found on the project page https://vap-r.github.io</description>

      <title>Towards Photonic Band Diagram Generation with Transformer-Latent Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photonic crystals enable fine control over light propagation at the nanoscale, and thus play a central role in the development of photonic and quantum technologies. Photonic band diagrams (BDs) are a key tool to investigate light propagation into such inhomogeneous structured materials. However, computing BDs requires solving Maxwell's equations across many configurations, making it numerically expensive, especially when embedded in optimization loops for inverse design techniques, for example. To address this challenge, we introduce the first approach for BD generation based on diffusion models, with the capacity to later generalize and scale to arbitrary three dimensional structures. Our method couples a transformer encoder, which extracts contextual embeddings from the input structure, with a latent diffusion model to generate the corresponding BD. In addition, we provide insights into why transformers and diffusion models are well suited to capture the complex interference and scattering phenomena inherent to photonics, paving the way for new surrogate modeling strategies in this domain.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Dynamic Feature Selection for Robust Latent Spaces in Vision Tasks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Latent representations are critical for the performance and robustness of machine learning models, as they encode the essential features of data in a compact and informative manner. However, in vision tasks, these representations are often affected by noisy or irrelevant features, which can degrade the model's performance and generalization capabilities. This paper presents a novel approach for enhancing latent representations using unsupervised Dynamic Feature Selection (DFS). For each instance, the proposed method identifies and removes misleading or redundant information in images, ensuring that only the most relevant features contribute to the latent space. By leveraging an unsupervised framework, our approach avoids reliance on labeled data, making it broadly applicable across various domains and datasets. Experiments conducted on image datasets demonstrate that models equipped with unsupervised DFS achieve significant improvements in generalization performance across various tasks, including clustering and image generation, while incurring a minimal increase in the computational cost.</description>

      <title>Model Merging to Maintain Language-Only Performance in Developmentally Plausible Multimodal Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: State-of-the-art vision-and-language models consist of many parameters and learn from enormous datasets, surpassing the amounts of linguistic data that children are exposed to as they acquire a language. This paper presents our approach to the multimodal track of the BabyLM challenge addressing this discrepancy. We develop language-only and multimodal models in low-resource settings using developmentally plausible datasets, with our multimodal models outperforming previous BabyLM baselines. One finding in the multimodal language model literature is that these models tend to underperform in \textit{language-only} tasks. Therefore, we focus on maintaining language-only abilities in multimodal models. To this end, we experiment with \textit{model merging}, where we fuse the parameters of multimodal models with those of language-only models using weighted linear interpolation. Our results corroborate the findings that multimodal models underperform in language-only benchmarks that focus on grammar, and model merging with text-only models can help alleviate this problem to some extent, while maintaining multimodal performance.</description>

      <title>GFSR-Net: Guided Focus via Segment-Wise Relevance Network for Interpretable Deep Learning in Medical Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning has achieved remarkable success in medical image analysis, however its adoption in clinical practice is limited by a lack of interpretability. These models often make correct predictions without explaining their reasoning. They may also rely on image regions unrelated to the disease or visual cues, such as annotations, that are not present in real-world conditions. This can reduce trust and increase the risk of misleading diagnoses. We introduce the Guided Focus via Segment-Wise Relevance Network (GFSR-Net), an approach designed to improve interpretability and reliability in medical imaging. GFSR-Net uses a small number of human annotations to approximate where a person would focus within an image intuitively, without requiring precise boundaries or exhaustive markings, making the process fast and practical. During training, the model learns to align its focus with these areas, progressively emphasizing features that carry diagnostic meaning. This guidance works across different types of natural and medical images, including chest X-rays, retinal scans, and dermatological images. Our experiments demonstrate that GFSR achieves comparable or superior accuracy while producing saliency maps that better reflect human expectations. This reduces the reliance on irrelevant patterns and increases confidence in automated diagnostic tools.</description>

      <title>ZK-WAGON: Imperceptible Watermark for Image Generation Models using ZK-SNARKs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As image generation models grow increasingly powerful and accessible, concerns around authenticity, ownership, and misuse of synthetic media have become critical. The ability to generate lifelike images indistinguishable from real ones introduces risks such as misinformation, deepfakes, and intellectual property violations. Traditional watermarking methods either degrade image quality, are easily removed, or require access to confidential model internals - making them unsuitable for secure and scalable deployment. We are the first to introduce ZK-WAGON, a novel system for watermarking image generation models using the Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non Interactive Argument of Knowledge (ZK-SNARKs). Our approach enables verifiable proof of origin without exposing model weights, generation prompts, or any sensitive internal information. We propose Selective Layer ZK-Circuit Creation (SL-ZKCC), a method to selectively convert key layers of an image generation model into a circuit, reducing proof generation time significantly. Generated ZK-SNARK proofs are imperceptibly embedded into a generated image via Least Significant Bit (LSB) steganography. We demonstrate this system on both GAN and Diffusion models, providing a secure, model-agnostic pipeline for trustworthy AI image generation.</description>

Abstract: We tackle the challenge of efficiently reconstructing 3D scenes with high detail on objects of interest. Existing 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) methods allocate resources uniformly across the scene, limiting fine detail to Regions Of Interest (ROIs) and leading to inflated model size. We propose ROI-GS, an object-aware framework that enhances local details through object-guided camera selection, targeted Object training, and seamless integration of high-fidelity object of interest reconstructions into the global scene. Our method prioritizes higher resolution details on chosen objects while maintaining real-time performance. Experiments show that ROI-GS significantly improves local quality (up to 2.96 dB PSNR), while reducing overall model size by $\approx 17\%$ of baseline and achieving faster training for a scene with a single object of interest, outperforming existing methods.</description>

      <title>$\text{G}^2$RPO: Granular GRPO for Precise Reward in Flow Models</title>

Abstract: The integration of online reinforcement learning (RL) into diffusion and flow models has recently emerged as a promising approach for aligning generative models with human preferences. Stochastic sampling via Stochastic Differential Equations (SDE) is employed during the denoising process to generate diverse denoising directions for RL exploration. While existing methods effectively explore potential high-value samples, they suffer from sub-optimal preference alignment due to sparse and narrow reward signals. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Granular-GRPO ($\text{G}^2$RPO ) framework that achieves precise and comprehensive reward assessments of sampling directions in reinforcement learning of flow models. Specifically, a Singular Stochastic Sampling strategy is introduced to support step-wise stochastic exploration while enforcing a high correlation between the reward and the injected noise, thereby facilitating a faithful reward for each SDE perturbation. Concurrently, to eliminate the bias inherent in fixed-granularity denoising, we introduce a Multi-Granularity Advantage Integration module that aggregates advantages computed at multiple diffusion scales, producing a more comprehensive and robust evaluation of the sampling directions. Experiments conducted on various reward models, including both in-domain and out-of-domain evaluations, demonstrate that our $\text{G}^2$RPO significantly outperforms existing flow-based GRPO baselines,highlighting its effectiveness and robustness.</description>

      <title>A Multicentric Dataset for Training and Benchmarking Breast Cancer Segmentation in H&amp;E Slides</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.02037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automated semantic segmentation of whole-slide images (WSIs) stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) is essential for large-scale artificial intelligence-based biomarker analysis in breast cancer. However, existing public datasets for breast cancer segmentation lack the morphological diversity needed to support model generalizability and robust biomarker validation across heterogeneous patient cohorts. We introduce BrEast cancEr hisTopathoLogy sEgmentation (BEETLE), a dataset for multiclass semantic segmentation of H&amp;E-stained breast cancer WSIs. It consists of 587 biopsies and resections from three collaborating clinical centers and two public datasets, digitized using seven scanners, and covers all molecular subtypes and histological grades. Using diverse annotation strategies, we collected annotations across four classes - invasive epithelium, non-invasive epithelium, necrosis, and other - with particular focus on morphologies underrepresented in existing datasets, such as ductal carcinoma in situ and dispersed lobular tumor cells. The dataset's diversity and relevance to the rapidly growing field of automated biomarker quantification in breast cancer ensure its high potential for reuse. Finally, we provide a well-curated, multicentric external evaluation set to enable standardized benchmarking of breast cancer segmentation models.</description>

      <title>Spec-Gloss Surfels and Normal-Diffuse Priors for Relightable Glossy Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate reconstruction and relighting of glossy objects remain a longstanding challenge, as object shape, material properties, and illumination are inherently difficult to disentangle. Existing neural rendering approaches often rely on simplified BRDF models or parameterizations that couple diffuse and specular components, which restricts faithful material recovery and limits relighting fidelity. We propose a relightable framework that integrates a microfacet BRDF with the specular-glossiness parameterization into 2D Gaussian Splatting with deferred shading. This formulation enables more physically consistent material decomposition, while diffusion-based priors for surface normals and diffuse color guide early-stage optimization and mitigate ambiguity. A coarse-to-fine optimization of the environment map accelerates convergence and preserves high-dynamic-range specular reflections. Extensive experiments on complex, glossy scenes demonstrate that our method achieves high-quality geometry and material reconstruction, delivering substantially more realistic and consistent relighting under novel illumination compared to existing Gaussian splatting methods.</description>

      <title>SpurBreast: A Curated Dataset for Investigating Spurious Correlations in Real-world Breast MRI Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have demonstrated remarkable success in medical imaging, yet their real-world deployment remains challenging due to spurious correlations, where models can learn non-clinical features instead of meaningful medical patterns. Existing medical imaging datasets are not designed to systematically study this issue, largely due to restrictive licensing and limited supplementary patient data. To address this gap, we introduce SpurBreast, a curated breast MRI dataset that intentionally incorporates spurious correlations to evaluate their impact on model performance. Analyzing over 100 features involving patient, device, and imaging protocol, we identify two dominant spurious signals: magnetic field strength (a global feature influencing the entire image) and image orientation (a local feature affecting spatial alignment). Through controlled dataset splits, we demonstrate that DNNs can exploit these non-clinical signals, achieving high validation accuracy while failing to generalize to unbiased test data. Alongside these two datasets containing spurious correlations, we also provide benchmark datasets without spurious correlations, allowing researchers to systematically investigate clinically relevant and irrelevant features, uncertainty estimation, adversarial robustness, and generalization strategies. Models and datasets are available at https://github.com/utkuozbulak/spurbreast.</description>

      <title>DisCo-Layout: Disentangling and Coordinating Semantic and Physical Refinement in a Multi-Agent Framework for 3D Indoor Layout Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02178v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 3D indoor layout synthesis is crucial for creating virtual environments. Traditional methods struggle with generalization due to fixed datasets. While recent LLM and VLM-based approaches offer improved semantic richness, they often lack robust and flexible refinement, resulting in suboptimal layouts. We develop DisCo-Layout, a novel framework that disentangles and coordinates physical and semantic refinement. For independent refinement, our Semantic Refinement Tool (SRT) corrects abstract object relationships, while the Physical Refinement Tool (PRT) resolves concrete spatial issues via a grid-matching algorithm. For collaborative refinement, a multi-agent framework intelligently orchestrates these tools, featuring a planner for placement rules, a designer for initial layouts, and an evaluator for assessment. Experiments demonstrate DisCo-Layout's state-of-the-art performance, generating realistic, coherent, and generalizable 3D indoor layouts. Our code will be publicly available.</description>

      <title>Uncovering Semantic Selectivity of Latent Groups in Higher Visual Cortex with Mutual Information-Guided Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how neural populations in higher visual areas encode object-centered visual information remains a central challenge in computational neuroscience. Prior works have investigated representational alignment between artificial neural networks and the visual cortex. Nevertheless, these findings are indirect and offer limited insights to the structure of neural populations themselves. Similarly, decoding-based methods have quantified semantic features from neural populations but have not uncovered their underlying organizations. This leaves open a scientific question: "how feature-specific visual information is distributed across neural populations in higher visual areas, and whether it is organized into structured, semantically meaningful subspaces." To tackle this problem, we present MIG-Vis, a method that leverages the generative power of diffusion models to visualize and validate the visual-semantic attributes encoded in neural latent subspaces. Our method first uses a variational autoencoder to infer a group-wise disentangled neural latent subspace from neural populations. Subsequently, we propose a mutual information (MI)-guided diffusion synthesis procedure to visualize the specific visual-semantic features encoded by each latent group. We validate MIG-Vis on multi-session neural spiking datasets from the inferior temporal (IT) cortex of two macaques. The synthesized results demonstrate that our method identifies neural latent groups with clear semantic selectivity to diverse visual features, including object pose, inter-category transformations, and intra-class content. These findings provide direct, interpretable evidence of structured semantic representation in the higher visual cortex and advance our understanding of its encoding principles.</description>

      <title>Measurement-Guided Consistency Model Sampling for Inverse Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.02208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have become powerful generative priors for solving inverse imaging problems, but their reliance on slow multi-step sampling limits practical deployment. Consistency models address this bottleneck by enabling high-quality generation in a single or only a few steps, yet their direct adaptation to inverse problems is underexplored. In this paper, we present a modified consistency sampling approach tailored for inverse problem reconstruction: the sampler's stochasticity is guided by a measurement-consistency mechanism tied to the measurement operator, which enforces fidelity to the acquired measurements while retaining the efficiency of consistency-based generation. Experiments on Fashion-MNIST and LSUN Bedroom datasets demonstrate consistent improvements in perceptual and pixel-level metrics, including Fr\'echet Inception Distance, Kernel Inception Distance, peak signal-to-noise ratio, and structural similarity index measure, compared to baseline consistency sampling, yielding competitive or superior reconstructions with only a handful of steps.</description>

      <title>The Reasoning Boundary Paradox: How Reinforcement Learning Constrains Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a key method for improving Large Language Models' reasoning capabilities, yet recent evidence suggests it may paradoxically shrink the reasoning boundary rather than expand it. This paper investigates the shrinkage issue of RLVR by analyzing its learning dynamics and reveals two critical phenomena that explain this failure. First, we expose negative interference in RLVR, where learning to solve certain training problems actively reduces the likelihood of correct solutions for others, leading to the decline of Pass@$k$ performance, or the probability of generating a correct solution within $k$ attempts. Second, we uncover the winner-take-all phenomenon: RLVR disproportionately reinforces problems with high likelihood, correct solutions, under the base model, while suppressing other initially low-likelihood ones. Through extensive theoretical and empirical analysis on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks, we show that this effect arises from the inherent on-policy sampling in standard RL objectives, causing the model to converge toward narrow solution strategies. Based on these insights, we propose a simple yet effective data curation algorithm that focuses RLVR learning on low-likelihood problems, achieving notable improvement in Pass@$k$ performance.

      <title>The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Scaling Agents for Computer Use</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.02250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computer-use agents (CUAs) hold promise for automating everyday digital tasks, but their unreliability and high variance hinder their application to long-horizon, complex tasks. We introduce Behavior Best-of-N (bBoN), a method that scales over agents by generating multiple rollouts and selecting among them using behavior narratives that describe the agents' rollouts. It enables both wide exploration and principled trajectory selection, substantially improving robustness and success rates. On OSWorld, our bBoN scaling method establishes a new state of the art (SoTA) at 69.9%, significantly outperforming prior methods and approaching human-level performance at 72%, with comprehensive ablations validating key design choices. We further demonstrate strong generalization results to different operating systems on WindowsAgentArena and AndroidWorld. Crucially, our results highlight the unreasonable effectiveness of scaling CUAs, when you do it right: effective scaling requires structured trajectory understanding and selection, and bBoN provides a practical framework to achieve this.</description>

      <title>Do You Know Where Your Camera Is? View-Invariant Policy Learning with Camera Conditioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study view-invariant imitation learning by explicitly conditioning policies on camera extrinsics. Using Plucker embeddings of per-pixel rays, we show that conditioning on extrinsics significantly improves generalization across viewpoints for standard behavior cloning policies, including ACT, Diffusion Policy, and SmolVLA. To evaluate policy robustness under realistic viewpoint shifts, we introduce six manipulation tasks in RoboSuite and ManiSkill that pair "fixed" and "randomized" scene variants, decoupling background cues from camera pose. Our analysis reveals that policies without extrinsics often infer camera pose using visual cues from static backgrounds in fixed scenes; this shortcut collapses when workspace geometry or camera placement shifts. Conditioning on extrinsics restores performance and yields robust RGB-only control without depth. We release the tasks, demonstrations, and code at https://ripl.github.io/know_your_camera/ .</description>

      <title>Test-Time Anchoring for Discrete Diffusion Posterior Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of posterior sampling using pretrained discrete diffusion foundation models, aiming to recover images from noisy measurements without retraining task-specific models. While diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generative modeling, most advances rely on continuous Gaussian diffusion. In contrast, discrete diffusion offers a unified framework for jointly modeling categorical data such as text and images. Beyond unification, discrete diffusion provides faster inference, finer control, and principled training-free Bayesian inference, making it particularly well-suited for posterior sampling. However, existing approaches to discrete diffusion posterior sampling face severe challenges: derivative-free guidance yields sparse signals, continuous relaxations limit applicability, and split Gibbs samplers suffer from the curse of dimensionality. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Anchored Posterior Sampling (APS) for masked diffusion foundation models, built on two key innovations -- quantized expectation for gradient-like guidance in discrete embedding space, and anchored remasking for adaptive decoding. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance among discrete diffusion samplers across linear and nonlinear inverse problems on the standard benchmarks. We further demonstrate the benefits of our approach in training-free stylization and text-guided editing.</description>

      <title>From Behavioral Performance to Internal Competence: Interpreting Vision-Language Models with VLM-Lens</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.02292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce VLM-Lens, a toolkit designed to enable systematic benchmarking, analysis, and interpretation of vision-language models (VLMs) by supporting the extraction of intermediate outputs from any layer during the forward pass of open-source VLMs. VLM-Lens provides a unified, YAML-configurable interface that abstracts away model-specific complexities and supports user-friendly operation across diverse VLMs. It currently supports 16 state-of-the-art base VLMs and their over 30 variants, and is extensible to accommodate new models without changing the core logic.
  The toolkit integrates easily with various interpretability and analysis methods. We demonstrate its usage with two simple analytical experiments, revealing systematic differences in the hidden representations of VLMs across layers and target concepts. VLM-Lens is released as an open-sourced project to accelerate community efforts in understanding and improving VLMs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.02296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Updating diffusion models in an incremental setting would be practical in real-world applications yet computationally challenging. We present a novel learning strategy of Concept Neuron Selection (CNS), a simple yet effective approach to perform personalization in a continual learning scheme. CNS uniquely identifies neurons in diffusion models that are closely related to the target concepts. In order to mitigate catastrophic forgetting problems while preserving zero-shot text-to-image generation ability, CNS finetunes concept neurons in an incremental manner and jointly preserves knowledge learned of previous concepts. Evaluation of real-world datasets demonstrates that CNS achieves state-of-the-art performance with minimal parameter adjustments, outperforming previous methods in both single and multi-concept personalization works. CNS also achieves fusion-free operation, reducing memory storage and processing time for continual personalization.</description>

      <title>Equilibrium Matching: Generative Modeling with Implicit Energy-Based Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Equilibrium Matching (EqM), a generative modeling framework built from an equilibrium dynamics perspective. EqM discards the non-equilibrium, time-conditional dynamics in traditional diffusion and flow-based generative models and instead learns the equilibrium gradient of an implicit energy landscape. Through this approach, we can adopt an optimization-based sampling process at inference time, where samples are obtained by gradient descent on the learned landscape with adjustable step sizes, adaptive optimizers, and adaptive compute. EqM surpasses the generation performance of diffusion/flow models empirically, achieving an FID of 1.90 on ImageNet 256$\times$256. EqM is also theoretically justified to learn and sample from the data manifold. Beyond generation, EqM is a flexible framework that naturally handles tasks including partially noised image denoising, OOD detection, and image composition. By replacing time-conditional velocities with a unified equilibrium landscape, EqM offers a tighter bridge between flow and energy-based models and a simple route to optimization-driven inference.</description>

      <title>LiDAR-HMR: 3D Human Mesh Recovery from LiDAR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.11971v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, point cloud perception tasks have been garnering increasing attention. This paper presents the first attempt to estimate 3D human body mesh from sparse LiDAR point clouds. We found that the major challenge in estimating human pose and mesh from point clouds lies in the sparsity, noise, and incompletion of LiDAR point clouds. Facing these challenges, we propose an effective sparse-to-dense reconstruction scheme to reconstruct 3D human mesh. This involves estimating a sparse representation of a human (3D human pose) and gradually reconstructing the body mesh. To better leverage the 3D structural information of point clouds, we employ a cascaded graph transformer (graphormer) to introduce point cloud features during sparse-to-dense reconstruction. Experimental results on three publicly available databases demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Code: https://github.com/soullessrobot/LiDAR-HMR/</description>

      <title>Meta-Transfer Derm-Diagnosis: Exploring Few-Shot Learning and Transfer Learning for Skin Disease Classification in Long-Tail Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16814v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Building accurate models for rare skin diseases remains challenging due to the lack of sufficient labeled data and the inherently long-tailed distribution of available samples. These issues are further complicated by inconsistencies in how datasets are collected and their varying objectives. To address these challenges, we compare three learning strategies: episodic learning, supervised transfer learning, and contrastive self-supervised pretraining, within a few-shot learning framework. We evaluate five training setups on three benchmark datasets: ISIC2018, Derm7pt, and SD-198. Our findings show that traditional transfer learning approaches, particularly those based on MobileNetV2 and Vision Transformer (ViT) architectures, consistently outperform episodic and self-supervised methods as the number of training examples increases. When combined with batch-level data augmentation techniques such as MixUp, CutMix, and ResizeMix, these models achieve state-of-the-art performance on the SD-198 and Derm7pt datasets, and deliver highly competitive results on ISIC2018. All the source codes related to this work will be made publicly available soon at the provided URL.</description>

      <title>DiffCut: Catalyzing Zero-Shot Semantic Segmentation with Diffusion Features and Recursive Normalized Cut</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02842v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Foundation models have emerged as powerful tools across various domains including language, vision, and multimodal tasks. While prior works have addressed unsupervised image segmentation, they significantly lag behind supervised models. In this paper, we use a diffusion UNet encoder as a foundation vision encoder and introduce DiffCut, an unsupervised zero-shot segmentation method that solely harnesses the output features from the final self-attention block. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that the utilization of these diffusion features in a graph based segmentation algorithm, significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on zero-shot segmentation. Specifically, we leverage a recursive Normalized Cut algorithm that softly regulates the granularity of detected objects and produces well-defined segmentation maps that precisely capture intricate image details. Our work highlights the remarkably accurate semantic knowledge embedded within diffusion UNet encoders that could then serve as foundation vision encoders for downstream tasks.

      <title>Interior Object Geometry via Fitted Frames</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14357v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a means of computing fitted frames on the boundary and in the interior of objects and using them to provide the basis for producing geometric features from them that are not only alignment-free but most importantly can be made to correspond locally across a population of objects. We describe a representation targeted for anatomic objects which is designed to enable this strong locational correspondence within object populations and thus to provide powerful object statistics. It accomplishes this by understanding an object as the diffeomorphic deformation of the closure of the interior of an ellipsoid and by using a skeletal representation fitted throughout the deformation to produce a model of the target object, where the object is provided initially in the form of a boundary mesh. Via classification performance on hippocampi shape between individuals with a disorder vs. others, we compare our method to two state-of-theart methods for producing object representations that are intended to capture geometric correspondence across a population of objects and to yield geometric features useful for statistics, and we show notably improved classification performance by this new representation, which we call the evolutionary s-rep. The geometric features that are derived from each of the representations, especially via fitted frames, are discussed.</description>

      <title>Sparkle: Mastering Basic Spatial Capabilities in Vision Language Models Elicits Generalization to Spatial Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16162v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) perform well on many tasks but often fail at spatial reasoning, which is essential for navigation and interaction with physical environments. Many spatial reasoning tasks depend on fundamental two-dimensional (2D) skills, yet our evaluation shows that state-of-the-art VLMs give implausible or incorrect answers to composite spatial problems, including simple pathfinding tasks that humans solve effortlessly. To address this, we enhance 2D spatial reasoning in VLMs by training them only on basic spatial capabilities. We first disentangle 2D spatial reasoning into three core components: direction comprehension, distance estimation, and localization. We hypothesize that mastering these skills substantially improves performance on complex spatial tasks that require advanced reasoning and combinatorial problem solving, while also generalizing to real-world scenarios. To test this, we introduce Sparkle, a framework that generates synthetic data to provide targeted supervision across these three capabilities and yields an instruction dataset for each. Experiments show that VLMs fine-tuned with \emph{Sparkle} improve not only on basic tasks but also on composite and out-of-distribution real-world spatial reasoning tasks. These results indicate that enhancing basic spatial skills through synthetic generalization effectively advances complex spatial reasoning and offers a systematic strategy for boosting the spatial understanding of VLMs. Source codes of Sparkle are available at https://github.com/YihongT/Sparkle.</description>

      <title>There and Back Again: On the relation between Noise and Image Inversions in Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23530v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion Models achieve state-of-the-art performance in generating new samples but lack a low-dimensional latent space that encodes the data into editable features. Inversion-based methods address this by reversing the denoising trajectory, transferring images to their approximated starting noise. In this work, we thoroughly analyze this procedure and focus on the relation between the initial noise, the generated samples, and their corresponding latent encodings obtained through the DDIM inversion. First, we show that latents exhibit structural patterns in the form of less diverse noise predicted for smooth image areas (e.g., plain sky). Through a series of analyses, we trace this issue to the first inversion steps, which fail to provide accurate and diverse noise. Consequently, the DDIM inversion space is notably less manipulative than the original noise. We show that prior inversion methods do not fully resolve this issue, but our simple fix, where we replace the first DDIM Inversion steps with a forward diffusion process, successfully decorrelates latent encodings and enables higher quality editions and interpolations.

      <title>What Makes a Good Dataset for Knowledge Distillation?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12817v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) has been a popular and effective method for model compression. One important assumption of KD is that the teacher's original dataset will also be available when training the student. However, in situations such as continual learning and distilling large models trained on company-withheld datasets, having access to the original data may not always be possible. This leads practitioners towards utilizing other sources of supplemental data, which could yield mixed results. One must then ask: "what makes a good dataset for transferring knowledge from teacher to student?" Many would assume that only real in-domain imagery is viable, but is that the only option? In this work, we explore multiple possible surrogate distillation datasets and demonstrate that many different datasets, even unnatural synthetic imagery, can serve as a suitable alternative in KD. From examining these alternative datasets, we identify and present various criteria describing what makes a good dataset for distillation.

      <title>VideoGen-of-Thought: Step-by-step generating multi-shot video with minimal manual intervention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02259v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current video generation models excel at short clips but fail to produce cohesive multi-shot narratives due to disjointed visual dynamics and fractured storylines. Existing solutions either rely on extensive manual scripting/editing or prioritize single-shot fidelity over cross-scene continuity, limiting their practicality for movie-like content. We introduce VideoGen-of-Thought (VGoT), a step-by-step framework that automates multi-shot video synthesis from a single sentence by systematically addressing three core challenges: (1) Narrative fragmentation: Existing methods lack structured storytelling. We propose dynamic storyline modeling, which turns the user prompt into concise shot drafts and then expands them into detailed specifications across five domains (character dynamics, background continuity, relationship evolution, camera movements, and HDR lighting) with self-validation to ensure logical progress. (2) Visual inconsistency: previous approaches struggle to maintain consistent appearance across shots. Our identity-aware cross-shot propagation builds identity-preserving portrait (IPP) tokens that keep character identity while allowing controlled trait changes (expressions, aging) required by the story. (3) Transition artifacts: Abrupt shot changes disrupt immersion. Our adjacent latent transition mechanisms implement boundary-aware reset strategies that process adjacent shots' features at transition points, enabling seamless visual flow while preserving narrative continuity. Combined in a training-free pipeline, VGoT surpasses strong baselines by 20.4\% in within-shot face consistency and 17.4\% in style consistency, while requiring 10x fewer manual adjustments. VGoT bridges the gap between raw visual synthesis and director-level storytelling for automated multi-shot video generation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06014v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP and SigLIP, have found remarkable success in classification, retrieval, and generative tasks. For this, VLMs deterministically map images and text descriptions to a joint latent space in which their similarity is assessed using the cosine similarity. However, a deterministic mapping of inputs fails to capture uncertainties over concepts arising from domain shifts when used in downstream tasks. In this work, we propose post-hoc uncertainty estimation in VLMs that does not require additional training. Our method leverages a Bayesian posterior approximation over the last layers in VLMs and analytically quantifies uncertainties over cosine similarities. We demonstrate its effectiveness for uncertainty quantification and support set selection in active learning. Compared to baselines, we obtain improved and well-calibrated predictive uncertainties, interpretable uncertainty estimates, and sample-efficient active learning. Our results show promise for safety-critical applications of large-scale models.</description>

      <title>DreamOmni: Unified Image Generation and Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17098v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Currently, the success of large language models (LLMs) illustrates that a unified multitasking approach can significantly enhance model usability, streamline deployment, and foster synergistic benefits across different tasks. However, in computer vision, while text-to-image (T2I) models have significantly improved generation quality through scaling up, their framework design did not initially consider how to unify with downstream tasks, such as various types of editing. To address this, we introduce DreamOmni, a unified model for image generation and editing. We begin by analyzing existing frameworks and the requirements of downstream tasks, proposing a unified framework that integrates both T2I models and various editing tasks. Furthermore, another key challenge is the efficient creation of high-quality editing data, particularly for instruction-based and drag-based editing. To this end, we develop a synthetic data pipeline using sticker-like elements to synthesize accurate, high-quality datasets efficiently, which enables editing data scaling up for unified model training. For training, DreamOmni jointly trains T2I generation and downstream tasks. T2I training enhances the model's understanding of specific concepts and improves generation quality, while editing training helps the model grasp the nuances of the editing task. This collaboration significantly boosts editing performance. Extensive experiments confirm the effectiveness of DreamOmni. The code and model will be released.</description>

      <title>A Survey on Dynamic Neural Networks: from Computer Vision to Multi-modal Sensor Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07451v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Model compression is essential in the deployment of large Computer Vision models on embedded devices. However, static optimization techniques (e.g. pruning, quantization, etc.) neglect the fact that different inputs have different complexities, thus requiring different amount of computations. Dynamic Neural Networks allow to condition the number of computations to the specific input. The current literature on the topic is very extensive and fragmented. We present a comprehensive survey that synthesizes and unifies existing Dynamic Neural Networks research in the context of Computer Vision. Additionally, we provide a logical taxonomy based on which component of the network is adaptive: the output, the computation graph or the input. Furthermore, we argue that Dynamic Neural Networks are particularly beneficial in the context of Sensor Fusion for better adaptivity, noise reduction and information prioritization. We present preliminary works in this direction. We complement this survey with a curated repository listing all the surveyed papers, each with a brief summary of the solution and the code base when available: https://github.com/DTU-PAS/awesome-dynn-for-cv .</description>

      <title>Diffusion Adversarial Post-Training for One-Step Video Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08316v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The diffusion models are widely used for image and video generation, but their iterative generation process is slow and expansive. While existing distillation approaches have demonstrated the potential for one-step generation in the image domain, they still suffer from significant quality degradation. In this work, we propose Adversarial Post-Training (APT) against real data following diffusion pre-training for one-step video generation. To improve the training stability and quality, we introduce several improvements to the model architecture and training procedures, along with an approximated R1 regularization objective. Empirically, our experiments show that our adversarial post-trained model, Seaweed-APT, can generate 2-second, 1280x720, 24fps videos in real time using a single forward evaluation step. Additionally, our model is capable of generating 1024px images in a single step, achieving quality comparable to state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Multiple Queries with Multiple Keys: A Precise Prompt Matching Paradigm for Prompt-based Continual Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12635v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Continual learning requires machine learning models to continuously acquire new knowledge in dynamic environments while avoiding the forgetting of previous knowledge. Prompt-based continual learning methods effectively address the issue of catastrophic forgetting through prompt expansion and selection. However, existing approaches often suffer from low accuracy in prompt selection, which can result in the model receiving biased knowledge and making biased predictions. To address this issue, we propose the Multiple Queries with Multiple Keys (MQMK) prompt matching paradigm for precise prompt selection. The goal of MQMK is to select the prompts whose training data distribution most closely matches that of the test sample. Specifically, Multiple Queries enable precise breadth search by introducing task-specific knowledge, while Multiple Keys perform deep search by representing the feature distribution of training samples at a fine-grained level. Each query is designed to perform local matching with a designated task to reduce interference across queries. Experiments show that MQMK enhances the prompt matching rate by over 30\% in challenging scenarios and achieves state-of-the-art performance on three widely adopted continual learning benchmarks. The code is available at https://github.com/DunweiTu/MQMK.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Model as a Noise-Aware Latent Reward Model for Step-Level Preference Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01051v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Preference optimization for diffusion models aims to align them with human preferences for images. Previous methods typically use Vision-Language Models (VLMs) as pixel-level reward models to approximate human preferences. However, when used for step-level preference optimization, these models face challenges in handling noisy images of different timesteps and require complex transformations into pixel space. In this work, we show that pre-trained diffusion models are naturally suited for step-level reward modeling in the noisy latent space, as they are explicitly designed to process latent images at various noise levels. Accordingly, we propose the Latent Reward Model (LRM), which repurposes components of the diffusion model to predict preferences of latent images at arbitrary timesteps. Building on LRM, we introduce Latent Preference Optimization (LPO), a step-level preference optimization method conducted directly in the noisy latent space. Experimental results indicate that LPO significantly improves the model's alignment with general, aesthetic, and text-image alignment preferences, while achieving a 2.5-28x training speedup over existing preference optimization methods. Our code and models are available at https://github.com/Kwai-Kolors/LPO.</description>

Abstract: The spatio-temporal relationship between the pixels of a video carries critical information for low-level 4D perception tasks. A single model that reasons about it should be able to solve several such tasks well. Yet, most state-of-the-art methods rely on architectures specialized for the task at hand. We present L4P, a feedforward, general-purpose architecture that solves low-level 4D perception tasks in a unified framework. L4P leverages a pre-trained ViT-based video encoder and combines it with per-task heads that are lightweight and therefore do not require extensive training. Despite its general and feedforward formulation, our method is competitive with existing specialized methods on both dense tasks, such as depth or optical flow estimation, and sparse tasks, such as 2D/3D tracking. Moreover, it solves all tasks at once in a time comparable to that of single-task methods.</description>

      <title>SCoT: Unifying Consistency Models and Rectified Flows via Straight-Consistent Trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16972v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pre-trained diffusion models are commonly used to generate clean data (e.g., images) from random noises, effectively forming pairs of noises and corresponding clean images. Distillation on these pre-trained models can be viewed as the process of constructing advanced trajectories within the pair to accelerate sampling. For instance, consistency model distillation develops consistent projection functions to regulate trajectories, although sampling efficiency remains a concern. Rectified flow method enforces straight trajectories to enable faster sampling, yet relies on numerical ODE solvers, which may introduce approximation errors. In this work, we bridge the gap between the consistency model and the rectified flow method by proposing a Straight Consistent Trajectory~(SCoT) model. SCoT enjoys the benefits of both approaches for fast sampling, producing trajectories with consistent and straight properties simultaneously. These dual properties are strategically balanced by targeting two critical objectives: (1) regulating the gradient of SCoT's mapping to a constant, (2) ensuring trajectory consistency. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of SCoT.</description>

      <title>How far can we go with ImageNet for Text-to-Image generation?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.21318v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent text-to-image (T2I) generation models have achieved remarkable sucess by training on billion-scale datasets, following a `bigger is better' paradigm that prioritizes data quantity over availability (closed vs open source) and reproducibility (data decay vs established collections). We challenge this established paradigm by demonstrating that one can achieve capabilities of models trained on massive web-scraped collections, using only ImageNet enhanced with well-designed text and image augmentations. With this much simpler setup, we achieve a +6% overall score over SD-XL on GenEval and +5% on DPGBench while using just 1/10th the parameters and 1/1000th the training images. We also show that ImageNet pretrained models can be finetuned on task specific datasets (like for high resolution aesthetic applications) with good results, indicating that ImageNet is sufficient for acquiring general capabilities. This opens the way for more reproducible research as ImageNet is widely available and the proposed standardized training setup only requires 500 hours of H100 to train a text-to-image model.</description>

      <title>What are You Looking at? Modality Contribution in Multimodal Medical Deep Learning</title>

Abstract: Purpose High dimensional, multimodal data can nowadays be analyzed by huge deep neural networks with little effort. Several fusion methods for bringing together different modalities have been developed. Given the prevalence of high-dimensional, multimodal patient data in medicine, the development of multimodal models marks a significant advancement. However, how these models process information from individual sources in detail is still underexplored. Methods To this end, we implemented an occlusion-based modality contribution method that is both model- and performance-agnostic. This method quantitatively measures the importance of each modality in the dataset for the model to fulfill its task. We applied our method to three different multimodal medical problems for experimental purposes. Results Herein we found that some networks have modality preferences that tend to unimodal collapses, while some datasets are imbalanced from the ground up. Moreover, we provide fine-grained quantitative and visual attribute importance for each modality. Conclusion Our metric offers valuable insights that can support the advancement of multimodal model development and dataset creation. By introducing this method, we contribute to the growing field of interpretability in deep learning for multimodal research. This approach helps to facilitate the integration of multimodal AI into clinical practice. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/ChristianGappGit/MC_MMD.</description>

      <title>An Improved Pure Fully Connected Neural Network for Rice Grain Classification</title>

Abstract: Rice is a staple food for a significant portion of the world's population, providing essential nutrients and serving as a versatile in-gredient in a wide range of culinary traditions. Recently, the use of deep learning has enabled automated classification of rice, im-proving accuracy and efficiency. However, classical models based on first-stage training may face difficulties in distinguishing between rice varieties with similar external characteristics, thus leading to misclassifications. Considering the transparency and feasibility of model, we selected and gradually improved pure fully connected neural network to achieve classification of rice grain. The dataset we used contains both global and domestic rice images obtained from websites and laboratories respectively. First, the training mode was changed from one-stage training to two-stage training, which significantly contributes to distinguishing two similar types of rice. Secondly, the preprocessing method was changed from random tilting to horizontal or vertical position cor-rection. After those two enhancements, the accuracy of our model increased notably from 97% to 99%. In summary, two subtle methods proposed in this study can remarkably enhance the classification ability of deep learning models in terms of the classification of rice grain.</description>

      <title>Temporal Overlapping Prediction: A Self-supervised Pre-training Method for LiDAR Moving Object Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07167v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Moving object segmentation (MOS) on LiDAR point clouds is crucial for autonomous systems like self-driving vehicles. Previous supervised approaches rely heavily on costly manual annotations, while LiDAR sequences naturally capture temporal motion cues that can be leveraged for self-supervised learning. In this paper, we propose Temporal Overlapping Prediction (TOP), a self-supervised pre-training method that alleviate the labeling burden for MOS. TOP explores the temporal overlapping points that commonly observed by current and adjacent scans, and learns spatiotemporal representations by predicting the occupancy states of temporal overlapping points. Moreover, we utilize current occupancy reconstruction as an auxiliary pre-training objective, which enhances the current structural awareness of the model. We conduct extensive experiments and observe that the conventional metric Intersection-over-Union (IoU) shows strong bias to objects with more scanned points, which might neglect small or distant objects. To compensate for this bias, we introduce an additional metric called mIoU_obj to evaluate object-level performance. Experiments on nuScenes and SemanticKITTI show that TOPoutperforms both supervised training-from-scratch baseline and other self-supervised pre-training baselines by up to 28.77% relative improvement, demonstrating strong transferability across LiDAR setups and generalization to other tasks. Code and pre-trained models will be publicly available upon publication.</description>

      <title>Oh-A-DINO: Understanding and Enhancing Attribute-Level Information in Self-Supervised Object-Centric Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09867v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Object-centric understanding is fundamental to human vision and required for complex reasoning. Traditional methods define slot-based bottlenecks to learn object properties explicitly, while recent self-supervised vision models like DINO have shown emergent object understanding. We investigate the effectiveness of self-supervised representations from models such as CLIP, DINOv2 and DINOv3, as well as slot-based approaches, for multi-object instance retrieval, where specific objects must be faithfully identified in a scene. This scenario is increasingly relevant as pre-trained representations are deployed in downstream tasks, e.g., retrieval, manipulation, and goal-conditioned policies that demand fine-grained object understanding. Our findings reveal that self-supervised vision models and slot-based representations excel at identifying edge-derived geometry (shape, size) but fail to preserve non-geometric surface-level cues (colour, material, texture), which are critical for disambiguating objects when reasoning about or selecting them in such tasks. We show that learning an auxiliary latent space over segmented patches, where VAE regularisation enforces compact, disentangled object-centric representations, recovers these missing attributes. Augmenting the self-supervised methods with such latents improves retrieval across all attributes, suggesting a promising direction for making self-supervised representations more reliable in downstream tasks that require precise object-level reasoning.</description>

      <title>One-Step Residual Shifting Diffusion for Image Super-Resolution via Distillation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13358v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion models for super-resolution (SR) produce high-quality visual results but require expensive computational costs. Despite the development of several methods to accelerate diffusion-based SR models, some (e.g., SinSR) fail to produce realistic perceptual details, while others (e.g., OSEDiff) may hallucinate non-existent structures. To overcome these issues, we present RSD, a new distillation method for ResShift, one of the top diffusion-based SR models. Our method is based on training the student network to produce such images that a new fake ResShift model trained on them will coincide with the teacher model. RSD achieves single-step restoration and outperforms the teacher by a large margin. We show that our distillation method can surpass the other distillation-based method for ResShift - SinSR - making it on par with state-of-the-art diffusion-based SR distillation methods. Compared to SR methods based on pre-trained text-to-image models, RSD produces competitive perceptual quality, provides images with better alignment to degraded input images, and requires fewer parameters and GPU memory. We provide experimental results on various real-world and synthetic datasets, including RealSR, RealSet65, DRealSR, ImageNet, and DIV2K.</description>

      <title>RGS-DR: Deferred Reflections and Residual Shading in 2D Gaussian Splatting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18468v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we address specular appearance in inverse rendering using 2D Gaussian splatting with deferred shading and argue for a refinement stage to improve specular detail, thereby bridging the gap with reconstruction-only methods. Our pipeline estimates editable material properties and environment illumination while employing a directional residual pass that captures leftover view-dependent effects for further refining novel view synthesis. In contrast to per-Gaussian shading with shortest-axis normals and normal residuals, which tends to result in more noisy geometry and specular appearance, a pixel-deferred surfel formulation with specular residuals yields sharper highlights, cleaner materials, and improved editability. We evaluate our approach on rendering and reconstruction quality on three popular datasets featuring glossy objects, and also demonstrate high-quality relighting and material editing.</description>

      <title>LRFusionPR: A Polar BEV-Based LiDAR-Radar Fusion Network for Place Recognition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19186v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In autonomous driving, place recognition is critical for global localization in GPS-denied environments. LiDAR and radar-based place recognition methods have garnered increasing attention, as LiDAR provides precise ranging, whereas radar excels in adverse weather resilience. However, effectively leveraging LiDAR-radar fusion for place recognition remains challenging. The noisy and sparse nature of radar data limits its potential to further improve recognition accuracy. In addition, heterogeneous radar configurations complicate the development of unified cross-modality fusion frameworks. In this paper, we propose LRFusionPR, which improves recognition accuracy and robustness by fusing LiDAR with either single-chip or scanning radar. Technically, a dual-branch network is proposed to fuse different modalities within the unified polar coordinate bird's eye view (BEV) representation. In the fusion branch, cross-attention is utilized to perform cross-modality feature interactions. The knowledge from the fusion branch is simultaneously transferred to the distillation branch, which takes radar as its only input to further improve the robustness. Ultimately, the descriptors from both branches are concatenated, producing the multimodal global descriptor for place retrieval. Extensive evaluations on multiple datasets demonstrate that our LRFusionPR achieves accurate place recognition, while maintaining robustness under varying weather conditions. Our open-source code will be released at https://github.com/QiZS-BIT/LRFusionPR.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01249v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Humans (and many vertebrates) face the problem of fusing together multiple fixations of a scene in order to obtain a representation of the whole, where each fixation uses a high-resolution fovea and decreasing resolution in the periphery. In this paper we explicitly represent the retinal transformation of a fixation as a linear downsampling of a high-resolution latent image of the scene, exploiting the known geometry. This linear transformation allows us to carry out exact inference for the latent variables in factor analysis (FA) and mixtures of FA models of the scene. Further, this allows us to formulate and solve the choice of "where to look next" as a Bayesian experimental design problem using the Expected Information Gain criterion. Experiments on the Frey faces and MNIST datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our models.</description>

      <title>PlaceIt3D: Language-Guided Object Placement in Real 3D Scenes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05288v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the novel task of Language-Guided Object Placement in Real 3D Scenes. Our model is given a 3D scene's point cloud, a 3D asset, and a textual prompt broadly describing where the 3D asset should be placed. The task here is to find a valid placement for the 3D asset that respects the prompt. Compared with other language-guided localization tasks in 3D scenes such as grounding, this task has specific challenges: it is ambiguous because it has multiple valid solutions, and it requires reasoning about 3D geometric relationships and free space. We inaugurate this task by proposing a new benchmark and evaluation protocol. We also introduce a new dataset for training 3D LLMs on this task, as well as the first method to serve as a non-trivial baseline. We believe that this challenging task and our new benchmark could become part of the suite of benchmarks used to evaluate and compare generalist 3D LLM models.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Targeted Hard-Label Adversarial Attacks in Low-Query Black-Box Settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16313v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep neural networks for image classification remain vulnerable to adversarial examples -- small, imperceptible perturbations that induce misclassifications. In black-box settings, where only the final prediction is accessible, crafting targeted attacks that aim to misclassify into a specific target class is particularly challenging due to narrow decision regions. Current state-of-the-art methods often exploit the geometric properties of the decision boundary separating a source image and a target image rather than incorporating information from the images themselves. In contrast, we propose Targeted Edge-informed Attack (TEA), a novel attack that utilizes edge information from the target image to carefully perturb it, thereby producing an adversarial image that is closer to the source image while still achieving the desired target classification. Our approach consistently outperforms current state-of-the-art methods across different models in low query settings (nearly 70% fewer queries are used), a scenario especially relevant in real-world applications with limited queries and black-box access. Furthermore, by efficiently generating a suitable adversarial example, TEA provides an improved target initialization for established geometry-based attacks.</description>

      <title>GARLIC: GAussian Representation LearnIng for spaCe partitioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24608v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present \textbf{GARLIC}, a representation learning approach for Euclidean approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search in high dimensions. Existing partitions tend to rely on isotropic cells, fixed global resolution, or balanced constraints, which fragment dense regions and merge unrelated points in sparse ones, thereby increasing the candidate count when probing only a few cells. Our method instead partitions \(\mathbb{R}^d\) into anisotropic Gaussian cells whose shapes align with local geometry and sizes adapt to data density. Information-theoretic objectives balance coverage, overlap, and geometric alignment, while split/clone refinement introduces Gaussians only where needed. At query time, Mahalanobis distance selects relevant cells and localized quantization prunes candidates. This yields partitions that reduce cross-cell neighbor splits and candidate counts under small probe budgets, while remaining robust even when trained on only a small fraction of the dataset. Overall, GARLIC introduces a geometry-aware space-partitioning paradigm that combines information-theoretic objectives with adaptive density refinement, offering competitive recall--efficiency trade-offs for Euclidean ANN search.</description>

      <title>Autoregressive Adversarial Post-Training for Real-Time Interactive Video Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09350v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Existing large-scale video generation models are computationally intensive, preventing adoption in real-time and interactive applications. In this work, we propose autoregressive adversarial post-training (AAPT) to transform a pre-trained latent video diffusion model into a real-time, interactive video generator. Our model autoregressively generates a latent frame at a time using a single neural function evaluation (1NFE). The model can stream the result to the user in real time and receive interactive responses as controls to generate the next latent frame. Unlike existing approaches, our method explores adversarial training as an effective paradigm for autoregressive generation. This not only allows us to design an architecture that is more efficient for one-step generation while fully utilizing the KV cache, but also enables training the model in a student-forcing manner that proves to be effective in reducing error accumulation during long video generation. Our experiments demonstrate that our 8B model achieves real-time, 24fps, streaming video generation at 736x416 resolution on a single H100, or 1280x720 on 8xH100 up to a minute long (1440 frames).

      <title>LEGATO: Large-scale End-to-end Generalizable Approach to Typeset OMR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19065v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose Legato, a new end-to-end model for optical music recognition (OMR), a task of converting music score images to machine-readable documents. Legato is the first large-scale pretrained OMR model capable of recognizing full-page or multi-page typeset music scores and the first to generate documents in ABC notation, a concise, human-readable format for symbolic music. Bringing together a pretrained vision encoder with an ABC decoder trained on a dataset of more than 214K images, our model exhibits the strong ability to generalize across various typeset scores. We conduct comprehensive experiments on a range of datasets and metrics and demonstrate that Legato outperforms the previous state of the art. On our most realistic dataset, we see a 68\% and 47.6\% absolute error reduction on the standard metrics TEDn and OMR-NED, respectively.</description>

      <title>Concept Unlearning by Modeling Key Steps of Diffusion Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06526v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models (T2I DMs), represented by Stable Diffusion, which generate highly realistic images based on textual input, have been widely used, but their flexibility also makes them prone to misuse for producing harmful or unsafe content. Concept unlearning has been used to prevent text-to-image diffusion models from being misused to generate undesirable visual content. However, existing methods struggle to trade off unlearning effectiveness with the preservation of generation quality. To address this limitation, we propose Key Step Concept Unlearning (KSCU), which selectively fine-tunes the model at key steps to the target concept. KSCU is inspired by the fact that different diffusion denoising steps contribute unequally to the final generation. Compared to previous approaches, which treat all denoising steps uniformly, KSCU avoids over-optimization of unnecessary steps for higher effectiveness and reduces the number of parameter updates for higher efficiency. For example, on the I2P dataset, KSCU outperforms ESD by 8.3% in nudity unlearning accuracy while improving FID by 8.4%, and achieves a high overall score of 0.92, substantially surpassing all other SOTA methods.</description>

      <title>VITA: Vision-to-Action Flow Matching Policy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13231v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conventional flow matching and diffusion-based policies sample through iterative denoising from standard noise distributions (e.g., Gaussian), and require conditioning mechanisms to incorporate visual information during the generative process, incurring substantial time and memory overhead. To reduce the complexity, we develop VITA(VIsion-To-Action policy), a noise-free and conditioning-free policy learning framework that directly maps visual representations to latent actions using flow matching. VITA treats latent visual representations as the source of the flow, thus eliminating the need of conditioning. As expected, bridging vision and action is challenging, because actions are lower-dimensional, less structured, and sparser than visual representations; moreover, flow matching requires the source and target to have the same dimensionality. To overcome this, we introduce an action autoencoder that maps raw actions into a structured latent space aligned with visual latents, trained jointly with flow matching. To further prevent latent space collapse, we propose flow latent decoding, which anchors the latent generation process by backpropagating the action reconstruction loss through the flow matching ODE (ordinary differential equations) solving steps. We evaluate VITA on 8 simulation and 2 real-world tasks from ALOHA and Robomimic. VITA outperforms or matches state-of-the-art generative policies, while achieving 1.5-2.3x faster inference compared to conventional methods with conditioning.

      <title>Efficient Whole Slide Pathology VQA via Token Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14497v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Whole-slide images (WSIs) in pathology can reach up to 10,000 x 10,000 pixels, posing significant challenges for multimodal large language model (MLLM) due to long context length and high computational demands. Previous methods typically focus on patch-level analysis or slide-level classification using CLIP-based models with multi-instance learning, but they lack the generative capabilities needed for visual question answering (VQA). More recent MLLM-based approaches address VQA by feeding thousands of patch tokens directly into the language model, which leads to excessive resource consumption. To address these limitations, we propose Token Compression Pathology LLaVA (TCP-LLaVA), the first MLLM architecture to perform WSI VQA via token compression. TCP-LLaVA introduces a set of trainable compression tokens that aggregate visual and textual information through a modality compression module, inspired by the [CLS] token mechanism in BERT. Only the compressed tokens are forwarded to the LLM for answer generation, significantly reducing input length and computational cost. Experiments on ten TCGA tumor subtypes show that TCP-LLaVA outperforms existing MLLM baselines in VQA accuracy while reducing training resource consumption by a substantial margin.</description>

      <title>StreamAgent: Towards Anticipatory Agents for Streaming Video Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01875v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Real-time streaming video understanding in domains such as autonomous driving and intelligent surveillance poses challenges beyond conventional offline video processing, requiring continuous perception, proactive decision making, and responsive interaction based on dynamically evolving visual content. However, existing methods rely on alternating perception-reaction or asynchronous triggers, lacking task-driven planning and future anticipation, which limits their real-time responsiveness and proactive decision making in evolving video streams. To this end, we propose a StreamAgent that anticipates the temporal intervals and spatial regions expected to contain future task-relevant information to enable proactive and goal-driven responses. Specifically, we integrate question semantics and historical observations through prompting the anticipatory agent to anticipate the temporal progression of key events, align current observations with the expected future evidence, and subsequently adjust the perception action (e.g., attending to task-relevant regions or continuously tracking in subsequent frames). To enable efficient inference, we design a streaming KV-cache memory mechanism that constructs a hierarchical memory structure for selective recall of relevant tokens, enabling efficient semantic retrieval while reducing the overhead of storing all tokens in the traditional KV-cache. Extensive experiments on streaming and long video understanding tasks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods in response accuracy and real-time efficiency, highlighting its practical value for real-world streaming scenarios.</description>

      <title>Robust Prompt Tuning for Vision-Language Models with Mild Semantic Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04677v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Prompt tuning has shown promising results, but its robustness and generalization to unseen categories remain limited. Through our experiments, we demonstrate that the complete removal of semantic noise is a key factor restricting robustness. Existing methods typically suppress or filter out semantic noise in the prompt space, inadvertently hindering the model's robustness and its ability to generalize to unseen categories. To address this, we propose ANPrompt, a robust prompt tuning framework that actively incorporates weak semantic noise. By clustering weakly perturbed features into noise prompts and integrating them with learnable tokens in both the text and vision encoders, ANPrompt ensures controlled exposure to semantic variations. To enhance the visual pathway, we introduce the Noise-Resistant Visual Prompt Prototype (NRVPP), which stabilizes visual semantics under weak perturbations. Additionally, we propose a Weak Alignment Loss (WALoss) at the logits level to enforce consistency between clean and perturbed predictions, providing stable supervision. By combining weak semantic noise exposure with logits-based consistency, ANPrompt prevents overfitting to specific phrasings while preserving semantic integrity. Extensive experiments across 11 benchmarks, including base-to-new splits, show that ANPrompt consistently outperforms existing prompt tuning methods, offering superior robustness to semantic noise and improved generalization across tasks.</description>

      <title>Automated Model Evaluation for Object Detection via Prediction Consistency and Reliability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12082v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in computer vision have made training object detectors more efficient and effective; however, assessing their performance in real-world applications still relies on costly manual annotation. To address this limitation, we develop an automated model evaluation (AutoEval) framework for object detection. We propose Prediction Consistency and Reliability (PCR), which leverages the multiple candidate bounding boxes that conventional detectors generate before non-maximum suppression (NMS). PCR estimates detection performance without ground-truth labels by jointly measuring 1) the spatial consistency between boxes before and after NMS, and 2) the reliability of the retained boxes via the confidence scores of overlapping boxes. For a more realistic and scalable evaluation, we construct a meta-dataset by applying image corruptions of varying severity. Experimental results demonstrate that PCR yields more accurate performance estimates than existing AutoEval methods, and the proposed meta-dataset covers a wider range of detection performance. The code is available at https://github.com/YonseiML/autoeval-det.</description>

      <title>DiCache: Let Diffusion Model Determine Its Own Cache</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17356v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent years have witnessed the rapid development of acceleration techniques for diffusion models, especially caching-based acceleration methods. These studies seek to answer two fundamental questions: "When to cache" and "How to use cache", typically relying on predefined empirical laws or dataset-level priors to determine caching timings and adopting handcrafted rules for multi-step cache utilization. However, given the highly dynamic nature of the diffusion process, they often exhibit limited generalizability and fail to cope with diverse samples. In this paper, a strong sample-specific correlation is revealed between the variation patterns of the shallow-layer feature differences in the diffusion model and those of deep-layer features. Moreover, we have observed that the features from different model layers form similar trajectories. Based on these observations, we present DiCache, a novel training-free adaptive caching strategy for accelerating diffusion models at runtime, answering both when and how to cache within a unified framework. Specifically, DiCache is composed of two principal components: (1) Online Probe Profiling Scheme leverages a shallow-layer online probe to obtain an on-the-fly indicator for the caching error in real time, enabling the model to dynamically customize the caching schedule for each sample. (2) Dynamic Cache Trajectory Alignment adaptively approximates the deep-layer feature output from multi-step historical caches based on the shallow-layer feature trajectory, facilitating higher visual quality. Extensive experiments validate DiCache's capability in achieving higher efficiency and improved fidelity over state-of-the-art approaches on various leading diffusion models including WAN 2.1, HunyuanVideo and Flux.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Corpus Callosum Segmentation in Fetal MRI via Pathology-Informed Domain Randomization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20475v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate fetal brain segmentation is crucial for extracting biomarkers and assessing neurodevelopment, especially in conditions such as corpus callosum dysgenesis (CCD), which can induce drastic anatomical changes. However, the rarity of CCD severely limits annotated data, hindering the generalization of deep learning models. To address this, we propose a pathology-informed domain randomization strategy that embeds prior knowledge of CCD manifestations into a synthetic data generation pipeline. By simulating diverse brain alterations from healthy data alone, our approach enables robust segmentation without requiring pathological annotations.
  We validate our method on a cohort comprising 248 healthy fetuses, 26 with CCD, and 47 with other brain pathologies, achieving substantial improvements on CCD cases while maintaining performance on both healthy fetuses and those with other pathologies. From the predicted segmentations, we derive clinically relevant biomarkers, such as corpus callosum length (LCC) and volume, and show their utility in distinguishing CCD subtypes. Our pathology-informed augmentation reduces the LCC estimation error from 1.89 mm to 0.80 mm in healthy cases and from 10.9 mm to 0.7 mm in CCD cases. Beyond these quantitative gains, our approach yields segmentations with improved topological consistency relative to available ground truth, enabling more reliable shape-based analyses. Overall, this work demonstrates that incorporating domain-specific anatomical priors into synthetic data pipelines can effectively mitigate data scarcity and enhance analysis of rare but clinically significant malformations.</description>

      <title>TrimTokenator: Towards Adaptive Visual Token Pruning for Large Multimodal Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00320v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have achieved significant success across various tasks. These models usually encode visual inputs into dense token sequences, which are then concatenated with textual tokens and jointly processed by a language model. However, the increased token count substantially raises computational and memory costs during inference. Token pruning has emerged as a promising approach to address this issue. Existing token pruning methods often rely on costly calibration or suboptimal importance metrics, leading to redundant retained tokens. In this paper, we analyze the redundancy differences between visual and textual tokens and propose pruning exclusively on visual tokens. Based on this, we propose a visual token pruning strategy that explicitly preserves both cross-modal alignment and intra-modal informational diversity. We introduce a mutual information-based token pruning strategy that removes visual tokens semantically misaligned with textual tokens, effectively preserving the alignment between the visual and textual modalities. To further improve the representational quality of the retained tokens, we additionally prune redundant visual tokens by maximizing the expected pairwise distances in the embedding space, which is solved efficiently with a greedy algorithm. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method maintains strong performance while reducing tokens by 88.9% on models such as LLaVA-1.5-7B and LLaVA-NEXT-7B, resulting in a 56.7% improvement in inference speed.</description>

Abstract: Methane is a potent greenhouse gas and a major driver of climate change, making its timely detection critical for effective mitigation. Machine learning (ML) deployed onboard satellites can enable rapid detection while reducing downlink costs, supporting faster response systems. Conventional methane detection methods often rely on image processing techniques, such as orthorectification to correct geometric distortions and matched filters to enhance plume signals. We introduce a novel approach that bypasses these preprocessing steps by using \textit{unorthorectified} data (UnorthoDOS). We find that ML models trained on this dataset achieve performance comparable to those trained on orthorectified data. Moreover, we also train models on an orthorectified dataset, showing that they can outperform the matched filter baseline (mag1c). We release model checkpoints and two ML-ready datasets comprising orthorectified and unorthorectified hyperspectral images from the Earth Surface Mineral Dust Source Investigation (EMIT) sensor at https://huggingface.co/datasets/SpaceML/UnorthoDOS , along with code at https://github.com/spaceml-org/plume-hunter.</description>

      <title>RS-OOD: A Vision-Language Augmented Framework for Out-of-Distribution Detection in Remote Sensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02273v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection represents a critical challenge in remote sensing applications, where reliable identification of novel or anomalous patterns is essential for autonomous monitoring, disaster response, and environmental assessment. Despite remarkable progress in OOD detection for natural images, existing methods and benchmarks remain poorly suited to remote sensing imagery due to data scarcity, complex multi-scale scene structures, and pronounced distribution shifts. To this end, we propose RS-OOD, a novel framework that leverages remote sensing-specific vision-language modeling to enable robust few-shot OOD detection. Our approach introduces three key innovations: spatial feature enhancement that improved scene discrimination, a dual-prompt alignment mechanism that cross-verifies scene context against fine-grained semantics for spatial-semantic consistency, and a confidence-guided self-training loop that dynamically mines pseudo-labels to expand training data without manual annotation. RS-OOD consistently outperforms existing methods across multiple remote sensing benchmarks and enables efficient adaptation with minimal labeled data, demonstrating the critical value of spatial-semantic integration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05606v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dense self-supervised learning (SSL) methods showed its effectiveness in enhancing the fine-grained semantic understandings of vision models. However, existing approaches often rely on parametric assumptions or complex post-processing (e.g., clustering, sorting), limiting their flexibility and stability. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Patch-level Kernel Alignment (PaKA), a non-parametric, kernel-based approach that improves the dense representations of pretrained vision encoders with a post-(pre)training. Our method propose a robust and effective alignment objective that captures statistical dependencies which matches the intrinsic structure of high-dimensional dense feature distributions. In addition, we revisit the augmentation strategies inherited from image-level SSL and propose a refined augmentation strategy for dense SSL. Our framework improves dense representations by conducting a lightweight post-training stage on top of a pretrained model. With only 14 hours of additional training on a single GPU, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across a range of dense vision benchmarks, demonstrating both efficiency and effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Using KL-Divergence to Focus Frequency Information in Low-Light Image Enhancement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.13083v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the Fourier domain, luminance information is primarily encoded in the amplitude spectrum, while spatial structures are captured in the phase components. The traditional Fourier Frequency information fitting employs pixel-wise loss functions, which tend to focus excessively on local information and may lead to global information loss. In this paper, we present LLFDisc, a U-shaped deep enhancement network that integrates cross-attention and gating mechanisms tailored for frequency-aware enhancement. We propose a novel distribution-aware loss that directly fits the Fourier-domain information and minimizes their divergence using a closed-form KL-Divergence objective. This enables the model to align Fourier-domain information more robustly than with conventional MSE-based losses. Furthermore, we enhance the perceptual loss based on VGG by embedding KL-Divergence on extracted deep features, enabling better structural fidelity. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that LLFDisc achieves state-of-the-art performance in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations. Our code will be released at: https://github.com/YanXY000/LLFDisc</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13388v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As a developing country, Fiji is facing rapid urbanisation, which is visible in the massive development projects that include housing, roads, and civil works. In this study, we present machine learning and remote sensing frameworks to compare land use and land cover change from 2013 to 2024 in Nadi, Fiji. The ultimate goal of this study is to provide technical support in land cover/land use modelling and change detection. We used Landsat-8 satellite image for the study region and created our training dataset with labels for supervised machine learning. We used Google Earth Engine and unsupervised machine learning via k-means clustering to generate the land cover map. We used convolutional neural networks to classify the selected regions' land cover types. We present a visualisation of change detection, highlighting urban area changes over time to monitor changes in the map.</description>

      <title>GenExam: A Multidisciplinary Text-to-Image Exam</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.14232v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Exams are a fundamental test of expert-level intelligence and require integrated understanding, reasoning, and generation. Existing exam-style benchmarks mainly focus on understanding and reasoning tasks, and current generation benchmarks emphasize the illustration of world knowledge and visual concepts, neglecting the evaluation of rigorous drawing exams. We introduce GenExam, the first benchmark for multidisciplinary text-to-image exams, featuring 1,000 samples across 10 subjects with exam-style prompts organized under a four-level taxonomy. Each problem is equipped with ground-truth images and fine-grained scoring points to enable a precise evaluation of semantic correctness and visual plausibility. Experiments show that even state-of-the-art models such as GPT-Image-1 and Gemini-2.5-Flash-Image achieve less than 15% strict scores, and most models yield almost 0%, suggesting the great challenge of our benchmark. By framing image generation as an exam, GenExam offers a rigorous assessment of models' ability to integrate understanding, reasoning, and generation, providing insights on the path to general AGI. Our benchmark and evaluation code are released at https://github.com/OpenGVLab/GenExam.</description>

      <title>EyePCR: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Fine-Grained Perception, Knowledge Comprehension and Clinical Reasoning in Ophthalmic Surgery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15596v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: MLLMs (Multimodal Large Language Models) have showcased remarkable capabilities, but their performance in high-stakes, domain-specific scenarios like surgical settings, remains largely under-explored. To address this gap, we develop \textbf{EyePCR}, a large-scale benchmark for ophthalmic surgery analysis, grounded in structured clinical knowledge to evaluate cognition across \textit{Perception}, \textit{Comprehension} and \textit{Reasoning}. EyePCR offers a richly annotated corpus with more than 210k VQAs, which cover 1048 fine-grained attributes for multi-view perception, medical knowledge graph of more than 25k triplets for comprehension, and four clinically grounded reasoning tasks. The rich annotations facilitate in-depth cognitive analysis, simulating how surgeons perceive visual cues and combine them with domain knowledge to make decisions, thus greatly improving models' cognitive ability. In particular, \textbf{EyePCR-MLLM}, a domain-adapted variant of Qwen2.5-VL-7B, achieves the highest accuracy on MCQs for \textit{Perception} among compared models and outperforms open-source models in \textit{Comprehension} and \textit{Reasoning}, rivalling commercial models like GPT-4.1. EyePCR reveals the limitations of existing MLLMs in surgical cognition and lays the foundation for benchmarking and enhancing clinical reliability of surgical video understanding models.</description>

      <title>Semantic and Visual Crop-Guided Diffusion Models for Heterogeneous Tissue Synthesis in Histopathology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17847v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Synthetic data generation in histopathology faces unique challenges: preserving tissue heterogeneity, capturing subtle morphological features, and scaling to unannotated datasets. We present a latent diffusion model that generates realistic heterogeneous histopathology images through a novel dual-conditioning approach combining semantic segmentation maps with tissue-specific visual crops. Unlike existing methods that rely on text prompts or abstract visual embeddings, our approach preserves critical morphological details by directly incorporating raw tissue crops from corresponding semantic regions. For annotated datasets (i.e., Camelyon16, Panda), we extract patches ensuring 20-80% tissue heterogeneity. For unannotated data (i.e., TCGA), we introduce a self-supervised extension that clusters whole-slide images into 100 tissue types using foundation model embeddings, automatically generating pseudo-semantic maps for training. Our method synthesizes high-fidelity images with precise region-wise annotations, achieving superior performance on downstream segmentation tasks. When evaluated on annotated datasets, models trained on our synthetic data show competitive performance to those trained on real data, demonstrating the utility of controlled heterogeneous tissue generation. In quantitative evaluation, prompt-guided synthesis reduces Frechet Distance by up to 6X on Camelyon16 (from 430.1 to 72.0) and yields 2-3x lower FD across Panda and TCGA. Downstream DeepLabv3+ models trained solely on synthetic data attain test IoU of 0.71 and 0.95 on Camelyon16 and Panda, within 1-2% of real-data baselines (0.72 and 0.96). By scaling to 11,765 TCGA whole-slide images without manual annotations, our framework offers a practical solution for an urgent need for generating diverse, annotated histopathology data, addressing a critical bottleneck in computational pathology.</description>

      <title>CAMILA: Context-Aware Masking for Image Editing with Language Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19731v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Text-guided image editing has been allowing users to transform and synthesize images through natural language instructions, offering considerable flexibility. However, most existing image editing models naively attempt to follow all user instructions, even if those instructions are inherently infeasible or contradictory, often resulting in nonsensical output. To address these challenges, we propose a context-aware method for image editing named as CAMILA (Context-Aware Masking for Image Editing with Language Alignment). CAMILA is designed to validate the contextual coherence between instructions and the image, ensuring that only relevant edits are applied to the designated regions while ignoring non-executable instructions. For comprehensive evaluation of this new method, we constructed datasets for both single- and multi-instruction image editing, incorporating the presence of infeasible requests. Our method achieves better performance and higher semantic alignment than state-of-the-art models, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling complex instruction challenges while preserving image integrity.</description>

      <title>Euclid's Gift: Enhancing Spatial Perception and Reasoning in Vision-Language Models via Geometric Surrogate Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24473v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spatial intelligence spans a rich suite of abilities, including visualising and transforming shapes, mentally rotating objects, judging relational positions and containment, and estimating numerosity. However, it still remains a critical unresolved challenge for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs).To fill this gap, we propose to treat Euclidean geometry problem-solving as a surrogate task. Specifically, we meticulously constructed a curated multimodal dataset, called Euclid30K, comprising approximately 30K plane and solid geometry problems. To enable the model to acquire and apply Euclidean principles from these geometry problems, we employed Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to finetune the Qwen2.5VL family and RoboBrain2.0 family, inspiring the models to identify shapes, count, and relate entities, and perform multi-step deductive reasoning using Euclidean principles. Our experiments demonstrate that the resulting models achieve substantial zero-shot gains across four spatial reasoning benchmarks (Super-CLEVR, Omni3DBench, VSI-Bench, and MindCube) without any task-specific adaptations. Notably, after training on the Euclid30K, the mean VSI-Bench accuracy of all evaluated models rose from 34.5% to 40.5%, improving by 5.5 percentage points. Among them, RoboBrain2.0-Euclid-7B achieves 49.6\% accuracy, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art model, Spatial-MLLM.To our knowledge, this is the first systematic study showing that geometry-centric fine-tuning can confer vision-language models with broadly transferable spatial skills. Code and Euclid30K dataset can be found in https://zgca-ai4edu.github.io/Euclids_Gift.</description>

      <title>RIFLE: Removal of Image Flicker-Banding via Latent Diffusion Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24644v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Capturing screens is now routine in our everyday lives. But the photographs of emissive displays are often influenced by the flicker-banding (FB), which is alternating bright%u2013dark stripes that arise from temporal aliasing between a camera's rolling-shutter readout and the display's brightness modulation. Unlike moire degradation, which has been extensively studied, the FB remains underexplored despite its frequent and severe impact on readability and perceived quality. We formulate FB removal as a dedicated restoration task and introduce Removal of Image Flicker-Banding via Latent Diffusion Enhancement, RIFLE, a diffusion-based framework designed to remove FB while preserving fine details. We propose the flicker-banding prior estimator (FPE) that predicts key banding attributes and injects it into the restoration network. Additionally, Masked Loss (ML) is proposed to concentrate supervision on banded regions without sacrificing global fidelity. To overcome data scarcity, we provide a simulation pipeline that synthesizes FB in the luminance domain with stochastic jitter in banding angle, banding spacing, and banding width. Feathered boundaries and sensor noise are also applied for a more realistic simulation. For evaluation, we collect a paired real-world FB dataset with pixel-aligned banding-free references captured via long exposure. Across quantitative metrics and visual comparisons on our real-world dataset, RIFLE consistently outperforms recent image reconstruction baselines from mild to severe flicker-banding. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first work to research the simulation and removal of FB. Our work establishes a great foundation for subsequent research in both the dataset construction and the removal model design. Our dataset and code will be released soon.</description>

      <title>Causal-Adapter: Taming Text-to-Image Diffusion for Faithful Counterfactual Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24798v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present Causal-Adapter, a modular framework that adapts frozen text-to-image diffusion backbones for counterfactual image generation. Our method enables causal interventions on target attributes, consistently propagating their effects to causal dependents without altering the core identity of the image. In contrast to prior approaches that rely on prompt engineering without explicit causal structure, Causal-Adapter leverages structural causal modeling augmented with two attribute regularization strategies: prompt-aligned injection, which aligns causal attributes with textual embeddings for precise semantic control, and a conditioned token contrastive loss to disentangle attribute factors and reduce spurious correlations. Causal-Adapter achieves state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic and real-world datasets, with up to 91% MAE reduction on Pendulum for accurate attribute control and 87% FID reduction on ADNI for high-fidelity MRI image generation. These results show that our approach enables robust, generalizable counterfactual editing with faithful attribute modification and strong identity preservation.</description>

      <title>Segmentor-Guided Counterfactual Fine-Tuning for Locally Coherent and Targeted Image Synthesis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24913v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Counterfactual image generation is a powerful tool for augmenting training data, de-biasing datasets, and modeling disease. Current approaches rely on external classifiers or regressors to increase the effectiveness of subject-level interventions (e.g., changing the patient's age). For structure-specific interventions (e.g., changing the area of the left lung in a chest radiograph), we show that this is insufficient, and can result in undesirable global effects across the image domain. Previous work used pixel-level label maps as guidance, requiring a user to provide hypothetical segmentations which are tedious and difficult to obtain. We propose Segmentor-guided Counterfactual Fine-Tuning (Seg-CFT), which preserves the simplicity of intervening on scalar-valued, structure-specific variables while producing locally coherent and effective counterfactuals. We demonstrate the capability of generating realistic chest radiographs, and we show promising results for modeling coronary artery disease.

      <title>GEM: 3D Gaussian Splatting for Efficient and Accurate Cryo-EM Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25075v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has become a central tool for high-resolution structural biology, yet the massive scale of datasets (often exceeding 100k particle images) renders 3D reconstruction both computationally expensive and memory intensive. Traditional Fourier-space methods are efficient but lose fidelity due to repeated transforms, while recent real-space approaches based on neural radiance fields (NeRFs) improve accuracy but incur cubic memory and computation overhead. Therefore, we introduce GEM, a novel cryo-EM reconstruction framework built on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) that operates directly in real-space while maintaining high efficiency. Instead of modeling the entire density volume, GEM represents proteins with compact 3D Gaussians, each parameterized by only 11 values. To further improve the training efficiency, we designed a novel gradient computation to 3D Gaussians that contribute to each voxel. This design substantially reduced both memory footprint and training cost. On standard cryo-EM benchmarks, GEM achieves up to 48% faster training and 12% lower memory usage compared to state-of-the-art methods, while improving local resolution by as much as 38.8%. These results establish GEM as a practical and scalable paradigm for cryo-EM reconstruction, unifying speed, efficiency, and high-resolution accuracy. Our code is available at https://github.com/UNITES-Lab/GEM.</description>

      <title>More Thought, Less Accuracy? On the Dual Nature of Reasoning in Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25848v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reasoning has emerged as a pivotal capability in Large Language Models (LLMs). Through Reinforcement Learning (RL), typically Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), these models are able to solve complex tasks such as mathematics and code generation. Building on these advances, recent research has sought to extend reasoning to Vision-Language Models (VLMs), yielding promising results across diverse visual tasks. Despite this progress, our study uncovers the dual nature of multimodal reasoning: while it substantially enhances logical inference and facilitates performance on challenging problems, it may gradually impair perceptual grounding, leading to recognition failures on otherwise basic visual questions. Through further analysis, we attribute this phenomenon to visual forgetting, wherein prolonged reasoning causes the model to increasingly disregard visual input. To address this, we propose Vision-Anchored Policy Optimization (VAPO), a simple yet effective method that explicitly steers the reasoning process toward visually grounded trajectories. Our result model, VAPO-Thinker-7B, significantly strengthens the model's reliance on visual information and achieves new state-of-the-art results on a wide range of established benchmarks.

      <title>LLaVAShield: Safeguarding Multimodal Multi-Turn Dialogues in Vision-Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25896v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As Vision-Language Models (VLMs) move into interactive, multi-turn use, new safety risks arise that single-turn or single-modality moderation misses. In Multimodal Multi-Turn (MMT) dialogues, malicious intent can be spread across turns and images, while context-sensitive replies may still advance harmful content. To address this challenge, we present the first systematic definition and study of MMT dialogue safety. Building on this formulation, we introduce the Multimodal Multi-turn Dialogue Safety (MMDS) dataset. We further develop an automated multimodal multi-turn red-teaming framework based on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to generate unsafe multimodal multi-turn dialogues for MMDS. MMDS contains 4,484 annotated multimodal dialogue samples with fine-grained safety ratings, policy dimension labels, and evidence-based rationales for both users and assistants. Leveraging MMDS, we present LLaVAShield, a powerful tool that jointly detects and assesses risk in user inputs and assistant responses. Across comprehensive experiments, LLaVAShield consistently outperforms strong baselines on MMT content moderation tasks and under dynamic policy configurations, establishing new state-of-the-art results. We will publicly release the dataset and model to support future research.</description>

      <title>VRWKV-Editor: Reducing quadratic complexity in transformer-based video editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25998v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In light of recent progress in video editing, deep learning models focusing on both spatial and temporal dependencies have emerged as the primary method. However, these models suffer from the quadratic computational complexity of traditional attention mechanisms, making them difficult to adapt to long-duration and high-resolution videos. This limitation restricts their applicability in practical contexts such as real-time video processing. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a method to reduce both time and space complexity of these systems by proposing VRWKV-Editor, a novel video editing model that integrates a linear spatio-temporal aggregation module into video-based diffusion models. VRWKV-Editor leverages bidirectional weighted key-value recurrence mechanism of the RWKV transformer to capture global dependencies while preserving temporal coherence, achieving linear complexity without sacrificing quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves up to 3.7x speedup and 60% lower memory usage compared to state-of-the-art diffusion-based video editing methods, while maintaining competitive performance in frame consistency and text alignment. Furthermore, a comparative analysis we conducted on videos with different sequence lengths confirms that the gap in editing speed between our approach and architectures with self-attention becomes more significant with long videos.</description>

      <title>Does Bigger Mean Better? Comparitive Analysis of CNNs and Biomedical Vision Language Modles in Medical Diagnosis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00411v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The accurate interpretation of chest radiographs using automated methods is a critical task in medical imaging. This paper presents a comparative analysis between a supervised lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a state-of-the-art, zero-shot medical Vision-Language Model (VLM), BiomedCLIP, across two distinct diagnostic tasks: pneumonia detection on the PneumoniaMNIST benchmark and tuberculosis detection on the Shenzhen TB dataset. Our experiments show that supervised CNNs serve as highly competitive baselines in both cases. While the default zero-shot performance of the VLM is lower, we demonstrate that its potential can be unlocked via a simple yet crucial remedy: decision threshold calibration. By optimizing the classification threshold on a validation set, the performance of BiomedCLIP is significantly boosted across both datasets. For pneumonia detection, calibration enables the zero-shot VLM to achieve a superior F1-score of 0.8841, surpassing the supervised CNN's 0.8803. For tuberculosis detection, calibration dramatically improves the F1-score from 0.4812 to 0.7684, bringing it close to the supervised baseline's 0.7834. This work highlights a key insight: proper calibration is essential for leveraging the full diagnostic power of zero-shot VLMs, enabling them to match or even outperform efficient, task-specific supervised models.</description>

      <title>Normal-Abnormal Guided Generalist Anomaly Detection</title>

Abstract: Generalist Anomaly Detection (GAD) aims to train a unified model on an original domain that can detect anomalies in new target domains. Previous GAD methods primarily use only normal samples as references, overlooking the valuable information contained in anomalous samples that are often available in real-world scenarios. To address this limitation, we propose a more practical approach: normal-abnormal-guided generalist anomaly detection, which leverages both normal and anomalous samples as references to guide anomaly detection across diverse domains. We introduce the Normal-Abnormal Generalist Learning (NAGL) framework, consisting of two key components: Residual Mining (RM) and Anomaly Feature Learning (AFL). RM extracts abnormal patterns from normal-abnormal reference residuals to establish transferable anomaly representations, while AFL adaptively learns anomaly features in query images through residual mapping to identify instance-aware anomalies. Our approach effectively utilizes both normal and anomalous references for more accurate and efficient cross-domain anomaly detection. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing GAD approaches. This work represents the first to adopt a mixture of normal and abnormal samples as references in generalist anomaly detection. The code and datasets are available at https://github.com/JasonKyng/NAGL.</description>

      <title>Multi-Domain Brain Vessel Segmentation Through Feature Disentanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00665v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The intricate morphology of brain vessels poses significant challenges for automatic segmentation models, which usually focus on a single imaging modality. However, accurately treating brain-related conditions requires a comprehensive understanding of the cerebrovascular tree, regardless of the specific acquisition procedure. Our framework effectively segments brain arteries and veins in various datasets through image-to-image translation while avoiding domain-specific model design and data harmonization between the source and the target domain. This is accomplished by employing disentanglement techniques to independently manipulate different image properties, allowing them to move from one domain to another in a label-preserving manner. Specifically, we focus on manipulating vessel appearances during adaptation while preserving spatial information, such as shapes and locations, which are crucial for correct segmentation. Our evaluation effectively bridges large and varied domain gaps across medical centers, image modalities, and vessel types. Additionally, we conduct ablation studies on the optimal number of required annotations and other architectural choices. The results highlight our framework's robustness and versatility, demonstrating the potential of domain adaptation methodologies to perform cerebrovascular image segmentation in multiple scenarios accurately. Our code is available at https://github.com/i-vesseg/MultiVesSeg.</description>

      <title>Equivariant Splitting: Self-supervised learning from incomplete data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00929v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Self-supervised learning for inverse problems allows to train a reconstruction network from noise and/or incomplete data alone. These methods have the potential of enabling learning-based solutions when obtaining ground-truth references for training is expensive or even impossible. In this paper, we propose a new self-supervised learning strategy devised for the challenging setting where measurements are observed via a single incomplete observation model. We introduce a new definition of equivariance in the context of reconstruction networks, and show that the combination of self-supervised splitting losses and equivariant reconstruction networks results in the same minimizer in expectation as the one of a supervised loss. Through a series of experiments on image inpainting, accelerated magnetic resonance imaging, and compressive sensing, we demonstrate that the proposed loss achieves state-of-the-art performance in settings with highly rank-deficient forward models.</description>

      <title>SoftCFG: Uncertainty-guided Stable Guidance for Visual Autoregressive Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00996v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models have emerged as powerful tools for image generation by modeling images as sequences of discrete tokens. While Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) has been adopted to improve conditional generation, its application in AR models faces two key issues: guidance diminishing, where the conditional-unconditional gap quickly vanishes as decoding progresses, and over-guidance, where strong conditions distort visual coherence. To address these challenges, we propose SoftCFG, an uncertainty-guided inference method that distributes adaptive perturbations across all tokens in the sequence. The key idea behind SoftCFG is to let each generated token contribute certainty-weighted guidance, ensuring that the signal persists across steps while resolving conflicts between text guidance and visual context. To further stabilize long-sequence generation, we introduce Step Normalization, which bounds cumulative perturbations of SoftCFG. Our method is training-free, model-agnostic, and seamlessly integrates with existing AR pipelines. Experiments show that SoftCFG significantly improves image quality over standard CFG and achieves state-of-the-art FID on ImageNet 256*256 among autoregressive models.</description>

      <title>SUPER-Net: Trustworthy Image Segmentation via Uncertainty Propagation in Encoder-Decoder Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.05978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.05978v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep Learning (DL) holds great promise in reshaping the industry owing to its precision, efficiency, and objectivity. However, the brittleness of DL models to noisy and out-of-distribution inputs is ailing their deployment in sensitive fields. Current models often lack uncertainty quantification, providing only point estimates. We propose SUPER-Net, a Bayesian framework for trustworthy image segmentation via uncertainty propagation. Using Taylor series approximations, SUPER-Net propagates the mean and covariance of the model's posterior distribution across nonlinear layers. It generates two outputs simultaneously: the segmented image and a pixel-wise uncertainty map, eliminating the need for expensive Monte Carlo sampling. SUPER-Net's performance is extensively evaluated on MRI and CT scans under various noisy and adversarial conditions. Results show that SUPER-Net outperforms state-of-the-art models in robustness and accuracy. The uncertainty map identifies low-confidence areas affected by noise or attacks, allowing the model to self-assess segmentation reliability, particularly when errors arise from noise or adversarial examples.</description>

      <title>Grasp Pre-shape Selection by Synthetic Training: Eye-in-hand Shared Control on the Hannes Prosthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.09812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.09812v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the task of object grasping with a prosthetic hand capable of multiple grasp types. In this setting, communicating the intended grasp type often requires a high user cognitive load which can be reduced adopting shared autonomy frameworks. Among these, so-called eye-in-hand systems automatically control the hand pre-shaping before the grasp, based on visual input coming from a camera on the wrist. In this paper, we present an eye-in-hand learning-based approach for hand pre-shape classification from RGB sequences. Differently from previous work, we design the system to support the possibility to grasp each considered object part with a different grasp type. In order to overcome the lack of data of this kind and reduce the need for tedious data collection sessions for training the system, we devise a pipeline for rendering synthetic visual sequences of hand trajectories. We develop a sensorized setup to acquire real human grasping sequences for benchmarking and show that, compared on practical use cases, models trained with our synthetic dataset achieve better generalization performance than models trained on real data. We finally integrate our model on the Hannes prosthetic hand and show its practical effectiveness. We make publicly available the code and dataset to reproduce the presented results.</description>

      <title>Momentum-SAM: Sharpness Aware Minimization without Computational Overhead</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.12033v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recently proposed optimization algorithm for deep neural networks Sharpness Aware Minimization (SAM) suggests perturbing parameters before gradient calculation by a gradient ascent step to guide the optimization into parameter space regions of flat loss. While significant generalization improvements and thus reduction of overfitting could be demonstrated, the computational costs are doubled due to the additionally needed gradient calculation, making SAM unfeasible in case of limited computationally capacities. Motivated by Nesterov Accelerated Gradient (NAG) we propose Momentum-SAM (MSAM), which perturbs parameters in the direction of the accumulated momentum vector to achieve low sharpness without significant computational overhead or memory demands over SGD or Adam. We evaluate MSAM in detail and reveal insights on separable mechanisms of NAG, SAM and MSAM regarding training optimization and generalization.

      <title>Hierarchical place recognition with omnidirectional images and curriculum learning-based loss functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14117v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses Visual Place Recognition (VPR), which is essential for the safe navigation of mobile robots. The solution we propose employs panoramic images and deep learning models, which are fine-tuned with triplet loss functions that integrate curriculum learning strategies. By progressively presenting more challenging examples during training, these loss functions enable the model to learn more discriminative and robust feature representations, overcoming the limitations of conventional contrastive loss functions. After training, VPR is tackled in two steps: coarse (room retrieval) and fine (position estimation). The results demonstrate that the curriculum-based triplet losses consistently outperform standard contrastive loss functions, particularly under challenging perceptual conditions. To thoroughly assess the robustness and generalization capabilities of the proposed method, it is evaluated in a variety of indoor and outdoor environments. The approach is tested against common challenges in real operation conditions, including severe illumination changes, the presence of dynamic visual effects such as noise and occlusions, and scenarios with limited training data. The results show that the proposed framework performs competitively in all these situations, achieving high recognition accuracy and demonstrating its potential as a reliable solution for real-world robotic applications. The code used in the experiments is available at https://github.com/MarcosAlfaro/TripletNetworksIndoorLocalization.git.</description>

      <title>Subspace Node Pruning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17506v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Improving the efficiency of neural network inference is undeniably important in a time where commercial use of AI models increases daily. Node pruning is the art of removing computational units such as neurons, filters, attention heads, or even entire layers to significantly reduce inference time while retaining network performance. In this work, we propose the projection of unit activations to an orthogonal subspace in which there is no redundant activity and within which we may prune nodes while simultaneously recovering the impact of lost units via linear least squares. We furthermore show that the order in which units are orthogonalized can be optimized to maximally rank units by their redundancy. Finally, we leverage these orthogonal subspaces to automatically determine layer-wise pruning ratios based upon the relative scale of node activations in our subspace, equivalent to cumulative variance. Our method matches or exceeds state-of-the-art pruning results on ImageNet-trained VGG-16, ResNet-50 and DeiT models while simultaneously having up to 24x lower computational cost than alternative methods. We also demonstrate that this method can be applied in a one-shot manner to OPT LLM models, again outperforming competing methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18213v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sound plays a major role in human perception. Along with vision, it provides essential information for understanding our surroundings. Despite advances in neural implicit representations, learning acoustics that align with visual scenes remains a challenge. We propose NeRAF, a method that jointly learns acoustic and radiance fields. NeRAF synthesizes both novel views and spatialized room impulse responses (RIR) at new positions by conditioning the acoustic field on 3D scene geometric and appearance priors from the radiance field. The generated RIR can be applied to auralize any audio signal. Each modality can be rendered independently and at spatially distinct positions, offering greater versatility. We demonstrate that NeRAF generates high-quality audio on SoundSpaces and RAF datasets, achieving significant performance improvements over prior methods while being more data-efficient. Additionally, NeRAF enhances novel view synthesis of complex scenes trained with sparse data through cross-modal learning. NeRAF is designed as a Nerfstudio module, providing convenient access to realistic audio-visual generation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17265v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Most control techniques for prosthetic grasping focus on dexterous fingers control, but overlook the wrist motion. This forces the user to perform compensatory movements with the elbow, shoulder and hip to adapt the wrist for grasping. We propose a computer vision-based system that leverages the collaboration between the user and an automatic system in a shared autonomy framework, to perform continuous control of the wrist degrees of freedom in a prosthetic arm, promoting a more natural approach-to-grasp motion. Our pipeline allows to seamlessly control the prosthetic wrist to follow the target object and finally orient it for grasping according to the user intent. We assess the effectiveness of each system component through quantitative analysis and finally deploy our method on the Hannes prosthetic arm.

      <title>How Can Time Series Analysis Benefit From Multiple Modalities? A Survey and Outlook</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11835v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time series analysis (TSA) is a longstanding research topic in the data mining community and has wide real-world significance. Compared to "richer" modalities such as language and vision, which have recently experienced explosive development and are densely connected, the time-series modality remains relatively underexplored and isolated. We notice that many recent TSA works have formed a new research field, i.e., Multiple Modalities for TSA (MM4TSA). In general, these MM4TSA works follow a common motivation: how TSA can benefit from multiple modalities. This survey is the first to offer a comprehensive review and a detailed outlook for this emerging field. Specifically, we systematically discuss three benefits: (1) reusing foundation models of other modalities for efficient TSA, (2) multimodal extension for enhanced TSA, and (3) cross-modality interaction for advanced TSA. We further group the works by the introduced modality type, including text, images, audio, tables, and others, within each perspective. Finally, we identify the gaps with future opportunities, including the reused modalities selections, heterogeneous modality combinations, and unseen tasks generalizations, corresponding to the three benefits. We release an up-to-date GitHub repository that includes key papers and resources.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17551v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transformer-based multimodal models are widely used in industrial-scale recommendation, search, and advertising systems for content understanding and relevance ranking. Enhancing labeled training data quality and cross-modal fusion significantly improves model performance, influencing key metrics such as quality view rates and ad revenue. High-quality annotations are crucial for advancing content modeling, yet traditional statistical-based active learning (AL) methods face limitations: they struggle to detect overconfident misclassifications and are less effective in distinguishing semantically similar items in deep neural networks. Additionally, audio information plays an increasing role, especially in short-video platforms, yet most pre-trained multimodal architectures primarily focus on text and images. While training from scratch across all three modalities is possible, it sacrifices the benefits of leveraging existing pre-trained visual-language (VL) and audio models. To address these challenges, we propose kNN-based Latent Space Broadening (LSB) to enhance AL efficiency and Vision-Language Modeling with Audio Enhancement (VLMAE), a mid-fusion approach integrating audio into VL models. This system deployed in production systems, leading to significant business gains.</description>

      <title>NeoARCADE: Robust Calibration for Distance Estimation to Support Assistive Drones for the Visually Impaired</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01988v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autonomous navigation by drones using onboard sensors, combined with deep learning and computer vision algorithms, is impacting a number of domains. We examine the use of drones to autonomously follow and assist Visually Impaired People (VIPs) in navigating urban environments. Estimating the absolute distance between the drone and the VIP, and to nearby objects, is essential to design obstacle avoidance algorithms. Here, we present NeoARCADE (Neo), which uses depth maps over monocular video feeds, common in consumer drones, to estimate absolute distances to the VIP and obstacles. Neo proposes robust calibration technique based on depth score normalization and coefficient estimations to translate relative distances from depth map to absolute ones. It further develops a dynamic recalibration method that can adapt to changing scenarios. We also develop two baseline models, Regression and Geometric, and compare Neo with SOTA depth map approaches and the baselines. We provide detailed evaluations to validate their robustness and generalizability for distance estimation to VIPs and other obstacles in diverse and dynamic conditions, using datasets collected in a campus environment. Neo predicts distances to VIP with an error &lt;30cm, and to different obstacles like cars and bicycles within a maximum error of 60cm, which are better than the baselines. Neo also clearly out-performs SOTA depth map methods, reporting errors up to 5.3-14.6x lower.</description>

      <title>Feature Representation Transferring to Lightweight Models via Perception Coherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06595v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a method for transferring feature representation to lightweight student models from larger teacher models. We mathematically define a new notion called \textit{perception coherence}. Based on this notion, we propose a loss function, which takes into account the dissimilarities between data points in feature space through their ranking. At a high level, by minimizing this loss function, the student model learns to mimic how the teacher model \textit{perceives} inputs. More precisely, our method is motivated by the fact that the representational capacity of the student model is weaker than the teacher model. Hence, we aim to develop a new method allowing for a better relaxation. This means that, the student model does not need to preserve the absolute geometry of the teacher one, while preserving global coherence through dissimilarity ranking. Importantly, while rankings are defined only on finite sets, our notion of \textit{perception coherence} extends them into a probabilistic form. This formulation depends on the input distribution and applies to general dissimilarity metrics. Our theoretical insights provide a probabilistic perspective on the process of feature representation transfer. Our experiments results show that our method outperforms or achieves on-par performance compared to strong baseline methods for representation transferring.</description>

      <title>Learning to Weight Parameters for Training Data Attribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05647v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study gradient-based data attribution, aiming to identify which training examples most influence a given output. Existing methods for this task either treat network parameters uniformly or rely on implicit weighting derived from Hessian approximations, which do not fully model functional heterogeneity of network parameters. To address this, we propose a method to explicitly learn parameter importance weights directly from data, without requiring annotated labels. Our approach improves attribution accuracy across diverse tasks, including image classification, language modeling, and diffusion, and enables fine-grained attribution for concepts like subject and style.</description>

      <title>AniMaker: Multi-Agent Animated Storytelling with MCTS-Driven Clip Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10540v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite rapid advancements in video generation models, generating coherent storytelling videos that span multiple scenes and characters remains challenging. Current methods often rigidly convert pre-generated keyframes into fixed-length clips, resulting in disjointed narratives and pacing issues. Furthermore, the inherent instability of video generation models means that even a single low-quality clip can significantly degrade the entire output animation's logical coherence and visual continuity. To overcome these obstacles, we introduce AniMaker, a multi-agent framework enabling efficient multi-candidate clip generation and storytelling-aware clip selection, thus creating globally consistent and story-coherent animation solely from text input. The framework is structured around specialized agents, including the Director Agent for storyboard generation, the Photography Agent for video clip generation, the Reviewer Agent for evaluation, and the Post-Production Agent for editing and voiceover. Central to AniMaker's approach are two key technical components: MCTS-Gen in Photography Agent, an efficient Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)-inspired strategy that intelligently navigates the candidate space to generate high-potential clips while optimizing resource usage; and AniEval in Reviewer Agent, the first framework specifically designed for multi-shot animation evaluation, which assesses critical aspects such as story-level consistency, action completion, and animation-specific features by considering each clip in the context of its preceding and succeeding clips. Experiments demonstrate that AniMaker achieves superior quality as measured by popular metrics including VBench and our proposed AniEval framework, while significantly improving the efficiency of multi-candidate generation, pushing AI-generated storytelling animation closer to production standards.</description>

      <title>Poutine: Vision-Language-Trajectory Pre-Training and Reinforcement Learning Post-Training Enable Robust End-to-End Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11234v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Maintaining good driving behavior in out-of-distribution scenarios remains a critical challenge in autonomous driving. A promising direction is to leverage the generalist knowledge and reasoning capabilities of large-language models by treating unusual driving scenarios as a logical reasoning task. In this work, we present Poutine, a method that uses an off-the-shelf 3B-parameter vision-language model (VLM) - without any additional components - to achieve robust end-to-end autonomous driving via a simple and scalable training recipe. To learn strong base driving capabilities, we first train Poutine-Base using self-supervised next-token prediction over vision, language, and trajectory (VLT) tokens, leveraging both nominal and long-tail driving data. In the second stage, we fine-tune Poutine-Base using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a small set of human preference-labeled examples. We evaluated our approach on the Waymo end-to-end driving benchmark curated for long-tail scenarios. The final Poutine model achieves an RFS of 7.99 on the test set, placing 1st in the 2025 Waymo Vision-Based End-to-End Driving Challenge by a significant margin. Our results suggest that handcrafted tokenizers or custom architectural components added to base VLMs in prior work are not necessary to achieve strong driving performance. Instead, this work highlights the potential of scalable VLT pretraining combined with lightweight RL fine-tuning to enable robust and generalizable autonomous driving.</description>

      <title>LoFT: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning for Long-tailed Semi-Supervised Learning in Open-World Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09926v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Long-tailed learning has garnered increasing attention due to its wide applicability in real-world scenarios. Among existing approaches, Long-Tailed Semi-Supervised Learning (LTSSL) has emerged as an effective solution by incorporating a large amount of unlabeled data into the imbalanced labeled dataset. However, most prior LTSSL methods are designed to train models from scratch, which often leads to issues such as overconfidence and low-quality pseudo-labels. To address these challenges, we extend LTSSL into the foundation model fine-tuning paradigm and propose a novel framework: LoFT (Long-tailed semi-supervised learning via parameter-efficient Fine-Tuning). We demonstrate that fine-tuned foundation models can generate more reliable pseudolabels, thereby benefiting imbalanced learning. Furthermore, we explore a more practical setting by investigating semi-supervised learning under open-world conditions, where the unlabeled data may include out-of-distribution (OOD) samples. To handle this problem, we propose LoFT-OW (LoFT under Open-World scenarios) to improve the discriminative ability. Experimental results on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance compared to previous approaches, even when utilizing only 1\% of the unlabeled data compared with previous works.</description>

      <title>UltraUPConvNet: A UPerNet- and ConvNeXt-Based Multi-Task Network for Ultrasound Tissue Segmentation and Disease Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11108v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultrasound imaging is widely used in clinical practice due to its cost-effectiveness, mobility, and safety. However, current AI research often treats disease prediction and tissue segmentation as two separate tasks and their model requires substantial computational overhead. In such a situation, we introduce UltraUPConvNet, a computationally efficient universal framework designed for both ultrasound image classification and segmentation. Trained on a large-scale dataset containing more than 9,700 annotations across seven different anatomical regions, our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on certain datasets with lower computational overhead. Our model weights and codes are available at https://github.com/yyxl123/UltraUPConvNet</description>

      <title>Development of a Mobile Application for at-Home Analysis of Retinal Fundus Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16814v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning is gaining significant attention as a diagnostic tool in medical imaging, particularly in the analysis of retinal fundus images. However, this approach is not yet clinically applicable, as it still depends on human validation from a professional. Therefore, we present the design for a mobile application that monitors metrics related to retinal fundus images correlating to age-related conditions. The purpose of this platform is to observe for a change in these metrics over time, offering early insights into potential ocular diseases without explicitly delivering diagnostics. Metrics analysed include vessel tortuosity, as well as signs of glaucoma, retinopathy and macular edema. To evaluate retinopathy grade and risk of macular edema, a model was trained on the Messidor dataset and compared to a similar model trained on the MAPLES-DR dataset. Information from the DeepSeeNet glaucoma detection model, as well as tortuosity calculations, is additionally incorporated to ultimately present a retinal fundus image monitoring platform. As a result, the mobile application permits monitoring of trends or changes in ocular metrics correlated to age-related conditions with regularly uploaded photographs.</description>

      <title>HAMLET: Switch your Vision-Language-Action Model into a History-Aware Policy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00695v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inherently, robotic manipulation tasks are history-dependent: leveraging past context could be beneficial. However, most existing Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) have been designed without considering this aspect, i.e., they rely solely on the current observation, ignoring preceding context. In this paper, we propose HAMLET, a scalable framework to adapt VLAs to attend to the historical context during action prediction. Specifically, we introduce moment tokens that compactly encode perceptual information at each timestep. Their representations are initialized with time-contrastive learning, allowing them to better capture temporally distinctive aspects. Next, we employ a lightweight memory module that integrates the moment tokens across past timesteps into memory features, which are then leveraged for action prediction. Through empirical evaluation, we show that HAMLET successfully transforms a state-of-the-art VLA into a history-aware policy, especially demonstrating significant improvements on long-horizon tasks that require historical context. In particular, on top of GR00T N1.5, HAMLET achieves an average success rate of 76.4% on history-dependent real-world tasks, surpassing the baseline performance by 47.2%. Furthermore, HAMLET pushes prior art performance from 64.1% to 66.4% on RoboCasa Kitchen (100-demo setup) and from 95.6% to 97.7% on LIBERO, highlighting its effectiveness even under generic robot-manipulation benchmarks.</description>
