      <title>Out-of-Distribution Detection with Attention Head Masking for Multimodal Document Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) data is crucial in machine learning applications to mitigate the risk of model overconfidence, thereby enhancing the reliability and safety of deployed systems. The majority of existing OOD detection methods predominantly address uni-modal inputs, such as images or texts. In the context of multi-modal documents, there is a notable lack of extensive research on the performance of these methods, which have primarily been developed with a focus on computer vision tasks. We propose a novel methodology termed as attention head masking (AHM) for multi-modal OOD tasks in document classification systems. Our empirical results demonstrate that the proposed AHM method outperforms all state-of-the-art approaches and significantly decreases the false positive rate (FPR) compared to existing solutions up to 7.5\%. This methodology generalizes well to multi-modal data, such as documents, where visual and textual information are modeled under the same Transformer architecture. To address the scarcity of high-quality publicly available document datasets and encourage further research on OOD detection for documents, we introduce FinanceDocs, a new document AI dataset. Our code and dataset are publicly available.</description>

      <title>The Dilemma of Uncertainty Estimation for General Purpose AI in the EU AI Act</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The AI act is the European Union-wide regulation of AI systems. It includes specific provisions for general-purpose AI models which however need to be further interpreted in terms of technical standards and state-of-art studies to ensure practical compliance solutions. This paper examines the AI act requirements for providers and deployers of general-purpose AI and further proposes uncertainty estimation as a suitable measure for legal compliance and quality assurance in training of such models. We argue that uncertainty estimation should be a required component for deploying models in the real world, and under the EU AI Act, it could fulfill several requirements for transparency, accuracy, and trustworthiness. However, generally using uncertainty estimation methods increases the amount of computation, producing a dilemma, as computation might go over the threshold ($10^{25}$ FLOPS) to classify the model as a systemic risk system which bears more regulatory burden.</description>

      <title>Improving Speech Recognition Error Prediction for Modern and Off-the-shelf Speech Recognizers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling the errors of a speech recognizer can help simulate errorful recognized speech data from plain text, which has proven useful for tasks like discriminative language modeling, improving robustness of NLP systems, where limited or even no audio data is available at train time. Previous work typically considered replicating behavior of GMM-HMM based systems, but the behavior of more modern posterior-based neural network acoustic models is not the same and requires adjustments to the error prediction model. In this work, we extend a prior phonetic confusion based model for predicting speech recognition errors in two ways: first, we introduce a sampling-based paradigm that better simulates the behavior of a posterior-based acoustic model. Second, we investigate replacing the confusion matrix with a sequence-to-sequence model in order to introduce context dependency into the prediction. We evaluate the error predictors in two ways: first by predicting the errors made by a Switchboard ASR system on unseen data (Fisher), and then using that same predictor to estimate the behavior of an unrelated cloud-based ASR system on a novel task. Sampling greatly improves predictive accuracy within a 100-guess paradigm, while the sequence model performs similarly to the confusion matrix.</description>

      <title>Towards Analyzing and Mitigating Sycophancy in Large Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have shown significant capability in vision-language understanding. However, one critical issue that persists in these models is sycophancy, which means models are unduly influenced by leading or deceptive prompts, resulting in biased outputs and hallucinations. Despite the progress in LVLMs, evaluating and mitigating sycophancy is yet much under-explored. In this work, we fill this gap by systematically analyzing sycophancy on various VL benchmarks with curated leading queries and further proposing a text contrastive decoding method for mitigation. While the specific sycophantic behavior varies significantly among models, our analysis reveals the severe deficiency of all LVLMs in resilience of sycophancy across various tasks. For improvement, we propose Leading Query Contrastive Decoding (LQCD), a model-agnostic method focusing on calibrating the LVLMs' over-reliance on leading cues by identifying and suppressing the probabilities of sycophancy tokens at the decoding stage. Extensive experiments show that LQCD effectively mitigate sycophancy, outperforming both prompt engineering methods and common methods for hallucination mitigation. We further demonstrate that LQCD does not hurt but even slightly improves LVLMs' responses to neutral queries, suggesting it being a more effective strategy for general-purpose decoding but not limited to sycophancy.</description>

      <title>BearLLM: A Prior Knowledge-Enhanced Bearing Health Management Framework with Unified Vibration Signal Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a bearing health management framework leveraging large language models (BearLLM), a novel multimodal model that unifies multiple bearing-related tasks by processing user prompts and vibration signals. Specifically, we introduce a prior knowledge-enhanced unified vibration signal representation to handle various working conditions across multiple datasets. This involves adaptively sampling the vibration signals based on the sampling rate of the sensor, incorporating the frequency domain to unify input dimensions, and using a fault-free reference signal as an auxiliary input. To extract features from vibration signals, we first train a fault classification network, then convert and align the extracted features into word embedding, and finally concatenate these with text embedding as input to an LLM. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, we constructed the first large-scale multimodal bearing health management (MBHM) dataset, including paired vibration signals and textual descriptions. With our unified vibration signal representation, BearLLM using one set of pre-trained weights achieves state-of-the-art performance on nine publicly available fault diagnosis benchmarks, outperforming specific methods designed for individual datasets. We provide a dataset, our model, and code to inspire future research on building more capable industrial multimodal models (https://github.com/hatton613/BearLLM).</description>

      <title>Applying and Evaluating Large Language Models in Mental Health Care: A Scoping Review of Human-Assessed Generative Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as promising tools for mental health care, offering scalable support through their ability to generate human-like responses. However, the effectiveness of these models in clinical settings remains unclear. This scoping review aimed to assess the current generative applications of LLMs in mental health care, focusing on studies where these models were tested with human participants in real-world scenarios. A systematic search across APA PsycNet, Scopus, PubMed, and Web of Science identified 726 unique articles, of which 17 met the inclusion criteria. These studies encompassed applications such as clinical assistance, counseling, therapy, and emotional support. However, the evaluation methods were often non-standardized, with most studies relying on ad hoc scales that limit comparability and robustness. Privacy, safety, and fairness were also frequently underexplored. Moreover, reliance on proprietary models, such as OpenAI's GPT series, raises concerns about transparency and reproducibility. While LLMs show potential in expanding mental health care access, especially in underserved areas, the current evidence does not fully support their use as standalone interventions. More rigorous, standardized evaluations and ethical oversight are needed to ensure these tools can be safely and effectively integrated into clinical practice.</description>

      <title>EEG-Defender: Defending against Jailbreak through Early Exit Generation of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly attracting attention in various applications. Nonetheless, there is a growing concern as some users attempt to exploit these models for malicious purposes, including the synthesis of controlled substances and the propagation of disinformation. In an effort to mitigate such risks, the concept of "Alignment" technology has been developed. However, recent studies indicate that this alignment can be undermined using sophisticated prompt engineering or adversarial suffixes, a technique known as "Jailbreak." Our research takes cues from the human-like generate process of LLMs. We identify that while jailbreaking prompts may yield output logits similar to benign prompts, their initial embeddings within the model's latent space tend to be more analogous to those of malicious prompts. Leveraging this finding, we propose utilizing the early transformer outputs of LLMs as a means to detect malicious inputs, and terminate the generation immediately. Built upon this idea, we introduce a simple yet significant defense approach called EEG-Defender for LLMs. We conduct comprehensive experiments on ten jailbreak methods across three models. Our results demonstrate that EEG-Defender is capable of reducing the Attack Success Rate (ASR) by a significant margin, roughly 85\% in comparison with 50\% for the present SOTAs, with minimal impact on the utility and effectiveness of LLMs.</description>

      <title>Unlocking Adversarial Suffix Optimization Without Affirmative Phrases: Efficient Black-box Jailbreaking via LLM as Optimizer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite prior safety alignment efforts, mainstream LLMs can still generate harmful and unethical content when subjected to jailbreaking attacks. Existing jailbreaking methods fall into two main categories: template-based and optimization-based methods. The former requires significant manual effort and domain knowledge, while the latter, exemplified by Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG), which seeks to maximize the likelihood of harmful LLM outputs through token-level optimization, also encounters several limitations: requiring white-box access, necessitating pre-constructed affirmative phrase, and suffering from low efficiency. In this paper, we present ECLIPSE, a novel and efficient black-box jailbreaking method utilizing optimizable suffixes. Drawing inspiration from LLMs' powerful generation and optimization capabilities, we employ task prompts to translate jailbreaking goals into natural language instructions. This guides the LLM to generate adversarial suffixes for malicious queries. In particular, a harmfulness scorer provides continuous feedback, enabling LLM self-reflection and iterative optimization to autonomously and efficiently produce effective suffixes. Experimental results demonstrate that ECLIPSE achieves an average attack success rate (ASR) of 0.92 across three open-source LLMs and GPT-3.5-Turbo, significantly surpassing GCG in 2.4 times. Moreover, ECLIPSE is on par with template-based methods in ASR while offering superior attack efficiency, reducing the average attack overhead by 83%.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Medical Predictions of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in clinical applications through prompt engineering, which enables the generation of flexible and diverse clinical predictions. However, they pose challenges in producing prediction probabilities, which are essential for transparency and allowing clinicians to apply flexible probability thresholds in decision-making. While explicit prompt instructions can lead LLMs to provide prediction probability numbers through text generation, LLMs' limitations in numerical reasoning raise concerns about the reliability of these text-generated probabilities. To assess this reliability, we compared explicit probabilities derived from text generation to implicit probabilities calculated based on the likelihood of predicting the correct label token. Experimenting with six advanced open-source LLMs across five medical datasets, we found that the performance of explicit probabilities was consistently lower than implicit probabilities with respect to discrimination, precision, and recall. Moreover, these differences were enlarged on small LLMs and imbalanced datasets, emphasizing the need for cautious interpretation and applications, as well as further research into robust probability estimation methods for LLMs in clinical contexts.</description>

      <title>Automating Thought of Search: A Journey Towards Soundness and Completeness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planning remains one of the last standing bastions for large language models (LLMs), which now turn their attention to search. Most of the literature uses the language models as world models to define the search space, forgoing soundness for the sake of flexibility. A recent work, Thought of Search (ToS), proposed defining the search space with code, having the language models produce that code. ToS requires a human in the loop, collaboratively producing a sound successor function and goal test. The result, however, is worth the effort: all the tested datasets were solved with 100% accuracy. At the same time LLMs have demonstrated significant progress in code generation and refinement for complex reasoning tasks. In this work, we automate ToS (AutoToS), completely taking the human out of the loop of solving planning problems. AutoToS guides the language model step by step towards the generation of sound and complete search components, through feedback from both generic and domain specific unit tests. We achieve 100% accuracy, with minimal feedback iterations, using LLMs of various sizes on all evaluated domains.</description>

      <title>Automatic Dataset Construction (ADC): Sample Collection, Data Curation, and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale data collection is essential for developing personalized training data, mitigating the shortage of training data, and fine-tuning specialized models. However, creating high-quality datasets quickly and accurately remains a challenge due to annotation errors, the substantial time and costs associated with human labor. To address these issues, we propose Automatic Dataset Construction (ADC), an innovative methodology that automates dataset creation with negligible cost and high efficiency. Taking the image classification task as a starting point, ADC leverages LLMs for the detailed class design and code generation to collect relevant samples via search engines, significantly reducing the need for manual annotation and speeding up the data generation process. Despite these advantages, ADC also encounters real-world challenges such as label errors (label noise) and imbalanced data distributions (label bias). We provide open-source software that incorporates existing methods for label error detection, robust learning under noisy and biased data, ensuring a higher-quality training data and more robust model training procedure. Furthermore, we design three benchmark datasets focused on label noise detection, label noise learning, and class-imbalanced learning. These datasets are vital because there are few existing datasets specifically for label noise detection, despite its importance. Finally, we evaluate the performance of existing popular methods on these datasets, thereby facilitating further research in the field.</description>

      <title>One-step Structure Prediction and Screening for Protein-Ligand Complexes using Multi-Task Geometric Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the structure of the protein-ligand complex is crucial to drug development. Existing virtual structure measurement and screening methods are dominated by docking and its derived methods combined with deep learning. However, the sampling and scoring methodology have largely restricted the accuracy and efficiency. Here, we show that these two fundamental tasks can be accurately tackled with a single model, namely LigPose, based on multi-task geometric deep learning. By representing the ligand and the protein pair as a graph, LigPose directly optimizes the three-dimensional structure of the complex, with the learning of binding strength and atomic interactions as auxiliary tasks, enabling its one-step prediction ability without docking tools. Extensive experiments show LigPose achieved state-of-the-art performance on major tasks in drug research. Its considerable improvements indicate a promising paradigm of AI-based pipeline for drug development.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding biological processes, drug development, and biotechnological advancements requires detailed analysis of protein structures and sequences, a task in protein research that is inherently complex and time-consuming when performed manually. To streamline this process, we introduce ProteinGPT, a state-of-the-art multi-modal protein chat system, that allows users to upload protein sequences and/or structures for comprehensive protein analysis and responsive inquiries. ProteinGPT seamlessly integrates protein sequence and structure encoders with linear projection layers for precise representation adaptation, coupled with a large language model (LLM) to generate accurate and contextually relevant responses. To train ProteinGPT, we construct a large-scale dataset of 132,092 proteins with annotations, and optimize the instruction-tuning process using GPT-4o. This innovative system ensures accurate alignment between the user-uploaded data and prompts, simplifying protein analysis. Experiments show that ProteinGPT can produce promising responses to proteins and their corresponding questions.</description>

      <title>Towards Probabilistic Inductive Logic Programming with Neurosymbolic Inference and Relaxation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many inductive logic programming (ILP) methods are incapable of learning programs from probabilistic background knowledge, e.g. coming from sensory data or neural networks with probabilities. We propose Propper, which handles flawed and probabilistic background knowledge by extending ILP with a combination of neurosymbolic inference, a continuous criterion for hypothesis selection (BCE) and a relaxation of the hypothesis constrainer (NoisyCombo). For relational patterns in noisy images, Propper can learn programs from as few as 8 examples. It outperforms binary ILP and statistical models such as a Graph Neural Network.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solving a decision theory problem usually involves finding the actions, among a set of possible ones, which optimize the expected reward, possibly accounting for the uncertainty of the environment. In this paper, we introduce the possibility to encode decision theory problems with Probabilistic Answer Set Programming under the credal semantics via decision atoms and utility attributes. To solve the task we propose an algorithm based on three layers of Algebraic Model Counting, that we test on several synthetic datasets against an algorithm that adopts answer set enumeration.

      <title>Epistemic Injustice in Generative AI</title>

Abstract: This paper investigates how generative AI can potentially undermine the integrity of collective knowledge and the processes we rely on to acquire, assess, and trust information, posing a significant threat to our knowledge ecosystem and democratic discourse. Grounded in social and political philosophy, we introduce the concept of \emph{generative algorithmic epistemic injustice}. We identify four key dimensions of this phenomenon: amplified and manipulative testimonial injustice, along with hermeneutical ignorance and access injustice. We illustrate each dimension with real-world examples that reveal how generative AI can produce or amplify misinformation, perpetuate representational harm, and create epistemic inequities, particularly in multilingual contexts. By highlighting these injustices, we aim to inform the development of epistemically just generative AI systems, proposing strategies for resistance, system design principles, and two approaches that leverage generative AI to foster a more equitable information ecosystem, thereby safeguarding democratic values and the integrity of knowledge production.</description>

      <title>Enabling Small Models for Zero-Shot Classification through Model Label Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP have demonstrated impressive zero-shot ability in image classification tasks by aligning text and images but suffer inferior performance compared with task-specific expert models. On the contrary, expert models excel in their specialized domains but lack zero-shot ability for new tasks. How to obtain both the high performance of expert models and zero-shot ability is an important research direction. In this paper, we attempt to demonstrate that by constructing a model hub and aligning models with their functionalities using model labels, new tasks can be solved in a zero-shot manner by effectively selecting and reusing models in the hub. We introduce a novel paradigm, Model Label Learning (MLL), which bridges the gap between models and their functionalities through a Semantic Directed Acyclic Graph (SDAG) and leverages an algorithm, Classification Head Combination Optimization (CHCO), to select capable models for new tasks. Compared with the foundation model paradigm, it is less costly and more scalable, i.e., the zero-shot ability grows with the sizes of the model hub. Experiments on seven real-world datasets validate the effectiveness and efficiency of MLL, demonstrating that expert models can be effectively reused for zero-shot tasks. Our code will be released publicly.</description>

      <title>Bidirectional Gated Mamba for Sequential Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In various domains, Sequential Recommender Systems (SRS) have become essential due to their superior capability to discern intricate user preferences. Typically, SRS utilize transformer-based architectures to forecast the subsequent item within a sequence. Nevertheless, the quadratic computational complexity inherent in these models often leads to inefficiencies, hindering the achievement of real-time recommendations. Mamba, a recent advancement, has exhibited exceptional performance in time series prediction, significantly enhancing both efficiency and accuracy. However, integrating Mamba directly into SRS poses several challenges. Its inherently unidirectional nature may constrain the model's capacity to capture the full context of user-item interactions, while its instability in state estimation can compromise its ability to detect short-term patterns within interaction sequences.
  To overcome these issues, we introduce a new framework named \textbf{\underline{S}}elect\textbf{\underline{I}}ve \textbf{\underline{G}}ated \textbf{\underline{MA}}mba (SIGMA). This framework leverages a Partially Flipped Mamba (PF-Mamba) to construct a bidirectional architecture specifically tailored to improve contextual modeling. Additionally, an input-sensitive Dense Selective Gate (DS Gate) is employed to optimize directional weights and enhance the processing of sequential information in PF-Mamba. For short sequence modeling, we have also developed a Feature Extract GRU (FE-GRU) to efficiently capture short-term dependencies. Empirical results indicate that SIGMA outperforms current models on five real-world datasets. Our implementation code is available at \url{https://github.com/ziwliu-cityu/SIMGA} to ease reproducibility.</description>

      <title>Nothing in Excess: Mitigating the Exaggerated Safety for LLMs via Safety-Conscious Activation Steering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Safety alignment is indispensable for Large language models (LLMs) to defend threats from malicious instructions. However, recent researches reveal safety-aligned LLMs prone to reject benign queries due to the exaggerated safety issue, limiting their helpfulness. In this paper, we propose a Safety-Conscious Activation Steering (SCANS) method to mitigate the exaggerated safety concerns in aligned LLMs. First, SCANS extracts the refusal steering vectors within the activation space and utilizes vocabulary projection to anchor some specific safety-critical layers which influence model refusal behavior. Second, by tracking the hidden state transition, SCANS identifies the steering direction and steers the model behavior accordingly, achieving a balance between exaggerated safety and adequate safety. Experiments show that SCANS achieves new state-of-the-art performance on XSTest and OKTest benchmarks, without impairing their defense capability against harmful queries and maintaining almost unchanged model capability.</description>

      <title>Estimating Peer Direct and Indirect Effects in Observational Network Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimating causal effects is crucial for decision-makers in many applications, but it is particularly challenging with observational network data due to peer interactions. Many algorithms have been proposed to estimate causal effects involving network data, particularly peer effects, but they often overlook the variety of peer effects. To address this issue, we propose a general setting which considers both peer direct effects and peer indirect effects, and the effect of an individual's own treatment, and provide identification conditions of these causal effects and proofs. To estimate these causal effects, we utilize attention mechanisms to distinguish the influences of different neighbors and explore high-order neighbor effects through multi-layer graph neural networks (GNNs). Additionally, to control the dependency between node features and representations, we incorporate the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) into the GNN, fully utilizing the structural information of the graph, to enhance the robustness and accuracy of the model. Extensive experiments on two semi-synthetic datasets confirm the effectiveness of our approach. Our theoretical findings have the potential to improve intervention strategies in networked systems, with applications in areas such as social networks and epidemiology.</description>

      <title>Mutagenesis screen to map the functionals of parameters of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced artificial intelligence, excelling in numerous tasks. Although the functionality of a model is inherently tied to its parameters, a systematic method for exploring the connections between the parameters and the functionality are lacking. Models sharing similar structure and parameter counts exhibit significant performance disparities across various tasks, prompting investigations into the varying patterns that govern their performance. We adopted a mutagenesis screen approach inspired by the methods used in biological studies, to investigate Llama2-7b and Zephyr. This technique involved mutating elements within the models' matrices to their maximum or minimum values to examine the relationship between model parameters and their functionalities. Our research uncovered multiple levels of fine structures within both models. Many matrices showed a mixture of maximum and minimum mutations following mutagenesis, but others were predominantly sensitive to one type. Notably, mutations that produced phenotypes, especially those with severe outcomes, tended to cluster along axes. Additionally, the location of maximum and minimum mutations often displayed a complementary pattern on matrix in both models, with the Gate matrix showing a unique two-dimensional asymmetry after rearrangement. In Zephyr, certain mutations consistently resulted in poetic or conversational rather than descriptive outputs. These "writer" mutations grouped according to the high-frequency initial word of the output, with a marked tendency to share the row coordinate even when they are in different matrices. Our findings affirm that the mutagenesis screen is an effective tool for deciphering the complexities of large language models and identifying unexpected ways to expand their potential, providing deeper insights into the foundational aspects of AI systems.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Behavioural Distance Between Mathematical Expressions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing symbolic regression methods organize the space of candidate mathematical expressions primarily based on their syntactic, structural similarity. However, this approach overlooks crucial equivalences between expressions that arise from mathematical symmetries, such as commutativity, associativity, and distribution laws for arithmetic operations. Consequently, expressions with similar errors on a given data set are apart from each other in the search space. This leads to a rough error landscape in the search space that efficient local, gradient-based methods cannot explore. This paper proposes and implements a measure of a behavioral distance, BED, that clusters together expressions with similar errors. The experimental results show that the stochastic method for calculating BED achieves consistency with a modest number of sampled values for evaluating the expressions. This leads to computational efficiency comparable to the tree-based syntactic distance. Our findings also reveal that BED significantly improves the smoothness of the error landscape in the search space for symbolic regression.</description>

      <title>RConE: Rough Cone Embedding for Multi-Hop Logical Query Answering on Multi-Modal Knowledge Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-hop query answering over a Knowledge Graph (KG) involves traversing one or more hops from the start node to answer a query. Path-based and logic-based methods are state-of-the-art for multi-hop question answering. The former is used in link prediction tasks. The latter is for answering complex logical queries. The logical multi-hop querying technique embeds the KG and queries in the same embedding space. The existing work incorporates First Order Logic (FOL) operators, such as conjunction ($\wedge$), disjunction ($\vee$), and negation ($\neg$), in queries. Though current models have most of the building blocks to execute the FOL queries, they cannot use the dense information of multi-modal entities in the case of Multi-Modal Knowledge Graphs (MMKGs). We propose RConE, an embedding method to capture the multi-modal information needed to answer a query. The model first shortlists candidate (multi-modal) entities containing the answer. It then finds the solution (sub-entities) within those entities. Several existing works tackle path-based question-answering in MMKGs. However, to our knowledge, we are the first to introduce logical constructs in querying MMKGs and to answer queries that involve sub-entities of multi-modal entities as the answer. Extensive evaluation of four publicly available MMKGs indicates that RConE outperforms the current state-of-the-art.</description>

      <title>Explainable Deep Learning Framework for Human Activity Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the realm of human activity recognition (HAR), the integration of explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) emerges as a critical necessity to elucidate the decision-making processes of complex models, fostering transparency and trust. Traditional explanatory methods like Class Activation Mapping (CAM) and attention mechanisms, although effective in highlighting regions vital for decisions in various contexts, prove inadequate for HAR. This inadequacy stems from the inherently abstract nature of HAR data, rendering these explanations obscure. In contrast, state-of-th-art post-hoc interpretation techniques for time series can explain the model from other perspectives. However, this requires extra effort. It usually takes 10 to 20 seconds to generate an explanation. To overcome these challenges, we proposes a novel, model-agnostic framework that enhances both the interpretability and efficacy of HAR models through the strategic use of competitive data augmentation. This innovative approach does not rely on any particular model architecture, thereby broadening its applicability across various HAR models. By implementing competitive data augmentation, our framework provides intuitive and accessible explanations of model decisions, thereby significantly advancing the interpretability of HAR systems without compromising on performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This technical report presents the Drama Engine, a novel framework for agentic interaction with large language models designed for narrative purposes. The framework adapts multi-agent system principles to create dynamic, context-aware companions that can develop over time and interact with users and each other. Key features include multi-agent workflows with delegation, dynamic prompt assembly, and model-agnostic design. The Drama Engine introduces unique elements such as companion development, mood systems, and automatic context summarising. It is implemented in TypeScript. The framework's applications include multi-agent chats and virtual co-workers for creative writing. The paper discusses the system's architecture, prompt assembly process, delegation mechanisms, and moderation techniques, as well as potential ethical considerations and future extensions.</description>

      <title>Don't Kill the Baby: The Case for AI in Arbitration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the introduction of Generative AI (GenAI) in 2022, its ability to simulate human intelligence and generate content has sparked both enthusiasm and concern. While much criticism focuses on AI's potential to perpetuate bias, create emotional dissonance, displace jobs, and raise ethical questions, these concerns often overlook the practical benefits of AI, particularly in legal contexts.
  This article examines the integration of AI into arbitration, arguing that the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) allows parties to contractually choose AI-driven arbitration, despite traditional reservations. The article makes three key contributions: (1) It shifts the focus from debates over AI's personhood to the practical aspects of incorporating AI into arbitration, asserting that AI can effectively serve as an arbitrator if both parties agree; (2) It positions arbitration as an ideal starting point for broader AI adoption in the legal field, given its flexibility and the autonomy it grants parties to define their standards of fairness; and (3) It outlines future research directions, emphasizing the importance of empirically comparing AI and human arbitration, which could lead to the development of distinct systems.
  By advocating for the use of AI in arbitration, this article underscores the importance of respecting contractual autonomy and creating an environment that allows AI's potential to be fully realized. Drawing on the insights of Judge Richard Posner, the article argues that the ethical obligations of AI in arbitration should be understood within the context of its technological strengths and the voluntary nature of arbitration agreements. Ultimately, it calls for a balanced, open-minded approach to AI in arbitration, recognizing its potential to enhance the efficiency, fairness, and flexibility of dispute resolution</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The modeling of dynamical systems is a pervasive concern for not only describing but also predicting and controlling natural phenomena and engineered systems. Current data-driven approaches often assume prior knowledge of the relevant state variables or result in overparameterized state spaces. Boyuan Chen and his co-authors proposed a neural network model that estimates the degrees of freedom and attempts to discover the state variables of a dynamical system. Despite its innovative approach, this baseline model lacks a connection to the physical principles governing the systems it analyzes, leading to unreliable state variables.
  This research proposes a method that leverages the physical characteristics of second-order Hamiltonian systems to constrain the baseline model. The proposed model outperforms the baseline model in identifying a minimal set of non-redundant and interpretable state variables.</description>

      <title>JieHua Paintings Style Feature Extracting Model using Stable Diffusion with ControlNet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study proposes a novel approach to extract stylistic features of Jiehua: the utilization of the Fine-tuned Stable Diffusion Model with ControlNet (FSDMC) to refine depiction techniques from artists' Jiehua. The training data for FSDMC is based on the opensource Jiehua artist's work collected from the Internet, which were subsequently manually constructed in the format of (Original Image, Canny Edge Features, Text Prompt). By employing the optimal hyperparameters identified in this paper, it was observed FSDMC outperforms CycleGAN, another mainstream style transfer model. FSDMC achieves FID of 3.27 on the dataset and also surpasses CycleGAN in terms of expert evaluation. This not only demonstrates the model's high effectiveness in extracting Jiehua's style features, but also preserves the original pre-trained semantic information. The findings of this study suggest that the application of FSDMC with appropriate hyperparameters can enhance the efficacy of the Stable Diffusion Model in the field of traditional art style migration tasks, particularly within the context of Jiehua.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current video generation models excel at creating short, realistic clips, but struggle with longer, multi-scene videos. We introduce \texttt{DreamFactory}, an LLM-based framework that tackles this challenge. \texttt{DreamFactory} leverages multi-agent collaboration principles and a Key Frames Iteration Design Method to ensure consistency and style across long videos. It utilizes Chain of Thought (COT) to address uncertainties inherent in large language models. \texttt{DreamFactory} generates long, stylistically coherent, and complex videos. Evaluating these long-form videos presents a challenge. We propose novel metrics such as Cross-Scene Face Distance Score and Cross-Scene Style Consistency Score. To further research in this area, we contribute the Multi-Scene Videos Dataset containing over 150 human-rated videos.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Chemistry Foundation Models to Facilitate Structure Focused Retrieval Augmented Generation in Multi-Agent Workflows for Catalyst and Materials Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular property prediction and generative design via deep learning models has been the subject of intense research given its potential to accelerate development of new, high-performance materials. More recently, these workflows have been significantly augmented with the advent of large language models (LLMs) and systems of LLM-driven agents capable of utilizing pre-trained models to make predictions in the context of more complex research tasks. While effective, there is still room for substantial improvement within the agentic systems on the retrieval of salient information for material design tasks. Moreover, alternative uses of predictive deep learning models, such as leveraging their latent representations to facilitate cross-modal retrieval augmented generation within agentic systems to enable task-specific materials design, has remained unexplored. Herein, we demonstrate that large, pre-trained chemistry foundation models can serve as a basis for enabling semantic chemistry information retrieval for both small-molecules, complex polymeric materials, and reactions. Additionally, we show the use of chemistry foundation models in conjunction with image models such as OpenCLIP facilitate unprecedented queries and information retrieval across multiple characterization data domains. Finally, we demonstrate the integration of these systems within multi-agent systems to facilitate structure and topological-based natural language queries and information retrieval for complex research tasks.</description>

      <title>LLM Agents Improve Semantic Code Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Code Search is a key task that many programmers often have to perform while developing solutions to problems. Current methodologies suffer from an inability to perform accurately on prompts that contain some ambiguity or ones that require additional context relative to a code-base. We introduce the approach of using Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) powered agents to inject information into user prompts allowing for better inputs into embedding models. By utilizing RAG, agents enhance user queries with relevant details from GitHub repositories, making them more informative and contextually aligned. Additionally, we introduce a multi-stream ensemble approach which when paired with agentic workflow can obtain improved retrieval accuracy, which we deploy on application called repo-rift.com. Experimental results on the CodeSearchNet dataset demonstrate that RepoRift significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving an 78.2% success rate at Success@10 and a 34.6% success rate at Success@1. This research presents a substantial advancement in semantic code search, highlighting the potential of agentic LLMs and RAG to enhance code retrieval systems.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Code Orchestration: Harnessing the Power of Large Language Models for Adaptive Script Execution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computer programming initially required humans to directly translate their goals into machine code. These goals could have easily been expressed as a written (or human) language directive. Computers, however, had no capacity to satisfactorily interpret written language. Large language model's provide exactly this capability; automatic generation of computer programs or even assembly code from written language directives. This research examines dynamic code execution of written language directives within the context of a running application. It implements a text editor whose business logic is purely backed by large language model prompts. That is, the program's execution uses prompts and written language directives to dynamically generate application logic at the point in time it is needed. The research clearly shows how written language directives, backed by a large language model, offer radically new programming and operating system paradigms. For example, empowerment of users to directly implement requirements via written language directives, thus supplanting the need for a team ofprogrammers, a release schedule and the like. Or, new security mechanisms where static executables, always a target for reverse engineering or fuzzing, no longer exist. They are replaced by ephemeral executables that may continually change, be completely removed, and are easily updated.</description>

      <title>Interactive-T2S: Multi-Turn Interactions for Text-to-SQL with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study explores text-to-SQL parsing by leveraging the powerful reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Despite recent advancements, existing LLM-based methods have not adequately addressed scalability, leading to inefficiencies when processing wide tables. Furthermore, current interaction-based approaches either lack a step-by-step, interpretable SQL generation process or fail to provide an efficient and universally applicable interaction design. To address these challenges, we introduce Interactive-T2S, a framework that generates SQL queries through direct interactions with databases. This framework includes four general tools that facilitate proactive and efficient information retrieval by the LLM. Additionally, we have developed detailed exemplars to demonstrate the step-wise reasoning processes within our framework. Our experiments on the BIRD-Dev dataset, employing a setting without oracle knowledge, reveal that our method achieves state-of-the-art results with only two exemplars, underscoring the effectiveness and robustness of our framework.</description>

      <title>Tabular Transfer Learning via Prompting LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning with a limited number of labeled data is a central problem in real-world applications of machine learning, as it is often expensive to obtain annotations. To deal with the scarcity of labeled data, transfer learning is a conventional approach; it suggests to learn a transferable knowledge by training a neural network from multiple other sources. In this paper, we investigate transfer learning of tabular tasks, which has been less studied and successful in the literature, compared to other domains, e.g., vision and language. This is because tables are inherently heterogeneous, i.e., they contain different columns and feature spaces, making transfer learning difficult. On the other hand, recent advances in natural language processing suggest that the label scarcity issue can be mitigated by utilizing in-context learning capability of large language models (LLMs). Inspired by this and the fact that LLMs can also process tables within a unified language space, we ask whether LLMs can be effective for tabular transfer learning, in particular, under the scenarios where the source and target datasets are of different format. As a positive answer, we propose a novel tabular transfer learning framework, coined Prompt to Transfer (P2T), that utilizes unlabeled (or heterogeneous) source data with LLMs. Specifically, P2T identifies a column feature in a source dataset that is strongly correlated with a target task feature to create examples relevant to the target task, thus creating pseudo-demonstrations for prompts. Experimental results demonstrate that P2T outperforms previous methods on various tabular learning benchmarks, showing good promise for the important, yet underexplored tabular transfer learning problem. Code is available at https://github.com/jaehyun513/P2T.</description>

      <title>Toward End-to-End Bearing Fault Diagnosis for Industrial Scenarios with Spiking Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) transmit information via low-power binary spikes and have received widespread attention in areas such as computer vision and reinforcement learning. However, there have been very few explorations of SNNs in more practical industrial scenarios. In this paper, we focus on the application of SNNs in bearing fault diagnosis to facilitate the integration of high-performance AI algorithms and real-world industries. In particular, we identify two key limitations of existing SNN fault diagnosis methods: inadequate encoding capacity that necessitates cumbersome data preprocessing, and non-spike-oriented architectures that constrain the performance of SNNs. To alleviate these problems, we propose a Multi-scale Residual Attention SNN (MRA-SNN) to simultaneously improve the efficiency, performance, and robustness of SNN methods. By incorporating a lightweight attention mechanism, we have designed a multi-scale attention encoding module to extract multiscale fault features from vibration signals and encode them as spatio-temporal spikes, eliminating the need for complicated preprocessing. Then, the spike residual attention block extracts high-dimensional fault features and enhances the expressiveness of sparse spikes with the attention mechanism for end-to-end diagnosis. In addition, the performance and robustness of MRA-SNN is further enhanced by introducing the lightweight attention mechanism within the spiking neurons to simulate the biological dendritic filtering effect. Extensive experiments on MFPT and JNU benchmark datasets demonstrate that MRA-SNN significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of accuracy, energy consumption and noise robustness, and is more feasible for deployment in real-world industrial scenarios.</description>

      <title>DiffZOO: A Purely Query-Based Black-Box Attack for Red-teaming Text-to-Image Generative Model via Zeroth Order Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current text-to-image (T2I) synthesis diffusion models raise misuse concerns, particularly in creating prohibited or not-safe-for-work (NSFW) images. To address this, various safety mechanisms and red teaming attack methods are proposed to enhance or expose the T2I model's capability to generate unsuitable content. However, many red teaming attack methods assume knowledge of the text encoders, limiting their practical usage. In this work, we rethink the case of \textit{purely black-box} attacks without prior knowledge of the T2l model. To overcome the unavailability of gradients and the inability to optimize attacks within a discrete prompt space, we propose DiffZOO which applies Zeroth Order Optimization to procure gradient approximations and harnesses both C-PRV and D-PRV to enhance attack prompts within the discrete prompt domain. We evaluated our method across multiple safety mechanisms of the T2I diffusion model and online servers. Experiments on multiple state-of-the-art safety mechanisms show that DiffZOO attains an 8.5% higher average attack success rate than previous works, hence its promise as a practical red teaming tool for T2l models.</description>

      <title>What can Large Language Models Capture about Code Functional Equivalence?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Code-LLMs, LLMs pre-trained on large code corpora, have shown great progress in learning rich representations of the structure and syntax of code, successfully using it to generate or classify code fragments. At the same time, understanding if they are able to do so because they capture code semantics, and how well, is still an open question. In this paper, we tackle this problem by introducing SeqCoBench, a benchmark for systematically assessing how Code-LLMs can capture code functional equivalence. SeqCoBench contains over 20 code transformations that either preserve or alter the semantics of Python programs. We conduct extensive evaluations in different settings, including zero-shot and parameter-efficient finetuning methods on state-of-the-art (Code-)LLMs to see if they can discern semantically equivalent or different pairs of programs in SeqCoBench. We find that the performance gap between these LLMs and classical match-based retrieval scores is minimal, with both approaches showing a concerning lack of depth in understanding code semantics.</description>

      <title>DOMBA: Double Model Balancing for Access-Controlled Language Models via Minimum-Bounded Aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The utility of large language models (LLMs) depends heavily on the quality and quantity of their training data. Many organizations possess large data corpora that could be leveraged to train or fine-tune LLMs tailored to their specific needs. However, these datasets often come with access restrictions that are based on user privileges and enforced by access control mechanisms. Training LLMs on such datasets could result in exposure of sensitive information to unauthorized users. A straightforward approach for preventing such exposure is to train a separate model for each access level. This, however, may result in low utility models due to the limited amount of training data per model compared to the amount in the entire organizational corpus. Another approach is to train a single LLM on all the data while limiting the exposure of unauthorized information. However, current exposure-limiting methods for LLMs are ineffective for access-controlled data, where sensitive information appears frequently across many training examples. We propose DOMBA - double model balancing - a simple approach for training and deploying LLMs that provides high utility and access-control functionality with security guarantees. DOMBA aggregates the probability distributions of two models, each trained on documents with (potentially many) different access levels, using a "min-bounded" average function (a function that is bounded by the smaller value, e.g., harmonic mean). A detailed mathematical analysis and extensive evaluation show that DOMBA safeguards restricted information while offering utility comparable to non-secure models.</description>

      <title>MS$^3$D: A RG Flow-Based Regularization for GAN Training with Limited Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have made impressive advances in image generation, but they often require large-scale training data to avoid degradation caused by discriminator overfitting. To tackle this issue, we investigate the challenge of training GANs with limited data, and propose a novel regularization method based on the idea of renormalization group (RG) in physics.We observe that in the limited data setting, the gradient pattern that the generator obtains from the discriminator becomes more aggregated over time. In RG context, this aggregated pattern exhibits a high discrepancy from its coarse-grained versions, which implies a high-capacity and sensitive system, prone to overfitting and collapse. To address this problem, we introduce a \textbf{m}ulti-\textbf{s}cale \textbf{s}tructural \textbf{s}elf-\textbf{d}issimilarity (MS$^3$D) regularization, which constrains the gradient field to have a consistent pattern across different scales, thereby fostering a more redundant and robust system. We show that our method can effectively enhance the performance and stability of GANs under limited data scenarios, and even allow them to generate high-quality images with very few data.</description>

      <title>SubgoalXL: Subgoal-based Expert Learning for Theorem Proving</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Formal theorem proving, a field at the intersection of mathematics and computer science, has seen renewed interest with advancements in large language models (LLMs). This paper introduces SubgoalXL, a novel approach that synergizes subgoal-based proofs with expert learning to enhance LLMs' capabilities in formal theorem proving within the Isabelle environment. SubgoalXL addresses two critical challenges: the scarcity of specialized mathematics and theorem-proving data, and the need for improved multi-step reasoning abilities in LLMs. By optimizing data efficiency and employing subgoal-level supervision, SubgoalXL extracts richer information from limited human-generated proofs. The framework integrates subgoal-oriented proof strategies with an expert learning system, iteratively refining formal statement, proof, and subgoal generators. Leveraging the Isabelle environment's advantages in subgoal-based proofs, SubgoalXL achieves a new state-of-the-art performance of 56.1\% in Isabelle on the standard miniF2F dataset, marking an absolute improvement of 4.9\%. Notably, SubgoalXL successfully solves 41 AMC12, 9 AIME, and 3 IMO problems from miniF2F. These results underscore the effectiveness of maximizing limited data utility and employing targeted guidance for complex reasoning in formal theorem proving, contributing to the ongoing advancement of AI reasoning capabilities. The implementation is available at \url{https://github.com/zhaoxlpku/SubgoalXL}.</description>

      <title>A Full DAG Score-Based Algorithm for Learning Causal Bayesian Networks with Latent Confounders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Causal Bayesian networks (CBN) are popular graphical probabilistic models that encode causal relations among variables. Learning their graphical structure from observational data has received a lot of attention in the literature. When there exists no latent (unobserved) confounder, i.e., no unobserved direct common cause of some observed variables, learning algorithms can be divided essentially into two classes: constraint-based and score-based approaches. The latter are often thought to be more robust than the former and to produce better results. However, to the best of our knowledge, when variables are discrete, no score-based algorithm is capable of dealing with latent confounders. This paper introduces the first fully score-based structure learning algorithm searching the space of DAGs (directed acyclic graphs) that is capable of identifying the presence of some latent confounders. It is justified mathematically and experiments highlight its effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Hide Your Malicious Goal Into Benign Narratives: Jailbreak Large Language Models through Neural Carrier Articles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Jailbreak attacks on Language Model Models (LLMs) entail crafting prompts aimed at exploiting the models to generate malicious content. This paper proposes a new type of jailbreak attacks which shift the attention of the LLM by inserting a prohibited query into a carrier article. The proposed attack leverage the knowledge graph and a composer LLM to automatically generating a carrier article that is similar to the topic of the prohibited query but does not violate LLM's safeguards. By inserting the malicious query to the carrier article, the assembled attack payload can successfully jailbreak LLM. To evaluate the effectiveness of our method, we leverage 4 popular categories of ``harmful behaviors'' adopted by related researches to attack 6 popular LLMs. Our experiment results show that the proposed attacking method can successfully jailbreak all the target LLMs which high success rate, except for Claude-3.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Negotiation Using Comparison-Based Gradient Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Negotiation is useful for resolving conflicts in multi-agent systems. We explore autonomous negotiation in a setting where two self-interested rational agents sequentially trade items from a finite set of categories. Each agent has a utility function that depends on the amount of items it possesses in each category. The offering agent makes trade offers to improve its utility without knowing the responding agent's utility function, and the responding agent accepts offers that improve its utility. We present a comparison-based algorithm for the offering agent that generates offers through previous acceptance or rejection responses without extensive information sharing. The algorithm estimates the responding agent's gradient by leveraging the rationality assumption and rejected offers to prune the space of potential gradients. After the algorithm makes a finite number of consecutively rejected offers, the responding agent is at a near-optimal state, or the agents' preferences are closely aligned. Additionally, we facilitate negotiations with humans by representing natural language feedback as comparisons that can be integrated into the proposed algorithm. We compare the proposed algorithm against random search baselines in integer and fractional trading scenarios and show that it improves the societal benefit with fewer offers.</description>

      <title>Optimization of Multi-Agent Flying Sidekick Traveling Salesman Problem over Road Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mixed truck-drone delivery systems have attracted increasing attention for last-mile logistics, but real-world complexities demand a shift from single-agent, fully connected graph models to multi-agent systems operating on actual road networks. We introduce the multi-agent flying sidekick traveling salesman problem (MA-FSTSP) on road networks, extending the single truck-drone model to multiple trucks, each carrying multiple drones while considering full road networks for truck restrictions and flexible drone routes. We propose a mixed-integer linear programming model and an efficient three-phase heuristic algorithm for this NP-hard problem. Our approach decomposes MA-FSTSP into manageable subproblems of one truck with multiple drones. Then, it computes the routes for trucks without drones in subproblems, which are used in the final phase as heuristics to help optimize drone and truck routes simultaneously. Extensive numerical experiments on Manhattan and Boston road networks demonstrate our algorithm's superior effectiveness and efficiency, significantly outperforming both column generation and variable neighborhood search baselines in solution quality and computation time. Notably, our approach scales to more than 300 customers within a 5-minute time limit, showcasing its potential for large-scale, real-world logistics applications.</description>

Abstract: Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) systems augment how knowledge language models are by integrating external information sources such as Wikipedia, internal documents, scientific papers, or the open internet. RAG systems that rely on the open internet as their knowledge source have to contend with the complexities of human-generated content. Human communication extends much deeper than just the words rendered as text. Intent, tonality, and connotation can all change the meaning of what is being conveyed. Recent real-world deployments of RAG systems have shown some difficulty in understanding these nuances of human communication. One significant challenge for these systems lies in processing sarcasm. Though the Large Language Models (LLMs) that make up the backbone of these RAG systems are able to detect sarcasm, they currently do not always use these detections for the subsequent processing of text. To address these issues, in this paper, we synthetically generate sarcastic passages from Natural Question's Wikipedia retrieval corpus. We then test the impact of these passages on the performance of both the retriever and reader portion of the RAG pipeline. We introduce a prompting system designed to enhance the model's ability to interpret and generate responses in the presence of sarcasm, thus improving overall system performance. Finally, we conduct ablation studies to validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating improvements in handling sarcastic content within RAG systems.</description>

      <title>EPiC: Cost-effective Search-based Prompt Engineering of LLMs for Code Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have seen increasing use in various software development tasks, especially in code generation. The most advanced recent methods attempt to incorporate feedback from code execution into prompts to help guide LLMs in generating correct code, in an iterative process. While effective, these methods could be costly and time-consuming due to numerous interactions with the LLM and the extensive token usage. To address this issue, we propose an alternative approach named Evolutionary Prompt Engineering for Code (EPiC), which leverages a lightweight evolutionary algorithm to evolve the original prompts toward better ones that produce high-quality code, with minimal interactions with LLM. Our evaluation against state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLM-based code generation models shows that EPiC outperforms all the baselines in terms of cost-effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Effective Off-Policy Evaluation and Learning in Contextual Combinatorial Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore off-policy evaluation and learning (OPE/L) in contextual combinatorial bandits (CCB), where a policy selects a subset in the action space. For example, it might choose a set of furniture pieces (a bed and a drawer) from available items (bed, drawer, chair, etc.) for interior design sales. This setting is widespread in fields such as recommender systems and healthcare, yet OPE/L of CCB remains unexplored in the relevant literature. Typical OPE/L methods such as regression and importance sampling can be applied to the CCB problem, however, they face significant challenges due to high bias or variance, exacerbated by the exponential growth in the number of available subsets. To address these challenges, we introduce a concept of factored action space, which allows us to decompose each subset into binary indicators. This formulation allows us to distinguish between the ''main effect'' derived from the main actions, and the ''residual effect'', originating from the supplemental actions, facilitating more effective OPE. Specifically, our estimator, called OPCB, leverages an importance sampling-based approach to unbiasedly estimate the main effect, while employing regression-based approach to deal with the residual effect with low variance. OPCB achieves substantial variance reduction compared to conventional importance sampling methods and bias reduction relative to regression methods under certain conditions, as illustrated in our theoretical analysis. Experiments demonstrate OPCB's superior performance over typical methods in both OPE and OPL.</description>

      <title>Quantum Inverse Contextual Vision Transformers (Q-ICVT): A New Frontier in 3D Object Detection for AVs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The field of autonomous vehicles (AVs) predominantly leverages multi-modal integration of LiDAR and camera data to achieve better performance compared to using a single modality. However, the fusion process encounters challenges in detecting distant objects due to the disparity between the high resolution of cameras and the sparse data from LiDAR. Insufficient integration of global perspectives with local-level details results in sub-optimal fusion performance.To address this issue, we have developed an innovative two-stage fusion process called Quantum Inverse Contextual Vision Transformers (Q-ICVT). This approach leverages adiabatic computing in quantum concepts to create a novel reversible vision transformer known as the Global Adiabatic Transformer (GAT). GAT aggregates sparse LiDAR features with semantic features in dense images for cross-modal integration in a global form. Additionally, the Sparse Expert of Local Fusion (SELF) module maps the sparse LiDAR 3D proposals and encodes position information of the raw point cloud onto the dense camera feature space using a gating point fusion approach. Our experiments show that Q-ICVT achieves an mAPH of 82.54 for L2 difficulties on the Waymo dataset, improving by 1.88% over current state-of-the-art fusion methods. We also analyze GAT and SELF in ablation studies to highlight the impact of Q-ICVT. Our code is available at https://github.com/sanjay-810/Qicvt Q-ICVT</description>

      <title>CoDi: Conversational Distillation for Grounded Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Distilling conversational skills into Small Language Models (SLMs) with approximately 1 billion parameters presents significant challenges. Firstly, SLMs have limited capacity in their model parameters to learn extensive knowledge compared to larger models. Secondly, high-quality conversational datasets are often scarce, small, and domain-specific. Addressing these challenges, we introduce a novel data distillation framework named CoDi (short for Conversational Distillation, pronounced "Cody"), allowing us to synthesize large-scale, assistant-style datasets in a steerable and diverse manner. Specifically, while our framework is task agnostic at its core, we explore and evaluate the potential of CoDi on the task of conversational grounded reasoning for question answering. This is a typical on-device scenario for specialist SLMs, allowing for open-domain model responses, without requiring the model to "memorize" world knowledge in its limited weights. Our evaluations show that SLMs trained with CoDi-synthesized data achieve performance comparable to models trained on human-annotated data in standard metrics. Additionally, when using our framework to generate larger datasets from web data, our models surpass larger, instruction-tuned models in zero-shot conversational grounded reasoning tasks.</description>

      <title>OCTCube: A 3D foundation model for optical coherence tomography that improves cross-dataset, cross-disease, cross-device and cross-modality analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical coherence tomography (OCT) has become critical for diagnosing retinal diseases as it enables 3D images of the retina and optic nerve. OCT acquisition is fast, non-invasive, affordable, and scalable. Due to its broad applicability, massive numbers of OCT images have been accumulated in routine exams, making it possible to train large-scale foundation models that can generalize to various diagnostic tasks using OCT images. Nevertheless, existing foundation models for OCT only consider 2D image slices, overlooking the rich 3D structure. Here, we present OCTCube, a 3D foundation model pre-trained on 26,605 3D OCT volumes encompassing 1.62 million 2D OCT images. OCTCube is developed based on 3D masked autoencoders and exploits FlashAttention to reduce the larger GPU memory usage caused by modeling 3D volumes. OCTCube outperforms 2D models when predicting 8 retinal diseases in both inductive and cross-dataset settings, indicating that utilizing the 3D structure in the model instead of 2D data results in significant improvement. OCTCube further shows superior performance on cross-device prediction and when predicting systemic diseases, such as diabetes and hypertension, further demonstrating its strong generalizability. Finally, we propose a contrastive-self-supervised-learning-based OCT-IR pre-training framework (COIP) for cross-modality analysis on OCT and infrared retinal (IR) images, where the OCT volumes are embedded using OCTCube. We demonstrate that COIP enables accurate alignment between OCT and IR en face images. Collectively, OCTCube, a 3D OCT foundation model, demonstrates significantly better performance against 2D models on 27 out of 29 tasks and comparable performance on the other two tasks, paving the way for AI-based retinal disease diagnosis.</description>

      <title>Unified Deep Learning Model for Global Prediction of Aboveground Biomass, Canopy Height and Cover from High-Resolution, Multi-Sensor Satellite Imagery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Regular measurement of carbon stock in the world's forests is critical for carbon accounting and reporting under national and international climate initiatives, and for scientific research, but has been largely limited in scalability and temporal resolution due to a lack of ground based assessments. Increasing efforts have been made to address these challenges by incorporating remotely sensed data. We present a new methodology which uses multi-sensor, multi-spectral imagery at a resolution of 10 meters and a deep learning based model which unifies the prediction of above ground biomass density (AGBD), canopy height (CH), canopy cover (CC) as well as uncertainty estimations for all three quantities. The model is trained on millions of globally sampled GEDI-L2/L4 measurements. We validate the capability of our model by deploying it over the entire globe for the year 2023 as well as annually from 2016 to 2023 over selected areas. The model achieves a mean absolute error for AGBD (CH, CC) of 26.1 Mg/ha (3.7 m, 9.9 %) and a root mean squared error of 50.6 Mg/ha (5.4 m, 15.8 %) on a globally sampled test dataset, demonstrating a significant improvement over previously published results. We also report the model performance against independently collected ground measurements published in the literature, which show a high degree of correlation across varying conditions. We further show that our pre-trained model facilitates seamless transferability to other GEDI variables due to its multi-head architecture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a group of related methods for binary classification tasks using probes of the hidden state activations in large language models (LLMs). Performance is on par with the largest and most advanced LLMs currently available, but requiring orders of magnitude fewer computational resources and not requiring labeled data. This approach involves translating class labels into a semantically rich description, spontaneous symmetry breaking of multilayer perceptron probes for unsupervised learning and inference, training probes to generate confidence scores (prior probabilities) from hidden state activations subject to known constraints via entropy maximization, and selecting the most confident probe model from an ensemble for prediction. These techniques are evaluated on four datasets using five base LLMs.</description>

      <title>Do Neural Scaling Laws Exist on Graph Self-Supervised Learning?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-supervised learning~(SSL) is essential to obtain foundation models in NLP and CV domains via effectively leveraging knowledge in large-scale unlabeled data. The reason for its success is that a suitable SSL design can help the model to follow the neural scaling law, i.e., the performance consistently improves with increasing model and dataset sizes. However, it remains a mystery whether existing SSL in the graph domain can follow the scaling behavior toward building Graph Foundation Models~(GFMs) with large-scale pre-training. In this study, we examine whether existing graph SSL techniques can follow the neural scaling behavior with the potential to serve as the essential component for GFMs. Our benchmark includes comprehensive SSL technique implementations with analysis conducted on both the conventional SSL setting and many new settings adopted in other domains. Surprisingly, despite the SSL loss continuously decreasing, no existing graph SSL techniques follow the neural scaling behavior on the downstream performance. The model performance only merely fluctuates on different data scales and model scales. Instead of the scales, the key factors influencing the performance are the choices of model architecture and pretext task design. This paper examines existing SSL techniques for the feasibility of Graph SSL techniques in developing GFMs and opens a new direction for graph SSL design with the new evaluation prototype. Our code implementation is available online to ease reproducibility on https://github.com/GraphSSLScaling/GraphSSLScaling.</description>

Abstract: In response to the burgeoning global demand for premium agricultural products, particularly within the competitive nut market, this paper introduces an innovative methodology aimed at enhancing the grading process for almonds and their shells. Leveraging state-of-the-art Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), specifically the AlmondNet-20 architecture, our study achieves exceptional accuracy exceeding 99%, facilitated by the utilization of a 20-layer CNN model. To bolster robustness in differentiating between almonds and shells, data augmentation techniques are employed, ensuring the reliability and accuracy of our classification system. Our model, meticulously trained over 1000 epochs, demonstrates remarkable performance, boasting an accuracy rate of 99% alongside a minimal loss function of 0.0567. Rigorous evaluation through test datasets further validates the efficacy of our approach, revealing impeccable precision, recall, and F1-score metrics for almond detection. Beyond its technical prowess, this advanced classification system offers tangible benefits to both industry experts and non-specialists alike, ensuring globally reliable almond classification. The application of deep learning algorithms, as showcased in our study, not only enhances grading accuracy but also presents opportunities for product patents, thereby contributing to the economic value of our nation. Through the adoption of cutting-edge technologies such as the AlmondNet-20 model, we pave the way for future advancements in agricultural product classification, ultimately enriching global trade and economic prosperity.</description>

      <title>Inference Plans for Hybrid Particle Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advanced probabilistic programming languages (PPLs) use hybrid inference systems to combine symbolic exact inference and Monte Carlo methods to improve inference performance. These systems use heuristics to partition random variables within the program into variables that are encoded symbolically and variables that are encoded with sampled values, and the heuristics are not necessarily aligned with the performance evaluation metrics used by the developer. In this work, we present inference plans, a programming interface that enables developers to control the partitioning of random variables during hybrid particle filtering. We further present Siren, a new PPL that enables developers to use annotations to specify inference plans the inference system must implement. To assist developers with statically reasoning about whether an inference plan can be implemented, we present an abstract-interpretation-based static analysis for Siren for determining inference plan satisfiability. We prove the analysis is sound with respect to Siren's semantics. Our evaluation applies inference plans to three different hybrid particle filtering algorithms on a suite of benchmarks and shows that the control provided by inference plans enables speed ups of 1.76x on average and up to 206x to reach target accuracy, compared to the inference plans implemented by default heuristics; the results also show that inference plans improve accuracy by 1.83x on average and up to 595x with less or equal runtime, compared to the default inference plans. We further show that the static analysis is precise in practice, identifying all satisfiable inference plans in 27 out of the 33 benchmark-algorithm combinations.</description>

      <title>Offline Policy Learning via Skill-step Abstraction for Long-horizon Goal-Conditioned Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Goal-conditioned (GC) policy learning often faces a challenge arising from the sparsity of rewards, when confronting long-horizon goals. To address the challenge, we explore skill-based GC policy learning in offline settings, where skills are acquired from existing data and long-horizon goals are decomposed into sequences of near-term goals that align with these skills. Specifically, we present an `offline GC policy learning via skill-step abstraction' framework (GLvSA) tailored for tackling long-horizon GC tasks affected by goal distribution shifts. In the framework, a GC policy is progressively learned offline in conjunction with the incremental modeling of skill-step abstractions on the data. We also devise a GC policy hierarchy that not only accelerates GC policy learning within the framework but also allows for parameter-efficient fine-tuning of the policy. Through experiments with the maze and Franka kitchen environments, we demonstrate the superiority and efficiency of our GLvSA framework in adapting GC policies to a wide range of long-horizon goals. The framework achieves competitive zero-shot and few-shot adaptation performance, outperforming existing GC policy learning and skill-based methods.</description>

      <title>UniFashion: A Unified Vision-Language Model for Multimodal Fashion Retrieval and Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fashion domain encompasses a variety of real-world multimodal tasks, including multimodal retrieval and multimodal generation. The rapid advancements in artificial intelligence generated content, particularly in technologies like large language models for text generation and diffusion models for visual generation, have sparked widespread research interest in applying these multimodal models in the fashion domain. However, tasks involving embeddings, such as image-to-text or text-to-image retrieval, have been largely overlooked from this perspective due to the diverse nature of the multimodal fashion domain. And current research on multi-task single models lack focus on image generation. In this work, we present UniFashion, a unified framework that simultaneously tackles the challenges of multimodal generation and retrieval tasks within the fashion domain, integrating image generation with retrieval tasks and text generation tasks. UniFashion unifies embedding and generative tasks by integrating a diffusion model and LLM, enabling controllable and high-fidelity generation. Our model significantly outperforms previous single-task state-of-the-art models across diverse fashion tasks, and can be readily adapted to manage complex vision-language tasks. This work demonstrates the potential learning synergy between multimodal generation and retrieval, offering a promising direction for future research in the fashion domain.

      <title>KAN4TSF: Are KAN and KAN-based models Effective for Time Series Forecasting?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time series forecasting is a crucial task that predicts the future values of variables based on historical data. Time series forecasting techniques have been developing in parallel with the machine learning community, from early statistical learning methods to current deep learning methods. Although existing methods have made significant progress, they still suffer from two challenges. The mathematical theory of mainstream deep learning-based methods does not establish a clear relation between network sizes and fitting capabilities, and these methods often lack interpretability. To this end, we introduce the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) into time series forecasting research, which has better mathematical properties and interpretability. First, we propose the Reversible Mixture of KAN experts (RMoK) model, which is a KAN-based model for time series forecasting. RMoK uses a mixture-of-experts structure to assign variables to KAN experts. Then, we compare performance, integration, and speed between RMoK and various baselines on real-world datasets, and the experimental results show that RMoK achieves the best performance in most cases. And we find the relationship between temporal feature weights and data periodicity through visualization, which roughly explains RMoK's mechanism. Thus, we conclude that KAN and KAN-based models (RMoK) are effective in time series forecasting. Code is available at KAN4TSF: https://github.com/2448845600/KAN4TSF.</description>

      <title>Swarm Intelligence in Geo-Localization: A Multi-Agent Large Vision-Language Model Collaborative Framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Visual geo-localization demands in-depth knowledge and advanced reasoning skills to associate images with real-world geographic locations precisely. In general, traditional methods based on data-matching are hindered by the impracticality of storing adequate visual records of global landmarks. Recently, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated the capability of geo-localization through Visual Question Answering (VQA), enabling a solution that does not require external geo-tagged image records. However, the performance of a single LVLM is still limited by its intrinsic knowledge and reasoning capabilities. Along this line, in this paper, we introduce a novel visual geo-localization framework called \name\ that integrates the inherent knowledge of multiple LVLM agents via inter-agent communication to achieve effective geo-localization of images. Furthermore, our framework employs a dynamic learning strategy to optimize the communication patterns among agents, reducing unnecessary discussions among agents and improving the efficiency of the framework. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, we construct GeoGlobe, a novel dataset for visual geo-localization tasks. Extensive testing on the dataset demonstrates that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</description>

Abstract: In the era of large language models (LLMs), the task of ``System I''~-~the fast, unconscious, and intuitive tasks, e.g., sentiment analysis, text classification, etc., have been argued to be successfully solved. However, sarcasm, as a subtle linguistic phenomenon, often employs rhetorical devices like hyperbole and figuration to convey true sentiments and intentions, involving a higher level of abstraction than sentiment analysis. There is growing concern that the argument about LLMs' success may not be fully tenable when considering sarcasm understanding. To address this question, we select eleven SOTA LLMs and eight SOTA pre-trained language models (PLMs) and present comprehensive evaluations on six widely used benchmark datasets through different prompting approaches, i.e., zero-shot input/output (IO) prompting, few-shot IO prompting, chain of thought (CoT) prompting. Our results highlight three key findings: (1) current LLMs underperform supervised PLMs based sarcasm detection baselines across six sarcasm benchmarks. This suggests that significant efforts are still required to improve LLMs' understanding of human sarcasm. (2) GPT-4 consistently and significantly outperforms other LLMs across various prompting methods, with an average improvement of 14.0\%$\uparrow$. Claude 3 and ChatGPT demonstrate the next best performance after GPT-4. (3) Few-shot IO prompting method outperforms the other two methods: zero-shot IO and few-shot CoT. The reason is that sarcasm detection, being a holistic, intuitive, and non-rational cognitive process, is argued not to adhere to step-by-step logical reasoning, making CoT less effective in understanding sarcasm compared to its effectiveness in mathematical reasoning tasks.</description>

      <title>Plug, Play, and Fuse: Zero-Shot Joint Decoding via Word-Level Re-ranking Across Diverse Vocabularies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11327</link>

Abstract: Recent advancements in NLP have resulted in models with specialized strengths, such as processing multimodal inputs or excelling in specific domains. However, real-world tasks, like multimodal translation, often require a combination of these strengths, such as handling both translation and image processing. While individual translation and vision models are powerful, they typically lack the ability to perform both tasks in a single system. Combining these models poses challenges, particularly due to differences in their vocabularies, which limit the effectiveness of traditional ensemble methods to post-generation techniques like N-best list re-ranking. In this work, we propose a novel zero-shot ensembling strategy that allows for the integration of different models during the decoding phase without the need for additional training. Our approach re-ranks beams during decoding by combining scores at the word level, using heuristics to predict when a word is completed. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method in machine translation scenarios, showing that it enables the generation of translations that are both speech- and image-aware while also improving overall translation quality\footnote{We will release the code upon paper acceptance.}.</description>

      <title>BURExtract-Llama: An LLM for Clinical Concept Extraction in Breast Ultrasound Reports</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Breast ultrasound is essential for detecting and diagnosing abnormalities, with radiology reports summarizing key findings like lesion characteristics and malignancy assessments. Extracting this critical information is challenging due to the unstructured nature of these reports, with varied linguistic styles and inconsistent formatting. While proprietary LLMs like GPT-4 are effective, they are costly and raise privacy concerns when handling protected health information. This study presents a pipeline for developing an in-house LLM to extract clinical information from radiology reports. We first use GPT-4 to create a small labeled dataset, then fine-tune a Llama3-8B model on it. Evaluated on clinician-annotated reports, our model achieves an average F1 score of 84.6%, which is on par with GPT-4. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of developing an in-house LLM that not only matches GPT-4's performance but also offers cost reductions and enhanced data privacy.</description>

      <title>EHL*: Memory-Budgeted Indexing for Ultrafast Optimal Euclidean Pathfinding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Euclidean Shortest Path Problem (ESPP), which involves finding the shortest path in a Euclidean plane with polygonal obstacles, is a classic problem with numerous real-world applications. The current state-of-the-art solution, Euclidean Hub Labeling (EHL), offers ultra-fast query performance, outperforming existing techniques by 1-2 orders of magnitude in runtime efficiency. However, this performance comes at the cost of significant memory overhead, requiring up to tens of gigabytes of storage on large maps, which can limit its applicability in memory-constrained environments like mobile phones or smaller devices. Additionally, EHL's memory usage can only be determined after index construction, and while it provides a memory-runtime tradeoff, it does not fully optimize memory utilization. In this work, we introduce an improved version of EHL, called EHL*, which overcomes these limitations. A key contribution of EHL* is its ability to create an index that adheres to a specified memory budget while optimizing query runtime performance. Moreover, EHL* can leverage preknown query distributions, a common scenario in many real-world applications to further enhance runtime efficiency. Our results show that EHL* can reduce memory usage by up to 10-20 times without much impact on query runtime performance compared to EHL, making it a highly effective solution for optimal pathfinding in memory-constrained environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11351v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Material characterization using electron micrographs is a crucial but challenging task with applications in various fields, such as semiconductors, quantum materials, batteries, etc. The challenges in categorizing electron micrographs include but are not limited to the complexity of patterns, high level of detail, and imbalanced data distribution(long-tail distribution). Existing methods have difficulty in modeling the complex relational structure in electron micrographs, hindering their ability to effectively capture the complex relationships between different spatial regions of micrographs. We propose a hypergraph neural network(HgNN) backbone architecture, a conceptually alternative approach, to better model the complex relationships in electron micrographs and improve material characterization accuracy. By utilizing cost-effective GPU hardware, our proposed framework outperforms popular baselines. The results of the ablation studies demonstrate that the proposed framework is effective in achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets and efficient in terms of computational and memory requirements for handling large-scale electron micrograph-based datasets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Anomaly detection is fundamental yet, challenging problem with practical applications in industry. The current approaches neglect the higher-order dependencies within the networks of interconnected sensors in the high-dimensional time series(multisensor data) for anomaly detection. To this end, we present a self-adapting anomaly detection framework for joint learning of (a) discrete hypergraph structure and (b) modeling the temporal trends and spatial relations among the interdependent sensors using the hierarchical encoder-decoder architecture to overcome the challenges. The hypergraph representation learning-based framework exploits the relational inductive biases in the hypergraph-structured data to learn the pointwise single-step-ahead forecasts through the self-supervised autoregressive task and predicts the anomalies based on the forecast error. Furthermore, our framework incentivizes learning the anomaly-diagnosis ontology through a differentiable approach. It derives the anomaly information propagation-based computational hypergraphs for root cause analysis and provides recommendations through an offline, optimal predictive control policy to remedy an anomaly. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the proposed method on the benchmark datasets for fair and rigorous comparison with the popular baselines. The proposed method outperforms the baseline models and achieves SOTA performance. We report the ablation studies to support the efficacy of the framework.</description>

      <title>Graph Classification via Reference Distribution Learning: Theory and Practice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph classification is a challenging problem owing to the difficulty in quantifying the similarity between graphs or representing graphs as vectors, though there have been a few methods using graph kernels or graph neural networks (GNNs). Graph kernels often suffer from computational costs and manual feature engineering, while GNNs commonly utilize global pooling operations, risking the loss of structural or semantic information. This work introduces Graph Reference Distribution Learning (GRDL), an efficient and accurate graph classification method. GRDL treats each graph's latent node embeddings given by GNN layers as a discrete distribution, enabling direct classification without global pooling, based on maximum mean discrepancy to adaptively learned reference distributions. To fully understand this new model (the existing theories do not apply) and guide its configuration (e.g., network architecture, references' sizes, number, and regularization) for practical use, we derive generalization error bounds for GRDL and verify them numerically. More importantly, our theoretical and numerical results both show that GRDL has a stronger generalization ability than GNNs with global pooling operations. Experiments on moderate-scale and large-scale graph datasets show the superiority of GRDL over the state-of-the-art, emphasizing its remarkable efficiency, being at least 10 times faster than leading competitors in both training and inference stages.</description>

      <title>Denoising Pre-Training and Customized Prompt Learning for Efficient Multi-Behavior Sequential Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the realm of recommendation systems, users exhibit a diverse array of behaviors when interacting with items. This phenomenon has spurred research into learning the implicit semantic relationships between these behaviors to enhance recommendation performance. However, these methods often entail high computational complexity. To address concerns regarding efficiency, pre-training presents a viable solution. Its objective is to extract knowledge from extensive pre-training data and fine-tune the model for downstream tasks. Nevertheless, previous pre-training methods have primarily focused on single-behavior data, while multi-behavior data contains significant noise. Additionally, the fully fine-tuning strategy adopted by these methods still imposes a considerable computational burden. In response to this challenge, we propose DPCPL, the first pre-training and prompt-tuning paradigm tailored for Multi-Behavior Sequential Recommendation. Specifically, in the pre-training stage, we commence by proposing a novel Efficient Behavior Miner (EBM) to filter out the noise at multiple time scales, thereby facilitating the comprehension of the contextual semantics of multi-behavior sequences. Subsequently, we propose to tune the pre-trained model in a highly efficient manner with the proposed Customized Prompt Learning (CPL) module, which generates personalized, progressive, and diverse prompts to fully exploit the potential of the pre-trained model effectively. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets have unequivocally demonstrated that DPCPL not only exhibits high efficiency and effectiveness, requiring minimal parameter adjustments but also surpasses the state-of-the-art performance across a diverse range of downstream tasks.</description>

      <title>Reflex-Based Open-Vocabulary Navigation without Prior Knowledge Using Omnidirectional Camera and Multiple Vision-Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Various robot navigation methods have been developed, but they are mainly based on Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), reinforcement learning, etc., which require prior map construction or learning. In this study, we consider the simplest method that does not require any map construction or learning, and execute open-vocabulary navigation of robots without any prior knowledge to do this. We applied an omnidirectional camera and pre-trained vision-language models to the robot. The omnidirectional camera provides a uniform view of the surroundings, thus eliminating the need for complicated exploratory behaviors including trajectory generation. By applying multiple pre-trained vision-language models to this omnidirectional image and incorporating reflective behaviors, we show that navigation becomes simple and does not require any prior setup. Interesting properties and limitations of our method are discussed based on experiments with the mobile robot Fetch.</description>

Abstract: The availability of temporal geospatial data in multiple modalities has been extensively leveraged to enhance the performance of machine learning models. While efforts on the design of adequate model architectures are approaching a level of saturation, focusing on a data-centric perspective can complement these efforts to achieve further enhancements in data usage efficiency and model generalization capacities. This work contributes to this direction. We leverage model explanation methods to identify the features crucial for the model to reach optimal performance and the smallest set of features sufficient to achieve this performance. We evaluate our approach on three temporal multimodal geospatial datasets and compare multiple model explanation techniques. Our results reveal that some datasets can reach their optimal accuracy with less than 20% of the temporal instances, while in other datasets, the time series of a single band from a single modality is sufficient.</description>

      <title>Revisiting FunnyBirds evaluation framework for prototypical parts networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Prototypical parts networks, such as ProtoPNet, became popular due to their potential to produce more genuine explanations than post-hoc methods. However, for a long time, this potential has been strictly theoretical, and no systematic studies have existed to support it. That changed recently with the introduction of the FunnyBirds benchmark, which includes metrics for evaluating different aspects of explanations.
  However, this benchmark employs attribution maps visualization for all explanation techniques except for the ProtoPNet, for which the bounding boxes are used. This choice significantly influences the metric scores and questions the conclusions stated in FunnyBirds publication.
  In this study, we comprehensively compare metric scores obtained for two types of ProtoPNet visualizations: bounding boxes and similarity maps. Our analysis indicates that employing similarity maps aligns better with the essence of ProtoPNet, as evidenced by different metric scores obtained from FunnyBirds. Therefore, we advocate using similarity maps as a visualization technique for prototypical parts networks in explainability evaluation benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Towards "Differential AI Psychology" and in-context Value-driven Statement Alignment with Moral Foundations Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contemporary research in social sciences is increasingly utilizing state-of-the-art statistical language models to annotate or generate content. While these models perform benchmark-leading on common language tasks and show exemplary task-independent emergent abilities, transferring them to novel out-of-domain tasks is only insufficiently explored. The implications of the statistical black-box approach - stochastic parrots - are prominently criticized in the language model research community; however, the significance for novel generative tasks is not.
  This work investigates the alignment between personalized language models and survey participants on a Moral Foundation Theory questionnaire. We adapt text-to-text models to different political personas and survey the questionnaire repetitively to generate a synthetic population of persona and model combinations. Analyzing the intra-group variance and cross-alignment shows significant differences across models and personas. Our findings indicate that adapted models struggle to represent the survey-captured assessment of political ideologies. Thus, using language models to mimic social interactions requires measurable improvements in in-context optimization or parameter manipulation to align with psychological and sociological stereotypes. Without quantifiable alignment, generating politically nuanced content remains unfeasible. To enhance these representations, we propose a testable framework to generate agents based on moral value statements for future research.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The global positioning system (GPS) has become an indispensable navigation method for field operations with unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) in marine environments. However, GPS may not always be available outdoors because it is vulnerable to natural interference and malicious jamming attacks. Thus, an alternative navigation system is required when the use of GPS is restricted or prohibited. To this end, we present a novel method that utilizes an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) to assist in localizing USVs in GNSS-restricted marine environments. In our approach, the UAV flies along the shoreline at a consistent altitude, continuously tracking and detecting the USV using a deep learning-based approach on camera images. Subsequently, triangulation techniques are applied to estimate the USV's position relative to the UAV, utilizing geometric information and datalink range from the UAV. We propose adjusting the UAV's camera angle based on the pixel error between the USV and the image center throughout the localization process to enhance accuracy. Additionally, visual measurements are integrated into an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) for robust state estimation. To validate our proposed method, we utilize a USV equipped with onboard sensors and a UAV equipped with a camera. A heterogeneous robotic interface is established to facilitate communication between the USV and UAV. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach through a series of experiments conducted during the ``Muhammad Bin Zayed International Robotic Challenge (MBZIRC-2024)'' in real marine environments, incorporating noisy measurements and ocean disturbances. The successful outcomes indicate the potential of our method to complement GPS for USV navigation.</description>

      <title>Diagnosing and Remedying Knowledge Deficiencies in LLMs via Label-free Curricular Meaningful Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are versatile and demonstrate impressive generalization ability by mining and learning information from extensive unlabeled text. However, they still exhibit reasoning mistakes, often stemming from knowledge deficiencies, which can affect their trustworthiness and reliability. Although users can provide diverse and comprehensive queries, obtaining sufficient and effective feedback is demanding. Furthermore, evaluating LLMs comprehensively with limited labeled samples is difficult. This makes it a challenge to diagnose and remedy the deficiencies of LLMs through rich label-free user queries. To tackle this challenge, we propose a label-free curricular meaningful learning framework (LaMer). LaMer first employs relative entropy to automatically diagnose and quantify the knowledge deficiencies of LLMs in a label-free setting. Next, to remedy the diagnosed knowledge deficiencies, we apply curricular meaningful learning: first, we adopt meaningful learning to adaptively synthesize augmentation data according to the severity of the deficiencies, and then design a curricular deficiency remedy strategy to remedy the knowledge deficiencies of LLMs progressively. Experiments show that LaMer efficiently and effectively diagnoses and remedies knowledge deficiencies in LLMs, improving various LLMs across seven out-of-distribution (OOD) reasoning and language understanding benchmarks, achieving comparable results to baselines with just 40\% training data. LaMer even surpasses methods that rely on labeled datasets for deficiency diagnosis. In application, our label-free method can offer an effective knowledge deficiency diagnostic tool for efficient LLM development.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern privacy regulations have spurred the evolution of machine unlearning, a technique that enables the removal of data from an already trained ML model without requiring retraining from scratch. Previous unlearning methods tend to induce the model to achieve lowest classification accuracy on the removal data. Nonetheless, the authentic objective of machine unlearning is to align the unlearned model with the gold model, i.e., achieving the same classification accuracy as the gold model. For this purpose, we present a Twin Machine Unlearning (TMU) approach, where a twin unlearning problem is defined corresponding to the original unlearning problem. As a results, the generalization-label predictor trained on the twin problem can be transferred to the original problem, facilitating aligned data removal. Comprehensive empirical experiments illustrate that our approach significantly enhances the alignment between the unlearned model and the gold model. Meanwhile, our method allows data removal without compromising the model accuracy.</description>

Abstract: In recent years, there have been significant advancements in computer vision which have led to the widespread deployment of image recognition and generation systems in socially relevant applications, from hiring to security screening. However, the prevalence of biases within these systems has raised significant ethical and social concerns. The most extensively studied biases in this context are related to gender, race and age. Yet, other biases are equally pervasive and harmful, such as lookism, i.e., the preferential treatment of individuals based on their physical appearance. Lookism remains under-explored in computer vision but can have profound implications not only by perpetuating harmful societal stereotypes but also by undermining the fairness and inclusivity of AI technologies. Thus, this paper advocates for the systematic study of lookism as a critical bias in computer vision models. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature, we identify three areas of intersection between lookism and computer vision. We illustrate them by means of examples and a user study. We call for an interdisciplinary approach to address lookism, urging researchers, developers, and policymakers to prioritize the development of equitable computer vision systems that respect and reflect the diversity of human appearances.</description>

      <title>Using Part-based Representations for Explainable Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Utilizing deep learning models to learn part-based representations holds significant potential for interpretable-by-design approaches, as these models incorporate latent causes obtained from feature representations through simple addition. However, training a part-based learning model presents challenges, particularly in enforcing non-negative constraints on the model's parameters, which can result in training difficulties such as instability and convergence issues. Moreover, applying such approaches in Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) is even more demanding due to the inherent instabilities that impact many optimization methods. In this paper, we propose a non-negative training approach for actor models in RL, enabling the extraction of part-based representations that enhance interpretability while adhering to non-negative constraints. To this end, we employ a non-negative initialization technique, as well as a modified sign-preserving training method, which can ensure better gradient flow compared to existing approaches. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach using the well-known Cartpole benchmark.</description>

      <title>Last-Iterate Convergence of General Parameterized Policies in Constrained MDPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of learning a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP) via general parameterization. Our proposed Primal-Dual based Regularized Accelerated Natural Policy Gradient (PDR-ANPG) algorithm uses entropy and quadratic regularizers to reach this goal. For a parameterized policy class with transferred compatibility approximation error, $\epsilon_{\mathrm{bias}}$, PDR-ANPG achieves a last-iterate $\epsilon$ optimality gap and $\epsilon$ constraint violation (up to some additive factor of $\epsilon_{\mathrm{bias}}$) with a sample complexity of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-2}\min\{\epsilon^{-2},\epsilon_{\mathrm{bias}}^{-\frac{1}{3}}\})$. If the class is incomplete ($\epsilon_{\mathrm{bias}}&gt;0$), then the sample complexity reduces to $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-2})$ for $\epsilon&lt;(\epsilon_{\mathrm{bias}})^{\frac{1}{6}}$. Moreover, for complete policies with $\epsilon_{\mathrm{bias}}=0$, our algorithm achieves a last-iterate $\epsilon$ optimality gap and $\epsilon$ constraint violation with $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-4})$ sample complexity. It is a significant improvement of the state-of-the-art last-iterate guarantees of general parameterized CMDPs.</description>

      <title>LARR: Large Language Model Aided Real-time Scene Recommendation with Semantic Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction is crucial for Recommendation System(RS), aiming to provide personalized recommendation services for users in many aspects such as food delivery, e-commerce and so on. However, traditional RS relies on collaborative signals, which lacks semantic understanding to real-time scenes. We also noticed that a major challenge in utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) for practical recommendation purposes is their efficiency in dealing with long text input. To break through the problems above, we propose Large Language Model Aided Real-time Scene Recommendation(LARR), adopt LLMs for semantic understanding, utilizing real-time scene information in RS without requiring LLM to process the entire real-time scene text directly, thereby enhancing the efficiency of LLM-based CTR modeling. Specifically, recommendation domain-specific knowledge is injected into LLM and then RS employs an aggregation encoder to build real-time scene information from separate LLM's outputs. Firstly, a LLM is continual pretrained on corpus built from recommendation data with the aid of special tokens. Subsequently, the LLM is fine-tuned via contrastive learning on three kinds of sample construction strategies. Through this step, LLM is transformed into a text embedding model. Finally, LLM's separate outputs for different scene features are aggregated by an encoder, aligning to collaborative signals in RS, enhancing the performance of recommendation model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Knowledge refactoring compresses a logic program by introducing new rules. Current approaches struggle to scale to large programs. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a constrained optimisation refactoring approach. Our first key idea is to encode the problem with decision variables based on literals rather than rules. Our second key idea is to focus on linear invented rules. Our empirical results on multiple domains show that our approach can refactor programs quicker and with more compression than the previous state-of-the-art approach, sometimes by 60%.</description>

      <title>A Survey of Embodied Learning for Object-Centric Robotic Manipulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Embodied learning for object-centric robotic manipulation is a rapidly developing and challenging area in embodied AI. It is crucial for advancing next-generation intelligent robots and has garnered significant interest recently. Unlike data-driven machine learning methods, embodied learning focuses on robot learning through physical interaction with the environment and perceptual feedback, making it especially suitable for robotic manipulation. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey of the latest advancements in this field and categorize the existing work into three main branches: 1) Embodied perceptual learning, which aims to predict object pose and affordance through various data representations; 2) Embodied policy learning, which focuses on generating optimal robotic decisions using methods such as reinforcement learning and imitation learning; 3) Embodied task-oriented learning, designed to optimize the robot's performance based on the characteristics of different tasks in object grasping and manipulation. In addition, we offer an overview and discussion of public datasets, evaluation metrics, representative applications, current challenges, and potential future research directions. A project associated with this survey has been established at https://github.com/RayYoh/OCRM_survey.</description>

      <title>Memorization In In-Context Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) has proven to be an effective strategy for improving the performance of large language models (LLMs) with no additional training. However, the exact mechanism behind these performance improvements remains unclear. This study is the first to show how ICL surfaces memorized training data and to explore the correlation between this memorization and performance across various ICL regimes: zero-shot, few-shot, and many-shot. Our most notable findings include: (1) ICL significantly surfaces memorization compared to zero-shot learning in most cases; (2) demonstrations, without their labels, are the most effective element in surfacing memorization; (3) ICL improves performance when the surfaced memorization in few-shot regimes reaches a high level (about 40%); and (4) there is a very strong correlation between performance and memorization in ICL when it outperforms zero-shot learning. Overall, our study uncovers a hidden phenomenon -- memorization -- at the core of ICL, raising an important question: to what extent do LLMs truly generalize from demonstrations in ICL, and how much of their success is due to memorization?</description>

      <title>Differentiating Choices via Commonality for Multiple-Choice Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) becomes particularly challenging when all choices are relevant to the question and are semantically similar. Yet this setting of MCQA can potentially provide valuable clues for choosing the right answer. Existing models often rank each choice separately, overlooking the context provided by other choices. Specifically, they fail to leverage the semantic commonalities and nuances among the choices for reasoning. In this paper, we propose a novel MCQA model by differentiating choices through identifying and eliminating their commonality, called DCQA. Our model captures token-level attention of each choice to the question, and separates tokens of the question attended to by all the choices (i.e., commonalities) from those by individual choices (i.e., nuances). Using the nuances as refined contexts for the choices, our model can effectively differentiate choices with subtle differences and provide justifications for choosing the correct answer. We conduct comprehensive experiments across five commonly used MCQA benchmarks, demonstrating that DCQA consistently outperforms baseline models. Furthermore, our case study illustrates the effectiveness of the approach in directing the attention of the model to more differentiating features.</description>

      <title>Active learning for efficient data selection in radio-signal based positioning via deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of user equipment (UE) positioning based on radio signals via deep learning. As in most supervised-learning tasks, a critical aspect is the availability of a relevant dataset to train a model. However, in a cellular network, the data-collection step may induce a high communication overhead. As a result, to reduce the required size of the dataset, it may be interesting to carefully choose the positions to be labelled and to be used in the training. We therefore propose an active learning approach for efficient data collection. We first show that significant gains (both in terms of positioning accuracy and size of the required dataset) can be obtained for the considered positioning problem using a genie. This validates the interest of active learning for positioning. We then propose a \textcolor{blue}{practical} method to approximate this genie.</description>

      <title>Cause-Aware Empathetic Response Generation via Chain-of-Thought Fine-Tuning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Empathetic response generation endows agents with the capability to comprehend dialogue contexts and react to expressed emotions. Previous works predominantly focus on leveraging the speaker's emotional labels, but ignore the importance of emotion cause reasoning in empathetic response generation, which hinders the model's capacity for further affective understanding and cognitive inference. In this paper, we propose a cause-aware empathetic generation approach by integrating emotions and causes through a well-designed Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompt on Large Language Models (LLMs). Our approach can greatly promote LLMs' performance of empathy by instruction tuning and enhancing the role awareness of an empathetic listener in the prompt. Additionally, we propose to incorporate cause-oriented external knowledge from COMET into the prompt, which improves the diversity of generation and alleviates conflicts between internal and external knowledge at the same time. Experimental results on the benchmark dataset demonstrate that our approach on LLaMA-7b achieves state-of-the-art performance in both automatic and human evaluations.</description>

      <title>Networked Communication for Mean-Field Games with Function Approximation and Empirical Mean-Field Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent works have provided algorithms by which decentralised agents, which may be connected via a communication network, can learn equilibria in Mean-Field Games from a single, non-episodic run of the empirical system. However, these algorithms are given for tabular settings: this computationally limits the size of players' observation space, meaning that the algorithms are not able to handle anything but small state spaces, nor to generalise beyond policies depending on the ego player's state to so-called 'population-dependent' policies. We address this limitation by introducing function approximation to the existing setting, drawing on the Munchausen Online Mirror Descent method that has previously been employed only in finite-horizon, episodic, centralised settings. While this permits us to include the population's mean-field distribution in the observation for each player's policy, it is arguably unrealistic to assume that decentralised agents would have access to this global information: we therefore additionally provide new algorithms that allow agents to estimate the global empirical distribution based on a local neighbourhood, and to improve this estimate via communication over a given network. Our experiments showcase how the communication network allows decentralised agents to estimate the mean-field distribution for population-dependent policies, and that exchanging policy information helps networked agents to outperform both independent and even centralised agents in function-approximation settings, by an even greater margin than in tabular settings.</description>

      <title>Xinyu: An Efficient LLM-based System for Commentary Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Commentary provides readers with a deep understanding of events by presenting diverse arguments and evidence. However, creating commentary is a time-consuming task, even for skilled commentators. Large language models (LLMs) have simplified the process of natural language generation, but their direct application in commentary creation still faces challenges due to unique task requirements. These requirements can be categorized into two levels: 1) fundamental requirements, which include creating well-structured and logically consistent narratives, and 2) advanced requirements, which involve generating quality arguments and providing convincing evidence. In this paper, we introduce Xinyu, an efficient LLM-based system designed to assist commentators in generating Chinese commentaries. To meet the fundamental requirements, we deconstruct the generation process into sequential steps, proposing targeted strategies and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) for each step. To address the advanced requirements, we present an argument ranking model for arguments and establish a comprehensive evidence database that includes up-to-date events and classic books, thereby strengthening the substantiation of the evidence with retrieval augmented generation (RAG) technology. To evaluate the generated commentaries more fairly, corresponding to the two-level requirements, we introduce a comprehensive evaluation metric that considers five distinct perspectives in commentary generation. Our experiments confirm the effectiveness of our proposed system. We also observe a significant increase in the efficiency of commentators in real-world scenarios, with the average time spent on creating a commentary dropping from 4 hours to 20 minutes. Importantly, such an increase in efficiency does not compromise the quality of the commentaries.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Modeling of Combined Sewer Systems for Urban Sustainability: An Empirical Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Climate change poses complex challenges, with extreme weather events becoming increasingly frequent and difficult to model. Examples include the dynamics of Combined Sewer Systems (CSS). Overburdened CSS during heavy rainfall will overflow untreated wastewater into surface water bodies. Classical approaches to modeling the impact of extreme rainfall events rely on physical simulations, which are particularly challenging to create for large urban infrastructures. Deep Learning (DL) models offer a cost-effective alternative for modeling the complex dynamics of sewer systems. In this study, we present a comprehensive empirical evaluation of several state-of-the-art DL time series models for predicting sewer system dynamics in a large urban infrastructure, utilizing three years of measurement data. We especially investigate the potential of DL models to maintain predictive precision during network outages by comparing global models, which have access to all variables within the sewer system, and local models, which are limited to data from a restricted set of local sensors. Our findings demonstrate that DL models can accurately predict the dynamics of sewer system load, even under network outage conditions. These results suggest that DL models can effectively aid in balancing the load redistribution in CSS, thereby enhancing the sustainability and resilience of urban infrastructures.</description>

      <title>Video-to-Text Pedestrian Monitoring (VTPM): Leveraging Computer Vision and Large Language Models for Privacy-Preserve Pedestrian Activity Monitoring at Intersections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computer vision has advanced research methodologies, enhancing system services across various fields. It is a core component in traffic monitoring systems for improving road safety; however, these monitoring systems don't preserve the privacy of pedestrians who appear in the videos, potentially revealing their identities. Addressing this issue, our paper introduces Video-to-Text Pedestrian Monitoring (VTPM), which monitors pedestrian movements at intersections and generates real-time textual reports, including traffic signal and weather information. VTPM uses computer vision models for pedestrian detection and tracking, achieving a latency of 0.05 seconds per video frame. Additionally, it detects crossing violations with 90.2% accuracy by incorporating traffic signal data. The proposed framework is equipped with Phi-3 mini-4k to generate real-time textual reports of pedestrian activity while stating safety concerns like crossing violations, conflicts, and the impact of weather on their behavior with latency of 0.33 seconds. To enhance comprehensive analysis of the generated textual reports, Phi-3 medium is fine-tuned for historical analysis of these generated textual reports. This fine-tuning enables more reliable analysis about the pedestrian safety at intersections, effectively detecting patterns and safety critical events. The proposed VTPM offers a more efficient alternative to video footage by using textual reports reducing memory usage, saving up to 253 million percent, eliminating privacy issues, and enabling comprehensive interactive historical analysis.</description>

      <title>CIPHER: Cybersecurity Intelligent Penetration-testing Helper for Ethical Researcher</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Penetration testing, a critical component of cybersecurity, typically requires extensive time and effort to find vulnerabilities. Beginners in this field often benefit from collaborative approaches with the community or experts. To address this, we develop CIPHER (Cybersecurity Intelligent Penetration-testing Helper for Ethical Researchers), a large language model specifically trained to assist in penetration testing tasks. We trained CIPHER using over 300 high-quality write-ups of vulnerable machines, hacking techniques, and documentation of open-source penetration testing tools. Additionally, we introduced the Findings, Action, Reasoning, and Results (FARR) Flow augmentation, a novel method to augment penetration testing write-ups to establish a fully automated pentesting simulation benchmark tailored for large language models. This approach fills a significant gap in traditional cybersecurity Q\&amp;A benchmarks and provides a realistic and rigorous standard for evaluating AI's technical knowledge, reasoning capabilities, and practical utility in dynamic penetration testing scenarios. In our assessments, CIPHER achieved the best overall performance in providing accurate suggestion responses compared to other open-source penetration testing models of similar size and even larger state-of-the-art models like Llama 3 70B and Qwen1.5 72B Chat, particularly on insane difficulty machine setups. This demonstrates that the current capabilities of general LLMs are insufficient for effectively guiding users through the penetration testing process. We also discuss the potential for improvement through scaling and the development of better benchmarks using FARR Flow augmentation results. Our benchmark will be released publicly at https://github.com/ibndias/CIPHER.</description>

      <title>5G NR PRACH Detection with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN): Overcoming Cell Interference Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel approach to interference detection in 5G New Radio (5G-NR) networks using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Interference in 5G networks challenges high-quality service due to dense user equipment deployment and increased wireless environment complexity. Our CNN-based model is designed to detect Physical Random Access Channel (PRACH) sequences amidst various interference scenarios, leveraging the spatial and temporal characteristics of PRACH signals to enhance detection accuracy and robustness. Comprehensive datasets of simulated PRACH signals under controlled interference conditions were generated to train and validate the model. Experimental results show that our CNN-based approach outperforms traditional PRACH detection methods in accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score. This study demonstrates the potential of AI/ML techniques in advancing interference management in 5G networks, providing a foundation for future research and practical applications in optimizing network performance and reliability.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Large Language Models for Enhancing the Understandability of Generated Unit Tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automated unit test generators, particularly search-based software testing tools like EvoSuite, are capable of generating tests with high coverage. Although these generators alleviate the burden of writing unit tests, they often pose challenges for software engineers in terms of understanding the generated tests. To address this, we introduce UTGen, which combines search-based software testing and large language models to enhance the understandability of automatically generated test cases. We achieve this enhancement through contextualizing test data, improving identifier naming, and adding descriptive comments. Through a controlled experiment with 32 participants from both academia and industry, we investigate how the understandability of unit tests affects a software engineer's ability to perform bug-fixing tasks. We selected bug-fixing to simulate a real-world scenario that emphasizes the importance of understandable test cases. We observe that participants working on assignments with UTGen test cases fix up to 33% more bugs and use up to 20% less time when compared to baseline test cases. From the post-test questionnaire, we gathered that participants found that enhanced test names, test data, and variable names improved their bug-fixing process.</description>

      <title>Iterative Object Count Optimization for Text-to-image Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address a persistent challenge in text-to-image models: accurately generating a specified number of objects. Current models, which learn from image-text pairs, inherently struggle with counting, as training data cannot depict every possible number of objects for any given object. To solve this, we propose optimizing the generated image based on a counting loss derived from a counting model that aggregates an object\'s potential. Employing an out-of-the-box counting model is challenging for two reasons: first, the model requires a scaling hyperparameter for the potential aggregation that varies depending on the viewpoint of the objects, and second, classifier guidance techniques require modified models that operate on noisy intermediate diffusion steps. To address these challenges, we propose an iterated online training mode that improves the accuracy of inferred images while altering the text conditioning embedding and dynamically adjusting hyperparameters. Our method offers three key advantages: (i) it can consider non-derivable counting techniques based on detection models, (ii) it is a zero-shot plug-and-play solution facilitating rapid changes to the counting techniques and image generation methods, and (iii) the optimized counting token can be reused to generate accurate images without additional optimization. We evaluate the generation of various objects and show significant improvements in accuracy. The project page is available at https://ozzafar.github.io/count_token.</description>

      <title>Efficient Detection of Toxic Prompts in Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and Gemini have significantly advanced natural language processing, enabling various applications such as chatbots and automated content generation. However, these models can be exploited by malicious individuals who craft toxic prompts to elicit harmful or unethical responses. These individuals often employ jailbreaking techniques to bypass safety mechanisms, highlighting the need for robust toxic prompt detection methods. Existing detection techniques, both blackbox and whitebox, face challenges related to the diversity of toxic prompts, scalability, and computational efficiency. In response, we propose ToxicDetector, a lightweight greybox method designed to efficiently detect toxic prompts in LLMs. ToxicDetector leverages LLMs to create toxic concept prompts, uses embedding vectors to form feature vectors, and employs a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) classifier for prompt classification. Our evaluation on various versions of the LLama models, Gemma-2, and multiple datasets demonstrates that ToxicDetector achieves a high accuracy of 96.39\% and a low false positive rate of 2.00\%, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, ToxicDetector's processing time of 0.0780 seconds per prompt makes it highly suitable for real-time applications. ToxicDetector achieves high accuracy, efficiency, and scalability, making it a practical method for toxic prompt detection in LLMs.</description>

      <title>CluMo: Cluster-based Modality Fusion Prompt for Continual Learning in Visual Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) have shown significant performance boost in various application domains. However, adopting them to deal with several sequentially encountered tasks has been challenging because finetuning a VLM on a task normally leads to reducing its generalization power and the capacity of learning new tasks as well as causing catastrophic forgetting on previously learned tasks. Enabling using VLMs in multimodal continual learning (CL) settings can help to address such scenarios. To improve generalization capacity and prevent catastrophic forgetting, we propose a novel prompt-based CL method for VLMs, namely $\textbf{Clu}$ster-based $\textbf{Mo}$dality Fusion Prompt (\textbf{CluMo}). We design a novel \textbf{Key-Key-Prompt} pair, where each prompt is associated with a visual prompt key and a textual prompt key. We adopt a two-stage training strategy. During the first stage, the single-modal keys are trained via $K$-means clustering algorithm to help select the best semantically matched prompt. During the second stage, the prompt keys are frozen, the selected prompt is attached to the input for training the VLM in the CL scenario. Experiments on two benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves SOTA performance.</description>

      <title>FocusLLM: Scaling LLM's Context by Parallel Decoding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Empowering LLMs with the ability to utilize useful information from a long context is crucial for many downstream applications. However, achieving long context lengths with the conventional transformer architecture requires substantial training and inference resources. In this paper, we present FocusLLM, a framework designed to extend the context length of any decoder-only LLM, enabling the model to focus on relevant information from very long sequences. FocusLLM processes long text inputs by dividing them into chunks based on the model's original context length to alleviate the issue of attention distraction. Then, it appends the local context to each chunk as a prompt to extract essential information from each chunk based on a novel parallel decoding mechanism, and ultimately integrates the extracted information into the local context. FocusLLM stands out for great training efficiency and versatility: trained with an 8K input length with much less training cost than previous methods, FocusLLM exhibits superior performance across downstream long-context tasks and maintains strong language modeling ability when handling extensive long texts, even up to 400K tokens. Our code is available at https://github.com/leezythu/FocusLLM.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Open-Vocab 3D Instance Segmentation methods (OV-3DIS) have recently demonstrated their ability to generalize to unseen objects. However, these methods still depend on predefined class names during testing, restricting the autonomy of agents. To mitigate this constraint, we propose a novel problem termed Open-Ended 3D Instance Segmentation (OE-3DIS), which eliminates the necessity for predefined class names during testing. Moreover, we contribute a comprehensive set of strong baselines, derived from OV-3DIS approaches and leveraging 2D Multimodal Large Language Models. To assess the performance of our OE-3DIS system, we introduce a novel Open-Ended score, evaluating both the semantic and geometric quality of predicted masks and their associated class names, alongside the standard AP score. Our approach demonstrates significant performance improvements over the baselines on the ScanNet200 and ScanNet++ datasets. Remarkably, our method surpasses the performance of Open3DIS, the current state-of-the-art method in OV-3DIS, even in the absence of ground-truth object class names.</description>

      <title>Improving the Scan-rescan Precision of AI-based CMR Biomarker Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantification of cardiac biomarkers from cine cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) data using deep learning (DL) methods offers many advantages, such as increased accuracy and faster analysis. However, only a few studies have focused on the scan-rescan precision of the biomarker estimates, which is important for reproducibility and longitudinal analysis. Here, we propose a cardiac biomarker estimation pipeline that not only focuses on achieving high segmentation accuracy but also on improving the scan-rescan precision of the computed biomarkers, namely left and right ventricular ejection fraction, and left ventricular myocardial mass. We evaluate two approaches to improve the apical-basal resolution of the segmentations used for estimating the biomarkers: one based on image interpolation and one based on segmentation interpolation. Using a database comprising scan-rescan cine CMR data acquired from 92 subjects, we compare the performance of these two methods against ground truth (GT) segmentations and DL segmentations obtained before interpolation (baseline). The results demonstrate that both the image-based and segmentation-based interpolation methods were able to narrow Bland-Altman scan-rescan confidence intervals for all biomarkers compared to the GT and baseline performances. Our findings highlight the importance of focusing not only on segmentation accuracy but also on the consistency of biomarkers across repeated scans, which is crucial for longitudinal analysis of cardiac function.</description>

      <title>SBDet: A Symmetry-Breaking Object Detector via Relaxed Rotation-Equivariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Introducing Group Equivariant Convolution (GConv) empowers models to explore symmetries hidden in visual data, improving their performance. However, in real-world scenarios, objects or scenes often exhibit perturbations of a symmetric system, specifically a deviation from a symmetric architecture, which can be characterized by a non-trivial action of a symmetry group, known as Symmetry-Breaking. Traditional GConv methods are limited by the strict operation rules in the group space, only ensuring features remain strictly equivariant under limited group transformations, making it difficult to adapt to Symmetry-Breaking or non-rigid transformations. Motivated by this, we introduce a novel Relaxed Rotation GConv (R2GConv) with our defined Relaxed Rotation-Equivariant group $\mathbf{R}_4$. Furthermore, we propose a Relaxed Rotation-Equivariant Network (R2Net) as the backbone and further develop the Symmetry-Breaking Object Detector (SBDet) for 2D object detection built upon it. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed R2GConv in natural image classification tasks, and SBDet achieves excellent performance in object detection tasks with improved generalization capabilities and robustness.</description>

      <title>D-RMGPT: Robot-assisted collaborative tasks driven by large multimodal models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collaborative robots are increasingly popular for assisting humans at work and daily tasks. However, designing and setting up interfaces for human-robot collaboration is challenging, requiring the integration of multiple components, from perception and robot task control to the hardware itself. Frequently, this leads to highly customized solutions that rely on large amounts of costly training data, diverging from the ideal of flexible and general interfaces that empower robots to perceive and adapt to unstructured environments where they can naturally collaborate with humans. To overcome these challenges, this paper presents the Detection-Robot Management GPT (D-RMGPT), a robot-assisted assembly planner based on Large Multimodal Models (LMM). This system can assist inexperienced operators in assembly tasks without requiring any markers or previous training. D-RMGPT is composed of DetGPT-V and R-ManGPT. DetGPT-V, based on GPT-4V(vision), perceives the surrounding environment through one-shot analysis of prompted images of the current assembly stage and the list of components to be assembled. It identifies which components have already been assembled by analysing their features and assembly requirements. R-ManGPT, based on GPT-4, plans the next component to be assembled and generates the robot's discrete actions to deliver it to the human co-worker. Experimental tests on assembling a toy aircraft demonstrated that D-RMGPT is flexible and intuitive to use, achieving an assembly success rate of 83% while reducing the assembly time for inexperienced operators by 33% compared to the manual process. http://robotics-and-ai.github.io/LMMmodels/</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Designing expressive generative models that support exact and efficient inference is a core question in probabilistic ML. Probabilistic circuits (PCs) offer a framework where this tractability-vs-expressiveness trade-off can be analyzed theoretically. Recently, squared PCs encoding subtractive mixtures via negative parameters have emerged as tractable models that can be exponentially more expressive than monotonic PCs, i.e., PCs with positive parameters only. In this paper, we provide a more precise theoretical characterization of the expressiveness relationships among these models. First, we prove that squared PCs can be less expressive than monotonic ones. Second, we formalize a novel class of PCs -- sum of squares PCs -- that can be exponentially more expressive than both squared and monotonic PCs. Around sum of squares PCs, we build an expressiveness hierarchy that allows us to precisely unify and separate different tractable model classes such as Born Machines and PSD models, and other recently introduced tractable probabilistic models by using complex parameters. Finally, we empirically show the effectiveness of sum of squares circuits in performing distribution estimation.</description>

      <title>Timeline and Boundary Guided Diffusion Network for Video Shadow Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Video Shadow Detection (VSD) aims to detect the shadow masks with frame sequence. Existing works suffer from inefficient temporal learning. Moreover, few works address the VSD problem by considering the characteristic (i.e., boundary) of shadow. Motivated by this, we propose a Timeline and Boundary Guided Diffusion (TBGDiff) network for VSD where we take account of the past-future temporal guidance and boundary information jointly. In detail, we design a Dual Scale Aggregation (DSA) module for better temporal understanding by rethinking the affinity of the long-term and short-term frames for the clipped video. Next, we introduce Shadow Boundary Aware Attention (SBAA) to utilize the edge contexts for capturing the characteristics of shadows. Moreover, we are the first to introduce the Diffusion model for VSD in which we explore a Space-Time Encoded Embedding (STEE) to inject the temporal guidance for Diffusion to conduct shadow detection. Benefiting from these designs, our model can not only capture the temporal information but also the shadow property. Extensive experiments show that the performance of our approach overtakes the state-of-the-art methods, verifying the effectiveness of our components. We release the codes, weights, and results at \url{https://github.com/haipengzhou856/TBGDiff}.</description>

Abstract: We present a comprehensive report on compressing the Llama 3.1 8B and Mistral NeMo 12B models to 4B and 8B parameters, respectively, using pruning and distillation. We explore two distinct pruning strategies: (1) depth pruning and (2) joint hidden/attention/MLP (width) pruning, and evaluate the results on common benchmarks from the LM Evaluation Harness. The models are then aligned with NeMo Aligner and tested in instruct-tuned versions. This approach produces a compelling 4B model from Llama 3.1 8B and a state-of-the-art Mistral-NeMo-Minitron-8B (MN-Minitron-8B for brevity) model from Mistral NeMo 12B. We found that with no access to the original data, it is beneficial to slightly fine-tune teacher models on the distillation dataset. We open-source our base model weights on Hugging Face with a permissive license.</description>

      <title>Approaching Deep Learning through the Spectral Dynamics of Weights</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an empirical approach centered on the spectral dynamics of weights -- the behavior of singular values and vectors during optimization -- to unify and clarify several phenomena in deep learning. We identify a consistent bias in optimization across various experiments, from small-scale ``grokking'' to large-scale tasks like image classification with ConvNets, image generation with UNets, speech recognition with LSTMs, and language modeling with Transformers. We also demonstrate that weight decay enhances this bias beyond its role as a norm regularizer, even in practical systems. Moreover, we show that these spectral dynamics distinguish memorizing networks from generalizing ones, offering a novel perspective on this longstanding conundrum. Additionally, we leverage spectral dynamics to explore the emergence of well-performing sparse subnetworks (lottery tickets) and the structure of the loss surface through linear mode connectivity. Our findings suggest that spectral dynamics provide a coherent framework to better understand the behavior of neural networks across diverse settings.</description>

      <title>Great Memory, Shallow Reasoning: Limits of $k$NN-LMs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: $K$-nearest neighbor language models ($k$NN-LMs), which integrate retrieval with next-word prediction, have demonstrated strong performance in language modeling as well as downstream NLP benchmarks. These results have led researchers to argue that models trained on poor quality or outdated data could perform well by employing a $k$NN extension that has access to a higher-quality datastore. In this work, we ask whether this improved ability to recall information really translates into downstream abilities. We extensively evaluate $k$NN-LMs on a diverse set of tasks, ranging from sentiment classification and commonsense reasoning to multi-hop reasoning. Results show that $k$NN-LMs excel at memory-intensive tasks, where utilizing the patterns in the input is sufficient for determining the output, but struggle with reasoning tasks that require integrating multiple pieces of information to derive new knowledge. We further demonstrate through oracle experiments and qualitative analysis that even with perfect retrieval, $k$NN-LMs still fail to determine the correct answers, placing an upper bound on their reasoning performance.

      <title>Efficient Exploration and Discriminative World Model Learning with an Object-Centric Abstraction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the face of difficult exploration problems in reinforcement learning, we study whether giving an agent an object-centric mapping (describing a set of items and their attributes) allow for more efficient learning. We found this problem is best solved hierarchically by modelling items at a higher level of state abstraction to pixels, and attribute change at a higher level of temporal abstraction to primitive actions. This abstraction simplifies the transition dynamic by making specific future states easier to predict. We make use of this to propose a fully model-based algorithm that learns a discriminative world model, plans to explore efficiently with only a count-based intrinsic reward, and can subsequently plan to reach any discovered (abstract) states.
  We demonstrate the model's ability to (i) efficiently solve single tasks, (ii) transfer zero-shot and few-shot across item types and environments, and (iii) plan across long horizons. Across a suite of 2D crafting and MiniHack environments, we empirically show our model significantly out-performs state-of-the-art low-level methods (without abstraction), as well as performant model-free and model-based methods using the same abstraction. Finally, we show how to reinforce learn low level object-perturbing policies, as well as supervise learn the object mapping itself.</description>

      <title>Proximal Policy Optimization with Graph Neural Networks for Optimal Power Flow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.12470v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optimal Power Flow (OPF) is a very traditional research area within the power systems field that seeks for the optimal operation point of electric power plants, and which needs to be solved every few minutes in real-world scenarios. However, due to the nonconvexities that arise in power generation systems, there is not yet a fast, robust solution technique for the full Alternating Current Optimal Power Flow (ACOPF). In the last decades, power grids have evolved into a typical dynamic, non-linear and large-scale control system, known as the power system, so searching for better and faster ACOPF solutions is becoming crucial. Appearance of Graph Neural Networks (GNN) has allowed the natural use of Machine Learning (ML) algorithms on graph data, such as power networks. On the other hand, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is known for its powerful capability to solve complex decision-making problems. Although solutions that use these two methods separately are beginning to appear in the literature, none has yet combined the advantages of both. We propose a novel architecture based on the Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm with Graph Neural Networks to solve the Optimal Power Flow. The objective is to design an architecture that learns how to solve the optimization problem and that is at the same time able to generalize to unseen scenarios. We compare our solution with the DCOPF in terms of cost after having trained our DRL agent on IEEE 30 bus system and then computing the OPF on that base network with topology changes</description>

      <title>Learning Complete Topology-Aware Correlations Between Relations for Inductive Link Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.11528v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inductive link prediction -- where entities during training and inference stages can be different -- has shown great potential for completing evolving knowledge graphs in an entity-independent manner. Many popular methods mainly focus on modeling graph-level features, while the edge-level interactions -- especially the semantic correlations between relations -- have been less explored. However, we notice a desirable property of semantic correlations between relations is that they are inherently edge-level and entity-independent. This implies the great potential of the semantic correlations for the entity-independent inductive link prediction task. Inspired by this observation, we propose a novel subgraph-based method, namely TACO, to model Topology-Aware COrrelations between relations that are highly correlated to their topological structures within subgraphs. Specifically, we prove that semantic correlations between any two relations can be categorized into seven topological patterns, and then proposes Relational Correlation Network (RCN) to learn the importance of each pattern. To further exploit the potential of RCN, we propose Complete Common Neighbor induced subgraph that can effectively preserve complete topological patterns within the subgraph. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TACO effectively unifies the graph-level information and edge-level interactions to jointly perform reasoning, leading to a superior performance over existing state-of-the-art methods for the inductive link prediction task.</description>

      <title>Corex: Pushing the Boundaries of Complex Reasoning through Multi-Model Collaboration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.00280v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are evolving at an unprecedented pace and have exhibited considerable capability in the realm of natural language processing (NLP) with world knowledge. Benefiting from ultra-large-scale training corpora, a single LLM can manage typical NLP tasks competently. However, its performance in executing reasoning tasks is still confined by the limitations of its internal representations. To push this boundary further, we introduce Corex in this paper, a suite of novel general-purpose strategies that transform LLMs into autonomous agents pioneering multi-model collaborations for complex task-solving. Inspired by human behaviors, Corex is constituted by diverse collaboration paradigms including Debate, Review, and Retrieve modes, which collectively work towards enhancing the factuality, faithfulness, and reliability of the reasoning process. These paradigms foster task-agnostic approaches that enable LLMs to ''think outside the box,'' thereby overcoming hallucinations and providing better solutions. Through extensive experiments across four different types of reasoning tasks, we demonstrate that orchestrating multiple LLMs to work in concert yields substantially better performance compared to existing methods. Further results and in-depth analysis demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of our method, facilitating collaboration among different LLMs and promoting annotation efficiency.</description>

      <title>A Roadmap to Pluralistic Alignment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05070v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With increased power and prevalence of AI systems, it is ever more critical that AI systems are designed to serve all, i.e., people with diverse values and perspectives. However, aligning models to serve pluralistic human values remains an open research question. In this piece, we propose a roadmap to pluralistic alignment, specifically using language models as a test bed. We identify and formalize three possible ways to define and operationalize pluralism in AI systems: 1) Overton pluralistic models that present a spectrum of reasonable responses; 2) Steerably pluralistic models that can steer to reflect certain perspectives; and 3) Distributionally pluralistic models that are well-calibrated to a given population in distribution. We also formalize and discuss three possible classes of pluralistic benchmarks: 1) Multi-objective benchmarks, 2) Trade-off steerable benchmarks, which incentivize models to steer to arbitrary trade-offs, and 3) Jury-pluralistic benchmarks which explicitly model diverse human ratings. We use this framework to argue that current alignment techniques may be fundamentally limited for pluralistic AI; indeed, we highlight empirical evidence, both from our own experiments and from other work, that standard alignment procedures might reduce distributional pluralism in models, motivating the need for further research on pluralistic alignment.</description>

      <title>UniMEL: A Unified Framework for Multimodal Entity Linking with Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16160v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multimodal Entity Linking (MEL) is a crucial task that aims at linking ambiguous mentions within multimodal contexts to the referent entities in a multimodal knowledge base, such as Wikipedia. Existing methods focus heavily on using complex mechanisms and extensive model tuning methods to model the multimodal interaction on specific datasets. However, these methods overcomplicate the MEL task and overlook the visual semantic information, which makes them costly and hard to scale. Moreover, these methods can not solve the issues like textual ambiguity, redundancy, and noisy images, which severely degrade their performance. Fortunately, the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) with robust capabilities in text understanding and reasoning, particularly Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) that can process multimodal inputs, provides new insights into addressing this challenge. However, how to design a universally applicable LLMs-based MEL approach remains a pressing challenge. To this end, we propose UniMEL, a unified framework which establishes a new paradigm to process multimodal entity linking tasks using LLMs. In this framework, we employ LLMs to augment the representation of mentions and entities individually by integrating textual and visual information and refining textual information. Subsequently, we employ the embedding-based method for retrieving and re-ranking candidate entities. Then, with only ~0.26% of the model parameters fine-tuned, LLMs can make the final selection from the candidate entities. Extensive experiments on three public benchmark datasets demonstrate that our solution achieves state-of-the-art performance, and ablation studies verify the effectiveness of all modules. Our code is available at https://github.com/Javkonline/UniMEL.</description>

      <title>Semantic Skill Grounding for Embodied Instruction-Following in Cross-Domain Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01024v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In embodied instruction-following (EIF), the integration of pretrained language models (LMs) as task planners emerges as a significant branch, where tasks are planned at the skill level by prompting LMs with pretrained skills and user instructions. However, grounding these pretrained skills in different domains remains challenging due to their intricate entanglement with the domain-specific knowledge. To address this challenge, we present a semantic skill grounding (SemGro) framework that leverages the hierarchical nature of semantic skills. SemGro recognizes the broad spectrum of these skills, ranging from short-horizon low-semantic skills that are universally applicable across domains to long-horizon rich-semantic skills that are highly specialized and tailored for particular domains. The framework employs an iterative skill decomposition approach, starting from the higher levels of semantic skill hierarchy and then moving downwards, so as to ground each planned skill to an executable level within the target domain. To do so, we use the reasoning capabilities of LMs for composing and decomposing semantic skills, as well as their multi-modal extension for assessing the skill feasibility in the target domain. Our experiments in the VirtualHome benchmark show the efficacy of SemGro in 300 cross-domain EIF scenarios.</description>

      <title>Query languages for neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10362v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We lay the foundations for a database-inspired approach to interpreting and understanding neural network models by querying them using declarative languages. Towards this end we study different query languages, based on first-order logic, that mainly differ in their access to the neural network model. First-order logic over the reals naturally yields a language which views the network as a black box; only the input--output function defined by the network can be queried. This is essentially the approach of constraint query languages. On the other hand, a white-box language can be obtained by viewing the network as a weighted graph, and extending first-order logic with summation over weight terms. The latter approach is essentially an abstraction of SQL. In general, the two approaches are incomparable in expressive power, as we will show. Under natural circumstances, however, the white-box approach can subsume the black-box approach; this is our main result. We prove the result concretely for linear constraint queries over real functions definable by feedforward neural networks with a fixed number of hidden layers and piecewise linear activation functions.</description>

      <title>Flexora: Flexible Low Rank Adaptation for Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10774v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are driving advancements in artificial intelligence by increasing the scale of model parameters, which has significantly enhanced generalization ability and unlocked new capabilities in practice. However, their performance in specific downstream tasks is usually hindered by their knowledge boundaries on these tasks. Thus, fine-tuning techniques, especially the widely used Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) method, have been introduced to expand the boundaries on these tasks, whereas LoRA would underperform on certain tasks owing to its potential overfitting on these tasks. To overcome this overfitting and improve the performance of LoRA, we propose the flexible low rank adaptation (Flexora) method to automatically and flexibly select the most important layers needing to be fine-tuned to achieve the best performance on different downstream tasks. Specifically, Flexora firstly frames this layer selection problem as a well-defined hyperparameter optimization (HPO) problem, then addresses it using the unrolled differentiation (UD) method, and finally selects the most useful layers based on the optimized hyperparameters. Our extensive experiments on many pretrained models and natural language tasks show that Flexora is able to consistently improve over the existing baselines, indicating the effectiveness of our Flexora in practice. We additionally provide insightful theoretical results and many ablation studies to deliver a comprehensive understanding of our Flexora.</description>

Abstract: The problem of anticipating human actions is an inherently uncertain one. However, we can reduce this uncertainty if we have a sense of the goal that the actor is trying to achieve. Here, we present an action anticipation model that leverages goal information for the purpose of reducing the uncertainty in future predictions. Since we do not possess goal information or the observed actions during inference, we resort to visual representation to encapsulate information about both actions and goals. Through this, we derive a novel concept called abstract goal which is conditioned on observed sequences of visual features for action anticipation. We design the abstract goal as a distribution whose parameters are estimated using a variational recurrent network. We sample multiple candidates for the next action and introduce a goal consistency measure to determine the best candidate that follows from the abstract goal. Our method obtains impressive results on the very challenging Epic-Kitchens55 (EK55), EK100, and EGTEA Gaze+ datasets. We obtain absolute improvements of +13.69, +11.24, and +5.19 for Top-1 verb, Top-1 noun, and Top-1 action anticipation accuracy respectively over prior state-of-the-art methods for seen kitchens (S1) of EK55. Similarly, we also obtain significant improvements in the unseen kitchens (S2) set for Top-1 verb (+10.75), noun (+5.84) and action (+2.87) anticipation. Similar trend is observed for EGTEA Gaze+ dataset, where absolute improvement of +9.9, +13.1 and +6.8 is obtained for noun, verb, and action anticipation. It is through the submission of this paper that our method is currently the new state-of-the-art for action anticipation in EK55 and EGTEA Gaze+ https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/20071#results Code available at https://github.com/debadityaroy/Abstract_Goal</description>

      <title>A Human Word Association based model for topic detection in social networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.13066v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the widespread use of social networks, detecting the topics discussed on these platforms has become a significant challenge. Current approaches primarily rely on frequent pattern mining or semantic relations, often neglecting the structure of the language. Language structural methods aim to discover the relationships between words and how humans understand them. Therefore, this paper introduces a topic detection framework for social networks based on the concept of imitating the mental ability of word association. This framework employs the Human Word Association method and includes a specially designed extraction algorithm. The performance of this method is evaluated using the FA-CUP dataset, a benchmark in the field of topic detection. The results indicate that the proposed method significantly improves topic detection compared to other methods, as evidenced by Topic-recall and the keyword F1 measure. Additionally, to assess the applicability and generalizability of the proposed method, a dataset of Telegram posts in the Persian language is used. The results demonstrate that this method outperforms other topic detection methods.</description>

      <title>Interpretable Deep Learning for Forecasting Online Advertising Costs: Insights from the Competitive Bidding Landscape</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.05762v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As advertisers increasingly shift their budgets toward digital advertising, accurately forecasting advertising costs becomes essential for optimizing marketing campaign returns. This paper presents a comprehensive study that employs various time-series forecasting methods to predict daily average CPC in the online advertising market. We evaluate the performance of statistical models, machine learning techniques, and deep learning approaches, including the Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT). Our findings reveal that incorporating multivariate models, enriched with covariates derived from competitors' CPC patterns through time-series clustering, significantly improves forecasting accuracy. We interpret the results by analyzing feature importance and temporal attention, demonstrating how the models leverage both the advertiser's data and insights from the competitive landscape. Additionally, our method proves robust during major market shifts, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, consistently outperforming models that rely solely on individual advertisers' data. This study introduces a scalable technique for selecting relevant covariates from a broad pool of advertisers, offering more accurate long-term forecasts and strategic insights into budget allocation and competitive dynamics in digital advertising.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.19183v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Relationships among time series can be exploited as inductive biases in learning effective forecasting models. In hierarchical time series, relationships among subsets of sequences induce hard constraints (hierarchical inductive biases) on the predicted values. In this paper, we propose a graph-based methodology to unify relational and hierarchical inductive biases in the context of deep learning for time series forecasting. In particular, we model both types of relationships as dependencies in a pyramidal graph structure, with each pyramidal layer corresponding to a level of the hierarchy. By exploiting modern - trainable - graph pooling operators we show that the hierarchical structure, if not available as a prior, can be learned directly from data, thus obtaining cluster assignments aligned with the forecasting objective. A differentiable reconciliation stage is incorporated into the processing architecture, allowing hierarchical constraints to act both as an architectural bias as well as a regularization element for predictions. Simulation results on representative datasets show that the proposed method compares favorably against the state of the art.</description>

Abstract: Recent strides in Large Language Models (LLMs) have saturated many Natural Language Processing (NLP) benchmarks, emphasizing the need for more challenging ones to properly assess LLM capabilities. However, domain-specific and multilingual benchmarks are rare because they require in-depth expertise to develop. Still, most public models are trained predominantly on English corpora, while other languages remain understudied, particularly for practical domain-specific NLP tasks. In this work, we introduce a novel NLP benchmark for the legal domain that challenges LLMs in five key dimensions: processing \emph{long documents} (up to 50K tokens), using \emph{domain-specific knowledge} (embodied in legal texts), \emph{multilingual} understanding (covering five languages), \emph{multitasking} (comprising legal document-to-document Information Retrieval, Court View Generation, Leading Decision Summarization, Citation Extraction, and eight challenging Text Classification tasks) and \emph{reasoning} (comprising especially Court View Generation, but also the Text Classification tasks). Our benchmark contains diverse datasets from the Swiss legal system, allowing for a comprehensive study of the underlying non-English, inherently multilingual legal system. Despite the large size of our datasets (some with hundreds of thousands of examples), existing publicly available multilingual models struggle with most tasks, even after extensive in-domain pre-training and fine-tuning. We publish all resources (benchmark suite, pre-trained models, code) under permissive open CC BY-SA licenses.</description>

      <title>2-Level Reinforcement Learning for Ships on Inland Waterways: Path Planning and Following</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.16769v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a realistic modularized framework for controlling autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) on inland waterways (IWs) based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL). The framework improves operational safety and comprises two levels: a high-level local path planning (LPP) unit and a low-level path following (PF) unit, each consisting of a DRL agent. The LPP agent is responsible for planning a path under consideration of dynamic vessels, closing a gap in the current research landscape. In addition, the LPP agent adequately considers traffic rules and the geometry of the waterway. We thereby introduce a novel application of a spatial-temporal recurrent neural network architecture to continuous action spaces. The LPP agent outperforms a state-of-the-art artificial potential field (APF) method by increasing the minimum distance to other vessels by 65% on average. The PF agent performs low-level actuator control while accounting for shallow water influences and the environmental forces winds, waves, and currents. Compared with a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller, the PF agent yields only 61% of the mean cross-track error (MCTE) while significantly reducing control effort (CE) in terms of the required absolute rudder angle. Lastly, both agents are jointly validated in simulation, employing the lower Elbe in northern Germany as an example case and using real automatic identification system (AIS) trajectories to model the behavior of other ships.</description>

      <title>ML-Bench: Evaluating Large Language Models and Agents for Machine Learning Tasks on Repository-Level Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09835v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 achieving impressive results in function-level code generation, they struggle with repository-scale code understanding (e.g., coming up with the right arguments for calling routines), requiring a deeper comprehension of complex file interactions. Also, recently, people have developed LLM agents that attempt to interact with repository code (e.g., compiling and evaluating its execution), prompting the need to evaluate their performance. These gaps have motivated our development of ML-Bench, a benchmark rooted in real-world programming applications that leverage existing code repositories to perform tasks. Addressing the need for LLMs to interpret long code contexts and translate instructions into precise, executable scripts, ML-Bench encompasses annotated 9,641 examples across 18 GitHub repositories, challenging LLMs to accommodate user-specified arguments and documentation intricacies effectively. To evaluate both LLMs and AI agents, two setups are employed: ML-LLM-Bench for assessing LLMs' text-to-code conversion within a predefined deployment environment, and ML-Agent-Bench for testing autonomous agents in an end-to-end task execution within a Linux sandbox environment. Our findings indicate that while GPT-4o leads with a Pass@5 rate surpassing 50%, there remains significant scope for improvement, highlighted by issues such as hallucinated outputs and difficulties with bash script generation. Notably, in the more demanding ML-Agent-Bench, GPT-4o achieves a 76.47% success rate, reflecting the efficacy of iterative action and feedback in complex task resolution. Our code, dataset, and models are available at https://github.com/gersteinlab/ML-bench.</description>

      <title>Edge AI as a Service with Coordinated Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00631v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) applications continue to expand in next-generation networks, there is a growing need for deep neural network (DNN) models. Although DNN models deployed at the edge are promising for providing AI as a service with low latency, their cooperation is yet to be explored. In this paper, we consider that DNN service providers share their computing resources as well as their models' parameters and allow other DNNs to offload their computations without mirroring. We propose a novel algorithm called coordinated DNNs on edge (\textbf{CoDE}) that facilitates coordination among DNN services by establishing new inference paths. CoDE aims to find the optimal path, which is the path with the highest possible reward, by creating multi-task DNNs from individual models. The reward reflects the inference throughput and model accuracy. With CoDE, DNN models can make new paths for inference by using their own or other models' parameters. We then evaluate the performance of CoDE through numerical experiments. The results demonstrate a $40\%$ increase in the inference throughput while degrading the average accuracy by only $2.3\%$. Experiments show that CoDE enhances the inference throughput and, achieves higher precision compared to a state-of-the-art existing method.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models in Mental Health Care: a Scoping Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.02984v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) in mental health care is an emerging field. There is a need to systematically review the application outcomes and delineate the advantages and limitations in clinical settings. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the use of LLMs in mental health care, assessing their efficacy, challenges, and potential for future applications. A systematic search was conducted across multiple databases including PubMed, Web of Science, Google Scholar, arXiv, medRxiv, and PsyArXiv in November 2023. All forms of original research, peer-reviewed or not, published or disseminated between October 1, 2019, and December 2, 2023, are included without language restrictions if they used LLMs developed after T5 and directly addressed research questions in mental health care settings. From an initial pool of 313 articles, 34 met the inclusion criteria based on their relevance to LLM application in mental health care and the robustness of reported outcomes. Diverse applications of LLMs in mental health care are identified, including diagnosis, therapy, patient engagement enhancement, etc. Key challenges include data availability and reliability, nuanced handling of mental states, and effective evaluation methods. Despite successes in accuracy and accessibility improvement, gaps in clinical applicability and ethical considerations were evident, pointing to the need for robust data, standardized evaluations, and interdisciplinary collaboration. LLMs hold substantial promise for enhancing mental health care. For their full potential to be realized, emphasis must be placed on developing robust datasets, development and evaluation frameworks, ethical guidelines, and interdisciplinary collaborations to address current limitations.</description>

      <title>Universal Time-Series Representation Learning: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03717v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time-series data exists in every corner of real-world systems and services, ranging from satellites in the sky to wearable devices on human bodies. Learning representations by extracting and inferring valuable information from these time series is crucial for understanding the complex dynamics of particular phenomena and enabling informed decisions. With the learned representations, we can perform numerous downstream analyses more effectively. Among several approaches, deep learning has demonstrated remarkable performance in extracting hidden patterns and features from time-series data without manual feature engineering. This survey first presents a novel taxonomy based on three fundamental elements in designing state-of-the-art universal representation learning methods for time series. According to the proposed taxonomy, we comprehensively review existing studies and discuss their intuitions and insights into how these methods enhance the quality of learned representations. Finally, as a guideline for future studies, we summarize commonly used experimental setups and datasets and discuss several promising research directions. An up-to-date corresponding resource is available at https://github.com/itouchz/awesome-deep-time-series-representations.</description>

      <title>Towards End-to-End GPS Localization with Neural Pseudorange Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10685v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The pseudorange error is one of the root causes of localization inaccuracy in GPS. Previous data-driven methods regress and eliminate pseudorange errors using handcrafted intermediate labels. Unlike them, we propose an end-to-end GPS localization framework, E2E-PrNet, to train a neural network for pseudorange correction (PrNet) directly using the final task loss calculated with the ground truth of GPS receiver states. The gradients of the loss with respect to learnable parameters are backpropagated through a Differentiable Nonlinear Least Squares (DNLS) optimizer to PrNet. The feasibility of fusing the data-driven neural network and the model-based DNLS module is verified with GPS data collected by Android phones, showing that E2E-PrNet outperforms the baseline weighted least squares method and the state-of-the-art end-to-end data-driven approach. Finally, we discuss the explainability of E2E-PrNet.</description>

      <title>Copilot-in-the-Loop: Fixing Code Smells in Copilot-Generated Python Code using Copilot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14176v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As one of the most popular dynamic languages, Python experiences a decrease in readability and maintainability when code smells are present. Recent advancements in Large Language Models have sparked growing interest in AI-enabled tools for both code generation and refactoring. GitHub Copilot is one such tool that has gained widespread usage. Copilot Chat, released in September 2023, functions as an interactive tool aimed at facilitating natural language-powered coding. However, limited attention has been given to understanding code smells in Copilot-generated Python code and Copilot Chat's ability to fix the code smells. To this end, we built a dataset comprising 102 code smells in Copilot-generated Python code. Our aim is to first explore the occurrence of code smells in Copilot-generated Python code and then evaluate the effectiveness of Copilot Chat in fixing these code smells employing different prompts. The results show that 8 out of 10 types of code smells can be detected in Copilot-generated Python code, among which Multiply-Nested Container is the most common one. For these code smells, Copilot Chat achieves a highest fixing rate of 87.1%, showing promise in fixing Python code smells generated by Copilot itself. In addition, the effectiveness of Copilot Chat in fixing these smells can be improved by providing more detailed prompts.</description>

      <title>Clarify: Improving Model Robustness With Natural Language Corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03715v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The standard way to teach models is by feeding them lots of data. However, this approach often teaches models incorrect ideas because they pick up on misleading signals in the data. To prevent such misconceptions, we must necessarily provide additional information beyond the training data. Prior methods incorporate additional instance-level supervision, such as labels for misleading features or additional labels for debiased data. However, such strategies require a large amount of labeler effort. We hypothesize that people are good at providing textual feedback at the concept level, a capability that existing teaching frameworks do not leverage. We propose Clarify, a novel interface and method for interactively correcting model misconceptions. Through Clarify, users need only provide a short text description of a model's consistent failure patterns. Then, in an entirely automated way, we use such descriptions to improve the training process. Clarify is the first end-to-end system for user model correction. Our user studies show that non-expert users can successfully describe model misconceptions via Clarify, leading to increased worst-case performance in two datasets. We additionally conduct a case study on a large-scale image dataset, ImageNet, using Clarify to find and rectify 31 novel hard subpopulations.</description>

      <title>Persona-DB: Efficient Large Language Model Personalization for Response Prediction with Collaborative Data Refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11060v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The increasing demand for personalized interactions with large language models (LLMs) calls for methodologies capable of accurately and efficiently identifying user opinions and preferences. Retrieval augmentation emerges as an effective strategy, as it can accommodate a vast number of users without the costs from fine-tuning. Existing research, however, has largely focused on enhancing the retrieval stage and devoted limited exploration toward optimizing the representation of the database, a crucial aspect for tasks such as personalization. In this work, we examine the problem from a novel angle, focusing on how data can be better represented for more data-efficient retrieval in the context of LLM customization. To tackle this challenge, we introduce Persona-DB, a simple yet effective framework consisting of a hierarchical construction process to improve generalization across task contexts and collaborative refinement to effectively bridge knowledge gaps among users. In the evaluation of response prediction, Persona-DB demonstrates superior context efficiency in maintaining accuracy with a significantly reduced retrieval size, a critical advantage in scenarios with extensive histories or limited context windows. Our experiments also indicate a marked improvement of over 10% under cold-start scenarios, when users have extremely sparse data. Furthermore, our analysis reveals the increasing importance of collaborative knowledge as the retrieval capacity expands.</description>

      <title>ComTraQ-MPC: Meta-Trained DQN-MPC Integration for Trajectory Tracking with Limited Active Localization Updates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01564v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optimal decision-making for trajectory tracking in partially observable, stochastic environments where the number of active localization updates -- the process by which the agent obtains its true state information from the sensors -- are limited, presents a significant challenge. Traditional methods often struggle to balance resource conservation, accurate state estimation and precise tracking, resulting in suboptimal performance. This problem is particularly pronounced in environments with large action spaces, where the need for frequent, accurate state data is paramount, yet the capacity for active localization updates is restricted by external limitations. This paper introduces ComTraQ-MPC, a novel framework that combines Deep Q-Networks (DQN) and Model Predictive Control (MPC) to optimize trajectory tracking with constrained active localization updates. The meta-trained DQN ensures adaptive active localization scheduling, while the MPC leverages available state information to improve tracking. The central contribution of this work is their reciprocal interaction: DQN's update decisions inform MPC's control strategy, and MPC's outcomes refine DQN's learning, creating a cohesive, adaptive system. Empirical evaluations in simulated and real-world settings demonstrate that ComTraQ-MPC significantly enhances operational efficiency and accuracy, providing a generalizable and approximately optimal solution for trajectory tracking in complex partially observable environments.</description>

      <title>DiffuMatting: Synthesizing Arbitrary Objects with Matting-level Annotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06168v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Due to the difficulty and labor-consuming nature of getting highly accurate or matting annotations, there only exists a limited amount of highly accurate labels available to the public. To tackle this challenge, we propose a DiffuMatting which inherits the strong Everything generation ability of diffusion and endows the power of "matting anything". Our DiffuMatting can 1). act as an anything matting factory with high accurate annotations 2). be well-compatible with community LoRAs or various conditional control approaches to achieve the community-friendly art design and controllable generation. Specifically, inspired by green-screen-matting, we aim to teach the diffusion model to paint on a fixed green screen canvas. To this end, a large-scale greenscreen dataset (Green100K) is collected as a training dataset for DiffuMatting. Secondly, a green background control loss is proposed to keep the drawing board as a pure green color to distinguish the foreground and background. To ensure the synthesized object has more edge details, a detailed-enhancement of transition boundary loss is proposed as a guideline to generate objects with more complicated edge structures. Aiming to simultaneously generate the object and its matting annotation, we build a matting head to make a green color removal in the latent space of the VAE decoder. Our DiffuMatting shows several potential applications (e.g., matting-data generator, community-friendly art design and controllable generation). As a matting-data generator, DiffuMatting synthesizes general object and portrait matting sets, effectively reducing the relative MSE error by 15.4% in General Object Matting and 11.4% in Portrait Matting tasks. The dataset is released in our project page at \url{https://diffumatting.github.io}.</description>

      <title>PhD: A Prompted Visual Hallucination Evaluation Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11116v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) hallucinate, resulting in an emerging topic of visual hallucination evaluation (VHE). We introduce in this paper PhD, a large-scale benchmark for VHE. The essence of VHE is to ask an MLLM the right questions concerning a specific image. Depending on what to ask (objects, attributes, sentiment, etc.) and how the questions are asked, we structure PhD along two dimensions, i.e. task and mode. Five visual recognition tasks, ranging from low-level (object / attribute recognition) to middle-level (sentiment / position recognition and counting), are considered. Besides a normal visual QA mode, which we term VHE-base, PhD also asks questions with inaccurate context (VHE-iac) or with incorrect context (VHE-icc), or with AI-generated counter common sense images (VHE-ccs). We construct PhD by a ChatGPT-assisted semi-automated pipeline, encompassing four pivotal modules: task-specific hallucinatory element (hitem) selection, hitem-embedded question generation, inaccurate / incorrect context generation, and CCS image generation. With over 102k VQA triplets in total, PhD reveals considerable variability in MLLMs' performance across various modes, offering valuable insights into the nature of hallucination issues. As such, PhD stands as a potent tool not only for VHE but may also play a significant role in the refinement of MLLMs.</description>

      <title>LLM3:Large Language Model-based Task and Motion Planning with Motion Failure Reasoning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11552v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conventional Task and Motion Planning (TAMP) approaches rely on manually crafted interfaces connecting symbolic task planning with continuous motion generation. These domain-specific and labor-intensive modules are limited in addressing emerging tasks in real-world settings. Here, we present LLM^3, a novel Large Language Model (LLM)-based TAMP framework featuring a domain-independent interface. Specifically, we leverage the powerful reasoning and planning capabilities of pre-trained LLMs to propose symbolic action sequences and select continuous action parameters for motion planning. Crucially, LLM^3 incorporates motion planning feedback through prompting, allowing the LLM to iteratively refine its proposals by reasoning about motion failure. Consequently, LLM^3 interfaces between task planning and motion planning, alleviating the intricate design process of handling domain-specific messages between them. Through a series of simulations in a box-packing domain, we quantitatively demonstrate the effectiveness of LLM^3 in solving TAMP problems and the efficiency in selecting action parameters. Ablation studies underscore the significant contribution of motion failure reasoning to the success of LLM^3. Furthermore, we conduct qualitative experiments on a physical manipulator, demonstrating the practical applicability of our approach in real-world settings.</description>

      <title>Empowering LLMs with Pseudo-Untrimmed Videos for Audio-Visual Temporal Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16276v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language and multimodal domains. By fine-tuning multimodal LLMs with temporal annotations from well-annotated datasets, e.g., dense video captioning datasets, their temporal understanding capacity in video-language tasks can be obtained. However, there is a notable lack of untrimmed audio-visual video datasets with precise temporal annotations for events. This deficiency hinders LLMs from learning the alignment between time, audio-visual events, and text tokens, thus impairing their ability to temporally localize audio-visual events in videos. To address this gap, we introduce PU-VALOR, a comprehensive audio-visual dataset comprising over 114,000 pseudo-untrimmed videos with detailed temporal annotations. PU-VALOR is derived from the large-scale but coarse-annotated audio-visual dataset VALOR, through a subtle method involving event-based video clustering, random temporal scaling, and permutation. By fine-tuning a multimodal LLM on PU-VALOR, we developed AVicuna, a model capable of aligning audio-visual events with temporal intervals and corresponding text tokens. AVicuna excels in temporal localization and time-aware dialogue capabilities. Our experiments demonstrate that AVicuna effectively handles temporal understanding in audio-visual videos and achieves state-of-the-art performance on open-ended video QA, audio-visual QA, and audio-visual event dense localization tasks.</description>

      <title>Self-Supervised Visual Preference Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10501v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper makes the first attempt towards unsupervised preference alignment in Vision-Language Models (VLMs). We generate chosen and rejected responses with regard to the original and augmented image pairs, and conduct preference alignment with direct preference optimization. It is based on a core idea: properly designed augmentation to the image input will induce VLM to generate false but hard negative responses, which helps the model to learn from and produce more robust and powerful answers. The whole pipeline no longer hinges on supervision from GPT-4 or human involvement during alignment, and is highly efficient with few lines of code. With only 8k randomly sampled unsupervised data, it achieves 90\% relative score to GPT-4 on complex reasoning in LLaVA-Bench, and improves LLaVA-7B/13B by 6.7\%/5.6\% score on complex multi-modal benchmark MM-Vet. Visualizations shows its improved ability to align with user-intentions. A series of ablations are firmly conducted to reveal the latent mechanism of the approach, which also indicates its potential towards further scaling.

      <title>Bias and Unfairness in Information Retrieval Systems: New Challenges in the LLM Era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11457v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the rapid advancements of large language models (LLMs), information retrieval (IR) systems, such as search engines and recommender systems, have undergone a significant paradigm shift. This evolution, while heralding new opportunities, introduces emerging challenges, particularly in terms of biases and unfairness, which may threaten the information ecosystem. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of existing works on emerging and pressing bias and unfairness issues in IR systems when the integration of LLMs. We first unify bias and unfairness issues as distribution mismatch problems, providing a groundwork for categorizing various mitigation strategies through distribution alignment. Subsequently, we systematically delve into the specific bias and unfairness issues arising from three critical stages of LLMs integration into IR systems: data collection, model development, and result evaluation. In doing so, we meticulously review and analyze recent literature, focusing on the definitions, characteristics, and corresponding mitigation strategies associated with these issues. Finally, we identify and highlight some open problems and challenges for future work, aiming to inspire researchers and stakeholders in the IR field and beyond to better understand and mitigate bias and unfairness issues of IR in this LLM era. We also consistently maintain a GitHub repository for the relevant papers and resources in this rising direction at https://github.com/KID-22/LLM-IR-Bias-Fairness-Survey.</description>

      <title>V2Xum-LLM: Cross-Modal Video Summarization with Temporal Prompt Instruction Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12353v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Video summarization aims to create short, accurate, and cohesive summaries of longer videos. Despite the existence of various video summarization datasets, a notable limitation is their limited amount of source videos, which hampers the effective training of advanced large vision-language models (VLMs). Additionally, most existing datasets are created for video-to-video summarization, overlooking the contemporary need for multimodal video content summarization. Recent efforts have been made to expand from unimodal to multimodal video summarization, categorizing the task into three sub-tasks based on the summary's modality: video-to-video (V2V), video-to-text (V2T), and a combination of video and text summarization (V2VT). However, the textual summaries in previous multimodal datasets are inadequate. To address these issues, we introduce Instruct-V2Xum, a cross-modal video summarization dataset featuring 30,000 diverse videos sourced from YouTube, with lengths ranging from 40 to 940 seconds and an average summarization ratio of 16.39%. Each video summary in Instruct-V2Xum is paired with a textual summary that references specific frame indexes, facilitating the generation of aligned video and textual summaries. In addition, we propose a new video summarization framework named V2Xum-LLM. V2Xum-LLM, specifically V2Xum-LLaMA in this study, is the first framework that unifies different video summarization tasks into one large language model's (LLM) text decoder and achieves task-controllable video summarization with temporal prompts and task instructions. Experiments show that V2Xum-LLaMA outperforms strong baseline models on multiple video summarization tasks. Furthermore, we propose an enhanced evaluation metric for V2V and V2VT summarization tasks.</description>

      <title>Federated Learning for Collaborative Inference Systems: The Case of Early Exit Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04249v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As Internet of Things (IoT) technology advances, end devices like sensors and smartphones are progressively equipped with AI models tailored to their local memory and computational constraints. Local inference reduces communication costs and latency; however, these smaller models typically underperform compared to more sophisticated models deployed on edge servers or in the cloud. Cooperative Inference Systems (CISs) address this performance trade-off by enabling smaller devices to offload part of their inference tasks to more capable devices. These systems often deploy hierarchical models that share numerous parameters, exemplified by Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) that utilize strategies like early exits or ordered dropout. In such instances, Federated Learning (FL) may be employed to jointly train the models within a CIS. Yet, traditional training methods have overlooked the operational dynamics of CISs during inference, particularly the potential high heterogeneity in serving rates across clients. To address this gap, we propose a novel FL approach designed explicitly for use in CISs that accounts for these variations in serving rates. Our framework not only offers rigorous theoretical guarantees, but also surpasses state-of-the-art (SOTA) training algorithms for CISs, especially in scenarios where inference request rates or data availability are uneven among clients.</description>

      <title>Learning Partially Aligned Item Representation for Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12473v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cross-domain sequential recommendation (CDSR) aims to uncover and transfer users' sequential preferences across multiple recommendation domains. While significant endeavors have been made, they primarily concentrated on developing advanced transfer modules and aligning user representations using self-supervised learning techniques. However, the problem of aligning item representations has received limited attention, and misaligned item representations can potentially lead to sub-optimal sequential modeling and user representation alignment. To this end, we propose a model-agnostic framework called \textbf{C}ross-domain item representation \textbf{A}lignment for \textbf{C}ross-\textbf{D}omain \textbf{S}equential \textbf{R}ecommendation (\textbf{CA-CDSR}), which achieves sequence-aware generation and adaptively partial alignment for item representations. Specifically, we first develop a sequence-aware feature augmentation strategy, which captures both collaborative and sequential item correlations, thus facilitating holistic item representation generation. Next, we conduct an empirical study to investigate the partial representation alignment problem from a spectrum perspective. It motivates us to devise an adaptive spectrum filter, achieving partial alignment adaptively. Furthermore, the aligned item representations can be fed into different sequential encoders to obtain user representations. The entire framework is optimized in a multi-task learning paradigm with an annealing strategy. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that CA-CDSR can surpass state-of-the-art baselines by a significant margin and can effectively align items in representation spaces to enhance performance.</description>

      <title>PrivCirNet: Efficient Private Inference via Block Circulant Transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14569v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Homomorphic encryption (HE)-based deep neural network (DNN) inference protects data and model privacy but suffers from significant computation overhead. We observe transforming the DNN weights into circulant matrices converts general matrix-vector multiplications into HE-friendly 1-dimensional convolutions, drastically reducing the HE computation cost. Hence, in this paper, we propose \method, a protocol/network co-optimization framework based on block circulant transformation. At the protocol level, PrivCirNet customizes the HE encoding algorithm that is fully compatible with the block circulant transformation and reduces the computation latency in proportion to the block size. At the network level, we propose a latency-aware formulation to search for the layer-wise block size assignment based on second-order information. PrivCirNet also leverages layer fusion to further reduce the inference cost. We compare PrivCirNet with the state-of-the-art HE-based framework Bolt (IEEE S\&amp;P 2024) and the HE-friendly pruning method SpENCNN (ICML 2023). For ResNet-18 and Vision Transformer (ViT) on Tiny ImageNet, PrivCirNet reduces latency by $5.0\times$ and $1.3\times$ with iso-accuracy over Bolt, respectively, and improves accuracy by $4.1\%$ and $12\%$ over SpENCNN, respectively. For MobileNetV2 on ImageNet, PrivCirNet achieves $1.7\times$ lower latency and $4.2\%$ better accuracy over Bolt and SpENCNN, respectively. Our code and checkpoints are available on Git Hub.</description>

      <title>OV-DQUO: Open-Vocabulary DETR with Denoising Text Query Training and Open-World Unknown Objects Supervision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17913v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Open-vocabulary detection aims to detect objects from novel categories beyond the base categories on which the detector is trained. However, existing open-vocabulary detectors trained on base category data tend to assign higher confidence to trained categories and confuse novel categories with the background. To resolve this, we propose OV-DQUO, an \textbf{O}pen-\textbf{V}ocabulary DETR with \textbf{D}enoising text \textbf{Q}uery training and open-world \textbf{U}nknown \textbf{O}bjects supervision. Specifically, we introduce a wildcard matching method. This method enables the detector to learn from pairs of unknown objects recognized by the open-world detector and text embeddings with general semantics, mitigating the confidence bias between base and novel categories. Additionally, we propose a denoising text query training strategy. It synthesizes foreground and background query-box pairs from open-world unknown objects to train the detector through contrastive learning, enhancing its ability to distinguish novel objects from the background. We conducted extensive experiments on the challenging OV-COCO and OV-LVIS benchmarks, achieving new state-of-the-art results of 45.6 AP50 and 39.3 mAP on novel categories respectively, without the need for additional training data.

      <title>Medical MLLM is Vulnerable: Cross-Modality Jailbreak and Mismatched Attacks on Medical Multimodal Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20775v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Security concerns related to Large Language Models (LLMs) have been extensively explored, yet the safety implications for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), particularly in medical contexts (MedMLLMs), remain insufficiently studied. This paper delves into the underexplored security vulnerabilities of MedMLLMs, especially when deployed in clinical environments where the accuracy and relevance of question-and-answer interactions are critically tested against complex medical challenges. By combining existing clinical medical data with atypical natural phenomena, we define the mismatched malicious attack (2M-attack) and introduce its optimized version, known as the optimized mismatched malicious attack (O2M-attack or 2M-optimization). Using the voluminous 3MAD dataset that we construct, which covers a wide range of medical image modalities and harmful medical scenarios, we conduct a comprehensive analysis and propose the MCM optimization method, which significantly enhances the attack success rate on MedMLLMs. Evaluations with this dataset and attack methods, including white-box attacks on LLaVA-Med and transfer attacks (black-box) on four other SOTA models, indicate that even MedMLLMs designed with enhanced security features remain vulnerable to security breaches. Our work underscores the urgent need for a concerted effort to implement robust security measures and enhance the safety and efficacy of open-source MedMLLMs, particularly given the potential severity of jailbreak attacks and other malicious or clinically significant exploits in medical settings. Our code is available at https://github.com/dirtycomputer/O2M_attack.</description>

      <title>An Analysis under a Unified Fomulation of Learning Algorithms with Output Constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01647v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural networks (NN) perform well in diverse tasks, but sometimes produce nonsensical results to humans. Most NN models "solely" learn from (input, output) pairs, occasionally conflicting with human knowledge. Many studies indicate injecting human knowledge by reducing output constraints during training can improve model performance and reduce constraint violations. While there have been several attempts to compare different existing algorithms under the same programming framework, nonetheless, there has been no previous work that categorizes learning algorithms with output constraints in a unified manner. Our contributions are as follows: (1) We categorize the previous studies based on three axes: type of constraint loss used (e.g. probabilistic soft logic, REINFORCE), exploration strategy of constraint-violating examples, and integration mechanism of learning signals from main task and constraint. (2) We propose new algorithms to integrate the information of main task and constraint injection, inspired by continual-learning algorithms. (3) Furthermore, we propose the $H\beta$-score as a metric for considering the main task metric and constraint violation simultaneously. To provide a thorough analysis, we examine all the algorithms on three NLP tasks: natural language inference (NLI), synthetic transduction examples (STE), and semantic role labeling (SRL). We explore and reveal the key factors of various algorithms associated with achieving high $H\beta$-scores.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05036v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time series forecasting has become an increasingly popular research area due to its critical applications in various real-world domains such as traffic management, weather prediction, and financial analysis. Despite significant advancements, existing models face notable challenges, including the necessity of manual hyperparameter tuning for different datasets, and difficulty in effectively distinguishing signal from redundant features in data characterized by strong seasonality. These issues hinder the generalization and practical application of time series forecasting models. To solve this issues, we propose an innovative time series forecasting model TimeSieve designed to address these challenges. Our approach employs wavelet transforms to preprocess time series data, effectively capturing multi-scale features without the need for additional parameters or manual hyperparameter tuning. Additionally, we introduce the information bottleneck theory that filters out redundant features from both detail and approximation coefficients, retaining only the most predictive information. This combination reduces significantly improves the model's accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on 70% of the datasets, achieving higher predictive accuracy and better generalization across diverse datasets. Our results validate the effectiveness of our approach in addressing the key challenges in time series forecasting, paving the way for more reliable and efficient predictive models in practical applications. The code for our model is available at https://github.com/xll0328/TimeSieve.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05590v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are being deployed across various domains today. However, their capacity to solve Capture the Flag (CTF) challenges in cybersecurity has not been thoroughly evaluated. To address this, we develop a novel method to assess LLMs in solving CTF challenges by creating a scalable, open-source benchmark database specifically designed for these applications. This database includes metadata for LLM testing and adaptive learning, compiling a diverse range of CTF challenges from popular competitions. Utilizing the advanced function calling capabilities of LLMs, we build a fully automated system with an enhanced workflow and support for external tool calls. Our benchmark dataset and automated framework allow us to evaluate the performance of five LLMs, encompassing both black-box and open-source models. This work lays the foundation for future research into improving the efficiency of LLMs in interactive cybersecurity tasks and automated task planning. By providing a specialized dataset, our project offers an ideal platform for developing, testing, and refining LLM-based approaches to vulnerability detection and resolution. Evaluating LLMs on these challenges and comparing with human performance yields insights into their potential for AI-driven cybersecurity solutions to perform real-world threat management. We make our dataset open source to public https://github.com/NYU-LLM-CTF/LLM_CTF_Database along with our playground automated framework https://github.com/NYU-LLM-CTF/llm_ctf_automation.</description>

Abstract: We present a logic based interpretable model for learning on graphs and an algorithm to distill this model from a Graph Neural Network (GNN). Recent results have shown connections between the expressivity of GNNs and the two-variable fragment of first-order logic with counting quantifiers (C2). We introduce a decision-tree based model which leverages an extension of C2 to distill interpretable logical classifiers from GNNs. We test our approach on multiple GNN architectures. The distilled models are interpretable, succinct, and attain similar accuracy to the underlying GNN. Furthermore, when the ground truth is expressible in C2, our approach outperforms the GNN.</description>

      <title>VulDetectBench: Evaluating the Deep Capability of Vulnerability Detection with Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07595v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have training corpora containing large amounts of program code, greatly improving the model's code comprehension and generation capabilities. However, sound comprehensive research on detecting program vulnerabilities, a more specific task related to code, and evaluating the performance of LLMs in this more specialized scenario is still lacking. To address common challenges in vulnerability analysis, our study introduces a new benchmark, VulDetectBench, specifically designed to assess the vulnerability detection capabilities of LLMs. The benchmark comprehensively evaluates LLM's ability to identify, classify, and locate vulnerabilities through five tasks of increasing difficulty. We evaluate the performance of 17 models (both open- and closed-source) and find that while existing models can achieve over 80% accuracy on tasks related to vulnerability identification and classification, they still fall short on specific, more detailed vulnerability analysis tasks, with less than 30% accuracy, making it difficult to provide valuable auxiliary information for professional vulnerability mining. Our benchmark effectively evaluates the capabilities of various LLMs at different levels in the specific task of vulnerability detection, providing a foundation for future research and improvements in this critical area of code security. VulDetectBench is publicly available at https://github.com/Sweetaroo/VulDetectBench.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11105v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is crucial for deploying robust machine learning models, especially in areas where security is critical. However, traditional OOD detection methods often fail to capture complex data distributions from large scale date. In this paper, we present a novel approach for OOD detection that leverages the generative ability of diffusion models and the powerful feature extraction capabilities of CLIP. By using these features as conditional inputs to a diffusion model, we can reconstruct the images after encoding them with CLIP. The difference between the original and reconstructed images is used as a signal for OOD identification. The practicality and scalability of our method is increased by the fact that it does not require class-specific labeled ID data, as is the case with many other methods. Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrates the robustness and effectiveness of our method, which have significantly improved the detection accuracy.</description>

      <title>SHIELD: Evaluation and Defense Strategies for Copyright Compliance in LLM Text Generation</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed machine learning but raised significant legal concerns due to their potential to produce text that infringes on copyrights, resulting in several high-profile lawsuits. The legal landscape is struggling to keep pace with these rapid advancements, with ongoing debates about whether generated text might plagiarize copyrighted materials. Current LLMs may infringe on copyrights or overly restrict non-copyrighted texts, leading to these challenges: (i) the need for a comprehensive evaluation benchmark to assess copyright compliance from multiple aspects; (ii) evaluating robustness against safeguard bypassing attacks; and (iii) developing effective defense targeted against the generation of copyrighted text. To tackle these challenges, we introduce a curated dataset to evaluate methods, test attack strategies, and propose lightweight, real-time defense to prevent the generation of copyrighted text, ensuring the safe and lawful use of LLMs. Our experiments demonstrate that current LLMs frequently output copyrighted text, and that jailbreaking attacks can significantly increase the volume of copyrighted output. Our proposed defense mechanism significantly reduces the volume of copyrighted text generated by LLMs by effectively refusing malicious requests.

      <title>Articulatory Encodec: Coding Speech through Vocal Tract Kinematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12998v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vocal tract articulation is a natural, grounded control space of speech production. The spatiotemporal coordination of articulators combined with the vocal source shapes intelligible speech sounds to enable effective spoken communication. Based on this physiological grounding of speech, we propose a new framework of neural encoding-decoding of speech -- Articulatory Encodec. Articulatory Encodec comprises an articulatory analysis model that infers articulatory features from speech audio, and an articulatory synthesis model that synthesizes speech audio from articulatory features. The articulatory features are kinematic traces of vocal tract articulators and source features, which are intuitively interpretable and controllable, being the actual physical interface of speech production. An additional speaker identity encoder is jointly trained with the articulatory synthesizer to inform the voice texture of individual speakers. By training on large-scale speech data, we achieve a fully intelligible, high-quality articulatory synthesizer that generalizes to unseen speakers. Furthermore, the speaker embedding is effectively disentangled from articulations, which enables accent-perserving zero-shot voice conversion. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of universal, high-performance articulatory inference and synthesis, suggesting the proposed framework as a powerful coding system of speech.</description>

      <title>FairX: A comprehensive benchmarking tool for model analysis using fairness, utility, and explainability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14281v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present FairX, an open-source Python-based benchmarking tool designed for the comprehensive analysis of models under the umbrella of fairness, utility, and eXplainability (XAI). FairX enables users to train benchmarking bias-removal models and evaluate their fairness using a wide array of fairness metrics, data utility metrics, and generate explanations for model predictions, all within a unified framework. Existing benchmarking tools do not have the way to evaluate synthetic data generated from fair generative models, also they do not have the support for training fair generative models either. In FairX, we add fair generative models in the collection of our fair-model library (pre-processing, in-processing, post-processing) and evaluation metrics for evaluating the quality of synthetic fair data. This version of FairX supports both tabular and image datasets. It also allows users to provide their own custom datasets. The open-source FairX benchmarking package is publicly available at https://github.com/fahim-sikder/FairX.</description>

      <title>TabSketchFM: Sketch-based Tabular Representation Learning for Data Discovery over Data Lakes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01619v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Enterprises have a growing need to identify relevant tables in data lakes; e.g. tables that are unionable, joinable, or subsets of each other. Tabular neural models can be helpful for such data discovery tasks. In this paper, we present TabSketchFM, a neural tabular model for data discovery over data lakes. First, we propose novel pre-training: a sketch-based approach to enhance the effectiveness of data discovery in neural tabular models. Second, we finetune the pretrained model for identifying unionable, joinable, and subset table pairs and show significant improvement over previous tabular neural models. Third, we present a detailed ablation study to highlight which sketches are crucial for which tasks. Fourth, we use these finetuned models to perform table search; i.e., given a query table, find other tables in a corpus that are unionable, joinable, or that are subsets of the query. Our results demonstrate significant improvements in F1 scores for search compared to state-of-the-art techniques. Finally, we show significant transfer across datasets and tasks establishing that our model can generalize across different tasks and over different data lakes.</description>

      <title>Addressing a fundamental limitation in deep vision models: lack of spatial attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01782v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The primary aim of this manuscript is to underscore a significant limitation in current deep learning models, particularly vision models. Unlike human vision, which efficiently selects only the essential visual areas for further processing, leading to high speed and low energy consumption, deep vision models process the entire image. In this work, we examine this issue from a broader perspective and propose a solution that could pave the way for the next generation of more efficient vision models. Basically, convolution and pooling operations are selectively applied to altered regions, with a change map sent to subsequent layers. This map indicates which computations need to be repeated. The code is available at https://github.com/aliborji/spatial_attention.</description>

      <title>Understanding is Compression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07723v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern data compression methods are slowly reaching their limits after 80 years of research, millions of papers, and wide range of applications. Yet, the extravagant 6G communication speed requirement raises a major open question for revolutionary new ideas of data compression.
  We have previously shown all understanding or learning are compression, under reasonable assumptions. Large language models (LLMs) understand data better than ever before. Can they help us to compress data?
  The LLMs may be seen to approximate the uncomputable Solomonoff induction. Therefore, under this new uncomputable paradigm, we present LMCompress. LMCompress shatters all previous lossless compression algorithms, doubling the lossless compression ratios of JPEG-XL for images, FLAC for audios, and H.264 for videos, and quadrupling the compression ratio of bz2 for texts. The better a large model understands the data, the better LMCompress compresses.</description>

      <title>ContextualStory: Consistent Visual Storytelling with Spatially-Enhanced and Storyline Context</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09774v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Visual storytelling involves generating a sequence of coherent frames from a textual storyline while maintaining consistency in characters and scenes. Existing autoregressive methods, which rely on previous frame-sentence pairs, struggle with high memory usage, slow generation speeds, and limited context integration. To address these issues, we propose ContextualStory, a novel framework designed to generate coherent story frames and extend frames for story continuation. ContextualStory utilizes Spatially-Enhanced Temporal Attention to capture spatial and temporal dependencies, handling significant character movements effectively. Additionally, we introduces a Storyline Contextualizer to enrich context in storyline embedding and a StoryFlow Adapter to measure scene changes between frames for guiding model. Extensive experiments on PororoSV and FlintstonesSV benchmarks demonstrate that ContextualStory significantly outperforms existing methods in both story visualization and story continuation.</description>

      <title>AdapTable: Test-Time Adaptation for Tabular Data via Shift-Aware Uncertainty Calibrator and Label Distribution Handler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10784v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In real-world applications, tabular data often suffer from distribution shifts due to their widespread and abundant nature, leading to erroneous predictions of pre-trained machine learning models. However, addressing such distribution shifts in the tabular domain has been relatively underexplored due to unique challenges such as varying attributes and dataset sizes, as well as the limited representation learning capabilities of deep learning models for tabular data. Particularly, with the recent promising paradigm of test-time adaptation (TTA), where we adapt the off-the-shelf model to the unlabeled target domain during the inference phase without accessing the source domain, we observe that directly adopting commonly used TTA methods from other domains often leads to model collapse. We systematically explore challenges in tabular data test-time adaptation, including skewed entropy, complex latent space decision boundaries, confidence calibration issues with both overconfident and under-confident, and model bias towards source label distributions along with class imbalances. Based on these insights, we introduce AdapTable, a novel tabular test-time adaptation method that directly modifies output probabilities by estimating target label distributions and adjusting initial probabilities based on calibrated uncertainty. Extensive experiments on both natural distribution shifts and synthetic corruptions demonstrate the adaptation efficacy of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the Efficacy of Foundational Models: Advancing Benchmarking Practices to Enhance Fine-Tuning Decision-Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11006v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have expanded into various domains. However, there remains a need to evaluate how these models perform when prompted with commonplace queries compared to domain-specific queries, which may be useful for benchmarking prior to fine-tuning for domain-specific downstream tasks. This study evaluates LLMs, specifically Gemma-2B and Gemma-7B, across diverse domains, including cybersecurity, medicine, and finance, compared to common knowledge queries. This study utilizes a comprehensive methodology to assess foundational models, which includes problem formulation, data analysis, and the development of ThroughCut, a novel outlier detection technique that automatically identifies response throughput outliers based on their conciseness. This methodological rigor enhances the credibility of the presented evaluation frameworks. This study focused on assessing inference time, response length, throughput, quality, and resource utilization and investigated the correlations between these factors. The results indicate that model size and types of prompts used for inference significantly influenced response length and quality. In addition, common prompts, which include various types of queries, generate diverse and inconsistent responses at irregular intervals. In contrast, domain-specific prompts consistently generate concise responses within a reasonable time. Overall, this study underscores the need for comprehensive evaluation frameworks to enhance the reliability of benchmarking procedures in multidomain AI research.</description>

      <title>Investigating Imperceptibility of Adversarial Attacks on Tabular Data: An Empirical Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11463v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Adversarial attacks are a potential threat to machine learning models by causing incorrect predictions through imperceptible perturbations to the input data. While these attacks have been extensively studied in unstructured data like images, applying them to tabular data, poses new challenges. These challenges arise from the inherent heterogeneity and complex feature interdependencies in tabular data, which differ from the image data. To account for this distinction, it is necessary to establish tailored imperceptibility criteria specific to tabular data. However, there is currently a lack of standardised metrics for assessing the imperceptibility of adversarial attacks on tabular data. To address this gap, we propose a set of key properties and corresponding metrics designed to comprehensively characterise imperceptible adversarial attacks on tabular data. These are: proximity to the original input, sparsity of altered features, deviation from the original data distribution, sensitivity in perturbing features with narrow distribution, immutability of certain features that should remain unchanged, feasibility of specific feature values that should not go beyond valid practical ranges, and feature interdependencies capturing complex relationships between data attributes. We evaluate the imperceptibility of five adversarial attacks, including both bounded attacks and unbounded attacks, on tabular data using the proposed imperceptibility metrics. The results reveal a trade-off between the imperceptibility and effectiveness of these attacks. The study also identifies limitations in current attack algorithms, offering insights that can guide future research in the area. The findings gained from this empirical analysis provide valuable direction for enhancing the design of adversarial attack algorithms, thereby advancing adversarial machine learning on tabular data.</description>

      <title>SOAP: Enhancing Spatio-Temporal Relation and Motion Information Capturing for Few-Shot Action Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16344v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High frame-rate (HFR) videos of action recognition improve fine-grained expression while reducing the spatio-temporal relation and motion information density. Thus, large amounts of video samples are continuously required for traditional data-driven training. However, samples are not always sufficient in real-world scenarios, promoting few-shot action recognition (FSAR) research. We observe that most recent FSAR works build spatio-temporal relation of video samples via temporal alignment after spatial feature extraction, cutting apart spatial and temporal features within samples. They also capture motion information via narrow perspectives between adjacent frames without considering density, leading to insufficient motion information capturing. Therefore, we propose a novel plug-and-play architecture for FSAR called Spatio-tempOral frAme tuPle enhancer (SOAP) in this paper. The model we designed with such architecture refers to SOAP-Net. Temporal connections between different feature channels and spatio-temporal relation of features are considered instead of simple feature extraction. Comprehensive motion information is also captured, using frame tuples with multiple frames containing more motion information than adjacent frames. Combining frame tuples of diverse frame counts further provides a broader perspective. SOAP-Net achieves new state-of-the-art performance across well-known benchmarks such as SthSthV2, Kinetics, UCF101, and HMDB51. Extensive empirical evaluations underscore the competitiveness, pluggability, generalization, and robustness of SOAP. The code is released at https://github.com/wenbohuang1002/SOAP.</description>

      <title>TAGIFY: LLM-powered Tagging Interface for Improved Data Findability on OGD portals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18764v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efforts directed towards promoting Open Government Data (OGD) have gained significant traction across various governmental tiers since the mid-2000s. As more datasets are published on OGD portals, finding specific data becomes harder, leading to information overload. Complete and accurate documentation of datasets, including association of proper tags with datasets is key to improving dataset findability and accessibility. Analysis conducted on the Estonian Open Data Portal, revealed that 11% datasets have no associated tags, while 26% had only one tag assigned to them, which underscores challenges in data findability and accessibility within the portal, which, according to the recent Open Data Maturity Report, is considered trend-setter. The aim of this study is to propose an automated solution to tagging datasets to improve data findability on OGD portals. This paper presents Tagify - a prototype of tagging interface that employs large language models (LLM) such as GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4 to automate dataset tagging, generating tags for datasets in English and Estonian, thereby augmenting metadata preparation by data publishers and improving data findability on OGD portals by data users. The developed solution was evaluated by users and their feedback was collected to define an agenda for future prototype improvements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19345v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose selective debiasing -- an inference-time safety mechanism that aims to increase the overall quality of models in terms of prediction performance and fairness in the situation when re-training a model is prohibitive. The method is inspired by selective prediction, where some predictions that are considered low quality are discarded at inference time. In our approach, we identify the potentially biased model predictions and, instead of discarding them, we debias them using LEACE -- a post-processing debiasing method. To select problematic predictions, we propose a bias quantification approach based on KL divergence, which achieves better results than standard UQ methods. Experiments with text classification datasets demonstrate that selective debiasing helps to close the performance gap between post-processing methods and at-training and pre-processing debiasing techniques.</description>

      <title>ML-Mamba: Efficient Multi-Modal Large Language Model Utilizing Mamba-2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19832v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have attracted much attention for their multifunctionality. However, traditional Transformer architectures incur significant overhead due to their secondary computational complexity. To address this issue, we introduce ML-Mamba, a multimodal language model, which utilizes the latest and efficient Mamba-2 model for inference. Mamba-2 is known for its linear scalability and fast processing of long sequences. We replace the Transformer-based backbone with a pre-trained Mamba-2 model and explore methods for integrating 2D visual selective scanning mechanisms into multimodal learning while also trying various visual encoders and Mamba-2 model variants. Our extensive experiments in various multimodal benchmark tests demonstrate the competitive performance of ML-Mamba and highlight the potential of state space models in multimodal tasks. The experimental results show that: (1) we empirically explore how to effectively apply the 2D vision selective scan mechanism for multimodal learning. We propose a novel multimodal connector called the Mamba-2 Scan Connector (MSC), which enhances representational capabilities. (2) ML-Mamba achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods such as TinyLaVA and MobileVLM v2 through its linear sequential modeling while faster inference speed; (3) Compared to multimodal models utilizing Mamba-1, the Mamba-2-based ML-Mamba exhibits superior inference performance and effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Gender, Race, and Intersectional Bias in Resume Screening via Language Model Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20371v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) hiring tools have revolutionized resume screening, and large language models (LLMs) have the potential to do the same. However, given the biases which are embedded within LLMs, it is unclear whether they can be used in this scenario without disadvantaging groups based on their protected attributes. In this work, we investigate the possibilities of using LLMs in a resume screening setting via a document retrieval framework that simulates job candidate selection. Using that framework, we then perform a resume audit study to determine whether a selection of Massive Text Embedding (MTE) models are biased in resume screening scenarios. We simulate this for nine occupations, using a collection of over 500 publicly available resumes and 500 job descriptions. We find that the MTEs are biased, significantly favoring White-associated names in 85.1\% of cases and female-associated names in only 11.1\% of cases, with a minority of cases showing no statistically significant differences. Further analyses show that Black males are disadvantaged in up to 100\% of cases, replicating real-world patterns of bias in employment settings, and validate three hypotheses of intersectionality. We also find an impact of document length as well as the corpus frequency of names in the selection of resumes. These findings have implications for widely used AI tools that are automating employment, fairness, and tech policy.</description>

      <title>Multi-Grained Query-Guided Set Prediction Network for Grounded Multimodal Named Entity Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21033v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Grounded Multimodal Named Entity Recognition (GMNER) is an emerging information extraction (IE) task, aiming to simultaneously extract entity spans, types, and corresponding visual regions of entities from given sentence-image pairs data. Recent unified methods employing machine reading comprehension or sequence generation-based frameworks show limitations in this difficult task. The former, utilizing human-designed queries, struggles to differentiate ambiguous entities, such as Jordan (Person) and off-White x Jordan (Shoes). The latter, following the one-by-one decoding order, suffers from exposure bias issues. We maintain that these works misunderstand the relationships of multimodal entities. To tackle these, we propose a novel unified framework named Multi-grained Query-guided Set Prediction Network (MQSPN) to learn appropriate relationships at intra-entity and inter-entity levels. Specifically, MQSPN consists of a Multi-grained Query Set (MQS) and a Multimodal Set Prediction Network (MSP). MQS explicitly aligns entity regions with entity spans by employing a set of learnable queries to strengthen intra-entity connections. Based on distinct intra-entity modeling, MSP reformulates GMNER as a set prediction, guiding models to establish appropriate inter-entity relationships from a global matching perspective. Additionally, we incorporate a query-guided Fusion Net (QFNet) to work as a glue network between MQS and MSP. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performances in widely used benchmarks.</description>

      <title>GNN-SKAN: Harnessing the Power of SwallowKAN to Advance Molecular Representation Learning with GNNs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01018v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Effective molecular representation learning is crucial for advancing molecular property prediction and drug design. Mainstream molecular representation learning approaches are based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). However, these approaches struggle with three significant challenges: insufficient annotations, molecular diversity, and architectural limitations such as over-squashing, which leads to the loss of critical structural details. To address these challenges, we introduce a new class of GNNs that integrates the Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), known for their robust data-fitting capabilities and high accuracy in small-scale AI + Science tasks. By incorporating KANs into GNNs, our model enhances the representation of molecular structures. We further advance this approach with a variant called SwallowKAN (SKAN), which employs adaptive Radial Basis Functions (RBFs) as the core of the non-linear neurons. This innovation improves both computational efficiency and adaptability to diverse molecular structures. Building on the strengths of SKAN, we propose a new class of GNNs, GNN-SKAN, and its augmented variant, GNN-SKAN+, which incorporates a SKAN-based classifier to further boost performance. To our knowledge, this is the first work to integrate KANs into GNN architectures tailored for molecular representation learning. Experiments across 6 classification datasets, 6 regression datasets, and 4 few-shot learning datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves new state-of-the-art performance in terms of accuracy and computational cost.</description>

      <title>PowerPM: Foundation Model for Power Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04057v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The emergence of abundant electricity time series (ETS) data provides ample opportunities for various applications in the power systems, including demand-side management, grid stability, and consumer behavior analysis. Deep learning models have advanced ETS modeling by effectively capturing sequence dependence. Nevertheless, learning a generic representation of ETS data for various applications remains challenging due to the inherently complex hierarchical structure of ETS data. Moreover, ETS data exhibits intricate temporal dependencies and is suscepti ble to the influence of exogenous variables. Furthermore, different instances exhibit diverse electricity consumption behavior. In this paper, we propose a foundation model PowerPM to model ETS data, providing a large-scale, off-the-shelf model for power systems. PowerPM consists of a temporal encoder and a hierarchical encoder. The temporal encoder captures both temporal dependencies in ETS data, considering exogenous variables. The hierarchical encoder models the correlation between hierarchy. Furthermore, PowerPM leverages a novel self-supervised pretraining framework consisting of masked ETS modeling and dual-view contrastive learning, which enable PowerPM to capture temporal dependency within ETS windows and aware the discrepancy across ETS windows, providing two different perspectives to learn generic representation. Our experiments involve five real world scenario datasets, comprising private and public data. Through pre-training on massive ETS data, PowerPM achieves SOTA performance on diverse downstream tasks within the private dataset. Impressively, when transferred to the public datasets, PowerPM maintains its superiority, showcasing its remarkable generalization ability across various tasks and domains. Moreover, ablation studies, few-shot experiments provide additional evidence of the effectiveness of our model.</description>

      <title>Large Model Strategic Thinking, Small Model Efficiency: Transferring Theory of Mind in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05241v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As the performance of larger, newer Large Language Models continues to improve for strategic Theory of Mind (ToM) tasks, the demand for these state-of-the-art models increases commensurately. However, their deployment is costly both in terms of processing power and time. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of creating smaller, highly-performing specialized algorithms by way of fine-tuning. To do this, we first present a large pre-trained model with 20 unique scenarios that combine different social contexts with games of varying social dilemmas, record its answers, and use them for Q&amp;A fine-tuning on a smaller model of the same family. Our focus is on in-context game-theoretic decision-making, the same domain within which human interaction occurs and that requires both a theory of mind (or a semblance thereof) and an understanding of social dynamics. The smaller model is therefore trained not just on the answers provided, but also on the motivations provided by the larger model, which should contain advice and guidelines to navigate both strategic dilemmas and social cues. We find that the fine-tuned smaller language model consistently bridged the gap in performance between the smaller pre-trained version of the model and its larger relative and that its improvements extended in areas and contexts beyond the ones provided in the training examples, including on out-of-sample scenarios that include completely different game structures. On average for all games, through fine-tuning, the smaller model showed a 46% improvement measured as alignment towards the behavior of the larger model, with 100% representing indistinguishable behavior. When presented with out-of-sample social contexts and games, the fine-tuned model still displays remarkable levels of alignment, reaching an improvement of 18% and 28% respectively.</description>

      <title>Freehand Sketch Generation from Mechanical Components</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05966v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Drawing freehand sketches of mechanical components on multimedia devices for AI-based engineering modeling has become a new trend. However, its development is being impeded because existing works cannot produce suitable sketches for data-driven research. These works either generate sketches lacking a freehand style or utilize generative models not originally designed for this task resulting in poor effectiveness. To address this issue, we design a two-stage generative framework mimicking the human sketching behavior pattern, called MSFormer, which is the first time to produce humanoid freehand sketches tailored for mechanical components. The first stage employs Open CASCADE technology to obtain multi-view contour sketches from mechanical components, filtering perturbing signals for the ensuing generation process. Meanwhile, we design a view selector to simulate viewpoint selection tasks during human sketching for picking out information-rich sketches. The second stage translates contour sketches into freehand sketches by a transformer-based generator. To retain essential modeling features as much as possible and rationalize stroke distribution, we introduce a novel edge-constraint stroke initialization. Furthermore, we utilize a CLIP vision encoder and a new loss function incorporating the Hausdorff distance to enhance the generalizability and robustness of the model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance for generating freehand sketches in the mechanical domain.

      <title>Node Level Graph Autoencoder: Unified Pretraining for Textual Graph Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07091v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Textual graphs are ubiquitous in real-world applications, featuring rich text information with complex relationships, which enables advanced research across various fields. Textual graph representation learning aims to generate low-dimensional feature embeddings from textual graphs that can improve the performance of downstream tasks. A high-quality feature embedding should effectively capture both the structural and the textual information in a textual graph. However, most textual graph dataset benchmarks rely on word2vec techniques to generate feature embeddings, which inherently limits their capabilities. Recent works on textual graph representation learning can be categorized into two folds: supervised and unsupervised methods. Supervised methods finetune a language model on labeled nodes, which have limited capabilities when labeled data is scarce. Unsupervised methods, on the other hand, extract feature embeddings by developing complex training pipelines. To address these limitations, we propose a novel unified unsupervised learning autoencoder framework, named Node Level Graph AutoEncoder (NodeGAE). We employ language models as the backbone of the autoencoder, with pretraining on text reconstruction. Additionally, we add an auxiliary loss term to make the feature embeddings aware of the local graph structure. Our method maintains simplicity in the training process and demonstrates generalizability across diverse textual graphs and downstream tasks. We evaluate our method on two core graph representation learning downstream tasks: node classification and link prediction. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our approach substantially enhances the performance of diverse graph neural networks (GNNs) across multiple textual graph datasets.</description>

Abstract: Model merging is an efficient empowerment technique in the machine learning community that does not require the collection of raw training data and does not require expensive computation. As model merging becomes increasingly prevalent across various fields, it is crucial to understand the available model merging techniques comprehensively. However, there is a significant gap in the literature regarding a systematic and thorough review of these techniques. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of model merging methods and theories, their applications in various domains and settings, and future research directions. Specifically, we first propose a new taxonomic approach that exhaustively discusses existing model merging methods. Secondly, we discuss the application of model merging techniques in large language models, multimodal large language models, and 10+ machine learning subfields, including continual learning, multi-task learning, few-shot learning, etc. Finally, we highlight the remaining challenges of model merging and discuss future research directions. A comprehensive list of papers about model merging is available at \url{https://github.com/EnnengYang/Awesome-Model-Merging-Methods-Theories-Applications}.</description>

Abstract: In Business Process Management (BPM), effectively comprehending process models is crucial yet poses significant challenges, particularly as organizations scale and processes become more complex. This paper introduces a novel framework utilizing the advanced capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance the interpretability of complex process models. We present different methods for abstracting business process models into a format accessible to LLMs, and we implement advanced prompting strategies specifically designed to optimize LLM performance within our framework. Additionally, we present a tool, AIPA, that implements our proposed framework and allows for conversational process querying. We evaluate our framework and tool by i) an automatic evaluation comparing different LLMs, model abstractions, and prompting strategies and ii) a user study designed to assess AIPA's effectiveness comprehensively. Results demonstrate our framework's ability to improve the accessibility and interpretability of process models, pioneering new pathways for integrating AI technologies into the BPM field.</description>

      <title>Selective Prompt Anchoring for Code Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09121v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) such as Copilot and ChatGPT have transformed software development by automating coding tasks. Despite these advancements, challenges remain in reducing error rates and fully meeting user expectations. Our empirical study reveals LLMs tend to dilute their self-attention on the initial prompt as more code tokens are generated. We hypothesize this self-attention dilution issue is one of the root causes of inaccuracies in LLM-generated code. To mitigate this issue, we propose Selective Prompt Anchoring (SPA). SPA amplifies the influence of the selected parts in the initial prompt, which we refer to as ``anchored text'', during code generation. Specifically, SPA calculates the logit distribution difference with and without the anchored text. We prove this difference approximates the anchored text's contextual contribution to the output logits. SPA creates an augmented logit distribution by linearly combining the original logit distribution and the logit difference. We evaluate SPA with five LLMs on four benchmarks. Our results demonstrate that using SPA can consistently improve Pass@1 rates by up to 9.7% in all settings. Notably, with selective text anchoring, a small version of DeepSeek-Coder (6.7B) can achieve better performance than an original much larger version (33B). Our code is available at https://github.com/magic-YuanTian/Selective-Prompt-Anchoring.</description>

      <title>Recognizing Beam Profiles from Silicon Photonics Gratings using Transformer Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10287v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Over the past decade, there has been extensive work in developing integrated silicon photonics (SiPh) gratings for the optical addressing of trapped ion qubits in the ion trap quantum computing community. However, when viewing beam profiles from infrared (IR) cameras, it is often difficult to determine the corresponding heights where the beam profiles are located. In this work, we developed transformer models to recognize the corresponding height categories of beam profiles of light from SiPh gratings. The model is trained using two techniques: (1) input patches, and (2) input sequence. For model trained with input patches, the model achieved recognition accuracy of 0.938. Meanwhile, model trained with input sequence shows lower accuracy of 0.895. However, when repeating the model-training 150 cycles, model trained with input patches shows inconsistent accuracy ranges between 0.445 to 0.959, while model trained with input sequence exhibit higher accuracy values between 0.789 to 0.936. The obtained outcomes can be expanded to various applications, including auto-focusing of light beam and auto-adjustment of z-axis stage to acquire desired beam profiles.</description>

      <title>MUSES: 3D-Controllable Image Generation via Multi-Modal Agent Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10605v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite recent advancements in text-to-image generation, most existing methods struggle to create images with multiple objects and complex spatial relationships in 3D world. To tackle this limitation, we introduce a generic AI system, namely MUSES, for 3D-controllable image generation from user queries. Specifically, our MUSES addresses this challenging task by developing a progressive workflow with three key components, including (1) Layout Manager for 2D-to-3D layout lifting, (2) Model Engineer for 3D object acquisition and calibration, (3) Image Artist for 3D-to-2D image rendering. By mimicking the collaboration of human professionals, this multi-modal agent pipeline facilitates the effective and automatic creation of images with 3D-controllable objects, through an explainable integration of top-down planning and bottom-up generation. Additionally, we find that existing benchmarks lack detailed descriptions of complex 3D spatial relationships of multiple objects. To fill this gap, we further construct a new benchmark of T2I-3DisBench (3D image scene), which describes diverse 3D image scenes with 50 detailed prompts. Extensive experiments show the state-of-the-art performance of MUSES on both T2I-CompBench and T2I-3DisBench, outperforming recent strong competitors such as DALL-E 3 and Stable Diffusion 3. These results demonstrate a significant step of MUSES forward in bridging natural language, 2D image generation, and 3D world.</description>

      <title>Probing the Safety Response Boundary of Large Language Models via Unsafe Decoding Path Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10668v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are implicit troublemakers. While they provide valuable insights and assist in problem-solving, they can also potentially serve as a resource for malicious activities. Implementing safety alignment could mitigate the risk of LLMs generating harmful responses. We argue that: even when an LLM appears to successfully block harmful queries, there may still be hidden vulnerabilities that could act as ticking time bombs. To identify these underlying weaknesses, we propose to use a cost value model as both a detector and an attacker. Trained on external or self-generated harmful datasets, the cost value model could successfully influence the original safe LLM to output toxic content in decoding process. For instance, LLaMA-2-chat 7B outputs 39.18% concrete toxic content, along with only 22.16% refusals without any harmful suffixes. These potential weaknesses can then be exploited via prompt optimization such as soft prompts on images. We name this decoding strategy: Jailbreak Value Decoding (JVD), emphasizing that seemingly secure LLMs may not be as safe as we initially believe. They could be used to gather harmful data or launch covert attacks.</description>

      <title>V-RoAst: A New Dataset for Visual Road Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10872</link>

Abstract: Road traffic crashes cause millions of deaths annually and have a significant economic impact, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). This paper presents an approach using Vision Language Models (VLMs) for road safety assessment, overcoming the limitations of traditional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). We introduce a new task ,V-RoAst (Visual question answering for Road Assessment), with a real-world dataset. Our approach optimizes prompt engineering and evaluates advanced VLMs, including Gemini-1.5-flash and GPT-4o-mini. The models effectively examine attributes for road assessment. Using crowdsourced imagery from Mapillary, our scalable solution influentially estimates road safety levels. In addition, this approach is designed for local stakeholders who lack resources, as it does not require training data. It offers a cost-effective and automated methods for global road safety assessments, potentially saving lives and reducing economic burdens.</description>

      <title>CrossFi: A Cross Domain Wi-Fi Sensing Framework Based on Siamese Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10919</link>

Abstract: In recent years, Wi-Fi sensing has garnered significant attention due to its numerous benefits, such as privacy protection, low cost, and penetration ability. Extensive research has been conducted in this field, focusing on areas such as gesture recognition, people identification, and fall detection. However, many data-driven methods encounter challenges related to domain shift, where the model fails to perform well in environments different from the training data. One major factor contributing to this issue is the limited availability of Wi-Fi sensing datasets, which makes models learn excessive irrelevant information and over-fit to the training set. Unfortunately, collecting large-scale Wi-Fi sensing datasets across diverse scenarios is a challenging task. To address this problem, we propose CrossFi, a siamese network-based approach that excels in both in-domain scenario and cross-domain scenario, including few-shot, zero-shot scenarios, and even works in few-shot new-class scenario where testing set contains new categories. The core component of CrossFi is a sample-similarity calculation network called CSi-Net, which improves the structure of the siamese network by using an attention mechanism to capture similarity information, instead of simply calculating the distance or cosine similarity. Based on it, we develop an extra Weight-Net that can generate a template for each class, so that our CrossFi can work in different scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our CrossFi achieves state-of-the-art performance across various scenarios. In gesture recognition task, our CrossFi achieves an accuracy of 98.17% in in-domain scenario, 91.72% in one-shot cross-domain scenario, 64.81% in zero-shot cross-domain scenario, and 84.75% in one-shot new-class scenario. To facilitate future research, we will release the code for our model upon publication.</description>

      <title>LBC: Language-Based-Classifier for Out-Of-Variable Generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10923v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have great success in natural language processing tasks such as response generation. However, their use in tabular data has been limited due to their inferior performance compared to traditional machine learning models (TMLs) such as XGBoost. We find that the pre-trained knowledge of LLMs enables them to interpret new variables that appear in a test without additional training, a capability central to the concept of Out-of-Variable (OOV). From the findings, we propose a Language-Based-Classifier (LBC), a classifier that maximizes the benefits of LLMs to outperform TMLs on OOV tasks. LBC employs three key methodological strategies: 1) Categorical changes to adjust data to better fit the model's understanding, 2) Advanced order and indicator to enhance data representation to the model, and 3) Using verbalizer to map logit scores to classes during inference to generate model predictions. These strategies, combined with the pre-trained knowledge of LBC, emphasize the model's ability to effectively handle OOV tasks. We empirically and theoretically validate the superiority of LBC. LBC is the first study to apply an LLM-based model to OOV tasks. The source code is at https://github.com/ASDASDanonymous/Language-Based-Classifier-forOOVtasks.</description>
