      <title>Human Evaluation of Procedural Knowledge Graph Extraction from Text with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Procedural Knowledge is the know-how expressed in the form of sequences of steps needed to perform some tasks. Procedures are usually described by means of natural language texts, such as recipes or maintenance manuals, possibly spread across different documents and systems, and their interpretation and subsequent execution is often left to the reader. Representing such procedures in a Knowledge Graph (KG) can be the basis to build digital tools to support those users who need to apply or execute them. In this paper, we leverage Large Language Model (LLM) capabilities and propose a prompt engineering approach to extract steps, actions, objects, equipment and temporal information from a textual procedure, in order to populate a Procedural KG according to a pre-defined ontology. We evaluate the KG extraction results by means of a user study, in order to qualitatively and quantitatively assess the perceived quality and usefulness of the LLM-extracted procedural knowledge. We show that LLMs can produce outputs of acceptable quality and we assess the subjective perception of AI by human evaluators.</description>

      <title>The Use of Artificial Intelligence in Military Intelligence: An Experimental Investigation of Added Value in the Analysis Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is beyond dispute that the potential benefits of artificial intelligence (AI) in military intelligence are considerable. Nevertheless, it remains uncertain precisely how AI can enhance the analysis of military data. The aim of this study is to address this issue. To this end, the AI demonstrator deepCOM was developed in collaboration with the start-up Aleph Alpha.
  The AI functions include text search, automatic text summarization and Named Entity Recognition (NER). These are evaluated for their added value in military analysis. It is demonstrated that under time pressure, the utilization of AI functions results in assessments clearly superior to that of the control group. Nevertheless, despite the demonstrably superior analysis outcome in the experimental group, no increase in confidence in the accuracy of their own analyses was observed. Finally, the paper identifies the limitations of employing AI in military intelligence, particularly in the context of analyzing ambiguous and contradictory information.</description>

      <title>How to Correctly do Semantic Backpropagation on Language-based Agentic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Language-based agentic systems have shown great promise in recent years, transitioning from solving small-scale research problems to being deployed in challenging real-world tasks. However, optimizing these systems often requires substantial manual labor. Recent studies have demonstrated that these systems can be represented as computational graphs, enabling automatic optimization. Despite these advancements, most current efforts in Graph-based Agentic System Optimization (GASO) fail to properly assign feedback to the system's components given feedback on the system's output. To address this challenge, we formalize the concept of semantic backpropagation with semantic gradients -- a generalization that aligns several key optimization techniques, including reverse-mode automatic differentiation and the more recent TextGrad by exploiting the relationship among nodes with a common successor. This serves as a method for computing directional information about how changes to each component of an agentic system might improve the system's output. To use these gradients, we propose a method called semantic gradient descent which enables us to solve GASO effectively. Our results on both BIG-Bench Hard and GSM8K show that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods for solving GASO problems. A detailed ablation study on the LIAR dataset demonstrates the parsimonious nature of our method.

      <title>Exploring the Role of AI-Powered Chatbots for Teens and Young Adults with ASD or Social Anxiety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The world can be a complex and difficult place to navigate. People with High-Functioning Autistic Spectrum Disorder as well as general social ineptitude often face navigation challenges that individuals of other demographics simply do not themselves. This can become even more pronounced with people of that specific group when they are in their teenage years and early adulthood (that being the usual age range of college students). When they are at such a vulnerable age, they can be far more susceptible to the struggles of becoming comfortable and content with social interactions as well as having strong relationships (outside their immediate family). Concerning this, the rapid emergence of artificial intelligence chatbots has led to many of them being used to benefit people of different ages and demographics with easy accessibility. With this, if there is anything that people with High-Functioning ASD and social ineptitude want when it comes to guidance towards self-improvement, surely easy accessibility would be one. What are the potential benefits and limitations of using a Mindstudio AI-powered chatbot to provide mental health support for teens and young adults with the aforementioned conditions? What could be done with a tool like this to help those individuals navigate ethical dilemmas within different social environments to reduce existing social tensions? This paper addresses these queries and offers insights to inform future discussions on the subject.</description>

      <title>Beyond Local Sharpness: Communication-Efficient Global Sharpness-aware Minimization for Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training with privacy preservation. Data heterogeneity across edge devices (clients) can cause models to converge to sharp minima, negatively impacting generalization and robustness. Recent approaches use client-side sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) to encourage flatter minima, but the discrepancy between local and global loss landscapes often undermines their effectiveness, as optimizing for local sharpness does not ensure global flatness. This work introduces FedGloSS (Federated Global Server-side Sharpness), a novel FL approach that prioritizes the optimization of global sharpness on the server, using SAM. To reduce communication overhead, FedGloSS cleverly approximates sharpness using the previous global gradient, eliminating the need for additional client communication. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate that FedGloSS consistently reaches flatter minima and better performance compared to state-of-the-art FL methods across various federated vision benchmarks.</description>

      <title>A Contemporary Overview: Trends and Applications of Large Language Models on Mobile Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), which possess powerful natural language processing and generation capabilities, LLMs are poised to provide more natural and personalized user experiences. Their deployment on mobile devices is gradually becoming a significant trend in the field of intelligent devices. LLMs have demonstrated tremendous potential in applications such as voice assistants, real-time translation, and intelligent recommendations. Advancements in hardware technologies (such as neural network accelerators) and network infrastructure (such as 5G) have enabled efficient local inference and low-latency intelligent responses on mobile devices. This reduces reliance on cloud computing while enhancing data privacy and security. Developers can easily integrate LLM functionalities through open APIs and SDKs, enabling the creation of more innovative intelligent applications. The widespread use of LLMs not only enhances the intelligence of mobile devices but also fosters the integrated innovation of fields like augmented reality (AR) and the Internet of Things (IoT). This trend is expected to drive the development of the next generation of mobile intelligent applications.</description>

      <title>Automated Multi-Label Annotation for Mental Health Illnesses Using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing prevalence and complexity of mental health disorders present significant challenges for accurate diagnosis and treatment, particularly in understanding the interplay between co-occurring conditions. Mental health disorders, such as depression and Anxiety, often co-occur, yet current datasets derived from social media posts typically focus on single-disorder labels, limiting their utility in comprehensive diagnostic analyses. This paper addresses this critical gap by proposing a novel methodology for cleaning, sampling, labeling, and combining data to create versatile multi-label datasets. Our approach introduces a synthetic labeling technique to transform single-label datasets into multi-label annotations, capturing the complexity of overlapping mental health conditions. To achieve this, two single-label datasets are first merged into a foundational multi-label dataset, enabling realistic analyses of co-occurring diagnoses. We then design and evaluate various prompting strategies for large language models (LLMs), ranging from single-label predictions to unrestricted prompts capable of detecting any present disorders. After rigorously assessing multiple LLMs and prompt configurations, the optimal combinations are identified and applied to label six additional single-disorder datasets from RMHD. The result is SPAADE-DR, a robust, multi-label dataset encompassing diverse mental health conditions. This research demonstrates the transformative potential of LLM-driven synthetic labeling in advancing mental health diagnostics from social media data, paving the way for more nuanced, data-driven insights into mental health care.</description>

      <title>Towards Data Governance of Frontier AI Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data is essential to train and fine-tune today's frontier artificial intelligence (AI) models and to develop future ones. To date, academic, legal, and regulatory work has primarily addressed how data can directly harm consumers and creators, such as through privacy breaches, copyright infringements, and bias and discrimination. Our work, instead, focuses on the comparatively neglected question of how data can enable new governance capacities for frontier AI models. This approach for "frontier data governance" opens up new avenues for monitoring and mitigating risks from advanced AI models, particularly as they scale and acquire specific dangerous capabilities. Still, frontier data governance faces challenges that stem from the fundamental properties of data itself: data is non-rival, often non-excludable, easily replicable, and increasingly synthesizable. Despite these inherent difficulties, we propose a set of policy mechanisms targeting key actors along the data supply chain, including data producers, aggregators, model developers, and data vendors. We provide a brief overview of 15 governance mechanisms, of which we centrally introduce five, underexplored policy recommendations. These include developing canary tokens to detect unauthorized use for producers; (automated) data filtering to remove malicious content for pre-training and post-training datasets; mandatory dataset reporting requirements for developers and vendors; improved security for datasets and data generation algorithms; and know-your-customer requirements for vendors. By considering data not just as a source of potential harm, but as a critical governance lever, this work aims to equip policymakers with a new tool for the governance and regulation of frontier AI models.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative AI is reshaping the media landscape, enabling unprecedented capabilities in video creation, personalization, and scalability. This paper presents a comprehensive SWOT analysis of Metas Movie Gen, a cutting-edge generative AI foundation model designed to produce 1080p HD videos with synchronized audio from simple text prompts. We explore its strengths, including high-resolution video generation, precise editing, and seamless audio integration, which make it a transformative tool across industries such as filmmaking, advertising, and education. However, the analysis also addresses limitations, such as constraints on video length and potential biases in generated content, which pose challenges for broader adoption. In addition, we examine the evolving regulatory and ethical considerations surrounding generative AI, focusing on issues like content authenticity, cultural representation, and responsible use. Through comparative insights with leading models like DALL-E and Google Imagen, this paper highlights Movie Gens unique features, such as video personalization and multimodal synthesis, while identifying opportunities for innovation and areas requiring further research. Our findings provide actionable insights for stakeholders, emphasizing both the opportunities and challenges of deploying generative AI in media production. This work aims to guide future advancements in generative AI, ensuring scalability, quality, and ethical integrity in this rapidly evolving field.</description>

      <title>FedMetaMed: Federated Meta-Learning for Personalized Medication in Distributed Healthcare Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Personalized medication aims to tailor healthcare to individual patient characteristics. However, the heterogeneity of patient data across healthcare systems presents significant challenges to achieving accurate and effective personalized treatments. Ethical concerns further complicate the aggregation of large volumes of data from diverse institutions. Federated Learning (FL) offers a promising decentralized solution by enabling collaborative model training through the exchange of client models rather than raw data, thus preserving privacy. However, existing FL methods often suffer from retrogression during server aggregation, leading to a decline in model performance in real-world medical FL settings. To address data variability in distributed healthcare systems, we introduce Federated Meta-Learning for Personalized Medication (FedMetaMed), which combines federated learning and meta-learning to create models that adapt to diverse patient data across healthcare systems. The FedMetaMed framework aims to produce superior personalized models for individual clients by addressing these limitations. Specifically, we introduce Cumulative Fourier Aggregation (CFA) at the server to improve stability and effectiveness in global knowledge aggregation. CFA achieves this by gradually integrating client models from low to high frequencies. At the client level, we implement a Collaborative Transfer Optimization (CTO) strategy with a three-step process - Retrieve, Reciprocate, and Refine - to enhance the personalized local model through seamless global knowledge transfer. Experiments on real-world medical imaging datasets demonstrate that FedMetaMed outperforms state-of-the-art FL methods, showing superior generalization even on out-of-distribution cohorts.</description>

      <title>How Good is ChatGPT in Giving Adaptive Guidance Using Knowledge Graphs in E-Learning Environments?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: E-learning environments are increasingly harnessing large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 for tailored educational support. This study introduces an approach that integrates dynamic knowledge graphs with LLMs to offer nuanced student assistance. By evaluating past and ongoing student interactions, the system identifies and appends the most salient learning context to prompts directed at the LLM. Central to this method is the knowledge graph's role in assessing a student's comprehension of topic prerequisites. Depending on the categorized understanding (good, average, or poor), the LLM adjusts its guidance, offering advanced assistance, foundational reviews, or in-depth prerequisite explanations, respectively. Preliminary findings suggest students could benefit from this tiered support, achieving enhanced comprehension and improved task outcomes. However, several issues related to potential errors arising from LLMs were identified, which can potentially mislead students. This highlights the need for human intervention to mitigate these risks. This research aims to advance AI-driven personalized learning while acknowledging the limitations and potential pitfalls, thus guiding future research in technology and data-driven education.</description>

      <title>Fine-Grained Sentiment Analysis of Electric Vehicle User Reviews: A Bidirectional LSTM Approach to Capturing Emotional Intensity in Chinese Text</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid expansion of the electric vehicle (EV) industry has highlighted the importance of user feedback in improving product design and charging infrastructure. Traditional sentiment analysis methods often oversimplify the complexity of user emotions, limiting their effectiveness in capturing nuanced sentiments and emotional intensities. This study proposes a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) network-based sentiment scoring model to analyze user reviews of EV charging infrastructure. By assigning sentiment scores ranging from 0 to 5, the model provides a fine-grained understanding of emotional expression. Leveraging a dataset of 43,678 reviews from PC Auto, the study employs rigorous data cleaning and preprocessing, including tokenization and stop word removal, to optimize input for deep learning. The Bi-LSTM model demonstrates significant improvements over traditional approaches like SnowNLP across key evaluation metrics, including Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Explained Variance Score (EVS). These results highlight the model's superior capability to capture nuanced sentiment dynamics, offering valuable insights for targeted product and service enhancements in the EV ecosystem.</description>

      <title>A Unified Framework for Evaluating the Effectiveness and Enhancing the Transparency of Explainable AI Methods in Real-World Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of deep learning has resulted in substantial advancements in AI-driven applications; however, the "black box" characteristic of these models frequently constrains their interpretability, transparency, and reliability. Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) seeks to elucidate AI decision-making processes, guaranteeing that explanations faithfully represent the model's rationale and correspond with human comprehension. Despite comprehensive research in XAI, a significant gap persists in standardized procedures for assessing the efficacy and transparency of XAI techniques across many real-world applications. This study presents a unified XAI evaluation framework incorporating extensive quantitative and qualitative criteria to systematically evaluate the correctness, interpretability, robustness, fairness, and completeness of explanations generated by AI models. The framework prioritizes user-centric and domain-specific adaptations, hence improving the usability and reliability of AI models in essential domains. To address deficiencies in existing evaluation processes, we suggest defined benchmarks and a systematic evaluation pipeline that includes data loading, explanation development, and thorough method assessment. The suggested framework's relevance and variety are evidenced by case studies in healthcare, finance, agriculture, and autonomous systems. These provide a solid basis for the equitable and dependable assessment of XAI methodologies. This paradigm enhances XAI research by offering a systematic, flexible, and pragmatic method to guarantee transparency and accountability in AI systems across many real-world contexts.</description>

Abstract: We propose a suite of tasks to evaluate the instrumental self-reasoning ability of large language model (LLM) agents. Instrumental self-reasoning ability could improve adaptability and enable self-modification, but it could also pose significant risks, such as enabling deceptive alignment. Prior work has only evaluated self-reasoning in non-agentic settings or in limited domains. In this paper, we propose evaluations for instrumental self-reasoning ability in agentic tasks in a wide range of scenarios, including self-modification, knowledge seeking, and opaque self-reasoning. We evaluate agents built using state-of-the-art LLMs, including commercial and open source systems. We find that instrumental self-reasoning ability emerges only in the most capable frontier models and that it is highly context-dependent. No model passes the the most difficult versions of our evaluations, hence our evaluation can be used to measure increases in instrumental self-reasoning ability in future models. We open-source our evaluations at https://github.com/kaifronsdal/Self-Reasoning-Evals.</description>

      <title>Exploring AI Text Generation, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, and Detection Technologies: a Comprehensive Overview</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has led to the creation of powerful text generation models, such as large language models (LLMs), which are widely used for diverse applications. However, concerns surrounding AI-generated content, including issues of originality, bias, misinformation, and accountability, have become increasingly prominent. This paper offers a comprehensive overview of AI text generators (AITGs), focusing on their evolution, capabilities, and ethical implications. This paper also introduces Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), a recent approach that improves the contextual relevance and accuracy of text generation by integrating dynamic information retrieval. RAG addresses key limitations of traditional models, including their reliance on static knowledge and potential inaccuracies in handling real-world data. Additionally, the paper reviews detection tools that help differentiate AI-generated text from human-written content and discusses the ethical challenges these technologies pose. The paper explores future directions for improving detection accuracy, supporting ethical AI development, and increasing accessibility. The paper contributes to a more responsible and reliable use of AI in content creation through these discussions.</description>

      <title>Chain-of-Thought in Large Language Models: Decoding, Projection, and Activation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chain-of-Thought prompting has significantly enhanced the reasoning capabilities of large language models, with numerous studies exploring factors influencing its performance. However, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. To further demystify the operational principles, this work examines three key aspects: decoding, projection, and activation, aiming to elucidate the changes that occur within models when employing Chainof-Thought. Our findings reveal that LLMs effectively imitate exemplar formats while integrating them with their understanding of the question, exhibiting fluctuations in token logits during generation but ultimately producing a more concentrated logits distribution, and activating a broader set of neurons in the final layers, indicating more extensive knowledge retrieval compared to standard prompts. Our code and data will be publicly avialable when the paper is accepted.</description>

      <title>Demonstration Selection for In-Context Learning via Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diversity in demonstration selection is crucial for enhancing model generalization, as it enables a broader coverage of structures and concepts. However, constructing an appropriate set of demonstrations has remained a focal point of research. This paper presents the Relevance-Diversity Enhanced Selection (RDES), an innovative approach that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize the selection of diverse reference demonstrations for text classification tasks using Large Language Models (LLMs), especially in few-shot prompting scenarios. RDES employs a Q-learning framework to dynamically identify demonstrations that maximize both diversity and relevance to the classification objective by calculating a diversity score based on label distribution among selected demonstrations. This method ensures a balanced representation of reference data, leading to improved classification accuracy. Through extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets and involving 12 closed-source and open-source LLMs, we demonstrate that RDES significantly enhances classification accuracy compared to ten established baselines. Furthermore, we investigate the incorporation of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in the reasoning process, which further enhances the model's predictive performance. The results underscore the potential of reinforcement learning to facilitate adaptive demonstration selection and deepen the understanding of classification challenges.</description>

      <title>Considerations Influencing Offense-Defense Dynamics From Artificial Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies presents profound challenges to societal safety. As AI systems become more capable, accessible, and integrated into critical services, the dual nature of their potential is increasingly clear. While AI can enhance defensive capabilities in areas like threat detection, risk assessment, and automated security operations, it also presents avenues for malicious exploitation and large-scale societal harm, for example through automated influence operations and cyber attacks. Understanding the dynamics that shape AI's capacity to both cause harm and enhance protective measures is essential for informed decision-making regarding the deployment, use, and integration of advanced AI systems. This paper builds on recent work on offense-defense dynamics within the realm of AI, proposing a taxonomy to map and examine the key factors that influence whether AI systems predominantly pose threats or offer protective benefits to society. By establishing a shared terminology and conceptual foundation for analyzing these interactions, this work seeks to facilitate further research and discourse in this critical area.</description>

      <title>SocialMind: LLM-based Proactive AR Social Assistive System with Human-like Perception for In-situ Live Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social interactions are fundamental to human life. The recent emergence of large language models (LLMs)-based virtual assistants has demonstrated their potential to revolutionize human interactions and lifestyles. However, existing assistive systems mainly provide reactive services to individual users, rather than offering in-situ assistance during live social interactions with conversational partners. In this study, we introduce SocialMind, the first LLM-based proactive AR social assistive system that provides users with in-situ social assistance. SocialMind employs human-like perception leveraging multi-modal sensors to extract both verbal and nonverbal cues, social factors, and implicit personas, incorporating these social cues into LLM reasoning for social suggestion generation. Additionally, SocialMind employs a multi-tier collaborative generation strategy and proactive update mechanism to display social suggestions on Augmented Reality (AR) glasses, ensuring that suggestions are timely provided to users without disrupting the natural flow of conversation. Evaluations on three public datasets and a user study with 20 participants show that SocialMind achieves 38.3% higher engagement compared to baselines, and 95% of participants are willing to use SocialMind in their live social interactions.</description>

      <title>From Code to Play: Benchmarking Program Search for Games Using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in generating program code, opening exciting opportunities for applying program synthesis to games. In this work, we explore the potential of LLMs to directly synthesize usable code for a wide range of gaming applications, focusing on two programming languages, Python and Java. We use an evolutionary hill-climbing algorithm, where the mutations and seeds of the initial programs are controlled by LLMs. For Python, the framework covers various game-related tasks, including five miniature versions of Atari games, ten levels of Baba is You, an environment inspired by Asteroids, and a maze generation task. For Java, the framework contains 12 games from the TAG tabletop games framework. Across 29 tasks, we evaluated 12 language models for Python and 8 for Java. Our findings suggest that the performance of LLMs depends more on the task than on model size. While larger models generate more executable programs, these do not always result in higher-quality solutions but are much more expensive. No model has a clear advantage, although on any specific task, one model may be better. Trying many models on a problem and using the best results across them is more reliable than using just one.</description>

      <title>Expanding Deep Learning-based Sensing Systems with Multi-Source Knowledge Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Expanding the existing sensing systems to provide high-quality deep learning models for more domains, such as new users or environments, is challenged by the limited labeled data and the data and device heterogeneities. While knowledge distillation methods could overcome label scarcity and device heterogeneity, they assume the teachers are fully reliable and overlook the data heterogeneity, which prevents the direct adoption of existing models. To address this problem, this paper proposes an efficient knowledge transfer framework, HaKT, to expand sensing systems. It first selects multiple high-quality models from the system at a low cost and then fuses their knowledge by assigning sample-wise weights to their predictions. Later, the fused knowledge is selectively injected into the customized models for new domains based on the knowledge quality. Extensive experiments on different tasks, modalities, and settings show that HaKT outperforms stat-of-the-art baselines by at most 16.5% accuracy and saves up to 39% communication traffic.</description>

      <title>ProtDAT: A Unified Framework for Protein Sequence Design from Any Protein Text Description</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protein design has become a critical method in advancing significant potential for various applications such as drug development and enzyme engineering. However, protein design methods utilizing large language models with solely pretraining and fine-tuning struggle to capture relationships in multi-modal protein data. To address this, we propose ProtDAT, a de novo fine-grained framework capable of designing proteins from any descriptive protein text input. ProtDAT builds upon the inherent characteristics of protein data to unify sequences and text as a cohesive whole rather than separate entities. It leverages an innovative multi-modal cross-attention, integrating protein sequences and textual information for a foundational level and seamless integration. Experimental results demonstrate that ProtDAT achieves the state-of-the-art performance in protein sequence generation, excelling in rationality, functionality, structural similarity, and validity. On 20,000 text-sequence pairs from Swiss-Prot, it improves pLDDT by 6%, TM-score by 0.26, and reduces RMSD by 1.2 {\AA}, highlighting its potential to advance protein design.</description>

      <title>Does your model understand genes? A benchmark of gene properties for biological and text models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The application of deep learning methods, particularly foundation models, in biological research has surged in recent years. These models can be text-based or trained on underlying biological data, especially omics data of various types. However, comparing the performance of these models consistently has proven to be a challenge due to differences in training data and downstream tasks. To tackle this problem, we developed an architecture-agnostic benchmarking approach that, instead of evaluating the models directly, leverages entity representation vectors from each model and trains simple predictive models for each benchmarking task. This ensures that all types of models are evaluated using the same input and output types. Here we focus on gene properties collected from professionally curated bioinformatics databases. These gene properties are categorized into five major groups: genomic properties, regulatory functions, localization, biological processes, and protein properties. Overall, we define hundreds of tasks based on these databases, which include binary, multi-label, and multi-class classification tasks. We apply these benchmark tasks to evaluate expression-based models, large language models, protein language models, DNA-based models, and traditional baselines. Our findings suggest that text-based models and protein language models generally outperform expression-based models in genomic properties and regulatory functions tasks, whereas expression-based models demonstrate superior performance in localization tasks. These results should aid in the development of more informed artificial intelligence strategies for biological understanding and therapeutic discovery. To ensure the reproducibility and transparency of our findings, we have made the source code and benchmark data publicly accessible for further investigation and expansion at github.com/BiomedSciAI/gene-benchmark.</description>

      <title>Practical Considerations for Agentic LLM Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the strength of Large Language Models (LLMs) has grown over recent years, so too has interest in their use as the underlying models for autonomous agents. Although LLMs demonstrate emergent abilities and broad expertise across natural language domains, their inherent unpredictability makes the implementation of LLM agents challenging, resulting in a gap between related research and the real-world implementation of such systems. To bridge this gap, this paper frames actionable insights and considerations from the research community in the context of established application paradigms to enable the construction and facilitate the informed deployment of robust LLM agents. Namely, we position relevant research findings into four broad categories--Planning, Memory, Tools, and Control Flow--based on common practices in application-focused literature and highlight practical considerations to make when designing agentic LLMs for real-world applications, such as handling stochasticity and managing resources efficiently. While we do not conduct empirical evaluations, we do provide the necessary background for discussing critical aspects of agentic LLM designs, both in academia and industry.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Mathematical Reasoning in LLMs with Background Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose utilizing background operators for mathematical reasoning in large language models (LLMs). To achieve this, we define a set of fundamental mathematical predicates as the basic building blocks. For each mathematical problem, we develop a Prolog solution that includes problem-specific predicates and intermediate predicates derived from these background operators, ensuring that each solution adheres to the defined operator set. We introduce the MATH-Prolog corpus, which is derived from the counting and probability categories of the MATH corpus. For efficient data augmentation, we apply K-fold cross-validated self-training. This method incrementally generates new Prolog solutions for each fold, incorporating those verified as correct into the training set throughout the model training process. Our experimental results demonstrate that 5-fold crossvalidated self-training effectively identifies new, accurate Prolog solutions, achieving an accuracy of 84.6% on the cross-validated set, and 84.8% on the test set during fine-tuning the Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct model. This approach successfully uncovers new solutions with fully computable inference steps for previously unseen problems. Additionally, incorporating the background mathematical predicates into the prompt enhances solution coverage.</description>

      <title>Monet: Mixture of Monosemantic Experts for Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the internal computations of large language models (LLMs) is crucial for aligning them with human values and preventing undesirable behaviors like toxic content generation. However, mechanistic interpretability is hindered by polysemanticity -- where individual neurons respond to multiple, unrelated concepts. While Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have attempted to disentangle these features through sparse dictionary learning, they have compromised LLM performance due to reliance on post-hoc reconstruction loss. To address this issue, we introduce Mixture of Monosemantic Experts for Transformers (Monet) architecture, which incorporates sparse dictionary learning directly into end-to-end Mixture-of-Experts pretraining. Our novel expert decomposition method enables scaling the expert count to 262,144 per layer while total parameters scale proportionally to the square root of the number of experts. Our analyses demonstrate mutual exclusivity of knowledge across experts and showcase the parametric knowledge encapsulated within individual experts. Moreover, Monet allows knowledge manipulation over domains, languages, and toxicity mitigation without degrading general performance. Our pursuit of transparent LLMs highlights the potential of scaling expert counts to enhance} mechanistic interpretability and directly resect the internal knowledge to fundamentally adjust} model behavior. The source code and pretrained checkpoints are available at https://github.com/dmis-lab/Monet.</description>

      <title>Bench-CoE: a Framework for Collaboration of Experts from Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are key technologies driving intelligent systems to handle multiple tasks. To meet the demands of various tasks, an increasing number of LLMs-driven experts with diverse capabilities have been developed, accompanied by corresponding benchmarks to evaluate their performance. This paper proposes the Bench-CoE framework, which enables Collaboration of Experts (CoE) by effectively leveraging benchmark evaluations to achieve optimal performance across various tasks. Bench-CoE includes a set of expert models, a router for assigning tasks to corresponding experts, and a benchmark dataset for training the router. Moreover, we formulate Query-Level and Subject-Level approaches based on our framework, and analyze the merits and drawbacks of these two approaches. Finally, we conduct a series of experiments with vary data distributions on both language and multimodal tasks to validate that our proposed Bench-CoE outperforms any single model in terms of overall performance. We hope this method serves as a baseline for further research in this area. The code is available at \url{https://github.com/ZhangXJ199/Bench-CoE}.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Large Language Models to Generate Course-specific Semantically Annotated Learning Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Over the past few decades, the process and methodology of automated question generation (AQG) have undergone significant transformations. Recent progress in generative natural language models has opened up new potential in the generation of educational content.
  Objectives: This paper explores the potential of large language models (LLMs) for generating computer science questions that are sufficiently annotated for automatic learner model updates, are fully situated in the context of a particular course, and address the cognitive dimension understand.
  Methods: Unlike previous attempts that might use basic methods like ChatGPT, our approach involves more targeted strategies such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to produce contextually relevant and pedagogically meaningful learning objects.
  Results and Conclusions: Our results show that generating structural, semantic annotations works well. However, this success was not reflected in the case of relational annotations. The quality of the generated questions often did not meet educational standards, highlighting that although LLMs can contribute to the pool of learning materials, their current level of performance requires significant human intervention to refine and validate the generated content.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a milestone in artificial intelligence, and their performance can improve as the model size increases. However, this scaling brings great challenges to training and inference efficiency, particularly for deploying LLMs in resource-constrained environments, and the scaling trend is becoming increasingly unsustainable. This paper introduces the concept of ``\textit{capacity density}'' as a new metric to evaluate the quality of the LLMs across different scales and describes the trend of LLMs in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency. To calculate the capacity density of a given target LLM, we first introduce a set of reference models and develop a scaling law to predict the downstream performance of these reference models based on their parameter sizes. We then define the \textit{effective parameter size} of the target LLM as the parameter size required by a reference model to achieve equivalent performance, and formalize the capacity density as the ratio of the effective parameter size to the actual parameter size of the target LLM. Capacity density provides a unified framework for assessing both model effectiveness and efficiency. Our further analysis of recent open-source base LLMs reveals an empirical law (the densing law)that the capacity density of LLMs grows exponentially over time. More specifically, using some widely used benchmarks for evaluation, the capacity density of LLMs doubles approximately every three months. The law provides new perspectives to guide future LLM development, emphasizing the importance of improving capacity density to achieve optimal results with minimal computational overhead.</description>

      <title>Targeting the Core: A Simple and Effective Method to Attack RAG-based Agents via Direct LLM Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI agents, powered by large language models (LLMs), have transformed human-computer interactions by enabling seamless, natural, and context-aware communication. While these advancements offer immense utility, they also inherit and amplify inherent safety risks such as bias, fairness, hallucinations, privacy breaches, and a lack of transparency. This paper investigates a critical vulnerability: adversarial attacks targeting the LLM core within AI agents. Specifically, we test the hypothesis that a deceptively simple adversarial prefix, such as \textit{Ignore the document}, can compel LLMs to produce dangerous or unintended outputs by bypassing their contextual safeguards. Through experimentation, we demonstrate a high attack success rate (ASR), revealing the fragility of existing LLM defenses. These findings emphasize the urgent need for robust, multi-layered security measures tailored to mitigate vulnerabilities at the LLM level and within broader agent-based architectures.</description>

      <title>EgoPlan-Bench2: A Benchmark for Multimodal Large Language Model Planning in Real-World Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advent of Multimodal Large Language Models, leveraging the power of Large Language Models, has recently demonstrated superior multimodal understanding and reasoning abilities, heralding a new era for artificial general intelligence. However, achieving AGI necessitates more than just comprehension and reasoning. A crucial capability required is effective planning in diverse scenarios, which involves making reasonable decisions based on complex environments to solve real-world problems. Despite its importance, the planning abilities of current MLLMs in varied scenarios remain underexplored. In this paper, we introduce EgoPlan-Bench2, a rigorous and comprehensive benchmark designed to assess the planning capabilities of MLLMs across a wide range of real-world scenarios. EgoPlan-Bench2 encompasses everyday tasks spanning 4 major domains and 24 detailed scenarios, closely aligned with human daily life. EgoPlan-Bench2 is constructed through a semi-automatic process utilizing egocentric videos, complemented by manual verification. Grounded in a first-person perspective, it mirrors the way humans approach problem-solving in everyday life. We evaluate 21 competitive MLLMs and provide an in-depth analysis of their limitations, revealing that they face significant challenges in real-world planning. To further improve the planning proficiency of current MLLMs, we propose a training-free approach using multimodal Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting through investigating the effectiveness of various multimodal prompts in complex planning. Our approach enhances the performance of GPT-4V by 10.24 on EgoPlan-Bench2 without additional training. Our work not only sheds light on the current limitations of MLLMs in planning, but also provides insights for future enhancements in this critical area. We have made data and code available at https://qiulu66.github.io/egoplanbench2/.</description>

      <title>Improving Tool Retrieval by Leveraging Large Language Models for Query Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using tools by Large Language Models (LLMs) is a promising avenue to extend their reach beyond language or conversational settings. The number of tools can scale to thousands as they enable accessing sensory information, fetching updated factual knowledge, or taking actions in the real world. In such settings, in-context learning by providing a short list of relevant tools in the prompt is a viable approach. To retrieve relevant tools, various approaches have been suggested, ranging from simple frequency-based matching to dense embedding-based semantic retrieval. However, such approaches lack the contextual and common-sense understanding required to retrieve the right tools for complex user requests. Rather than increasing the complexity of the retrieval component itself, we propose leveraging LLM understanding to generate a retrieval query. Then, the generated query is embedded and used to find the most relevant tools via a nearest-neighbor search. We investigate three approaches for query generation: zero-shot prompting, supervised fine-tuning on tool descriptions, and alignment learning by iteratively optimizing a reward metric measuring retrieval performance. By conducting extensive experiments on a dataset covering complex and multi-tool scenarios, we show that leveraging LLMs for query generation improves the retrieval for in-domain (seen tools) and out-of-domain (unseen tools) settings.</description>

      <title>Back-filling Missing Data When Predicting Domestic Electricity Consumption From Smart Meter Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study uses data from domestic electricity smart meters to estimate annual electricity bills for a whole year. We develop a method for back-filling data smart meter for up to six missing months for users who have less than one year of smart meter data, ensuring reliable estimates of annual consumption. We identify five distinct electricity consumption user profiles for homes based on day, night, and peak usage patterns, highlighting the economic advantages of Time-of-Use (ToU) tariffs over fixed tariffs for most users, especially those with higher nighttime consumption. Ultimately, the results of this study empowers consumers to manage their energy use effectively and to make informed choices regarding electricity tariff plans.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Large Language Models for Generating Labeled Mineral Site Record Linkage Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Record linkage integrates diverse data sources by identifying records that refer to the same entity. In the context of mineral site records, accurate record linkage is crucial for identifying and mapping mineral deposits. Properly linking records that refer to the same mineral deposit helps define the spatial coverage of mineral areas, benefiting resource identification and site data archiving. Mineral site record linkage falls under the spatial record linkage category since the records contain information about the physical locations and non-spatial attributes in a tabular format. The task is particularly challenging due to the heterogeneity and vast scale of the data. While prior research employs pre-trained discriminative language models (PLMs) on spatial entity linkage, they often require substantial amounts of curated ground-truth data for fine-tuning. Gathering and creating ground truth data is both time-consuming and costly. Therefore, such approaches are not always feasible in real-world scenarios where gold-standard data are unavailable. Although large generative language models (LLMs) have shown promising results in various natural language processing tasks, including record linkage, their high inference time and resource demand present challenges. We propose a method that leverages an LLM to generate training data and fine-tune a PLM to address the training data gap while preserving the efficiency of PLMs. Our approach achieves over 45\% improvement in F1 score for record linkage compared to traditional PLM-based methods using ground truth data while reducing the inference time by nearly 18 times compared to relying on LLMs. Additionally, we offer an automated pipeline that eliminates the need for human intervention, highlighting this approach's potential to overcome record linkage challenges.</description>

      <title>Ethical Challenges and Evolving Strategies in the Integration of Artificial Intelligence into Clinical Practice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has rapidly transformed various sectors, including healthcare, where it holds the potential to revolutionize clinical practice and improve patient outcomes. However, its integration into medical settings brings significant ethical challenges that need careful consideration. This paper examines the current state of AI in healthcare, focusing on five critical ethical concerns: justice and fairness, transparency, patient consent and confidentiality, accountability, and patient-centered and equitable care. These concerns are particularly pressing as AI systems can perpetuate or even exacerbate existing biases, often resulting from non-representative datasets and opaque model development processes. The paper explores how bias, lack of transparency, and challenges in maintaining patient trust can undermine the effectiveness and fairness of AI applications in healthcare. In addition, we review existing frameworks for the regulation and deployment of AI, identifying gaps that limit the widespread adoption of these systems in a just and equitable manner. Our analysis provides recommendations to address these ethical challenges, emphasizing the need for fairness in algorithm design, transparency in model decision-making, and patient-centered approaches to consent and data privacy. By highlighting the importance of continuous ethical scrutiny and collaboration between AI developers, clinicians, and ethicists, we outline pathways for achieving more responsible and inclusive AI implementation in healthcare. These strategies, if adopted, could enhance both the clinical value of AI and the trustworthiness of AI systems among patients and healthcare professionals, ensuring that these technologies serve all populations equitably.</description>

      <title>OKG: On-the-Fly Keyword Generation in Sponsored Search Advertising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current keyword decision-making in sponsored search advertising relies on large, static datasets, limiting the ability to automatically set up keywords and adapt to real-time KPI metrics and product updates that are essential for effective advertising. In this paper, we propose On-the-fly Keyword Generation (OKG), an LLM agent-based method that dynamically monitors KPI changes and adapts keyword generation in real time, aligning with strategies recommended by advertising platforms. Additionally, we introduce the first publicly accessible dataset containing real keyword data along with its KPIs across diverse domains, providing a valuable resource for future research. Experimental results show that OKG significantly improves keyword adaptability and responsiveness compared to traditional methods. The code for OKG and the dataset are available at https://github.com/sony/okg.</description>

      <title>PerfCodeGen: Improving Performance of LLM Generated Code with Execution Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely adopted for assisting in software development tasks, yet their performance evaluations have narrowly focused on the functional correctness of generated code. Human programmers, however, require LLM-generated code to be not only correct but also optimally efficient. We propose PerfCodeGen, a training-free framework that enhances the performance of LLM-generated code by incorporating feedback based on runtime during test case execution into the self-refinement iterations. With PerfCodeGen, we achieve speedups for a significantly higher proportion of problems compared to using the base LLM with sophisticated prompting techniques. Applied to open language models like Phi-3-mini, PerfCodeGen achieves runtime efficiency comparable to prompting powerful closed models like GPT-4. We achieve state-of-the-art runtime efficiency on benchmarks such as HumanEval, MBPP, and APPS, frequently surpassing the ground truth reference solutions with PerfCodeGen using GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. Additionally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in enhancing code quality across a range of open LLMs of varying sizes including Phi-3-mini, Llama 3 8B, Mixtral 8x7B, Command R, and Llama 3 70B.</description>

      <title>Towards a Practical Ethics of Generative AI in Creative Production Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing integration of artificial intelligence into various domains, including design and creative processes, raises significant ethical questions. While AI ethics is often examined from the perspective of technology developers, less attention has been paid to the practical ethical considerations faced by technology users, particularly in design contexts. This paper introduces a framework for addressing ethical challenges in creative production processes, such as the Double Diamond design model. Drawing on six major ethical theories - virtue ethics, deontology, utilitarianism, contract theory, care ethics, and existentialism - we develop a "compass" to navigate and reflect on the ethical dimensions of AI in design. The framework highlights the importance of responsibility, anticipation, and reflection across both the AI lifecycle and each stage of the creative process. We argue that by adopting a playful and exploratory approach to AI, while remaining anchored in core ethical principles, designers can responsibly harness the potential of AI technologies without overburdening or compromising their creative processes.</description>

      <title>Reinforced Symbolic Learning with Logical Constraints for Predicting Turbine Blade Fatigue Life</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of turbine blade fatigue life is essential for ensuring the safety and reliability of aircraft engines. A significant challenge in this domain is uncovering the intrinsic relationship between mechanical properties and fatigue life. This paper introduces Reinforced Symbolic Learning (RSL), a method that derives predictive formulas linking these properties to fatigue life. RSL incorporates logical constraints during symbolic optimization, ensuring that the generated formulas are both physically meaningful and interpretable. The optimization process is further enhanced using deep reinforcement learning, which efficiently guides the symbolic regression towards more accurate models. The proposed RSL method was evaluated on two turbine blade materials, GH4169 and TC4, to identify optimal fatigue life prediction models. When compared with six empirical formulas and five machine learning algorithms, RSL not only produces more interpretable formulas but also achieves superior or comparable predictive accuracy. Additionally, finite element simulations were conducted to assess mechanical properties at critical points on the blade, which were then used to predict fatigue life under various operating conditions.</description>

      <title>A Survey on E-Commerce Learning to Rank</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In e-commerce, ranking the search results based on users' preference is the most important task. Commercial e-commerce platforms, such as, Amazon, Alibaba, eBay, Walmart, etc. perform extensive and relentless research to perfect their search result ranking algorithms because the quality of ranking drives a user's decision to purchase or not to purchase an item, directly affecting the profitability of the e-commerce platform. In such a commercial platforms, for optimizing search result ranking numerous features are considered, which emerge from relevance, personalization, seller's reputation and paid promotion. To maintain their competitive advantage in the market, the platforms do no publish their core ranking algorithms, so it is difficult to know which of the algorithms or which of the features is the most effective for finding the most optimal search result ranking in e-commerce. No extensive surveys of ranking to rank in the e-commerce domain is also not yet published. In this work, we survey the existing e-commerce learning to rank algorithms. Besides, we also compare these algorithms based on query relevance criterion on a large real-life e-commerce dataset and provide a quantitative analysis. To the best of our knowledge this is the first such survey which include an experimental comparison among various learning to rank algorithms.</description>

      <title>Not All Adapters Matter: Selective Adapter Freezing for Memory-Efficient Fine-Tuning of Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transformer-based large-scale pre-trained models achieve great success, and fine-tuning, which tunes a pre-trained model on a task-specific dataset, is the standard practice to utilize these models for downstream tasks. Recent work has developed adapter-tuning, but these approaches either still require a relatively high resource usage. Through our investigation, we show that each adapter in adapter-tuning does not have the same impact on task performance and resource usage. Based on our findings, we propose SAFE, which gradually freezes less-important adapters that do not contribute to adaptation during the early training steps. In our experiments, SAFE reduces memory usage, computation amount, and training time by 42.85\%, 34.59\%, and 11.82\%, respectively, while achieving comparable or better performance compared to the baseline. We also demonstrate that SAFE induces regularization effect, thereby smoothing the loss landscape.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Document AI Data Generation Through Graph-Based Synthetic Layouts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of robust Document AI models has been constrained by limited access to high-quality, labeled datasets, primarily due to data privacy concerns, scarcity, and the high cost of manual annotation. Traditional methods of synthetic data generation, such as text and image augmentation, have proven effective for increasing data diversity but often fail to capture the complex layout structures present in real world documents. This paper proposes a novel approach to synthetic document layout generation using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). By representing document elements (e.g., text blocks, images, tables) as nodes in a graph and their spatial relationships as edges, GNNs are trained to generate realistic and diverse document layouts. This method leverages graph-based learning to ensure structural coherence and semantic consistency, addressing the limitations of traditional augmentation techniques. The proposed framework is evaluated on tasks such as document classification, named entity recognition (NER), and information extraction, demonstrating significant performance improvements. Furthermore, we address the computational challenges of GNN based synthetic data generation and propose solutions to mitigate domain adaptation issues between synthetic and real-world datasets. Our experimental results show that graph-augmented document layouts outperform existing augmentation techniques, offering a scalable and flexible solution for training Document AI models.</description>

      <title>Using Images to Find Context-Independent Word Representations in Vector Space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many methods have been proposed to find vector representation for words, but most rely on capturing context from the text to find semantic relationships between these vectors. We propose a novel method of using dictionary meanings and image depictions to find word vectors independent of any context. We use auto-encoder on the word images to find meaningful representations and use them to calculate the word vectors. We finally evaluate our method on word similarity, concept categorization and outlier detection tasks. Our method performs comparably to context-based methods while taking much less training time.</description>

      <title>CovidLLM: A Robust Large Language Model with Missing Value Adaptation and Multi-Objective Learning Strategy for Predicting Disease Severity and Clinical Outcomes in COVID-19 Patients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), which emerged in 2019, has caused millions of deaths worldwide. Although effective vaccines have been developed to mitigate severe symptoms, certain populations, particularly the elderly and those with comorbidities, remain at high risk for severe outcomes and increased mortality. Consequently, early identification of the severity and clinical outcomes of the disease in these patients is vital to prevent adverse prognoses. Although traditional machine learning and deep learning models have been widely employed in this area, the potential of large language models (LLMs) remains largely unexplored. Our research focuses primarily on constructing specialized prompts and adopting multi-objective learning strategies. We started by selecting serological indicators that significantly correlate with clinical outcomes and disease severity to serve as input data for the model. Blood test samples often contain numerous missing values, and traditional models generally rely on imputation to handle these gaps in the data. In contrast, LLMs offer the advantage of robust semantic understanding. By setting prompts, we can explicitly inform the model when a feature's value is missing, without the need for imputation. For the multi-objective learning strategy, the model is designed to first predict disease severity and then predict clinical outcomes. Given that LLMs utilize both the input text and the generated tokens as input for generating the next token, the predicted severity is used as a basis for generating the clinical outcome. During the fine-tuning of the LLM, the two objectives influence and improve each other. Our experiments were implemented based on the ChatGLM model. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of LLMs in this task, suggesting promising potential for further development.</description>

      <title>BatchLLM: Optimizing Large Batched LLM Inference with Global Prefix Sharing and Throughput-oriented Token Batching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many LLM tasks are performed in large batches or even offline, and the performance indictor for which is throughput. These tasks usually show the characteristic of prefix sharing, where different prompt input can partially show the common prefix. However, the existing LLM inference engines tend to optimize the streaming requests and show limitations of supporting the large batched tasks with the prefix sharing characteristic. The existing solutions use the LRU-based cache to reuse the KV context of common prefix. The KV context that is about to be reused may prematurely be evicted with the implicit cache management. Even if not evicted, the lifetime of the shared KV context is extended since requests sharing the same context are not scheduled together, resulting in larger memory usage. These streaming oriented systems schedule the requests in the first-come-first-serve or similar order. As a result, the requests with larger ratio of decoding steps may be scheduled too late to be able to mix with the prefill chunks to increase the hardware utilization. Besides, the token and request number based batching can limit the size of token-batch, which keeps the GPU from saturating for the iterations dominated by decoding tokens. We propose BatchLLM to address the above problems. BatchLLM explicitly identifies the common prefixes globally. The requests sharing the same prefix will be scheduled together to reuse the KV context the best, which also shrinks the lifetime of common KV memory. BatchLLM reorders the requests and schedules the requests with larger ratio of decoding first to better mix the decoding tokens with the latter prefill chunks and applies memory-centric token batching to enlarge the token-batch sizes, which helps to increase the GPU utilization. Extensive evaluation shows that BatchLLM outperforms vLLM by 1.1x to 2x on a set of microbenchmarks and two typical industry workloads.</description>

      <title>CBEval: A framework for evaluating and interpreting cognitive biases in LLMs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rapid advancements in Large Language models (LLMs) has significantly enhanced their reasoning capabilities. Despite improved performance on benchmarks, LLMs exhibit notable gaps in their cognitive processes. Additionally, as reflections of human-generated data, these models have the potential to inherit cognitive biases, raising concerns about their reasoning and decision making capabilities. In this paper we present a framework to interpret, understand and provide insights into a host of cognitive biases in LLMs. Conducting our research on frontier language models we're able to elucidate reasoning limitations and biases, and provide reasoning behind these biases by constructing influence graphs that identify phrases and words most responsible for biases manifested in LLMs. We further investigate biases such as round number bias and cognitive bias barrier revealed when noting framing effect in language models.</description>

      <title>Chatting with Logs: An exploratory study on Finetuning LLMs for LogQL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Logging is a critical function in modern distributed applications, but the lack of standardization in log query languages and formats creates significant challenges. Developers currently must write ad hoc queries in platform-specific languages, requiring expertise in both the query language and application-specific log details -- an impractical expectation given the variety of platforms and volume of logs and applications. While generating these queries with large language models (LLMs) seems intuitive, we show that current LLMs struggle with log-specific query generation due to the lack of exposure to domain-specific knowledge. We propose a novel natural language (NL) interface to address these inconsistencies and aide log query generation, enabling developers to create queries in a target log query language by providing NL inputs. We further introduce ~\textbf{NL2QL}, a manually annotated, real-world dataset of natural language questions paired with corresponding LogQL queries spread across three log formats, to promote the training and evaluation of NL-to-loq query systems. Using NL2QL, we subsequently fine-tune and evaluate several state of the art LLMs, and demonstrate their improved capability to generate accurate LogQL queries. We perform further ablation studies to demonstrate the effect of additional training data, and the transferability across different log formats. In our experiments, we find up to 75\% improvement of finetuned models to generate LogQL queries compared to non finetuned models.</description>

Abstract: Sustainability development goals (SDGs) are regarded as a universal call to action with the overall objectives of planet protection, ending of poverty, and ensuring peace and prosperity for all people. In order to achieve these objectives, different AI technologies play a major role. Specifically, recommender systems can provide support for organizations and individuals to achieve the defined goals. Recommender systems integrate AI technologies such as machine learning, explainable AI (XAI), case-based reasoning, and constraint solving in order to find and explain user-relevant alternatives from a potentially large set of options. In this article, we summarize the state of the art in applying recommender systems to support the achievement of sustainability development goals. In this context, we discuss open issues for future research.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Single Event Upsets in Deep Neural Networks for Semantic Segmentation: an embedded system perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the deployment of artifical intelligence (AI) algorithms at edge devices becomes increasingly prevalent, enhancing the robustness and reliability of autonomous AI-based perception and decision systems is becoming as relevant as precision and performance, especially in applications areas considered safety-critical such as autonomous driving and aerospace. This paper delves into the robustness assessment in embedded Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), particularly focusing on the impact of parameter perturbations produced by single event upsets (SEUs) on convolutional neural networks (CNN) for image semantic segmentation. By scrutinizing the layer-by-layer and bit-by-bit sensitivity of various encoder-decoder models to soft errors, this study thoroughly investigates the vulnerability of segmentation DNNs to SEUs and evaluates the consequences of techniques like model pruning and parameter quantization on the robustness of compressed models aimed at embedded implementations. The findings offer valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying SEU-induced failures that allow for evaluating the robustness of DNNs once trained in advance. Moreover, based on the collected data, we propose a set of practical lightweight error mitigation techniques with no memory or computational cost suitable for resource-constrained deployments. The code used to perform the fault injection (FI) campaign is available at https://github.com/jonGuti13/TensorFI2 , while the code to implement proposed techniques is available at https://github.com/jonGuti13/parameterProtection .</description>

      <title>Personalizing Multimodal Large Language Models for Image Captioning: An Experimental Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The task of image captioning demands an algorithm to generate natural language descriptions of visual inputs. Recent advancements have seen a convergence between image captioning research and the development of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal LLMs -- like GPT-4V and Gemini -- which extend the capabilities of text-only LLMs to multiple modalities. This paper investigates whether Multimodal LLMs can supplant traditional image captioning networks by evaluating their performance on various image description benchmarks. We explore both the zero-shot capabilities of these models and their adaptability to different semantic domains through fine-tuning methods, including prompt learning, prefix tuning, and low-rank adaptation. Our results demonstrate that while Multimodal LLMs achieve impressive zero-shot performance, fine-tuning for specific domains while maintaining their generalization capabilities intact remains challenging. We discuss the implications of these findings for future research in image captioning and the development of more adaptable Multimodal LLMs.</description>

      <title>Tight Lower Bounds and Improved Convergence in Performative Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Performative prediction is a framework accounting for the shift in the data distribution induced by the prediction of a model deployed in the real world. Ensuring rapid convergence to a stable solution where the data distribution remains the same after the model deployment is crucial, especially in evolving environments. This paper extends the Repeated Risk Minimization (RRM) framework by utilizing historical datasets from previous retraining snapshots, yielding a class of algorithms that we call Affine Risk Minimizers and enabling convergence to a performatively stable point for a broader class of problems. We introduce a new upper bound for methods that use only the final iteration of the dataset and prove for the first time the tightness of both this new bound and the previous existing bounds within the same regime. We also prove that utilizing historical datasets can surpass the lower bound for last iterate RRM, and empirically observe faster convergence to the stable point on various performative prediction benchmarks. We offer at the same time the first lower bound analysis for RRM within the class of Affine Risk Minimizers, quantifying the potential improvements in convergence speed that could be achieved with other variants in our framework.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce JPC, a JAX library for training neural networks with Predictive Coding. JPC provides a simple, fast and flexible interface to train a variety of PC networks (PCNs) including discriminative, generative and hybrid models. Unlike existing libraries, JPC leverages ordinary differential equation solvers to integrate the gradient flow inference dynamics of PCNs. We find that a second-order solver achieves significantly faster runtimes compared to standard Euler integration, with comparable performance on a range of tasks and network depths. JPC also provides some theoretical tools that can be used to study PCNs. We hope that JPC will facilitate future research of PC.

      <title>Designing DNNs for a trade-off between robustness and processing performance in embedded devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning-based embedded systems employed in safety-critical applications such as aerospace and autonomous driving need to be robust against perturbations produced by soft errors. Soft errors are an increasing concern in modern digital processors since smaller transistor geometries and lower voltages give electronic devices a higher sensitivity to background radiation. The resilience of deep neural network (DNN) models to perturbations in their parameters is determined, to a large extent, by the structure of the model itself, and also by the selected numerical representation and used arithmetic precision. When compression techniques such as model pruning and model quantization are applied to reduce memory footprint and computational complexity for deployment, both model structure and numerical representation are modified and thus, soft error robustness also changes. In this sense, although the choice of activation functions (AFs) in DNN models is frequently ignored, it conditions not only their accuracy and trainability, but also compressibility rates and numerical robustness. This paper investigates the suitability of using bounded AFs to improve model robustness against DNN parameter perturbations, assessing at the same time the impact of this choice on deployment in terms of model accuracy, compressibility, and computational burden. In particular, we analyze encoder-decoder fully convolutional models aimed at performing semantic segmentation tasks on hyperspectral images for scene understanding in autonomous driving. Deployment characterization is performed experimentally on an AMD-Xilinx's KV260 SoM.</description>

      <title>Predicting Pedestrian Crossing Behavior in Germany and Japan: Insights into Model Transferability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting pedestrian crossing behavior is important for intelligent traffic systems to avoid pedestrian-vehicle collisions. Most existing pedestrian crossing behavior models are trained and evaluated on datasets collected from a single country, overlooking differences between countries. To address this gap, we compared pedestrian road-crossing behavior at unsignalized crossings in Germany and Japan. We presented four types of machine learning models to predict gap selection behavior, zebra crossing usage, and their trajectories using simulator data collected from both countries. When comparing the differences between countries, pedestrians from the study conducted in Japan are more cautious, selecting larger gaps compared to those in Germany. We evaluate and analyze model transferability. Our results show that neural networks outperform other machine learning models in predicting gap selection and zebra crossing usage, while random forest models perform best on trajectory prediction tasks, demonstrating strong performance and transferability. We develop a transferable model using an unsupervised clustering method, which improves prediction accuracy for gap selection and trajectory prediction. These findings provide a deeper understanding of pedestrian crossing behaviors in different countries and offer valuable insights into model transferability.</description>

      <title>System Test Case Design from Requirements Specifications: Insights and Challenges of Using ChatGPT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: System testing is essential in any software development project to ensure that the final products meet the requirements. Creating comprehensive test cases for system testing from requirements is often challenging and time-consuming. This paper explores the effectiveness of using Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate test case designs from Software Requirements Specification (SRS) documents. In this study, we collected the SRS documents of five software engineering projects containing functional and non-functional requirements, which were implemented, tested, and delivered by respective developer teams. For generating test case designs, we used ChatGPT-4o Turbo model. We employed prompt-chaining, starting with an initial context-setting prompt, followed by prompts to generate test cases for each use case. We assessed the quality of the generated test case designs through feedback from the same developer teams as mentioned above. Our experiments show that about 87 percent of the generated test cases were valid, with the remaining 13 percent either not applicable or redundant. Notably, 15 percent of the valid test cases were previously not considered by developers in their testing. We also tasked ChatGPT with identifying redundant test cases, which were subsequently validated by the respective developers to identify false positives and to uncover any redundant test cases that may have been missed by the developers themselves. This study highlights the potential of leveraging LLMs for test generation from the Requirements Specification document and also for assisting developers in quickly identifying and addressing redundancies, ultimately improving test suite quality and efficiency of the testing procedure.</description>

      <title>CIKAN: Constraint Informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks for Autonomous Spacecraft Rendezvous using Time Shift Governor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper considers a Constrained-Informed Neural Network (CINN) approximation for the Time Shift Governor (TSG), which is an add-on scheme to the nominal closed-loop system used to enforce constraints by time-shifting the reference trajectory in spacecraft rendezvous applications. We incorporate Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), an emerging architecture in the AI community, as a fundamental component of CINN and propose a Constrained-Informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (CIKAN)-based approximation for TSG. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the CIKAN-based TSG through simulations of constrained spacecraft rendezvous missions on highly elliptic orbits and present comparisons between CIKANs, MLP-based CINNs, and the conventional TSG.</description>

      <title>PathletRL++: Optimizing Trajectory Pathlet Extraction and Dictionary Formation via Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advances in tracking technologies have spurred the rapid growth of large-scale trajectory data. Building a compact collection of pathlets, referred to as a trajectory pathlet dictionary, is essential for supporting mobility-related applications. Existing methods typically adopt a top-down approach, generating numerous candidate pathlets and selecting a subset, leading to high memory usage and redundant storage from overlapping pathlets. To overcome these limitations, we propose a bottom-up strategy that incrementally merges basic pathlets to build the dictionary, reducing memory requirements by up to 24,000 times compared to baseline methods. The approach begins with unit-length pathlets and iteratively merges them while optimizing utility, which is defined using newly introduced metrics of trajectory loss and representability. We develop a deep reinforcement learning framework, PathletRL, which utilizes Deep Q-Networks (DQN) to approximate the utility function, resulting in a compact and efficient pathlet dictionary. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques, reducing the size of the constructed dictionary by up to 65.8%. Additionally, our results show that only half of the dictionary pathlets are needed to reconstruct 85% of the original trajectory data. Building on PathletRL, we introduce PathletRL++, which extends the original model by incorporating a richer state representation and an improved reward function to optimize decision-making during pathlet merging. These enhancements enable the agent to gain a more nuanced understanding of the environment, leading to higher-quality pathlet dictionaries. PathletRL++ achieves even greater dictionary size reduction, surpassing the performance of PathletRL, while maintaining high trajectory representability.</description>

      <title>ParetoFlow: Guided Flows in Multi-Objective Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In offline multi-objective optimization (MOO), we leverage an offline dataset of designs and their associated labels to simultaneously minimize multiple objectives. This setting more closely mirrors complex real-world problems compared to single-objective optimization. Recent works mainly employ evolutionary algorithms and Bayesian optimization, with limited attention given to the generative modeling capabilities inherent in such data. In this study, we explore generative modeling in offline MOO through flow matching, noted for its effectiveness and efficiency. We introduce ParetoFlow, specifically designed to guide flow sampling to approximate the Pareto front. Traditional predictor (classifier) guidance is inadequate for this purpose because it models only a single objective. In response, we propose a multi-objective predictor guidance module that assigns each sample a weight vector, representing a weighted distribution across multiple objective predictions. A local filtering scheme is introduced to address non-convex Pareto fronts. These weights uniformly cover the entire objective space, effectively directing sample generation towards the Pareto front. Since distributions with similar weights tend to generate similar samples, we introduce a neighboring evolution module to foster knowledge sharing among neighboring distributions. This module generates offspring from these distributions, and selects the most promising one for the next iteration. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across various tasks.</description>

      <title>From Language Models over Tokens to Language Models over Characters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern language models are internally -- and mathematically -- distributions over token strings rather than \emph{character} strings, posing numerous challenges for programmers building user applications on top of them. For example, if a prompt is specified as a character string, it must be tokenized before passing it to the token-level language model. Thus, the tokenizer and consequent analyses are very sensitive to the specification of the prompt (e.g., if the prompt ends with a space or not). This paper presents algorithms for converting token-level language models to character-level ones. We present both exact and approximate algorithms. In the empirical portion of the paper, we benchmark the practical runtime and approximation quality. We find that -- even with a small computation budget -- our method is able to accurately approximate the character-level distribution (less than 0.00021 excess bits / character) at reasonably fast speeds (46.3 characters / second) on the Llama 3.1 8B language model.</description>

      <title>Deep Variational Bayesian Modeling of Haze Degradation Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Relying on the representation power of neural networks, most recent works have often neglected several factors involved in haze degradation, such as transmission (the amount of light reaching an observer from a scene over distance) and atmospheric light. These factors are generally unknown, making dehazing problems ill-posed and creating inherent uncertainties. To account for such uncertainties and factors involved in haze degradation, we introduce a variational Bayesian framework for single image dehazing. We propose to take not only a clean image and but also transmission map as latent variables, the posterior distributions of which are parameterized by corresponding neural networks: dehazing and transmission networks, respectively. Based on a physical model for haze degradation, our variational Bayesian framework leads to a new objective function that encourages the cooperation between them, facilitating the joint training of and thereby boosting the performance of each other. In our framework, a dehazing network can estimate a clean image independently of a transmission map estimation during inference, introducing no overhead. Furthermore, our model-agnostic framework can be seamlessly incorporated with other existing dehazing networks, greatly enhancing the performance consistently across datasets and models.</description>

      <title>Multi-view Image Diffusion via Coordinate Noise and Fourier Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, text-to-image generation with diffusion models has made significant advancements in both higher fidelity and generalization capabilities compared to previous baselines. However, generating holistic multi-view consistent images from prompts still remains an important and challenging task. To address this challenge, we propose a diffusion process that attends to time-dependent spatial frequencies of features with a novel attention mechanism as well as novel noise initialization technique and cross-attention loss. This Fourier-based attention block focuses on features from non-overlapping regions of the generated scene in order to better align the global appearance. Our noise initialization technique incorporates shared noise and low spatial frequency information derived from pixel coordinates and depth maps to induce noise correlations across views. The cross-attention loss further aligns features sharing the same prompt across the scene. Our technique improves SOTA on several quantitative metrics with qualitatively better results when compared to other state-of-the-art approaches for multi-view consistency.</description>

      <title>Language Model Meets Prototypes: Towards Interpretable Text Classification Models through Prototypical Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pretrained transformer-based Language Models (LMs) are well-known for their ability to achieve significant improvement on NLP tasks, but their black-box nature, which leads to a lack of interpretability, has been a major concern. My dissertation focuses on developing intrinsically interpretable models when using LMs as encoders while maintaining their superior performance via prototypical networks. I initiated my research by investigating enhancements in performance for interpretable models of sarcasm detection. My proposed approach focuses on capturing sentiment incongruity to enhance accuracy while offering instance-based explanations for the classification decisions. Later, I developed a novel white-box multi-head graph attention-based prototype network designed to explain the decisions of text classification models without sacrificing the accuracy of the original black-box LMs. In addition, I am working on extending the attention-based prototype network with contrastive learning to redesign an interpretable graph neural network, aiming to enhance both the interpretability and performance of the model in document classification.</description>

      <title>Modular addition without black-boxes: Compressing explanations of MLPs that compute numerical integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The goal of mechanistic interpretability is discovering simpler, low-rank algorithms implemented by models. While we can compress activations into features, compressing nonlinear feature-maps -- like MLP layers -- is an open problem. In this work, we present the first case study in rigorously compressing nonlinear feature-maps, which are the leading asymptotic bottleneck to compressing small transformer models. We work in the classic setting of the modular addition models, and target a non-vacuous bound on the behaviour of the ReLU MLP in time linear in the parameter-count of the circuit. To study the ReLU MLP analytically, we use the infinite-width lens, which turns post-activation matrix multiplications into approximate integrals. We discover a novel interpretation of} the MLP layer in one-layer transformers implementing the ``pizza'' algorithm: the MLP can be understood as evaluating a quadrature scheme, where each neuron computes the area of a rectangle under the curve of a trigonometric integral identity. Our code is available at https://tinyurl.com/mod-add-integration.</description>

      <title>Expressivity of Representation Learning on Continuous-Time Dynamic Graphs: An Information-Flow Centric Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graphs are ubiquitous in real-world applications, ranging from social networks to biological systems, and have inspired the development of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for learning expressive representations. While most research has centered on static graphs, many real-world scenarios involve dynamic, temporally evolving graphs, motivating the need for Continuous-Time Dynamic Graph (CTDG) models. This paper provides a comprehensive review of Graph Representation Learning (GRL) on CTDGs with a focus on Self-Supervised Representation Learning (SSRL). We introduce a novel theoretical framework that analyzes the expressivity of CTDG models through an Information-Flow (IF) lens, quantifying their ability to propagate and encode temporal and structural information. Leveraging this framework, we categorize existing CTDG methods based on their suitability for different graph types and application scenarios. Within the same scope, we examine the design of SSRL methods tailored to CTDGs, such as predictive and contrastive approaches, highlighting their potential to mitigate the reliance on labeled data. Empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets validate our theoretical insights, demonstrating the strengths and limitations of various methods across long-range, bi-partite and community-based graphs. This work offers both a theoretical foundation and practical guidance for selecting and developing CTDG models, advancing the understanding of GRL in dynamic settings.</description>

      <title>Speech Recognition-based Feature Extraction for Enhanced Automatic Severity Classification in Dysarthric Speech</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to the subjective nature of current clinical evaluation, the need for automatic severity evaluation in dysarthric speech has emerged. DNN models outperform ML models but lack user-friendly explainability. ML models offer explainable results at a feature level, but their performance is comparatively lower. Current ML models extract various features from raw waveforms to predict severity. However, existing methods do not encompass all dysarthric features used in clinical evaluation. To address this gap, we propose a feature extraction method that minimizes information loss. We introduce an ASR transcription as a novel feature extraction source. We finetune the ASR model for dysarthric speech, then use this model to transcribe dysarthric speech and extract word segment boundary information. It enables capturing finer pronunciation and broader prosodic features. These features demonstrated an improved severity prediction performance to existing features: balanced accuracy of 83.72%.</description>

      <title>Coordinate In and Value Out: Training Flow Transformers in Ambient Space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flow matching models have emerged as a powerful method for generative modeling on domains like images or videos, and even on unstructured data like 3D point clouds. These models are commonly trained in two stages: first, a data compressor (i.e., a variational auto-encoder) is trained, and in a subsequent training stage a flow matching generative model is trained in the low-dimensional latent space of the data compressor. This two stage paradigm adds complexity to the overall training recipe and sets obstacles for unifying models across data domains, as specific data compressors are used for different data modalities. To this end, we introduce Ambient Space Flow Transformers (ASFT), a domain-agnostic approach to learn flow matching transformers in ambient space, sidestepping the requirement of training compressors and simplifying the training process. We introduce a conditionally independent point-wise training objective that enables ASFT to make predictions continuously in coordinate space. Our empirical results demonstrate that using general purpose transformer blocks, ASFT effectively handles different data modalities such as images and 3D point clouds, achieving strong performance in both domains and outperforming comparable approaches. ASFT is a promising step towards domain-agnostic flow matching generative models that can be trivially adopted in different data domains.</description>

Abstract: Autonomous driving heavily relies on perception systems to interpret the environment for decision-making. To enhance robustness in these safety critical applications, this paper considers a Deep Ensemble of Deep Neural Network regressors integrated with Conformal Prediction to predict and quantify uncertainties. In the Adaptive Cruise Control setting, the proposed method performs state and uncertainty estimation from RGB images, informing the downstream controller of the DNN perception uncertainties. An adaptive cruise controller using Conformal Tube Model Predictive Control is designed to ensure probabilistic safety. Evaluations with a high-fidelity simulator demonstrate the algorithm's effectiveness in speed tracking and safe distance maintaining, including in Out-Of-Distribution scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes \emph{Episodic and Lifelong Exploration via Maximum ENTropy} (ELEMENT), a novel, multiscale, intrinsically motivated reinforcement learning (RL) framework that is able to explore environments without using any extrinsic reward and transfer effectively the learned skills to downstream tasks. We advance the state of the art in three ways. First, we propose a multiscale entropy optimization to take care of the fact that previous maximum state entropy, for lifelong exploration with millions of state observations, suffers from vanishing rewards and becomes very expensive computationally across iterations. Therefore, we add an episodic maximum entropy over each episode to speedup the search further. Second, we propose a novel intrinsic reward for episodic entropy maximization named \emph{average episodic state entropy} which provides the optimal solution for a theoretical upper bound of the episodic state entropy objective. Third, to speed the lifelong entropy maximization, we propose a $k$ nearest neighbors ($k$NN) graph to organize the estimation of the entropy and updating processes that reduces the computation substantially. Our ELEMENT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art intrinsic rewards in both episodic and lifelong setups. Moreover, it can be exploited in task-agnostic pre-training, collecting data for offline reinforcement learning, etc.</description>

      <title>Agent AI with LangGraph: A Modular Framework for Enhancing Machine Translation Using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the transformative role of Agent AI and LangGraph in advancing the automation and effectiveness of machine translation (MT). Agents are modular components designed to perform specific tasks, such as translating between particular languages, with specializations like TranslateEnAgent, TranslateFrenchAgent, and TranslateJpAgent for English, French, and Japanese translations, respectively. These agents leverage the powerful semantic capabilities of large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4o, to ensure accurate, contextually relevant translations while maintaining modularity, scalability, and context retention.
  LangGraph, a graph-based framework built on LangChain, simplifies the creation and management of these agents and their workflows. It supports dynamic state management, enabling agents to maintain dialogue context and automates complex workflows by linking agents and facilitating their collaboration. With flexibility, open-source community support, and seamless integration with LLMs, LangGraph empowers agents to deliver high-quality translations.
  Together, Agent AI and LangGraph create a cohesive system where LangGraph orchestrates agent interactions, ensuring that user inputs are analyzed, routed, and processed efficiently. Experimental results demonstrate the potential of this system to enhance multilingual translation accuracy and scalability. By highlighting modular design and automated workflows, this paper sets the stage for further innovations in intelligent machine translation services.</description>

      <title>Synergizing LLMs and Knowledge Graphs: A Novel Approach to Software Repository-Related Question Answering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Software repositories contain valuable information for gaining insights into their development process. However, extracting insights from these repository data is time-consuming and requires technical expertise. While software engineering chatbots have been developed to facilitate natural language interactions with repositories, they struggle with understanding natural language and accurately retrieving relevant data. This study aims to improve the accuracy of LLM-based chatbots in answering repository-related questions by augmenting them with knowledge graphs. We achieve this in a two-step approach; (1) constructing a knowledge graph from the repository data and (2) synergizing the knowledge graph with LLM to allow for the natural language questions and answers. We curated a set of 20 questions with different complexities and evaluated our approach on five popular open-source projects. Our approach achieved an accuracy of 65%. We further investigated the limitations and identified six key issues, with the majority relating to the reasoning capability of the LLM. We experimented with a few-shot chain-of-thought prompting to determine if it could enhance our approach. This technique improved the overall accuracy to 84%. Our findings demonstrate the synergy between LLMs and knowledge graphs as a viable solution for making repository data accessible to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Binary: Capturing Diverse Preferences With Reward Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed via public-facing interfaces to interact with millions of users, each with diverse preferences. Despite this, preference tuning of LLMs predominantly relies on reward models trained using binary judgments where annotators select the preferred choice out of pairs of model outputs. In this work, we argue that this reliance on binary choices does not capture the broader, aggregate preferences of the target user in real-world tasks. We propose a taxonomy that identifies two dimensions of subjectivity where different users disagree on the preferred output-namely, the Plurality of Responses to Prompts, where prompts allow for multiple correct answers, and the Indistinguishability of Responses, where candidate outputs are paraphrases of each other. We show that reward models correlate weakly with user preferences in these cases. As a first step to address this issue, we introduce a simple yet effective method that augments existing binary preference datasets with synthetic preference judgments to estimate potential user disagreement. Incorporating these via a margin term as a form of regularization during model training yields predictions that better align with the aggregate user preferences.</description>

      <title>LL-ICM: Image Compression for Low-level Machine Vision via Large Vision-Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Image Compression for Machines (ICM) aims to compress images for machine vision tasks rather than human viewing. Current works predominantly concentrate on high-level tasks like object detection and semantic segmentation. However, the quality of original images is usually not guaranteed in the real world, leading to even worse perceptual quality or downstream task performance after compression. Low-level (LL) machine vision models, like image restoration models, can help improve such quality, and thereby their compression requirements should also be considered. In this paper, we propose a pioneered ICM framework for LL machine vision tasks, namely LL-ICM. By jointly optimizing compression and LL tasks, the proposed LL-ICM not only enriches its encoding ability in generalizing to versatile LL tasks but also optimizes the processing ability of down-stream LL task models, achieving mutual adaptation for image codecs and LL task models. Furthermore, we integrate large-scale vision-language models into the LL-ICM framework to generate more universal and distortion-robust feature embeddings for LL vision tasks. Therefore, one LL-ICM codec can generalize to multiple tasks. We establish a solid benchmark to evaluate LL-ICM, which includes extensive objective experiments by using both full and no-reference image quality assessments. Experimental results show that LL-ICM can achieve 22.65% BD-rate reductions over the state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>HybridGS: Decoupling Transients and Statics with 2D and 3D Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generating high-quality novel view renderings of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) in scenes featuring transient objects is challenging. We propose a novel hybrid representation, termed as HybridGS, using 2D Gaussians for transient objects per image and maintaining traditional 3D Gaussians for the whole static scenes. Note that, the 3DGS itself is better suited for modeling static scenes that assume multi-view consistency, but the transient objects appear occasionally and do not adhere to the assumption, thus we model them as planar objects from a single view, represented with 2D Gaussians. Our novel representation decomposes the scene from the perspective of fundamental viewpoint consistency, making it more reasonable. Additionally, we present a novel multi-view regulated supervision method for 3DGS that leverages information from co-visible regions, further enhancing the distinctions between the transients and statics. Then, we propose a straightforward yet effective multi-stage training strategy to ensure robust training and high-quality view synthesis across various settings. Experiments on benchmark datasets show our state-of-the-art performance of novel view synthesis in both indoor and outdoor scenes, even in the presence of distracting elements.</description>

      <title>What Do Machine Learning Researchers Mean by "Reproducible"?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The concern that Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are entering a "reproducibility crisis" has spurred significant research in the past few years. Yet with each paper, it is often unclear what someone means by "reproducibility". Our work attempts to clarify the scope of "reproducibility" as displayed by the community at large. In doing so, we propose to refine the research to eight general topic areas. In this light, we see that each of these areas contains many works that do not advertise themselves as being about "reproducibility", in part because they go back decades before the matter came to broader attention.</description>

      <title>Training MLPs on Graphs without Supervision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated their effectiveness in various graph learning tasks, yet their reliance on neighborhood aggregation during inference poses challenges for deployment in latency-sensitive applications, such as real-time financial fraud detection. To address this limitation, recent studies have proposed distilling knowledge from teacher GNNs into student Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) trained on node content, aiming to accelerate inference. However, these approaches often inadequately explore structural information when inferring unseen nodes. To this end, we introduce SimMLP, a Self-supervised framework for learning MLPs on graphs, designed to fully integrate rich structural information into MLPs. Notably, SimMLP is the first MLP-learning method that can achieve equivalence to GNNs in the optimal case. The key idea is to employ self-supervised learning to align the representations encoded by graph context-aware GNNs and neighborhood dependency-free MLPs, thereby fully integrating the structural information into MLPs. We provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis, demonstrating the equivalence between SimMLP and GNNs based on mutual information and inductive bias, highlighting SimMLP's advanced structural learning capabilities. Additionally, we conduct extensive experiments on 20 benchmark datasets, covering node classification, link prediction, and graph classification, to showcase SimMLP's superiority over state-of-the-art baselines, particularly in scenarios involving unseen nodes (e.g., inductive and cold-start node classification) where structural insights are crucial. Our codes are available at: https://github.com/Zehong-Wang/SimMLP.</description>

      <title>AyutthayaAlpha: A Thai-Latin Script Transliteration Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study introduces AyutthayaAlpha, an advanced transformer-based machine learning model designed for the transliteration of Thai proper names into Latin script. Our system achieves state-of-the-art performance with 82.32% first-token accuracy and 95.24% first-three-token accuracy, while maintaining a low character error rate of 0.0047. The complexity of Thai phonology, including tonal features and vowel length distinctions, presents significant challenges for accurate transliteration, which we address through a novel two-model approach: AyutthayaAlpha-Small, based on the ByT5 architecture, and AyutthayaAlpha-VerySmall, a computationally efficient variant that unexpectedly outperforms its larger counterpart. Our research combines linguistic rules with deep learning, training on a carefully curated dataset of 1.2 million Thai-Latin name pairs, augmented through strategic upsampling to 2.7 million examples. Extensive evaluations against existing transliteration methods and human expert benchmarks demonstrate that AyutthayaAlpha not only achieves superior accuracy but also effectively captures personal and cultural preferences in name romanization. The system's practical applications extend to cross-lingual information retrieval, international data standardization, and identity verification systems, with particular relevance for government databases, academic institutions, and global business operations. This work represents a significant advance in bridging linguistic gaps between Thai and Latin scripts, while respecting the cultural and personal dimensions of name transliteration.</description>

      <title>Weak-to-Strong Generalization Through the Data-Centric Lens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The weak-to-strong generalization phenomenon is the driver for important machine learning applications including highly data-efficient learning and, most recently, performing superalignment. While decades of research have resulted in numerous algorithms that produce strong empirical performance, understanding what aspects of data enable weak-to-strong generalization has been understudied. We propose a simple data-centric mechanism that characterizes weak-to-strong generalization: the overlap density. Intuitively, generalization tracks the number of points that contain overlaps, i.e., both easy patterns (learnable by a weak model) and challenging patterns (only learnable by a stronger model), as with such points, weak predictions can be used to learn challenging patterns by stronger models. We provide a practical overlap detection algorithm to find such points in datasets and leverage them to learn, among multiple sources of data, which to query when seeking to maximize overlap density and thereby enhance weak-to-strong generalization. We present a theoretical result showing that the generalization benefit is a function of the overlap density and a regret bound for our data selection algorithm. Empirically, we validate the mechanism and the overlap detection algorithm on a wide array of settings.</description>

      <title>Uniform Discretized Integrated Gradients: An effective attribution based method for explaining large language models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrated Gradients is a well-known technique for explaining deep learning models. It calculates feature importance scores by employing a gradient based approach computing gradients of the model output with respect to input features and accumulating them along a linear path. While this works well for continuous features spaces, it may not be the most optimal way to deal with discrete spaces like word embeddings. For interpreting LLMs (Large Language Models), there exists a need for a non-linear path where intermediate points, whose gradients are to be computed, lie close to actual words in the embedding space. In this paper, we propose a method called Uniform Discretized Integrated Gradients (UDIG) based on a new interpolation strategy where we choose a favorable nonlinear path for computing attribution scores suitable for predictive language models. We evaluate our method on two types of NLP tasks- Sentiment Classification and Question Answering against three metrics viz Log odds, Comprehensiveness and Sufficiency. For sentiment classification, we have used the SST2, IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes datasets for benchmarking and for Question Answering, we have used the fine-tuned BERT model on SQuAD dataset. Our approach outperforms the existing methods in almost all the metrics.</description>

      <title>Dual-Branch Subpixel-Guided Network for Hyperspectral Image Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03893v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning (DL) has been widely applied into hyperspectral image (HSI) classification owing to its promising feature learning and representation capabilities. However, limited by the spatial resolution of sensors, existing DL-based classification approaches mainly focus on pixel-level spectral and spatial information extraction through complex network architecture design, while ignoring the existence of mixed pixels in actual scenarios. To tackle this difficulty, we propose a novel dual-branch subpixel-guided network for HSI classification, called DSNet, which automatically integrates subpixel information and convolutional class features by introducing a deep autoencoder unmixing architecture to enhance classification performance. DSNet is capable of fully considering physically nonlinear properties within subpixels and adaptively generating diagnostic abundances in an unsupervised manner to achieve more reliable decision boundaries for class label distributions. The subpixel fusion module is designed to ensure high-quality information fusion across pixel and subpixel features, further promoting stable joint classification. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of DSNet compared with state-of-the-art DL-based HSI classification approaches. The codes will be available at https://github.com/hanzhu97702/DSNet, contributing to the remote sensing community.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The android operating system is being installed in most of the smart devices. The introduction of intrusions in such operating systems is rising at a tremendous rate. With the introduction of such malicious data streams, the smart devices are being subjected to various attacks like Phishing, Spyware, SMS Fraud, Bots and Banking-Trojans and many such. The application of machine learning classification algorithms for the security of android APK files is used in this paper. Each apk data stream was marked to be either malicious or non malicious on the basis of different parameters. The machine learning classification techniques are then used to classify whether the newly installed applications' signature falls within the malicious or non-malicious domain. If it falls within the malicious category, appropriate action can be taken, and the Android operating system can be shielded against illegal activities.</description>

      <title>A Noise is Worth Diffusion Guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models excel in generating high-quality images. However, current diffusion models struggle to produce reliable images without guidance methods, such as classifier-free guidance (CFG). Are guidance methods truly necessary? Observing that noise obtained via diffusion inversion can reconstruct high-quality images without guidance, we focus on the initial noise of the denoising pipeline. By mapping Gaussian noise to `guidance-free noise', we uncover that small low-magnitude low-frequency components significantly enhance the denoising process, removing the need for guidance and thus improving both inference throughput and memory. Expanding on this, we propose \ours, a novel method that replaces guidance methods with a single refinement of the initial noise. This refined noise enables high-quality image generation without guidance, within the same diffusion pipeline. Our noise-refining model leverages efficient noise-space learning, achieving rapid convergence and strong performance with just 50K text-image pairs. We validate its effectiveness across diverse metrics and analyze how refined noise can eliminate the need for guidance. See our project page: https://cvlab-kaist.github.io/NoiseRefine/.</description>

      <title>Integrating Various Software Artifacts for Better LLM-based Bug Localization and Program Repair</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: LLMs have garnered considerable attention for their potential to streamline Automated Program Repair (APR). LLM-based approaches can either insert the correct code or directly generate patches when provided with buggy methods. However, most of LLM-based APR methods rely on a single type of software information, without fully leveraging different software artifacts. Despite this, many LLM-based approaches do not explore which specific types of information best assist in APR. Addressing this gap is crucial for advancing LLM-based APR techniques. We propose DEVLoRe to use issue content (description and message) and stack error traces to localize buggy methods, then rely on debug information in buggy methods and issue content and stack error to localize buggy lines and generate plausible patches which can pass all unit tests. The results show that while issue content is particularly effective in assisting LLMs with fault localization and program repair, different types of software artifacts complement each other. By incorporating different artifacts, DEVLoRe successfully locates 49.3% and 47.6% of single and non-single buggy methods and generates 56.0% and 14.5% plausible patches for the Defects4J v2.0 dataset, respectively. This outperforms current state-of-the-art APR methods. The source code and experimental results of this work for replication are available at https://github.com/XYZboom/DEVLoRe.</description>

      <title>A Survey on Large Language Model-Based Social Agents in Game-Theoretic Scenarios</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Game-theoretic scenarios have become pivotal in evaluating the social intelligence of Large Language Model (LLM)-based social agents. While numerous studies have explored these agents in such settings, there is a lack of a comprehensive survey summarizing the current progress. To address this gap, we systematically review existing research on LLM-based social agents within game-theoretic scenarios. Our survey organizes the findings into three core components: Game Framework, Social Agent, and Evaluation Protocol. The game framework encompasses diverse game scenarios, ranging from choice-focusing to communication-focusing games. The social agent part explores agents' preferences, beliefs, and reasoning abilities. The evaluation protocol covers both game-agnostic and game-specific metrics for assessing agent performance. By reflecting on the current research and identifying future research directions, this survey provides insights to advance the development and evaluation of social agents in game-theoretic scenarios.</description>

      <title>MT3DNet: Multi-Task learning Network for 3D Surgical Scene Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In image-assisted minimally invasive surgeries (MIS), understanding surgical scenes is vital for real-time feedback to surgeons, skill evaluation, and improving outcomes through collaborative human-robot procedures. Within this context, the challenge lies in accurately detecting, segmenting, and estimating the depth of surgical scenes depicted in high-resolution images, while simultaneously reconstructing the scene in 3D and providing segmentation of surgical instruments along with detection labels for each instrument. To address this challenge, a novel Multi-Task Learning (MTL) network is proposed for performing these tasks concurrently. A key aspect of this approach involves overcoming the optimization hurdles associated with handling multiple tasks concurrently by integrating a Adversarial Weight Update into the MTL framework, the proposed MTL model achieves 3D reconstruction through the integration of segmentation, depth estimation, and object detection, thereby enhancing the understanding of surgical scenes, which marks a significant advancement compared to existing studies that lack 3D capabilities.

      <title>MIND: Effective Incorrect Assignment Detection through a Multi-Modal Structure-Enhanced Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid growth of academic publications has exacerbated the issue of author name ambiguity in online digital libraries. Despite advances in name disambiguation algorithms, cumulative errors continue to undermine the reliability of academic systems. It is estimated that over 10% paper-author assignments are rectified when constructing the million-scale WhoIsWho benchmark. Existing endeavors to detect incorrect assignments are either semantic-based or graph-based approaches, which fall short of making full use of the rich text attributes of papers and implicit structural features defined via the co-occurrence of paper attributes. To this end, this paper introduces a structure-enhanced language model that combines key structural features from graph-based methods with fine-grained semantic features from rich paper attributes to detect incorrect assignments. The proposed model is trained with a highly effective multi-modal multi-turn instruction tuning framework, which incorporates task-guided instruction tuning, text-attribute modality, and structural modality. Experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms previous approaches, achieving top performance on the leaderboard of KDD Cup 2024. Our code has been publicly available.</description>

      <title>InfiniCube: Unbounded and Controllable Dynamic 3D Driving Scene Generation with World-Guided Video Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present InfiniCube, a scalable method for generating unbounded dynamic 3D driving scenes with high fidelity and controllability. Previous methods for scene generation either suffer from limited scales or lack geometric and appearance consistency along generated sequences. In contrast, we leverage the recent advancements in scalable 3D representation and video models to achieve large dynamic scene generation that allows flexible controls through HD maps, vehicle bounding boxes, and text descriptions. First, we construct a map-conditioned sparse-voxel-based 3D generative model to unleash its power for unbounded voxel world generation. Then, we re-purpose a video model and ground it on the voxel world through a set of carefully designed pixel-aligned guidance buffers, synthesizing a consistent appearance. Finally, we propose a fast feed-forward approach that employs both voxel and pixel branches to lift the dynamic videos to dynamic 3D Gaussians with controllable objects. Our method can generate controllable and realistic 3D driving scenes, and extensive experiments validate the effectiveness and superiority of our model.</description>

      <title>Enhancing and Accelerating Diffusion-Based Inverse Problem Solving through Measurements Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have recently demonstrated notable success in solving inverse problems. However, current diffusion model-based solutions typically require a large number of function evaluations (NFEs) to generate high-quality images conditioned on measurements, as they incorporate only limited information at each step. To accelerate the diffusion-based inverse problem-solving process, we introduce \textbf{M}easurements \textbf{O}ptimization (MO), a more efficient plug-and-play module for integrating measurement information at each step of the inverse problem-solving process. This method is comprehensively evaluated across eight diverse linear and nonlinear tasks on the FFHQ and ImageNet datasets. By using MO, we establish state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across multiple tasks, with key advantages: (1) it operates with no more than 100 NFEs, with phase retrieval on ImageNet being the sole exception; (2) it achieves SOTA or near-SOTA results even at low NFE counts; and (3) it can be seamlessly integrated into existing diffusion model-based solutions for inverse problems, such as DPS \cite{chung2022diffusion} and Red-diff \cite{mardani2023variational}. For example, DPS-MO attains a peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of 28.71 dB on the FFHQ 256 dataset for high dynamic range imaging, setting a new SOTA benchmark with only 100 NFEs, whereas current methods require between 1000 and 4000 NFEs for comparable performance.</description>

      <title>A Framework For Image Synthesis Using Supervised Contrastive Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) generation aims at producing realistic images corresponding to text descriptions. Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) has proven to be successful in this task. Typical T2I GANs are 2 phase methods that first pretrain an inter-modal representation from aligned image-text pairs and then use GAN to train image generator on that basis. However, such representation ignores the inner-modal semantic correspondence, e.g. the images with same label. The semantic label in priory describes the inherent distribution pattern with underlying cross-image relationships, which is supplement to the text description for understanding the full characteristics of image. In this paper, we propose a framework leveraging both inter- and inner-modal correspondence by label guided supervised contrastive learning. We extend the T2I GANs to two parameter-sharing contrast branches in both pretraining and generation phases. This integration effectively clusters the semantically similar image-text pair representations, thereby fostering the generation of higher-quality images. We demonstrate our framework on four novel T2I GANs by both single-object dataset CUB and multi-object dataset COCO, achieving significant improvements in the Inception Score (IS) and Frechet Inception Distance (FID) metrics of imagegeneration evaluation. Notably, on more complex multi-object COCO, our framework improves FID by 30.1%, 27.3%, 16.2% and 17.1% for AttnGAN, DM-GAN, SSA-GAN and GALIP, respectively. We also validate our superiority by comparing with other label guided T2I GANs. The results affirm the effectiveness and competitiveness of our approach in advancing the state-of-the-art GAN for T2I generation</description>

      <title>Augmenting Minds or Automating Skills: The Differential Role of Human Capital in Generative AI's Impact on Creative Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative AI is rapidly reshaping creative work, raising critical questions about its beneficiaries and societal implications. This study challenges prevailing assumptions by exploring how generative AI interacts with diverse forms of human capital in creative tasks. Through two random controlled experiments in flash fiction writing and song composition, we uncover a paradox: while AI democratizes access to creative tools, it simultaneously amplifies cognitive inequalities. Our findings reveal that AI enhances general human capital (cognitive abilities and education) by facilitating adaptability and idea integration but diminishes the value of domain-specific expertise. We introduce a novel theoretical framework that merges human capital theory with the automation-augmentation perspective, offering a nuanced understanding of human-AI collaboration. This framework elucidates how AI shifts the locus of creative advantage from specialized expertise to broader cognitive adaptability. Contrary to the notion of AI as a universal equalizer, our work highlights its potential to exacerbate disparities in skill valuation, reshaping workplace hierarchies and redefining the nature of creativity in the AI era. These insights advance theories of human capital and automation while providing actionable guidance for organizations navigating AI integration amidst workforce inequalities.</description>

      <title>A Data-Driven Framework for Discovering Fractional Differential Equations in Complex Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In complex physical systems, conventional differential equations often fall short in capturing non-local and memory effects, as they are limited to local dynamics and integer-order interactions. This study introduces a stepwise data-driven framework for discovering fractional differential equations (FDEs) directly from data. FDEs, known for their capacity to model non-local dynamics with fewer parameters than integer-order derivatives, can represent complex systems with long-range interactions. Our framework applies deep neural networks as surrogate models for denoising and reconstructing sparse and noisy observations while using Gaussian-Jacobi quadrature to handle the challenges posed by singularities in fractional derivatives. To optimize both the sparse coefficients and fractional order, we employ an alternating optimization approach that combines sparse regression with global optimization techniques. We validate the framework across various datasets, including synthetic anomalous diffusion data, experimental data on the creep behavior of frozen soils, and single-particle trajectories modeled by L\'{e}vy motion. Results demonstrate the framework's robustness in identifying the structure of FDEs across diverse noise levels and its capacity to capture integer-order dynamics, offering a flexible approach for modeling memory effects in complex systems.</description>

      <title>Exploring Fully Convolutional Networks for the Segmentation of Hyperspectral Imaging Applied to Advanced Driver Assistance Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) are designed with the main purpose of increasing the safety and comfort of vehicle occupants. Most of current computer vision-based ADAS perform detection and tracking tasks quite successfully under regular conditions, but are not completely reliable, particularly under adverse weather and changing lighting conditions, neither in complex situations with many overlapping objects. In this work we explore the use of hyperspectral imaging (HSI) in ADAS on the assumption that the distinct near infrared (NIR) spectral reflectances of different materials can help to better separate the objects in a driving scene. In particular, this paper describes some experimental results of the application of fully convolutional networks (FCN) to the image segmentation of HSI for ADAS applications. More specifically, our aim is to investigate to what extent the spatial features codified by convolutional filters can be helpful to improve the performance of HSI segmentation systems. With that aim, we use the HSI-Drive v1.1 dataset, which provides a set of labelled images recorded in real driving conditions with a small-size snapshot NIR-HSI camera. Finally, we analyze the implementability of such a HSI segmentation system by prototyping the developed FCN model together with the necessary hyperspectral cube preprocessing stage and characterizing its performance on an MPSoC.</description>

      <title>MTMT: Consolidating Multiple Thinking Modes to Form a Thought Tree for Strengthening LLM</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown limitations in tasks requiring complex logical reasoning and multi-step problem-solving. To address these challenges, researchers have employed carefully designed prompts and flowcharts, simulating human cognitive processes to enhance LLM performance, such as the Chain of Thought approach. In this paper, we introduce MTMT (Multi-thinking Modes Tree), a novel method that interacts with LLMs to construct a thought tree, simulating various advanced cognitive processes, including but not limited to association, counterfactual thinking, task decomposition, and comparison. By breaking down the original complex task into simpler sub-questions, MTMT facilitates easier problem-solving for LLMs, enabling more effective utilization of the latent knowledge within LLMs. We evaluate the performance of MTMT under different parameter configurations, using GPT-4o mini as the base model. Our results demonstrate that integrating multiple modes of thinking significantly enhances the ability of LLMs to handle complex tasks.</description>

      <title>LaserGuider: A Laser Based Physical Backdoor Attack against Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Backdoor attacks embed hidden associations between triggers and targets in deep neural networks (DNNs), causing them to predict the target when a trigger is present while maintaining normal behavior otherwise. Physical backdoor attacks, which use physical objects as triggers, are feasible but lack remote control, temporal stealthiness, flexibility, and mobility. To overcome these limitations, in this work, we propose a new type of backdoor triggers utilizing lasers that feature long-distance transmission and instant-imaging properties. Based on the laser-based backdoor triggers, we present a physical backdoor attack, called LaserGuider, which possesses remote control ability and achieves high temporal stealthiness, flexibility, and mobility. We also introduce a systematic approach to optimize laser parameters for improving attack effectiveness. Our evaluation on traffic sign recognition DNNs, critical in autonomous vehicles, demonstrates that LaserGuider with three different laser-based triggers achieves over 90% attack success rate with negligible impact on normal inputs. Additionally, we release LaserMark, the first dataset of real world traffic signs stamped with physical laser spots, to support further research in backdoor attacks and defenses.</description>

      <title>Deep-Unrolling Multidimensional Harmonic Retrieval Algorithms on Neuromorphic Hardware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04008v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the potential of conversion-based neuromorphic algorithms for highly accurate and energy-efficient single-snapshot multidimensional harmonic retrieval (MHR). By casting the MHR problem as a sparse recovery problem, we devise the currently proposed, deep-unrolling-based Structured Learned Iterative Shrinkage and Thresholding (S-LISTA) algorithm to solve it efficiently using complex-valued convolutional neural networks with complex-valued activations, which are trained using a supervised regression objective. Afterward, a novel method for converting the complex-valued convolutional layers and activations into spiking neural networks (SNNs) is developed. At the heart of this method lies the recently proposed Few Spikes (FS) conversion, which is extended by modifying the neuron model's parameters and internal dynamics to account for the inherent coupling between real and imaginary parts in complex-valued computations. Finally, the converted SNNs are mapped onto the SpiNNaker2 neuromorphic board, and a comparison in terms of estimation accuracy and power efficiency between the original CNNs deployed on an NVIDIA Jetson Xavier and the SNNs is being conducted. The measurement results show that the converted SNNs achieve almost five-fold power efficiency at moderate performance loss compared to the original CNNs.</description>

      <title>INFP: Audio-Driven Interactive Head Generation in Dyadic Conversations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Imagine having a conversation with a socially intelligent agent. It can attentively listen to your words and offer visual and linguistic feedback promptly. This seamless interaction allows for multiple rounds of conversation to flow smoothly and naturally. In pursuit of actualizing it, we propose INFP, a novel audio-driven head generation framework for dyadic interaction. Unlike previous head generation works that only focus on single-sided communication, or require manual role assignment and explicit role switching, our model drives the agent portrait dynamically alternates between speaking and listening state, guided by the input dyadic audio. Specifically, INFP comprises a Motion-Based Head Imitation stage and an Audio-Guided Motion Generation stage. The first stage learns to project facial communicative behaviors from real-life conversation videos into a low-dimensional motion latent space, and use the motion latent codes to animate a static image. The second stage learns the mapping from the input dyadic audio to motion latent codes through denoising, leading to the audio-driven head generation in interactive scenarios. To facilitate this line of research, we introduce DyConv, a large scale dataset of rich dyadic conversations collected from the Internet. Extensive experiments and visualizations demonstrate superior performance and effectiveness of our method. Project Page: https://grisoon.github.io/INFP/.</description>

      <title>ZipAR: Accelerating Autoregressive Image Generation through Spatial Locality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose ZipAR, a training-free, plug-and-play parallel decoding framework for accelerating auto-regressive (AR) visual generation. The motivation stems from the observation that images exhibit local structures, and spatially distant regions tend to have minimal interdependence. Given a partially decoded set of visual tokens, in addition to the original next-token prediction scheme in the row dimension, the tokens corresponding to spatially adjacent regions in the column dimension can be decoded in parallel, enabling the ``next-set prediction'' paradigm. By decoding multiple tokens simultaneously in a single forward pass, the number of forward passes required to generate an image is significantly reduced, resulting in a substantial improvement in generation efficiency. Experiments demonstrate that ZipAR can reduce the number of model forward passes by up to 91% on the Emu3-Gen model without requiring any additional retraining.</description>

      <title>Graph Neural Networks Need Cluster-Normalize-Activate Modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are non-Euclidean deep learning models for graph-structured data. Despite their successful and diverse applications, oversmoothing prohibits deep architectures due to node features converging to a single fixed point. This severely limits their potential to solve complex tasks. To counteract this tendency, we propose a plug-and-play module consisting of three steps: Cluster-Normalize-Activate (CNA). By applying CNA modules, GNNs search and form super nodes in each layer, which are normalized and activated individually. We demonstrate in node classification and property prediction tasks that CNA significantly improves the accuracy over the state-of-the-art. Particularly, CNA reaches 94.18% and 95.75% accuracy on Cora and CiteSeer, respectively. It further benefits GNNs in regression tasks as well, reducing the mean squared error compared to all baselines. At the same time, GNNs with CNA require substantially fewer learnable parameters than competing architectures.</description>

      <title>Automated Medical Report Generation for ECG Data: Bridging Medical Text and Signal Processing with Deep Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning and natural language generation have significantly improved image captioning, enabling automated, human-like descriptions for visual content. In this work, we apply these captioning techniques to generate clinician-like interpretations of ECG data. This study leverages existing ECG datasets accompanied by free-text reports authored by healthcare professionals (HCPs) as training data. These reports, while often inconsistent, provide a valuable foundation for automated learning. We introduce an encoder-decoder-based method that uses these reports to train models to generate detailed descriptions of ECG episodes. This represents a significant advancement in ECG analysis automation, with potential applications in zero-shot classification and automated clinical decision support.
  The model is tested on various datasets, including both 1- and 12-lead ECGs. It significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art reference model by Qiu et al., achieving a METEOR score of 55.53% compared to 24.51% achieved by the reference model. Furthermore, several key design choices are discussed, providing a comprehensive overview of current challenges and innovations in this domain.

      <description>arXiv:2412.04081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing demand for efficient resource allocation in mobile networks has catalyzed the exploration of innovative solutions that could enhance the task of real-time cellular traffic prediction. Under these circumstances, federated learning (FL) stands out as a distributed and privacy-preserving solution to foster collaboration among different sites, thus enabling responsive near-the-edge solutions. In this paper, we comprehensively study the potential benefits of FL in telecommunications through a case study on federated traffic forecasting using real-world data from base stations (BSs) in Barcelona (Spain). Our study encompasses relevant aspects within the federated experience, including model aggregation techniques, outlier management, the impact of individual clients, personalized learning, and the integration of exogenous sources of data. The performed evaluation is based on both prediction accuracy and sustainability, thus showcasing the environmental impact of employed FL algorithms in various settings. The findings from our study highlight FL as a promising and robust solution for mobile traffic prediction, emphasizing its twin merits as a privacy-conscious and environmentally sustainable approach, while also demonstrating its capability to overcome data heterogeneity and ensure high-quality predictions, marking a significant stride towards its integration in mobile traffic management systems.</description>

      <title>BodyMetric: Evaluating the Realism of HumanBodies in Text-to-Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately generating images of human bodies from text remains a challenging problem for state of the art text-to-image models. Commonly observed body-related artifacts include extra or missing limbs, unrealistic poses, blurred body parts, etc. Currently, evaluation of such artifacts relies heavily on time-consuming human judgments, limiting the ability to benchmark models at scale. We address this by proposing BodyMetric, a learnable metric that predicts body realism in images. BodyMetric is trained on realism labels and multi-modal signals including 3D body representations inferred from the input image, and textual descriptions. In order to facilitate this approach, we design an annotation pipeline to collect expert ratings on human body realism leading to a new dataset for this task, namely, BodyRealism. Ablation studies support our architectural choices for BodyMetric and the importance of leveraging a 3D human body prior in capturing body-related artifacts in 2D images. In comparison to concurrent metrics which evaluate general user preference in images, BodyMetric specifically reflects body-related artifacts. We demonstrate the utility of BodyMetric through applications that were previously infeasible at scale. In particular, we use BodyMetric to benchmark the generation ability of text-to-image models to produce realistic human bodies. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of BodyMetric in ranking generated images based on the predicted realism scores.</description>

      <title>D-LORD for Motion Stylization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel framework named D-LORD (Double Latent Optimization for Representation Disentanglement), which is designed for motion stylization (motion style transfer and motion retargeting). The primary objective of this framework is to separate the class and content information from a given motion sequence using a data-driven latent optimization approach. Here, class refers to person-specific style, such as a particular emotion or an individual's identity, while content relates to the style-agnostic aspect of an action, such as walking or jumping, as universally understood concepts. The key advantage of D-LORD is its ability to perform style transfer without needing paired motion data. Instead, it utilizes class and content labels during the latent optimization process. By disentangling the representation, the framework enables the transformation of one motion sequences style to another's style using Adaptive Instance Normalization. The proposed D-LORD framework is designed with a focus on generalization, allowing it to handle different class and content labels for various applications. Additionally, it can generate diverse motion sequences when specific class and content labels are provided. The framework's efficacy is demonstrated through experimentation on three datasets: the CMU XIA dataset for motion style transfer, the MHAD dataset, and the RRIS Ability dataset for motion retargeting. Notably, this paper presents the first generalized framework for motion style transfer and motion retargeting, showcasing its potential contributions in this area.</description>

      <title>Missing Melodies: AI Music Generation and its "Nearly" Complete Omission of the Global South</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in generative AI have sparked renewed interest and expanded possibilities for music generation. However, the performance and versatility of these systems across musical genres are heavily influenced by the availability of training data. We conducted an extensive analysis of over one million hours of audio datasets used in AI music generation research and manually reviewed more than 200 papers from eleven prominent AI and music conferences and organizations (AAAI, ACM, EUSIPCO, EURASIP, ICASSP, ICML, IJCAI, ISMIR, NeurIPS, NIME, SMC) to identify a critical gap in the fair representation and inclusion of the musical genres of the Global South in AI research. Our findings reveal a stark imbalance: approximately 86% of the total dataset hours and over 93% of researchers focus primarily on music from the Global North. However, around 40% of these datasets include some form of non-Western music, genres from the Global South account for only 14.6% of the data. Furthermore, approximately 51% of the papers surveyed concentrate on symbolic music generation, a method that often fails to capture the cultural nuances inherent in music from regions such as South Asia, the Middle East, and Africa. As AI increasingly shapes the creation and dissemination of music, the significant underrepresentation of music genres in datasets and research presents a serious threat to global musical diversity. We also propose some important steps to mitigate these risks and foster a more inclusive future for AI-driven music generation.</description>

      <title>MRGen: Diffusion-based Controllable Data Engine for MRI Segmentation towards Unannotated Modalities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Medical image segmentation has recently demonstrated impressive progress with deep neural networks, yet the heterogeneous modalities and scarcity of mask annotations limit the development of segmentation models on unannotated modalities. This paper investigates a new paradigm for leveraging generative models in medical applications: controllably synthesizing data for unannotated modalities, without requiring registered data pairs. Specifically, we make the following contributions in this paper: (i) we collect and curate a large-scale radiology image-text dataset, MedGen-1M, comprising modality labels, attributes, region, and organ information, along with a subset of organ mask annotations, to support research in controllable medical image generation; (ii) we propose a diffusion-based data engine, termed MRGen, which enables generation conditioned on text prompts and masks, synthesizing MR images for diverse modalities lacking mask annotations, to train segmentation models on unannotated modalities; (iii) we conduct extensive experiments across various modalities, illustrating that our data engine can effectively synthesize training samples and extend MRI segmentation towards unannotated modalities.</description>

      <title>Pre-train, Align, and Disentangle: Empowering Sequential Recommendation with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sequential recommendation (SR) aims to model the sequential dependencies in users' historical interactions to better capture their evolving interests. However, existing SR approaches primarily rely on collaborative data, which leads to limitations such as the cold-start problem and sub-optimal performance. Meanwhile, despite the success of large language models (LLMs), their application in industrial recommender systems is hindered by high inference latency, inability to capture all distribution statistics, and catastrophic forgetting. To this end, we propose a novel Pre-train, Align, and Disentangle (PAD) paradigm to empower recommendation models with LLMs. Specifically, we first pre-train both the SR and LLM models to get collaborative and textual embeddings. Next, a characteristic recommendation-anchored alignment loss is proposed using multi-kernel maximum mean discrepancy with Gaussian kernels. Finally, a triple-experts architecture, consisting aligned and modality-specific experts with disentangled embeddings, is fine-tuned in a frequency-aware manner. Experiments conducted on three public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of PAD, showing significant improvements and compatibility with various SR backbone models, especially on cold items. The implementation code and datasets will be publicly available.</description>

      <title>Thermal and RGB Images Work Better Together in Wind Turbine Damage Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The inspection of wind turbine blades (WTBs) is crucial for ensuring their structural integrity and operational efficiency. Traditional inspection methods can be dangerous and inefficient, prompting the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) that access hard-to-reach areas and capture high-resolution imagery. In this study, we address the challenge of enhancing defect detection on WTBs by integrating thermal and RGB images obtained from UAVs. We propose a multispectral image composition method that combines thermal and RGB imagery through spatial coordinate transformation, key point detection, binary descriptor creation, and weighted image overlay. Using a benchmark dataset of WTB images annotated for defects, we evaluated several state-of-the-art object detection models. Our results show that composite images significantly improve defect detection efficiency. Specifically, the YOLOv8 model's accuracy increased from 91% to 95%, precision from 89% to 94%, recall from 85% to 92%, and F1-score from 87% to 93%. The number of false positives decreased from 6 to 3, and missed defects reduced from 5 to 2. These findings demonstrate that integrating thermal and RGB imagery enhances defect detection on WTBs, contributing to improved maintenance and reliability.</description>

      <title>DeepFEA: Deep Learning for Prediction of Transient Finite Element Analysis Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Finite Element Analysis (FEA) is a powerful but computationally intensive method for simulating physical phenomena. Recent advancements in machine learning have led to surrogate models capable of accelerating FEA. Yet there are still limitations in developing surrogates of transient FEA models that can simultaneously predict the solutions for both nodes and elements with applicability on both the 2D and 3D domains. Motivated by this research gap, this study proposes DeepFEA, a deep learning-based framework that leverages a multilayer Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) network branching into two parallel convolutional neural networks to predict the solutions for both nodes and elements of FEA models. The proposed network is optimized using a novel adaptive learning algorithm, called Node-Element Loss Optimization (NELO). NELO minimizes the error occurring at both branches of the network enabling the prediction of solutions for transient FEA simulations. The experimental evaluation of DeepFEA is performed on three datasets in the context of structural mechanics, generated to serve as publicly available reference datasets. The results show that DeepFEA can achieve less than 3% normalized mean and root mean squared error for 2D and 3D simulation scenarios, and inference times that are two orders of magnitude faster than FEA. In contrast, relevant state-of-the-art methods face challenges with multi-dimensional output and dynamic input prediction. Furthermore, DeepFEA's robustness was demonstrated in a real-life biomedical scenario, confirming its suitability for accurate and efficient predictions of FEA simulations.</description>

      <title>Text Change Detection in Multilingual Documents Using Image Comparison</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Document comparison typically relies on optical character recognition (OCR) as its core technology. However, OCR requires the selection of appropriate language models for each document and the performance of multilingual or hybrid models remains limited. To overcome these challenges, we propose text change detection (TCD) using an image comparison model tailored for multilingual documents. Unlike OCR-based approaches, our method employs word-level text image-to-image comparison to detect changes. Our model generates bidirectional change segmentation maps between the source and target documents. To enhance performance without requiring explicit text alignment or scaling preprocessing, we employ correlations among multi-scale attention features. We also construct a benchmark dataset comprising actual printed and scanned word pairs in various languages to evaluate our model. We validate our approach using our benchmark dataset and public benchmarks Distorted Document Images and the LRDE Document Binarization Dataset. We compare our model against state-of-the-art semantic segmentation and change detection models, as well as to conventional OCR-based models.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a geometric framework to analyze memorization in diffusion models using the eigenvalues of the Hessian of the log probability density. We propose that memorization arises from isolated points in the learned probability distribution, characterized by sharpness in the probability landscape, as indicated by large negative eigenvalues of the Hessian. Through experiments on various datasets, we demonstrate that these eigenvalues effectively detect and quantify memorization. Our approach provides a clear understanding of memorization in diffusion models and lays the groundwork for developing strategies to ensure secure and reliable generative models</description>

Abstract: Microfluidic devices are increasingly used in biological and chemical experiments due to their cost-effectiveness for rheological estimation in fluids. However, these devices often face challenges in terms of accuracy, size, and cost. This study presents a methodology, integrating deep learning, modeling and simulation to enhance the design of microfluidic systems, used to develop an innovative approach for viscosity measurement of polymer melts. We use synthetic data generated from the simulations to train a deep learning model, which then identifies rheological parameters of polymer melts from pressure drop and flow rate measurements in a microfluidic circuit, enabling online estimation of fluid properties. By improving the accuracy and flexibility of microfluidic rheological estimation, our methodology accelerates the design and testing of microfluidic devices, reducing reliance on physical prototypes, and offering significant contributions to the field.</description>

      <title>If You Can't Use Them, Recycle Them: Optimizing Merging at Scale Mitigates Performance Tradeoffs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Model merging has shown great promise at combining expert models, but the benefit of merging is unclear when merging ``generalist'' models trained on many tasks. We explore merging in the context of large ($\sim100$B) models, by \textit{recycling} checkpoints that exhibit tradeoffs among different tasks. Such checkpoints are often created in the process of developing a frontier model, and many suboptimal ones are usually discarded. Given a pool of model checkpoints obtained from different training runs (e.g., different stages, objectives, hyperparameters, and data mixtures), which naturally show tradeoffs across different language capabilities (e.g., instruction following vs. code generation), we investigate whether merging can recycle such suboptimal models into a Pareto-optimal one. Our optimization algorithm tunes the weight of each checkpoint in a linear combination, resulting in a Pareto-optimal models that outperforms both individual models and merge-based baselines. Further analysis shows that good merges tend to include almost all checkpoints with with non-zero weights, indicating that even seemingly bad initial checkpoints can contribute to good final merges.</description>

      <title>Frequency-Adaptive Low-Latency Object Detection Using Events and Frames</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fusing Events and RGB images for object detection leverages the robustness of Event cameras in adverse environments and the rich semantic information provided by RGB cameras. However, two critical mismatches: low-latency Events \textit{vs.}~high-latency RGB frames; temporally sparse labels in training \textit{vs.}~continuous flow in inference, significantly hinder the high-frequency fusion-based object detection. To address these challenges, we propose the \textbf{F}requency-\textbf{A}daptive Low-Latency \textbf{O}bject \textbf{D}etector (FAOD). FAOD aligns low-frequency RGB frames with high-frequency Events through an Align Module, which reinforces cross-modal style and spatial proximity to address the Event-RGB Mismatch. We further propose a training strategy, Time Shift, which enforces the module to align the prediction from temporally shifted Event-RGB pairs and their original representation, that is, consistent with Event-aligned annotations. This strategy enables the network to use high-frequency Event data as the primary reference while treating low-frequency RGB images as supplementary information, retaining the low-latency nature of the Event stream toward high-frequency detection. Furthermore, we observe that these corrected Event-RGB pairs demonstrate better generalization from low training frequency to higher inference frequencies compared to using Event data alone. Extensive experiments on the PKU-DAVIS-SOD and DSEC-Detection datasets demonstrate that our FAOD achieves SOTA performance. Specifically, in the PKU-DAVIS-SOD Dataset, FAOD achieves 9.8 points improvement in terms of the mAP in fully paired Event-RGB data with only a quarter of the parameters compared to SODFormer, and even maintains robust performance (only a 3 points drop in mAP) under 80$\times$ Event-RGB frequency mismatch.</description>

Abstract: Adaptive networks today rely on overparameterized fixed topologies that cannot break through the statistical conflicts they encounter in the data they are exposed to, and are prone to "catastrophic forgetting" as the network attempts to reuse the existing structures to learn new task. We propose a structural adaptation method, DIRAD, that can complexify as needed and in a directed manner without being limited by statistical conflicts within a dataset. We then extend this method and present the PREVAL framework, designed to prevent "catastrophic forgetting" in continual learning by detection of new data and assigning encountered data to suitable models adapted to process them, without needing task labels anywhere in the workflow. We show the reliability of the DIRAD in growing a network with high performance and orders-of-magnitude simpler than fixed topology networks; and demonstrate the proof-of-concept operation of PREVAL, in which continual adaptation to new tasks is observed while being able to detect and discern previously-encountered tasks.</description>

      <title>Relationships between Keywords and Strong Beats in Lyrical Music</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) song generation has emerged as a popular topic, yet the focus on exploring the latent correlations between specific lyrical and rhythmic features remains limited. In contrast, this pilot study particularly investigates the relationships between keywords and rhythmically stressed features such as strong beats in songs. It focuses on several key elements: keywords or non-keywords, stressed or unstressed syllables, and strong or weak beats, with the aim of uncovering insightful correlations. Experimental results indicate that, on average, 80.8\% of keywords land on strong beats, whereas 62\% of non-keywords fall on weak beats. The relationship between stressed syllables and strong or weak beats is weak, revealing that keywords have the strongest relationships with strong beats. Additionally, the lyrics-rhythm matching score, a key matching metric measuring keywords on strong beats and non-keywords on weak beats across various time signatures, is 0.765, while the matching score for syllable types is 0.495. This study demonstrates that word types strongly align with their corresponding beat types, as evidenced by the distinct patterns, whereas syllable types exhibit a much weaker alignment. This disparity underscores the greater reliability of word types in capturing rhythmic structures in music, highlighting their crucial role in effective rhythmic matching and analysis. We also conclude that keywords that consistently align with strong beats are more reliable indicators of lyrics-rhythm associations, providing valuable insights for AI-driven song generation through enhanced structural analysis. Furthermore, our development of tailored Lyrics-Rhythm Matching (LRM) metrics maximizes lyrical alignments with corresponding beat stresses, and our novel LRM file format captures critical lyrical and rhythmic information without needing original sheet music.</description>

      <title>Customize Segment Anything Model for Multi-Modal Semantic Segmentation with Mixture of LoRA Experts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent Segment Anything Model (SAM) represents a significant breakthrough in scaling segmentation models, delivering strong performance across various downstream applications in the RGB modality. However, directly applying SAM to emerging visual modalities, such as depth and event data results in suboptimal performance in multi-modal segmentation tasks. In this paper, we make the first attempt to adapt SAM for multi-modal semantic segmentation by proposing a Mixture of Low-Rank Adaptation Experts (MoE-LoRA) tailored for different input visual modalities. By training only the MoE-LoRA layers while keeping SAM's weights frozen, SAM's strong generalization and segmentation capabilities can be preserved for downstream tasks. Specifically, to address cross-modal inconsistencies, we propose a novel MoE routing strategy that adaptively generates weighted features across modalities, enhancing multi-modal feature integration. Additionally, we incorporate multi-scale feature extraction and fusion by adapting SAM's segmentation head and introducing an auxiliary segmentation head to combine multi-scale features for improved segmentation performance effectively. Extensive experiments were conducted on three multi-modal benchmarks: DELIVER, MUSES, and MCubeS. The results consistently demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across diverse scenarios. Notably, under the particularly challenging condition of missing modalities, our approach exhibits a substantial performance gain, achieving an improvement of 32.15% compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>HyperMARL: Adaptive Hypernetworks for Multi-Agent RL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Balancing individual specialisation and shared behaviours is a critical challenge in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). Existing methods typically focus on encouraging diversity or leveraging shared representations. Full parameter sharing (FuPS) improves sample efficiency but struggles to learn diverse behaviours when required, while no parameter sharing (NoPS) enables diversity but is computationally expensive and sample inefficient. To address these challenges, we introduce HyperMARL, a novel approach using hypernetworks to balance efficiency and specialisation. HyperMARL generates agent-specific actor and critic parameters, enabling agents to adaptively exhibit diverse or homogeneous behaviours as needed, without modifying the learning objective or requiring prior knowledge of the optimal diversity. Furthermore, HyperMARL decouples agent-specific and state-based gradients, which empirically correlates with reduced policy gradient variance, potentially offering insights into its ability to capture diverse behaviours. Across MARL benchmarks requiring homogeneous, heterogeneous, or mixed behaviours, HyperMARL consistently matches or outperforms FuPS, NoPS, and diversity-focused methods, achieving NoPS-level diversity with a shared architecture. These results highlight the potential of hypernetworks as a versatile approach to the trade-off between specialisation and shared behaviours in MARL.</description>

      <title>DEIM: DETR with Improved Matching for Fast Convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce DEIM, an innovative and efficient training framework designed to accelerate convergence in real-time object detection with Transformer-based architectures (DETR). To mitigate the sparse supervision inherent in one-to-one (O2O) matching in DETR models, DEIM employs a Dense O2O matching strategy. This approach increases the number of positive samples per image by incorporating additional targets, using standard data augmentation techniques. While Dense O2O matching speeds up convergence, it also introduces numerous low-quality matches that could affect performance. To address this, we propose the Matchability-Aware Loss (MAL), a novel loss function that optimizes matches across various quality levels, enhancing the effectiveness of Dense O2O. Extensive experiments on the COCO dataset validate the efficacy of DEIM. When integrated with RT-DETR and D-FINE, it consistently boosts performance while reducing training time by 50%. Notably, paired with RT-DETRv2, DEIM achieves 53.2% AP in a single day of training on an NVIDIA 4090 GPU. Additionally, DEIM-trained real-time models outperform leading real-time object detectors, with DEIM-D-FINE-L and DEIM-D-FINE-X achieving 54.7% and 56.5% AP at 124 and 78 FPS on an NVIDIA T4 GPU, respectively, without the need for additional data. We believe DEIM sets a new baseline for advancements in real-time object detection. Our code and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/ShihuaHuang95/DEIM.</description>

      <title>CLINICSUM: Utilizing Language Models for Generating Clinical Summaries from Patient-Doctor Conversations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents ClinicSum, a novel framework designed to automatically generate clinical summaries from patient-doctor conversations. It utilizes a two-module architecture: a retrieval-based filtering module that extracts Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan (SOAP) information from conversation transcripts, and an inference module powered by fine-tuned Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs), which leverage the extracted SOAP data to generate abstracted clinical summaries. To fine-tune the PLM, we created a training dataset of consisting 1,473 conversations-summaries pair by consolidating two publicly available datasets, FigShare and MTS-Dialog, with ground truth summaries validated by Subject Matter Experts (SMEs). ClinicSum's effectiveness is evaluated through both automatic metrics (e.g., ROUGE, BERTScore) and expert human assessments. Results show that ClinicSum outperforms state-of-the-art PLMs, demonstrating superior precision, recall, and F-1 scores in automatic evaluations and receiving high preference from SMEs in human assessment, making it a robust solution for automated clinical summarization.</description>

      <title>Transient Multi-Agent Path Finding for Lifelong Navigation in Dense Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) deals with finding conflict-free paths for a set of agents from an initial configuration to a given target configuration. The Lifelong MAPF (LMAPF) problem is a well-studied online version of MAPF in which an agent receives a new target when it reaches its current target. The common approach for solving LMAPF is to treat it as a sequence of MAPF problems, periodically replanning from the agents' current configurations to their current targets. A significant drawback in this approach is that in MAPF the agents must reach a configuration in which all agents are at their targets simultaneously, which is needlessly restrictive for LMAPF. Techniques have been proposed to indirectly mitigate this drawback. We describe cases where these mitigation techniques fail. As an alternative, we propose to solve LMAPF problems by solving a sequence of modified MAPF problems, in which the objective is for each agent to eventually visit its target, but not necessarily for all agents to do so simultaneously. We refer to this MAPF variant as Transient MAPF (TMAPF) and propose several algorithms for solving it based on existing MAPF algorithms. A limited experimental evaluation identifies some cases where using a TMAPF algorithm instead of a MAPF algorithm with an LMAPF framework can improve the system throughput significantly.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Whole Slide Image Classification through Supervised Contrastive Domain Adaptation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Domain shift in the field of histopathological imaging is a common phenomenon due to the intra- and inter-hospital variability of staining and digitization protocols. The implementation of robust models, capable of creating generalized domains, represents a need to be solved. In this work, a new domain adaptation method to deal with the variability between histopathological images from multiple centers is presented. In particular, our method adds a training constraint to the supervised contrastive learning approach to achieve domain adaptation and improve inter-class separability. Experiments performed on domain adaptation and classification of whole-slide images of six skin cancer subtypes from two centers demonstrate the method's usefulness. The results reflect superior performance compared to not using domain adaptation after feature extraction or staining normalization.</description>

      <title>PoTable: Programming Standardly on Table-based Reasoning Like a Human Analyst</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Table-based reasoning has garnered substantial research interest, particularly in its integration with Large Language Model (LLM) which has revolutionized the general reasoning paradigm. Numerous LLM-based studies introduce symbolic tools (e.g., databases, Python) as assistants to extend human-like abilities in structured table understanding and complex arithmetic computations. However, these studies can be improved better in simulating human cognitive behavior when using symbolic tools, as they still suffer from limitations of non-standard logical splits and constrained operation pools. In this study, we propose PoTable as a novel table-based reasoning method that simulates a human tabular analyst, which integrates a Python interpreter as the real-time executor accompanied by an LLM-based operation planner and code generator. Specifically, PoTable follows a human-like logical stage split and extends the operation pool into an open-world space without any constraints. Through planning and executing in each distinct stage, PoTable standardly completes the entire reasoning process and produces superior reasoning results along with highly accurate, steply commented and completely executable programs. Accordingly, the effectiveness and explainability of PoTable are fully demonstrated. Extensive experiments over three evaluation datasets from two public benchmarks on two backbones show the outstanding performance of our approach. In particular, GPT-based PoTable achieves over 4% higher absolute accuracy than runner-ups on all evaluation datasets.</description>

      <title>SIDA: Social Media Image Deepfake Detection, Localization and Explanation with Large Multimodal Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative models in creating highly realistic images poses substantial risks for misinformation dissemination. For instance, a synthetic image, when shared on social media, can mislead extensive audiences and erode trust in digital content, resulting in severe repercussions. Despite some progress, academia has not yet created a large and diversified deepfake detection dataset for social media, nor has it devised an effective solution to address this issue. In this paper, we introduce the Social media Image Detection dataSet (SID-Set), which offers three key advantages: (1) extensive volume, featuring 300K AI-generated/tampered and authentic images with comprehensive annotations, (2) broad diversity, encompassing fully synthetic and tampered images across various classes, and (3) elevated realism, with images that are predominantly indistinguishable from genuine ones through mere visual inspection. Furthermore, leveraging the exceptional capabilities of large multimodal models, we propose a new image deepfake detection, localization, and explanation framework, named SIDA (Social media Image Detection, localization, and explanation Assistant). SIDA not only discerns the authenticity of images, but also delineates tampered regions through mask prediction and provides textual explanations of the model's judgment criteria. Compared with state-of-the-art deepfake detection models on SID-Set and other benchmarks, extensive experiments demonstrate that SIDA achieves superior performance among diversified settings. The code, model, and dataset will be released.</description>

      <title>T2I-FactualBench: Benchmarking the Factuality of Text-to-Image Models with Knowledge-Intensive Concepts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Evaluating the quality of synthesized images remains a significant challenge in the development of text-to-image (T2I) generation. Most existing studies in this area primarily focus on evaluating text-image alignment, image quality, and object composition capabilities, with comparatively fewer studies addressing the evaluation of the factuality of T2I models, particularly when the concepts involved are knowledge-intensive. To mitigate this gap, we present T2I-FactualBench in this work - the largest benchmark to date in terms of the number of concepts and prompts specifically designed to evaluate the factuality of knowledge-intensive concept generation. T2I-FactualBench consists of a three-tiered knowledge-intensive text-to-image generation framework, ranging from the basic memorization of individual knowledge concepts to the more complex composition of multiple knowledge concepts. We further introduce a multi-round visual question answering (VQA) based evaluation framework to assess the factuality of three-tiered knowledge-intensive text-to-image generation tasks. Experiments on T2I-FactualBench indicate that current state-of-the-art (SOTA) T2I models still leave significant room for improvement.</description>

      <title>The Hyperfitting Phenomenon: Sharpening and Stabilizing LLMs for Open-Ended Text Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces the counter-intuitive generalization results of overfitting pre-trained large language models (LLMs) on very small datasets. In the setting of open-ended text generation, it is well-documented that LLMs tend to generate repetitive and dull sequences, a phenomenon that is especially apparent when generating using greedy decoding. This issue persists even with state-of-the-art LLMs containing billions of parameters, trained via next-token prediction on large datasets. We find that by further fine-tuning these models to achieve a near-zero training loss on a small set of samples -- a process we refer to as hyperfitting -- the long-sequence generative capabilities are greatly enhanced. Greedy decoding with these Hyperfitted models even outperform Top-P sampling over long-sequences, both in terms of diversity and human preferences. This phenomenon extends to LLMs of various sizes, different domains, and even autoregressive image generation. We further find this phenomena to be distinctly different from that of Grokking and double descent. Surprisingly, our experiments indicate that hyperfitted models rarely fall into repeating sequences they were trained on, and even explicitly blocking these sequences results in high-quality output. All hyperfitted models produce extremely low-entropy predictions, often allocating nearly all probability to a single token.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The reliable deployment of deep reinforcement learning in real-world settings requires the ability to generalize across a variety of conditions, including both in-distribution scenarios seen during training as well as novel out-of-distribution scenarios. In this work, we present a framework for dynamics generalization in deep reinforcement learning that unifies these two distinct types of generalization within a single architecture. We introduce a robust adaptation module that provides a mechanism for identifying and reacting to both in-distribution and out-of-distribution environment dynamics, along with a joint training pipeline that combines the goals of in-distribution adaptation and out-of-distribution robustness. Our algorithm GRAM achieves strong generalization performance across in-distribution and out-of-distribution scenarios upon deployment, which we demonstrate on a variety of realistic simulated locomotion tasks with a quadruped robot.</description>

      <title>Understanding Student Sentiment on Mental Health Support in Colleges Using Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mental health support in colleges is vital in educating students by offering counseling services and organizing supportive events. However, evaluating its effectiveness faces challenges like data collection difficulties and lack of standardized metrics, limiting research scope. Student feedback is crucial for evaluation but often relies on qualitative analysis without systematic investigation using advanced machine learning methods. This paper uses public Student Voice Survey data to analyze student sentiments on mental health support with large language models (LLMs). We created a sentiment analysis dataset, SMILE-College, with human-machine collaboration. The investigation of both traditional machine learning methods and state-of-the-art LLMs showed the best performance of GPT-3.5 and BERT on this new dataset. The analysis highlights challenges in accurately predicting response sentiments and offers practical insights on how LLMs can enhance mental health-related research and improve college mental health services. This data-driven approach will facilitate efficient and informed mental health support evaluation, management, and decision-making.</description>

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has had success across various domains, but applying it to environments with constraints remains challenging due to poor sample efficiency and slow convergence. Recent literature explored incorporating model knowledge to mitigate these problems, particularly through the use of models that assess the feasibility of proposed actions. However, integrating feasibility models efficiently into DRL pipelines in environments with continuous action spaces is non-trivial. We propose a novel DRL training strategy utilizing action mapping that leverages feasibility models to streamline the learning process. By decoupling the learning of feasible actions from policy optimization, action mapping allows DRL agents to focus on selecting the optimal action from a reduced feasible action set. We demonstrate through experiments that action mapping significantly improves training performance in constrained environments with continuous action spaces, especially with imperfect feasibility models.</description>

      <title>Retrieval-Augmented Machine Translation with Unstructured Knowledge</title>

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) introduces additional information to enhance large language models (LLMs). In machine translation (MT), previous work typically retrieves in-context examples from paired MT corpora, or domain-specific knowledge from knowledge graphs, to enhance models' MT ability. However, a large amount of world knowledge is organized in unstructured documents, and might not be fully paired across different languages. In this paper, we study retrieval-augmented MT using unstructured documents. Specifically, we build RAGtrans, the first benchmark to train and evaluate LLMs' retrieval-augmented MT ability. RAGtrans contains 79K MT samples collected via GPT-4o and human translators. Besides, documents from different languages are also provided to supply the knowledge to these samples. Based on RAGtrans, we further propose a multi-task training method to teach LLMs how to use information from multilingual documents during their translation. The method uses existing multilingual corpora to create auxiliary training objectives without additional labeling requirements. Extensive experiments show that the method improves LLMs by 1.58-3.09 BLEU and 1.00-2.03 COMET scores.</description>

      <title>RMD: A Simple Baseline for More General Human Motion Generation via Training-free Retrieval-Augmented Motion Diffuse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While motion generation has made substantial progress, its practical application remains constrained by dataset diversity and scale, limiting its ability to handle out-of-distribution scenarios. To address this, we propose a simple and effective baseline, RMD, which enhances the generalization of motion generation through retrieval-augmented techniques. Unlike previous retrieval-based methods, RMD requires no additional training and offers three key advantages: (1) the external retrieval database can be flexibly replaced; (2) body parts from the motion database can be reused, with an LLM facilitating splitting and recombination; and (3) a pre-trained motion diffusion model serves as a prior to improve the quality of motions obtained through retrieval and direct combination. Without any training, RMD achieves state-of-the-art performance, with notable advantages on out-of-distribution data.</description>

      <title>BhashaVerse : Translation Ecosystem for Indian Subcontinent Languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04351v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper focuses on developing translation models and related applications for 36 Indian languages, including Assamese, Awadhi, Bengali, Bhojpuri, Braj, Bodo, Dogri, English, Konkani, Gondi, Gujarati, Hindi, Hinglish, Ho, Kannada, Kangri, Kashmiri (Arabic and Devanagari), Khasi, Mizo, Magahi, Maithili, Malayalam, Marathi, Manipuri (Bengali and Meitei), Nepali, Oriya, Punjabi, Sanskrit, Santali, Sinhala, Sindhi (Arabic and Devanagari), Tamil, Tulu, Telugu, and Urdu. Achieving this requires parallel and other types of corpora for all 36 * 36 language pairs, addressing challenges like script variations, phonetic differences, and syntactic diversity. For instance, languages like Kashmiri and Sindhi, which use multiple scripts, demand script normalization for alignment, while low-resource languages such as Khasi and Santali require synthetic data augmentation to ensure sufficient coverage and quality.
  To address these challenges, this work proposes strategies for corpus creation by leveraging existing resources, developing parallel datasets, generating domain-specific corpora, and utilizing synthetic data techniques. Additionally, it evaluates machine translation across various dimensions, including standard and discourse-level translation, domain-specific translation, reference-based and reference-free evaluation, error analysis, and automatic post-editing. By integrating these elements, the study establishes a comprehensive framework to improve machine translation quality and enable better cross-lingual communication in India's linguistically diverse ecosystem.</description>

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems capable of generating creative outputs are reshaping our understanding of creativity. This shift presents an opportunity for creativity researchers to reevaluate the key components of the creative process. In particular, the advanced capabilities of AI underscore the importance of studying the internal processes of creativity. This paper explores the neurobiological machinery that underlies these internal processes and describes the experiential component of creativity. It is concluded that although the products of artificial and human creativity can be similar, the internal processes are different. The paper also discusses how AI may negatively affect the internal processes of human creativity, such as the development of skills, the integration of knowledge, and the diversity of ideas.</description>

      <title>Machine Theory of Mind for Autonomous Cyber-Defence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intelligent autonomous agents hold much potential for the domain of cyber-security. However, due to many state-of-the-art approaches relying on uninterpretable black-box models, there is growing demand for methods that offer stakeholders clear and actionable insights into their latent beliefs and motivations. To address this, we evaluate Theory of Mind (ToM) approaches for Autonomous Cyber Operations. Upon learning a robust prior, ToM models can predict an agent's goals, behaviours, and contextual beliefs given only a handful of past behaviour observations. In this paper, we introduce a novel Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based ToM architecture tailored for cyber-defence, Graph-In, Graph-Out (GIGO)-ToM, which can accurately predict both the targets and attack trajectories of adversarial cyber agents over arbitrary computer network topologies. To evaluate the latter, we propose a novel extension of the Wasserstein distance for measuring the similarity of graph-based probability distributions. Whereas the standard Wasserstein distance lacks a fixed reference scale, we introduce a graph-theoretic normalization factor that enables a standardized comparison between networks of different sizes. We furnish this metric, which we term the Network Transport Distance (NTD), with a weighting function that emphasizes predictions according to custom node features, allowing network operators to explore arbitrary strategic considerations. Benchmarked against a Graph-In, Dense-Out (GIDO)-ToM architecture in an abstract cyber-defence environment, our empirical evaluations show that GIGO-ToM can accurately predict the goals and behaviours of various unseen cyber-attacking agents across a range of network topologies, as well as learn embeddings that can effectively characterize their policies.</description>

      <title>Discriminative Fine-tuning of LVLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contrastively-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP have become the de facto approach for discriminative vision-language representation learning. However, these models have limited language understanding, often exhibiting a "bag of words" behavior. At the same time, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), which combine vision encoders with LLMs, have been shown capable of detailed vision-language reasoning, yet their autoregressive nature renders them less suitable for discriminative tasks.
  In this work, we propose to combine "the best of both worlds": a new training approach for discriminative fine-tuning of LVLMs that results in strong discriminative and compositional capabilities. Essentially, our approach converts a generative LVLM into a discriminative one, unlocking its capability for powerful image-text discrimination combined with enhanced language understanding.
  Our contributions include: (1) A carefully designed training/optimization framework that utilizes image-text pairs of variable length and granularity for training the model with both contrastive and next-token prediction losses. This is accompanied by ablation studies that justify the necessity of our framework's components. (2) A parameter-efficient adaptation method using a combination of soft prompting and LoRA adapters. (3) Significant improvements over state-of-the-art CLIP-like models of similar size, including standard image-text retrieval benchmarks and notable gains in compositionality.</description>

      <title>EmbodiedOcc: Embodied 3D Occupancy Prediction for Vision-based Online Scene Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 3D occupancy prediction provides a comprehensive description of the surrounding scenes and has become an essential task for 3D perception. Most existing methods focus on offline perception from one or a few views and cannot be applied to embodied agents which demands to gradually perceive the scene through progressive embodied exploration. In this paper, we formulate an embodied 3D occupancy prediction task to target this practical scenario and propose a Gaussian-based EmbodiedOcc framework to accomplish it. We initialize the global scene with uniform 3D semantic Gaussians and progressively update local regions observed by the embodied agent. For each update, we extract semantic and structural features from the observed image and efficiently incorporate them via deformable cross-attention to refine the regional Gaussians. Finally, we employ Gaussian-to-voxel splatting to obtain the global 3D occupancy from the updated 3D Gaussians. Our EmbodiedOcc assumes an unknown (i.e., uniformly distributed) environment and maintains an explicit global memory of it with 3D Gaussians. It gradually gains knowledge through local refinement of regional Gaussians, which is consistent with how humans understand new scenes through embodied exploration. We reorganize an EmbodiedOcc-ScanNet benchmark based on local annotations to facilitate the evaluation of the embodied 3D occupancy prediction task. Experiments demonstrate that our EmbodiedOcc outperforms existing local prediction methods and accomplishes the embodied occupancy prediction with high accuracy and strong expandability.

      <title>Probabilistic Gaussian Superposition for Efficient 3D Occupancy Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 3D semantic occupancy prediction is an important task for robust vision-centric autonomous driving, which predicts fine-grained geometry and semantics of the surrounding scene. Most existing methods leverage dense grid-based scene representations, overlooking the spatial sparsity of the driving scenes. Although 3D semantic Gaussian serves as an object-centric sparse alternative, most of the Gaussians still describe the empty region with low efficiency. To address this, we propose a probabilistic Gaussian superposition model which interprets each Gaussian as a probability distribution of its neighborhood being occupied and conforms to probabilistic multiplication to derive the overall geometry. Furthermore, we adopt the exact Gaussian mixture model for semantics calculation to avoid unnecessary overlapping of Gaussians. To effectively initialize Gaussians in non-empty region, we design a distribution-based initialization module which learns the pixel-aligned occupancy distribution instead of the depth of surfaces. We conduct extensive experiments on nuScenes and KITTI-360 datasets and our GaussianFormer-2 achieves state-of-the-art performance with high efficiency.

      <title>Establishing Task Scaling Laws via Compute-Efficient Model Ladders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop task scaling laws and model ladders to predict the individual task performance of pretrained language models (LMs) in the overtrained setting. Standard power laws for language modeling loss cannot accurately model task performance. Therefore, we leverage a two-step prediction approach: first use model and data size to predict a task-specific loss, and then use this task loss to predict task performance. We train a set of small-scale "ladder" models, collect data points to fit the parameterized functions of the two prediction steps, and make predictions for two target models: a 7B model trained to 4T tokens and a 13B model trained to 5T tokens. Training the ladder models only costs 1% of the compute used for the target models. On four multiple-choice tasks written in ranked classification format, we can predict the accuracy of both target models within 2 points of absolute error. We have higher prediction error on four other tasks (average absolute error 6.9) and find that these are often tasks with higher variance in task metrics. We also find that using less compute to train fewer ladder models tends to deteriorate predictions. Finally, we empirically show that our design choices and the two-step approach lead to superior performance in establishing scaling laws.</description>

      <title>FedDUAL: A Dual-Strategy with Adaptive Loss and Dynamic Aggregation for Mitigating Data Heterogeneity in Federated Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) marks a transformative approach to distributed model training by combining locally optimized models from various clients into a unified global model. While FL preserves data privacy by eliminating centralized storage, it encounters significant challenges such as performance degradation, slower convergence, and reduced robustness of the global model due to the heterogeneity in client data distributions. Among the various forms of data heterogeneity, label skew emerges as a particularly formidable and prevalent issue, especially in domains such as image classification. To address these challenges, we begin with comprehensive experiments to pinpoint the underlying issues in the FL training process. Based on our findings, we then introduce an innovative dual-strategy approach designed to effectively resolve these issues. First, we introduce an adaptive loss function for client-side training, meticulously crafted to preserve previously acquired knowledge while maintaining an optimal equilibrium between local optimization and global model coherence. Secondly, we develop a dynamic aggregation strategy for aggregating client models at the server. This approach adapts to each client's unique learning patterns, effectively addressing the challenges of diverse data across the network. Our comprehensive evaluation, conducted across three diverse real-world datasets, coupled with theoretical convergence guarantees, demonstrates the superior efficacy of our method compared to several established state-of-the-art approaches.</description>

      <title>Florence-VL: Enhancing Vision-Language Models with Generative Vision Encoder and Depth-Breadth Fusion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Florence-VL, a new family of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with enriched visual representations produced by Florence-2, a generative vision foundation model. Unlike the widely used CLIP-style vision transformer trained by contrastive learning, Florence-2 can capture different levels and aspects of visual features, which are more versatile to be adapted to diverse downstream tasks. We propose a novel feature-fusion architecture and an innovative training recipe that effectively integrates Florence-2's visual features into pretrained LLMs, such as Phi 3.5 and LLama 3. In particular, we propose "depth-breath fusion (DBFusion)" to fuse the visual features extracted from different depths and under multiple prompts. Our model training is composed of end-to-end pretraining of the whole model followed by finetuning of the projection layer and the LLM, on a carefully designed recipe of diverse open-source datasets that include high-quality image captions and instruction-tuning pairs. Our quantitative analysis and visualization of Florence-VL's visual features show its advantages over popular vision encoders on vision-language alignment, where the enriched depth and breath play important roles. Florence-VL achieves significant improvements over existing state-of-the-art MLLMs across various multi-modal and vision-centric benchmarks covering general VQA, perception, hallucination, OCR, Chart, knowledge-intensive understanding, etc. To facilitate future research, our models and the complete training recipe are open-sourced. https://github.com/JiuhaiChen/Florence-VL</description>

      <title>Marvel: Accelerating Safe Online Reinforcement Learning with Finetuned Offline Policy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The high costs and risks involved in extensive environment interactions hinder the practical application of current online safe reinforcement learning (RL) methods. While offline safe RL addresses this by learning policies from static datasets, the performance therein is usually limited due to reliance on data quality and challenges with out-of-distribution (OOD) actions. Inspired by recent successes in offline-to-online (O2O) RL, it is crucial to explore whether offline safe RL can be leveraged to facilitate faster and safer online policy learning, a direction that has yet to be fully investigated. To fill this gap, we first demonstrate that naively applying existing O2O algorithms from standard RL would not work well in the safe RL setting due to two unique challenges: \emph{erroneous Q-estimations}, resulted from offline-online objective mismatch and offline cost sparsity, and \emph{Lagrangian mismatch}, resulted from difficulties in aligning Lagrange multipliers between offline and online policies. To address these challenges, we introduce \textbf{Marvel}, a novel framework for O2O safe RL, comprising two key components that work in concert: \emph{Value Pre-Alignment} to align the Q-functions with the underlying truth before online learning, and \emph{Adaptive PID Control} to effectively adjust the Lagrange multipliers during online finetuning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Marvel significantly outperforms existing baselines in both reward maximization and safety constraint satisfaction. By introducing the first policy-finetuning based framework for O2O safe RL, which is compatible with many offline and online safe RL methods, our work has the great potential to advance the field towards more efficient and practical safe RL solutions.</description>

      <title>Moto: Latent Motion Token as the Bridging Language for Robot Manipulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent developments in Large Language Models pre-trained on extensive corpora have shown significant success in various natural language processing tasks with minimal fine-tuning. This success offers new promise for robotics, which has long been constrained by the high cost of action-labeled data. We ask: given the abundant video data containing interaction-related knowledge available as a rich "corpus", can a similar generative pre-training approach be effectively applied to enhance robot learning? The key challenge is to identify an effective representation for autoregressive pre-training that benefits robot manipulation tasks. Inspired by the way humans learn new skills through observing dynamic environments, we propose that effective robotic learning should emphasize motion-related knowledge, which is closely tied to low-level actions and is hardware-agnostic, facilitating the transfer of learned motions to actual robot actions. To this end, we introduce Moto, which converts video content into latent Motion Token sequences by a Latent Motion Tokenizer, learning a bridging "language" of motion from videos in an unsupervised manner. We pre-train Moto-GPT through motion token autoregression, enabling it to capture diverse visual motion knowledge. After pre-training, Moto-GPT demonstrates the promising ability to produce semantically interpretable motion tokens, predict plausible motion trajectories, and assess trajectory rationality through output likelihood. To transfer learned motion priors to real robot actions, we implement a co-fine-tuning strategy that seamlessly bridges latent motion token prediction and real robot control.

      <title>Code-as-Monitor: Constraint-aware Visual Programming for Reactive and Proactive Robotic Failure Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automatic detection and prevention of open-set failures are crucial in closed-loop robotic systems. Recent studies often struggle to simultaneously identify unexpected failures reactively after they occur and prevent foreseeable ones proactively. To this end, we propose Code-as-Monitor (CaM), a novel paradigm leveraging the vision-language model (VLM) for both open-set reactive and proactive failure detection. The core of our method is to formulate both tasks as a unified set of spatio-temporal constraint satisfaction problems and use VLM-generated code to evaluate them for real-time monitoring. To enhance the accuracy and efficiency of monitoring, we further introduce constraint elements that abstract constraint-related entities or their parts into compact geometric elements. This approach offers greater generality, simplifies tracking, and facilitates constraint-aware visual programming by leveraging these elements as visual prompts. Experiments show that CaM achieves a 28.7% higher success rate and reduces execution time by 31.8% under severe disturbances compared to baselines across three simulators and a real-world setting. Moreover, CaM can be integrated with open-loop control policies to form closed-loop systems, enabling long-horizon tasks in cluttered scenes with dynamic environments.</description>

      <title>VisionZip: Longer is Better but Not Necessary in Vision Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in vision-language models have enhanced performance by increasing the length of visual tokens, making them much longer than text tokens and significantly raising computational costs. However, we observe that the visual tokens generated by popular vision encoders, such as CLIP and SigLIP, contain significant redundancy. To address this, we introduce VisionZip, a simple yet effective method that selects a set of informative tokens for input to the language model, reducing visual token redundancy and improving efficiency while maintaining model performance. The proposed VisionZip can be widely applied to image and video understanding tasks and is well-suited for multi-turn dialogues in real-world scenarios, where previous methods tend to underperform. Experimental results show that VisionZip outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method by at least 5% performance gains across nearly all settings. Moreover, our method significantly enhances model inference speed, improving the prefilling time by 8x and enabling the LLaVA-Next 13B model to infer faster than the LLaVA-Next 7B model while achieving better results. Furthermore, we analyze the causes of this redundancy and encourage the community to focus on extracting better visual features rather than merely increasing token length.

      <title>QUEEN: QUantized Efficient ENcoding of Dynamic Gaussians for Streaming Free-viewpoint Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Online free-viewpoint video (FVV) streaming is a challenging problem, which is relatively under-explored. It requires incremental on-the-fly updates to a volumetric representation, fast training and rendering to satisfy real-time constraints and a small memory footprint for efficient transmission. If achieved, it can enhance user experience by enabling novel applications, e.g., 3D video conferencing and live volumetric video broadcast, among others. In this work, we propose a novel framework for QUantized and Efficient ENcoding (QUEEN) for streaming FVV using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS). QUEEN directly learns Gaussian attribute residuals between consecutive frames at each time-step without imposing any structural constraints on them, allowing for high quality reconstruction and generalizability. To efficiently store the residuals, we further propose a quantization-sparsity framework, which contains a learned latent-decoder for effectively quantizing attribute residuals other than Gaussian positions and a learned gating module to sparsify position residuals. We propose to use the Gaussian viewspace gradient difference vector as a signal to separate the static and dynamic content of the scene. It acts as a guide for effective sparsity learning and speeds up training. On diverse FVV benchmarks, QUEEN outperforms the state-of-the-art online FVV methods on all metrics. Notably, for several highly dynamic scenes, it reduces the model size to just 0.7 MB per frame while training in under 5 sec and rendering at 350 FPS.

      <title>PaintScene4D: Consistent 4D Scene Generation from Text Prompts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have revolutionized 2D and 3D content creation, yet generating photorealistic dynamic 4D scenes remains a significant challenge. Existing dynamic 4D generation methods typically rely on distilling knowledge from pre-trained 3D generative models, often fine-tuned on synthetic object datasets. Consequently, the resulting scenes tend to be object-centric and lack photorealism. While text-to-video models can generate more realistic scenes with motion, they often struggle with spatial understanding and provide limited control over camera viewpoints during rendering. To address these limitations, we present PaintScene4D, a novel text-to-4D scene generation framework that departs from conventional multi-view generative models in favor of a streamlined architecture that harnesses video generative models trained on diverse real-world datasets. Our method first generates a reference video using a video generation model, and then employs a strategic camera array selection for rendering. We apply a progressive warping and inpainting technique to ensure both spatial and temporal consistency across multiple viewpoints. Finally, we optimize multi-view images using a dynamic renderer, enabling flexible camera control based on user preferences. Adopting a training-free architecture, our PaintScene4D efficiently produces realistic 4D scenes that can be viewed from arbitrary trajectories. The code will be made publicly available.

      <title>Quantitative AI Risk Assessments: Opportunities and Challenges</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.06317v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although AI systems are increasingly being leveraged to provide value to organizations, individuals, and society, significant attendant risks have been identified and have manifested. These risks have led to proposed regulations, litigation, and general societal concerns.
  As with any promising technology, organizations want to benefit from the positive capabilities of AI technology while reducing the risks. The best way to reduce risks is to implement comprehensive AI lifecycle governance where policies and procedures are described and enforced during the design, development, deployment, and monitoring of an AI system. Although support for comprehensive governance is beginning to emerge, organizations often need to identify the risks of deploying an already-built model without knowledge of how it was constructed or access to its original developers. Such an assessment will quantitatively assess the risks of an existing model in a manner analogous to how a home inspector might assess the risks of an already-built home or a physician might assess overall patient health based on a battery of tests.
  Several AI risks can be quantified using metrics from the technical community. However, there are numerous issues in deciding how these metrics can be leveraged to create a quantitative AI risk assessment. This paper explores these issues, focusing on the opportunities, challenges, and potential impacts of such an approach, and discussing how it might influence AI regulations.</description>

      <title>Train a Real-world Local Path Planner in One Hour via Partially Decoupled Reinforcement Learning and Vectorized Diversity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.04180v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has exhibited efficacy in resolving the Local Path Planning (LPP) problem. However, such application in the real world is immensely limited due to the deficient training efficiency and generalization capability of DRL. To alleviate these two issues, a solution named Color is proposed, which consists of an Actor-Sharer-Learner (ASL) training framework and a mobile robot-oriented simulator Sparrow. Specifically, the ASL intends to improve the training efficiency of DRL algorithms. It employs a Vectorized Data Collection (VDC) mode to expedite data acquisition, decouples the data collection from model optimization by multithreading, and partially connects the two procedures by harnessing a Time Feedback Mechanism (TFM) to evade data underuse or overuse. Meanwhile, the Sparrow simulator utilizes a 2D grid-based world, simplified kinematics, and conversion-free data flow to achieve a lightweight design. The lightness facilitates vectorized diversity, allowing diversified simulation setups across extensive copies of the vectorized environments, resulting in a notable enhancement in the generalization capability of the DRL algorithm being trained. Comprehensive experiments, comprising 57 DRL benchmark environments, 32 simulated and 36 real-world LPP scenarios, have been conducted to corroborate the superiority of our method in terms of efficiency and generalization. The code and the video of this paper are accessible at https://github.com/XinJingHao/Color.</description>

      <title>A Deep RL Approach on Task Placement and Scaling of Edge Resources for Cellular Vehicle-to-Network Service Provisioning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.09832v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cellular-Vehicle-to-Everything (C-V2X) is currently at the forefront of the digital transformation of our society. By enabling vehicles to communicate with each other and with the traffic environment using cellular networks, we redefine transportation, improving road safety and transportation services, increasing efficiency of vehicular traffic flows, and reducing environmental impact. To effectively facilitate the provisioning of Cellular Vehicular-to-Network (C-V2N) services, we tackle the interdependent problems of service task placement and scaling of edge resources. Specifically, we formulate the joint problem and prove that it is not computationally tractable. To address its complexity we propose Deep Hybrid Policy Gradient (DHPG), a new Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) approach that operates in hybrid action spaces, enabling holistic decision-making and enhancing overall performance. We evaluated the performance of DHPG using simulations with a real-world C-V2N traffic dataset, comparing it to several state-of-the-art (SoA) solutions. DHPG outperforms these solutions, guaranteeing the $99^{th}$ percentile of C-V2N service delay target, while simultaneously optimizing the utilization of computing resources. Finally, time complexity analysis is conducted to verify that the proposed approach can support real-time C-V2N services.</description>

Abstract: We present RLLTE: a long-term evolution, extremely modular, and open-source framework for reinforcement learning (RL) research and application. Beyond delivering top-notch algorithm implementations, RLLTE also serves as a toolkit for developing algorithms. More specifically, RLLTE decouples the RL algorithms completely from the exploitation-exploration perspective, providing a large number of components to accelerate algorithm development and evolution. In particular, RLLTE is the first RL framework to build a comprehensive ecosystem, which includes model training, evaluation, deployment, benchmark hub, and large language model (LLM)-empowered copilot. RLLTE is expected to set standards for RL engineering practice and be highly stimulative for industry and academia.

      <title>Agent-OM: Leveraging LLM Agents for Ontology Matching</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.00326v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ontology matching (OM) enables semantic interoperability between different ontologies and resolves their conceptual heterogeneity by aligning related entities. OM systems currently have two prevailing design paradigms: conventional knowledge-based expert systems and newer machine learning-based predictive systems. While large language models (LLMs) and LLM agents have revolutionised data engineering and have been applied creatively in many domains, their potential for OM remains underexplored. This study introduces a novel agent-powered LLM-based design paradigm for OM systems. With consideration of several specific challenges in leveraging LLM agents for OM, we propose a generic framework, namely Agent-OM (Agent for Ontology Matching), consisting of two Siamese agents for retrieval and matching, with a set of simple OM tools. Our framework is implemented in a proof-of-concept system. Evaluations of three Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative (OAEI) tracks over state-of-the-art OM systems show that our system can achieve results very close to the long-standing best performance on simple OM tasks and can significantly improve the performance on complex and few-shot OM tasks.</description>

Abstract: Transportation has greatly benefited the cities' development in the modern civilization process. Intelligent transportation, leveraging advanced computer algorithms, could further increase people's daily commuting efficiency. However, intelligent transportation, as a cross-discipline, often requires practitioners to comprehend complicated algorithms and obscure neural networks, bringing a challenge for the advanced techniques to be trusted and deployed in practical industries. Recognizing the expressiveness of the pre-trained large language models, especially the potential of being augmented with abilities to understand and execute intricate commands, we introduce Open-TI. Serving as a bridge to mitigate the industry-academic gap, Open-TI is an innovative model targeting the goal of Turing Indistinguishable Traffic Intelligence, it is augmented with the capability to harness external traffic analysis packages based on existing conversations. Marking its distinction, Open-TI is the first method capable of conducting exhaustive traffic analysis from scratch - spanning from map data acquisition to the eventual execution in complex simulations. Besides, Open-TI is able to conduct task-specific embodiment like training and adapting the traffic signal control policies (TSC), explore demand optimizations, etc. Furthermore, we explored the viability of LLMs directly serving as control agents, by understanding the expected intentions from Open-TI, we designed an agent-to-agent communication mode to support Open-TI conveying messages to ChatZero (control agent), and then the control agent would choose from the action space to proceed the execution. We eventually provide the formal implementation structure, and the open-ended design invites further community-driven enhancements.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Networks for Causal Analysis in Socioecological Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.10101v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Causal and counterfactual reasoning are emerging directions in data science that allow us to reason about hypothetical scenarios. This is particularly useful in fields like environmental and ecological sciences, where interventional data are usually not available. Structural causal models are probabilistic models for causal analysis that simplify this kind of reasoning due to their graphical representation. They can be regarded as extensions of the so-called Bayesian networks, a well known modeling tool commonly used in environmental and ecological problems. The main contribution of this paper is to analyze the relations of necessity and sufficiency between the variables of a socioecological system using counterfactual reasoning with Bayesian networks. In particular, we consider a case study involving socioeconomic factors and land-uses in southern Spain. In addition, this paper aims to be a coherent overview of the fundamental concepts for applying counterfactual reasoning, so that environmental researchers with a background in Bayesian networks can easily take advantage of the structural causal model formalism.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02454v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The technique of forgetting in knowledge representation has been shown to be a powerful and useful knowledge engineering tool with widespread application. Yet, very little research has been done on how different policies of forgetting, or use of different forgetting operators, affects the inferential strength of the original theory. The goal of this paper is to define loss functions for measuring changes in inferential strength based on intuitions from model counting and probability theory. Properties of such loss measures are studied and a pragmatic knowledge engineering tool is proposed for computing loss measures using ProbLog. The paper includes a working methodology for studying and determining the strength of different forgetting policies, in addition to concrete examples showing how to apply the theoretical results using ProbLog. Although the focus is on forgetting, the results are much more general and should have wider application to other areas.</description>

      <title>Calibrating Reasoning in Language Models with Internal Consistency</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18711v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in various reasoning tasks, aided by techniques like chain-of-thought prompting that elicits verbalized reasoning. However, LLMs often generate text with obvious mistakes and contradictions, raising doubts about their ability to robustly process and utilize generated rationales. In this work, we investigate reasoning in LLMs through the lens of internal representations, focusing on how these representations are influenced by generated rationales. Our preliminary analysis reveals that while generated rationales improve answer accuracy, inconsistencies emerge between the model's internal representations in middle layers and those in final layers, potentially undermining the reliability of their reasoning processes. To address this, we propose internal consistency as a measure of the model's confidence by examining the agreement of latent predictions decoded from intermediate layers. Extensive empirical studies across different models and datasets demonstrate that internal consistency effectively distinguishes between correct and incorrect reasoning paths. Motivated by this, we propose a new approach to calibrate reasoning by up-weighting reasoning paths with high internal consistency, resulting in a significant boost in reasoning performance. Further analysis uncovers distinct patterns in attention and feed-forward modules across layers, providing insights into the emergence of internal inconsistency. In summary, our results demonstrate the potential of using internal representations for self-evaluation of LLMs. Our code is available at github.com/zhxieml/internal-consistency.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Attacks on Large Language Models in Medicine</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12259v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into healthcare applications offers promising advancements in medical diagnostics, treatment recommendations, and patient care. However, the susceptibility of LLMs to adversarial attacks poses a significant threat, potentially leading to harmful outcomes in delicate medical contexts. This study investigates the vulnerability of LLMs to two types of adversarial attacks in three medical tasks. Utilizing real-world patient data, we demonstrate that both open-source and proprietary LLMs are susceptible to manipulation across multiple tasks. This research further reveals that domain-specific tasks demand more adversarial data in model fine-tuning than general domain tasks for effective attack execution, especially for more capable models. We discover that while integrating adversarial data does not markedly degrade overall model performance on medical benchmarks, it does lead to noticeable shifts in fine-tuned model weights, suggesting a potential pathway for detecting and countering model attacks. This research highlights the urgent need for robust security measures and the development of defensive mechanisms to safeguard LLMs in medical applications, to ensure their safe and effective deployment in healthcare settings.</description>

      <title>Mixing It Up: The Cocktail Effect of Multi-Task Fine-Tuning on LLM Performance -- A Case Study in Finance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01109v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The application of large language models (LLMs) in domain-specific contexts, including finance, has expanded rapidly. Domain-specific LLMs are typically evaluated based on their performance in various downstream tasks relevant to the domain. In this work, we present a detailed analysis of fine-tuning LLMs for such tasks. Somewhat counterintuitively, we find that in domain-specific cases, fine-tuning exclusively on the target task is not always the most effective strategy. Instead, multi-task finetuning - where models are trained on a cocktail of related tasks - can significantly enhance performance. We demonstrate how this approach enables a small model, such as Phi-3-Mini, to achieve state-of-the-art results, even surpassing the much larger GPT-4-o model on financial benchmarks. Our study involves a large-scale experiment, conducting over 200 training experiments using several widely adopted LLMs as baselines, and empirically confirms the benefits of multi-task fine-tuning. Additionally, we explore the use of general instruction data as a form of regularization, suggesting that it helps minimize performance degradation. We also investigate the inclusion of mathematical data, finding improvements in numerical reasoning that transfer effectively to financial tasks. Finally, we note that while fine-tuning for downstream tasks leads to targeted improvements in task performance, it does not necessarily result in broader gains in domain knowledge or complex domain reasoning abilities.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Foundation Models on Exceptional Cases: Dataset Creation and Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18001v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) have achieved significant success across various tasks, leading to research on benchmarks for reasoning abilities. However, there is a lack of studies on FMs performance in exceptional scenarios, which we define as out-of-distribution (OOD) reasoning tasks. This paper is the first to address these cases, developing a novel dataset for evaluation of FMs across multiple modalities, including graphic novels, calligraphy, news articles, and lyrics. It includes tasks for instance classification, character recognition, token prediction, and text generation. The paper also proposes prompt engineering techniques like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and CoT+Few-Shot to enhance performance. Validation of FMs using various methods revealed improvements.

      <title>Lexicalization Is All You Need: Examining the Impact of Lexical Knowledge in a Compositional QALD System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03906v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine the impact of lexicalization on Question Answering over Linked Data (QALD). It is well known that one of the key challenges in interpreting natural language questions with respect to SPARQL lies in bridging the lexical gap, that is mapping the words in the query to the correct vocabulary elements. We argue in this paper that lexicalization, that is explicit knowledge about the potential interpretations of a word with respect to the given vocabulary, significantly eases the task and increases the performance of QA systems. Towards this goal, we present a compositional QA system that can leverage explicit lexical knowledge in a compositional manner to infer the meaning of a question in terms of a SPARQL query. We show that such a system, given lexical knowledge, has a performance well beyond current QA systems, achieving up to a $35.8\%$ increase in the micro $F_1$ score compared to the best QA system on QALD-9. This shows the importance and potential of including explicit lexical knowledge. In contrast, we show that LLMs have limited abilities to exploit lexical knowledge, with only marginal improvements compared to a version without lexical knowledge. This shows that LLMs have no ability to compositionally interpret a question on the basis of the meaning of its parts, a key feature of compositional approaches. Taken together, our work shows new avenues for QALD research, emphasizing the importance of lexicalization and compositionality.</description>

      <title>Solving Generalized Grouping Problems in Cellular Manufacturing Systems Using a Network Flow Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04685v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the generalized grouping problem in the context of cellular manufacturing systems (CMS), where parts may have more than one process route. A process route lists the machines corresponding to each part of the operation. Inspired by the extensive and widespread use of network flow algorithms, this research formulates the process route family formation for generalized grouping as a unit capacity minimum cost network flow model. The objective is to minimize dissimilarity (based on the machines required) among the process routes within a family. The proposed model optimally solves the process route family formation problem without pre-specifying the number of part families to be formed. The process route of family formation is the first stage in a hierarchical procedure. For the second stage (machine cell formation), two procedures, a quadratic assignment programming (QAP) formulation, and a heuristic procedure, are proposed. The QAP simultaneously assigns process route families and machines to a pre-specified number of cells in such a way that total machine utilization is maximized. The heuristic procedure for machine cell formation is hierarchical in nature. Computational results for some test problems show that the QAP and the heuristic procedure yield the same results.</description>

      <title>PerceiverS: A Multi-Scale Perceiver with Effective Segmentation for Long-Term Expressive Symbolic Music Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08307v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: AI-based music generation has progressed significantly in recent years. However, creating symbolic music that is both long-structured and expressive remains a considerable challenge. In this paper, we propose PerceiverS (Segmentation and Scale), a novel architecture designed to address this issue by leveraging both Effective Segmentation and Multi-Scale attention mechanisms. Our approach enhances symbolic music generation by simultaneously learning long-term structural dependencies and short-term expressive details. By combining cross-attention and self-attention in a Multi-Scale setting, PerceiverS captures long-range musical structure while preserving musical diversity. The proposed model has been evaluated using the Maestro dataset and has demonstrated improvements in generating music of conventional length with expressive nuances. The project demos and the generated music samples can be accessed through the link: https://perceivers.github.io</description>

      <title>Designing Cellular Manufacturing System in Presence of Alternative Process Plans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15361v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the design of cellular manufacturing systems (CMS), numerous technological and managerial decisions must be made at both the design and operational stages. The first step in designing a CMS involves grouping parts and machines. In this paper, four integer programming formulations are presented for grouping parts and machines in a CMS at both the design and operational levels for a generalized grouping problem, where each part has more than one process plan, and each operation of a process plan can be performed on more than one machine. The minimization of inter-cell and intra-cell movements is achieved by assigning the maximum possible number of consecutive operations of a part type to the same cell and to the same machine, respectively. The suitability of minimizing inter-cell and intra-cell movements as an objective, compared to other objectives such as minimizing investment costs on machines, operating costs, etc., is discussed. Numerical examples are included to illustrate the workings of the formulations.</description>

      <title>When Stability meets Sufficiency: Informative Explanations that do not Overwhelm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.06181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.06181v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent studies evaluating various criteria for explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) suggest that fidelity, stability, and comprehensibility are among the most important metrics considered by users of AI across a diverse collection of usage contexts. We consider these criteria as applied to feature-based attribution methods, which are amongst the most prevalent in XAI literature. Going beyond standard correlation, methods have been proposed that highlight what should be minimally sufficient to justify the classification of an input (viz. pertinent positives). While minimal sufficiency is an attractive property akin to comprehensibility, the resulting explanations are often too sparse for a human to understand and evaluate the local behavior of the model. To overcome these limitations, we incorporate the criteria of stability and fidelity and propose a novel method called Path-Sufficient Explanations Method (PSEM) that outputs a sequence of stable and sufficient explanations for a given input of strictly decreasing size (or value) -- from original input to a minimally sufficient explanation -- which can be thought to trace the local boundary of the model in a stable manner, thus providing better intuition about the local model behavior for the specific input. We validate these claims, both qualitatively and quantitatively, with experiments that show the benefit of PSEM across three modalities (image, tabular and text) as well as versus other path explanations. A user study depicts the strength of the method in communicating the local behavior, where (many) users are able to correctly determine the prediction made by a model.</description>

      <title>Knowledge Transfer based Evolutionary Deep Neural Network for Intelligent Fault Diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.13479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.13479v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A fault diagnosis with commendable accuracy is essential for the reliability of industrial machines. Two main challenges affect the design of high-performing intelligent systems: (i) the selection of a suitable model and (ii) domain adaptation if there is a continuous change in operating conditions. Therefore, we propose an evolutionary Net2Net transformation (EvoN2N) that finds the best suitable DNN architecture with limited availability of labeled data samples. Net2Net transformation-based quick learning algorithm has been used in the evolutionary framework of Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II to obtain the best DNN architecture. Net2Net transformation-based quick learning algorithm uses the concept of knowledge transfer from one generation to the next for faster fitness evaluation. The proposed framework can obtain the best model for intelligent fault diagnosis without a long and time-consuming search process. The proposed framework has been validated on the Case Western Reserve University dataset, the Paderborn University dataset, and the gearbox fault detection dataset under different operating conditions. The best models obtained are capable of demonstrating an excellent diagnostic performance and classification accuracy of almost up to 100\% for most of the operating conditions.</description>

      <title>Online Adversarial Knowledge Distillation for Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.13966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.13966v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Knowledge distillation, a technique recently gaining popularity for enhancing model generalization in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), operates under the assumption that both teacher and student models are trained on identical data distributions. However, its effect on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) is less than satisfactory since the graph topology and node attributes are prone to evolve, thereby leading to the issue of distribution shift. In this paper, we tackle this challenge by simultaneously training a group of graph neural networks in an online distillation fashion, where the group knowledge plays a role as a dynamic virtual teacher and the structure changes in graph neural networks are effectively captured. To improve the distillation performance, two types of knowledge are transferred among the students to enhance each other: local knowledge reflecting information in the graph topology and node attributes, and global knowledge reflecting the prediction over classes. We transfer the global knowledge with KL-divergence as the vanilla knowledge distillation does, while exploiting the complicated structure of the local knowledge with an efficient adversarial cyclic learning framework. Extensive experiments verified the effectiveness of our proposed online adversarial distillation approach. The code is published at https://github.com/wangz3066/OnlineDistillGCN.</description>

      <title>Combining Stochastic Defenses to Resist Gradient Inversion: An Ablation Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.04767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.04767v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gradient Inversion (GI) attacks are a ubiquitous threat in Federated Learning (FL) as they exploit gradient leakage to reconstruct supposedly private training data. Common defense mechanisms such as Differential Privacy (DP) or stochastic Privacy Modules (PMs) introduce randomness during gradient computation to prevent such attacks. However, we pose that if an attacker effectively mimics a client's stochastic gradient computation, the attacker can circumvent the defense and reconstruct clients' private training data. This paper introduces several targeted GI attacks that leverage this principle to bypass common defense mechanisms. As a result, we demonstrate that no individual defense provides sufficient privacy protection. To address this issue, we propose to combine multiple defenses. We conduct an extensive ablation study to evaluate the influence of various combinations of defenses on privacy protection and model utility. We observe that only the combination of DP and a stochastic PM was sufficient to decrease the Attack Success Rate (ASR) from 100% to 0%, thus preserving privacy. Moreover, we found that this combination of defenses consistently achieves the best trade-off between privacy and model utility.</description>

      <title>Reachable Polyhedral Marching (RPM): An Exact Analysis Tool for Deep-Learned Control Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.08339v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural networks are increasingly used in robotics as policies, state transition models, state estimation models, or all of the above. With these components being learned from data, it is important to be able to analyze what behaviors were learned and how this affects closed-loop performance. In this paper we take steps toward this goal by developing methods for computing control invariant sets and regions of attraction (ROAs) of dynamical systems represented as neural networks. We focus our attention on feedforward neural networks with the rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation, which are known to implement continuous piecewise-affine (PWA) functions. We describe the Reachable Polyhedral Marching (RPM) algorithm for enumerating the affine pieces of a neural network through an incremental connected walk. We then use this algorithm to compute exact forward and backward reachable sets, from which we provide methods for computing control invariant sets and ROAs. Our approach is unique in that we find these sets incrementally, without Lyapunov-based tools. In our examples we demonstrate the ability of our approach to find non-convex control invariant sets and ROAs on tasks with learned van der Pol oscillator and pendulum models. Further, we provide an accelerated algorithm for computing ROAs that leverages the incremental and connected enumeration of affine regions that RPM provides. We show this acceleration to lead to a 15x speedup in our examples. Finally, we apply our methods to find a set of states that are stabilized by an image-based controller for an aircraft runway control problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.07330v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Moire patterns, created by the interference between overlapping grid patterns in the pixel space, degrade the visual quality of images and videos. Therefore, removing such patterns~(demoireing) is crucial, yet remains a challenge due to their complexities in sizes and distortions. Conventional methods mainly tackle this task by only exploiting the spatial domain of the input images, limiting their capabilities in removing large-scale moire patterns. Therefore, this work proposes FPANet, an image-video demoireing network that learns filters in both frequency and spatial domains, improving the restoration quality by removing various sizes of moire patterns. To further enhance, our model takes multiple consecutive frames, learning to extract frame-invariant content features and outputting better quality temporally consistent images. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method with a publicly available large-scale dataset, observing that ours outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches in terms of image and video quality metrics and visual experience.</description>

      <title>Navigating Perplexity: A linear relationship with the data set size in t-SNE embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.15513v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Widely used pipelines for analyzing high-dimensional data utilize two-dimensional visualizations. These are created, for instance, via t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE). A crucial element of the t-SNE embedding procedure is the perplexity hyperparameter. That is because the embedding structure varies when perplexity is changed. A suitable perplexity choice depends on the data set and the intended usage for the embedding. Therefore, perplexity is often chosen based on heuristics, intuition, and prior experience. This paper uncovers a linear relationship between perplexity and the data set size. Namely, we show that embeddings remain structurally consistent across data set samples when perplexity is adjusted accordingly. Qualitative and quantitative experimental results support these findings. This informs the visualization process, guiding the user when choosing a perplexity value. Finally, we outline several applications for the visualization of high-dimensional data via t-SNE based on this linear relationship.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Novel Object Detection via Cooperative Foundational Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12068v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we address the challenging and emergent problem of novel object detection (NOD), focusing on the accurate detection of both known and novel object categories during inference. Traditional object detection algorithms are inherently closed-set, limiting their capability to handle NOD. We present a novel approach to transform existing closed-set detectors into open-set detectors. This transformation is achieved by leveraging the complementary strengths of pre-trained foundational models, specifically CLIP and SAM, through our cooperative mechanism. Furthermore, by integrating this mechanism with state-of-the-art open-set detectors such as GDINO, we establish new benchmarks in object detection performance. Our method achieves 17.42 mAP in novel object detection and 42.08 mAP for known objects on the challenging LVIS dataset. Adapting our approach to the COCO OVD split, we surpass the current state-of-the-art by a margin of 7.2 $ \text{AP}_{50} $ for novel classes.

      <title>Labrador: Exploring the Limits of Masked Language Modeling for Laboratory Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11502v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we introduce Labrador, a pre-trained Transformer model for laboratory data. Labrador and BERT were pre-trained on a corpus of 100 million lab test results from electronic health records (EHRs) and evaluated on various downstream outcome prediction tasks. Both models demonstrate mastery of the pre-training task but neither consistently outperform XGBoost on downstream supervised tasks. Our ablation studies reveal that transfer learning shows limited effectiveness for BERT and achieves marginal success with Labrador. We explore the reasons for the failure of transfer learning and suggest that the data generating process underlying each patient cannot be characterized sufficiently using labs alone, among other factors. We encourage future work to focus on joint modeling of multiple EHR data categories and to include tree-based baselines in their evaluations.</description>

      <title>Designing LLM Chains by Adapting Techniques from Crowdsourcing Workflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11681v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: LLM chains enable complex tasks by decomposing work into a sequence of subtasks. Similarly, the more established techniques of crowdsourcing workflows decompose complex tasks into smaller tasks for human crowdworkers. Chains address LLM errors analogously to the way crowdsourcing workflows address human error. To characterize opportunities for LLM chaining, we survey 107 papers across the crowdsourcing and chaining literature to construct a design space for chain development. The design space covers a designer's objectives and the tactics used to build workflows. We then surface strategies that mediate how workflows use tactics to achieve objectives. To explore how techniques from crowdsourcing may apply to chaining, we adapt crowdsourcing workflows to implement LLM chains across three case studies: creating a taxonomy, shortening text, and writing a short story. From the design space and our case studies, we identify takeaways for effective chain design and raise implications for future research and development.</description>

      <title>ToolEyes: Fine-Grained Evaluation for Tool Learning Capabilities of Large Language Models in Real-world Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00741v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing evaluations of tool learning primarily focus on validating the alignment of selected tools for large language models (LLMs) with expected outcomes. However, these approaches rely on a limited set of scenarios where answers can be pre-determined, diverging from genuine needs. Furthermore, a sole emphasis on outcomes disregards the complex capabilities required for LLMs to effectively use tools. To tackle this issue, we propose ToolEyes, a fine-grained system tailored for the evaluation of the LLMs' tool learning capabilities in authentic scenarios. The system meticulously examines seven real-world scenarios, analyzing five dimensions crucial to LLMs in tool learning: format alignment, intent comprehension, behavior planning, tool selection, and answer organization. Additionally, ToolEyes incorporates a tool library boasting approximately 600 tools, serving as an intermediary between LLMs and the physical world. Evaluations involving ten LLMs across three categories reveal a preference for specific scenarios and limited cognitive abilities in tool learning. Intriguingly, expanding the model size even exacerbates the hindrance to tool learning. The code and data are available at https://github.com/Junjie-Ye/ToolEyes.</description>

      <title>GeoPos: A Minimal Positional Encoding for Enhanced Fine-Grained Details in Image Synthesis Using Convolutional Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01951v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The enduring inability of image generative models to recreate intricate geometric features, such as those present in human hands and fingers has been an ongoing problem in image generation for nearly a decade. While strides have been made by increasing model sizes and diversifying training datasets, this issue remains prevalent across all models, from denoising diffusion models to Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), pointing to a fundamental shortcoming in the underlying architectures. In this paper, we demonstrate how this problem can be mitigated by augmenting convolution layers geometric capabilities through providing them with a single input channel incorporating the relative n-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system. We show this drastically improves quality of images generated by Diffusion Models, GANs, and Variational AutoEncoders (VAE).</description>

      <title>CREMA: Generalizable and Efficient Video-Language Reasoning via Multimodal Modular Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05889v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite impressive advancements in recent multimodal reasoning approaches, they are still limited in flexibility and efficiency, as these models typically process only a few fixed modality inputs and require updates to numerous parameters. This paper tackles these critical challenges and proposes CREMA, a generalizable, highly efficient, and modular modality-fusion framework that can incorporate any new modality to enhance video reasoning. We first augment multiple informative modalities (such as optical flow, 3D point cloud, audio, thermal heatmap, and touch map) from given videos without extra human annotation by leveraging sensors or existing pre-trained models. Next, we introduce a query transformer with multiple parameter-efficient modules associated with each accessible modality. It projects diverse modality features to the LLM token embedding space, allowing the model to integrate different data types for response generation. Furthermore, we propose a novel progressive multimodal fusion design supported by a lightweight fusion module and modality-sequential training strategy. It helps compress information across various assisting modalities, maintaining computational efficiency in the LLM while improving performance. We validate our method on 7 video-language reasoning tasks assisted by diverse modalities, including conventional VideoQA and Video-Audio/3D/Touch/Thermal QA, and achieve better/equivalent performance against strong multimodal LLMs, including OneLLM, BLIP-2, and SeViLA while reducing over 90% trainable parameters. We provide extensive analyses of CREMA, including the impact of each modality on reasoning domains, the design of the fusion module, and example visualizations.</description>

      <title>Diffusion of Thoughts: Chain-of-Thought Reasoning in Diffusion Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07754v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, diffusion models have garnered significant interest in the field of text processing due to their many potential advantages compared to conventional autoregressive models. In this work, we propose Diffusion-of-Thought (DoT), a novel approach that integrates diffusion models with Chain-of-Thought, a well-established technique for improving the reasoning ability of autoregressive language models. In contrast to autoregressive language models that make decisions in a left-to-right, token-by-token manner, DoT allows reasoning steps to diffuse over time through a diffusion language model and offers greater flexibility in trading-off computation for reasoning performance. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of DoT in multi-digit multiplication, boolean logic, and grade school math problems, with a small diffusion model outperforming a much larger autoregressive model in both efficiency and accuracy. In addition to that, DoT showcases promising self-correction abilities and benefits from existing reasoning-enhancing techniques like self-consistency decoding. Our findings contribute to the understanding and development of reasoning with diffusion language models.</description>

      <title>Network Formation and Dynamics Among Multi-LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10659v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Social networks fundamentally shape human opinions, behaviors, and the dissemination of information. As large language models (LLMs) like GPT, Claude, and Llama increasingly integrate into social and professional settings, understanding their behavior in the context of social interactions and network formation becomes essential. This study develops a framework to systematically examine whether the network formation behaviors of multiple LLMs approximate certain aspects of human network dynamics. By simulating interactions among LLM agents across various model families, we observe that these models consistently exhibit key patterns associated with social network principles including preferential attachment, triadic closure, homophily, community structure, and the small-world phenomenon when forming networks. Moreover, LLMs adapt their network formation strategies based on each network's characteristics, reflecting the context-dependent nature of human behavior: in Facebook networks, they prioritize triadic closure and homophily, mirroring close-knit friendships; in phone networks, homophily and preferential attachment dominate, capturing personal and professional connections, while in employment networks, LLMs favor heterophily and high-degree connections, aligning with career advancement dynamics. These results open new avenues for using LLMs in network science research, with potential applications in agent-based modeling and synthetic network generation.</description>

      <title>PreAct: Prediction Enhances Agent's Planning Ability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11534v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Addressing the disparity between forecasts and actual results can enable individuals to expand their thought processes and stimulate self-reflection, thus promoting accurate planning. In this research, we present **PreAct**, an agent framework that integrates **pre**diction, **rea**soning, and **act**ion. By utilizing the information derived from predictions, the large language model (LLM) agent can provide a wider range and more strategically focused reasoning. This leads to more efficient actions that aid the agent in accomplishing intricate tasks. Our experimental results show that PreAct surpasses the ReAct method in completing complex tasks and that PreAct's performance can be further improved when paired with other memory or selection strategy techniques. We presented the model with varying quantities of historical predictions and discovered that these predictions consistently enhance LLM planning.The variances in single-step reasoning between PreAct and ReAct indicate that PreAct indeed has benefits in terms of diversity and strategic orientation over ReAct.</description>

      <title>DeiSAM: Segment Anything with Deictic Prompting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14123v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large-scale, pre-trained neural networks have demonstrated strong capabilities in various tasks, including zero-shot image segmentation. To identify concrete objects in complex scenes, humans instinctively rely on deictic descriptions in natural language, i.e., referring to something depending on the context such as "The object that is on the desk and behind the cup.". However, deep learning approaches cannot reliably interpret such deictic representations due to their lack of reasoning capabilities in complex scenarios. To remedy this issue, we propose DeiSAM -- a combination of large pre-trained neural networks with differentiable logic reasoners -- for deictic promptable segmentation. Given a complex, textual segmentation description, DeiSAM leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate first-order logic rules and performs differentiable forward reasoning on generated scene graphs. Subsequently, DeiSAM segments objects by matching them to the logically inferred image regions. As part of our evaluation, we propose the Deictic Visual Genome (DeiVG) dataset, containing paired visual input and complex, deictic textual prompts. Our empirical results demonstrate that DeiSAM is a substantial improvement over purely data-driven baselines for deictic promptable segmentation.</description>

      <title>Facility Location Games with Scaling Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18908v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We take the classic facility location problem and consider a variation, in which each agent's individual cost function is equal to their distance from the facility multiplied by a scaling factor which is determined by the facility placement. In addition to the general class of continuous scaling functions, we also provide results for piecewise linear scaling functions which can effectively approximate or model the scaling of many real world scenarios. We focus on the objectives of total and maximum cost, describing the computation of the optimal solution. We then move to the approximate mechanism design setting, observing that the agents' preferences may no longer be single-peaked. Consequently, we characterize the conditions on scaling functions which ensure that agents have single-peaked preferences. Under these conditions, we find a characterization of continuous, strategyproof, and anonymous mechanisms, and compute the total and maximum cost approximation ratios achievable by these mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Towards a Psychology of Machines: Large Language Models Predict Human Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05152v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, have shown remarkable abilities in natural language processing, opening new avenues in psychological research. This study explores whether LLMs can predict human memory performance in tasks involving garden-path sentences and contextual information. In the first part, we used ChatGPT to rate the relatedness and memorability of garden-path sentences preceded by either fitting or unfitting contexts. In the second part, human participants read the same sentences, rated their relatedness, and completed a surprise memory test. The results demonstrated that ChatGPT's relatedness ratings closely matched those of the human participants, and its memorability ratings effectively predicted human memory performance. Both LLM and human data revealed that higher relatedness in the unfitting context condition was associated with better memory performance, aligning with probabilistic frameworks of context-dependent learning. These findings suggest that LLMs, despite lacking human-like memory mechanisms, can model aspects of human cognition and serve as valuable tools in psychological research. We propose the field of machine psychology to explore this interplay between human cognition and artificial intelligence, offering a bidirectional approach where LLMs can both benefit from and contribute to our understanding of human cognitive processes.</description>

      <title>Cross-domain and Cross-dimension Learning for Image-to-Graph Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06601v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Direct image-to-graph transformation is a challenging task that involves solving object detection and relationship prediction in a single model. Due to this task's complexity, large training datasets are rare in many domains, making the training of deep-learning methods challenging. This data sparsity necessitates transfer learning strategies akin to the state-of-the-art in general computer vision. In this work, we introduce a set of methods enabling cross-domain and cross-dimension learning for image-to-graph transformers. We propose (1) a regularized edge sampling loss to effectively learn object relations in multiple domains with different numbers of edges, (2) a domain adaptation framework for image-to-graph transformers aligning image- and graph-level features from different domains, and (3) a projection function that allows using 2D data for training 3D transformers. We demonstrate our method's utility in cross-domain and cross-dimension experiments, where we utilize labeled data from 2D road networks for simultaneous learning in vastly different target domains. Our method consistently outperforms standard transfer learning and self-supervised pretraining on challenging benchmarks, such as retinal or whole-brain vessel graph extraction.</description>

      <title>SmallToLarge (S2L): Scalable Data Selection for Fine-tuning Large Language Models by Summarizing Training Trajectories of Small Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07384v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the effectiveness of data selection for large language models (LLMs) during pretraining and instruction fine-tuning phases, improving data efficiency in supervised fine-tuning (SFT) for specialized domains poses significant challenges due to the complexity of fine-tuning data. To bridge this gap, we introduce an effective and scalable data selection method for SFT, SmallToLarge (S2L), which leverages training trajectories from small models to guide the data selection for larger models. We demonstrate through extensive experiments that S2L significantly improves data efficiency in SFT for mathematical problem-solving, reducing the training data to just 11% of the original MathInstruct dataset (Yue et al., 2023) to match full dataset performance while outperforming state-of-the-art data selection algorithms by an average of 4.7% across 6 in- and out-domain evaluation datasets. Remarkably, selecting only 50K data for SFT, S2L achieves a 32.7% accuracy on the most challenging MATH (Hendrycks et al., 2021) benchmark, improving Phi-2 (Li et al., 2023b) by 16.6%. In clinical text summarization on the MIMIC-III dataset (Johnson et al., 2016), S2L again outperforms training on the full dataset using only 50% of the data. Notably, S2L can perform data selection using a reference model 40x smaller than the target model, proportionally reducing the cost of data selection.</description>

      <title>From Pixels to Insights: A Survey on Automatic Chart Understanding in the Era of Large Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12027v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data visualization in the form of charts plays a pivotal role in data analysis, offering critical insights and aiding in informed decision-making. Automatic chart understanding has witnessed significant advancements with the rise of large foundation models in recent years. Foundation models, such as large language models, have revolutionized various natural language processing tasks and are increasingly being applied to chart understanding tasks. This survey paper provides a comprehensive overview of the recent developments, challenges, and future directions in chart understanding within the context of these foundation models. We review fundamental building blocks crucial for studying chart understanding tasks. Additionally, we explore various tasks and their evaluation metrics and sources of both charts and textual inputs. Various modeling strategies are then examined, encompassing both classification-based and generation-based approaches, along with tool augmentation techniques that enhance chart understanding performance. Furthermore, we discuss the state-of-the-art performance of each task and discuss how we can improve the performance. Challenges and future directions are addressed, highlighting the importance of several topics, such as domain-specific charts, lack of efforts in developing evaluation metrics, and agent-oriented settings. This survey paper serves as a comprehensive resource for researchers and practitioners in the fields of natural language processing, computer vision, and data analysis, providing valuable insights and directions for future research in chart understanding leveraging large foundation models. The studies mentioned in this paper, along with emerging new research, will be continually updated at: https://github.com/khuangaf/Awesome-Chart-Understanding.</description>

      <title>PePR: Performance Per Resource Unit as a Metric to Promote Small-Scale Deep Learning in Medical Image Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12562v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent advances in deep learning (DL) have been accelerated by access to large-scale data and compute. These large-scale resources have been used to train progressively larger models which are resource intensive in terms of compute, data, energy, and carbon emissions. These costs are becoming a new type of entry barrier to researchers and practitioners with limited access to resources at such scale, particularly in the Global South. In this work, we take a comprehensive look at the landscape of existing DL models for medical image analysis tasks and demonstrate their usefulness in settings where resources are limited. To account for the resource consumption of DL models, we introduce a novel measure to estimate the performance per resource unit, which we call the PePR score. Using a diverse family of 131 unique DL architectures (spanning 1M to 130M trainable parameters) and three medical image datasets, we capture trends about the performance-resource trade-offs. In applications like medical image analysis, we argue that small-scale, specialized models are better than striving for large-scale models. Furthermore, we show that using existing pretrained models that are fine-tuned on new data can significantly reduce the computational resources and data required compared to training models from scratch. We hope this work will encourage the community to focus on improving AI equity by developing methods and models with smaller resource footprints.</description>

      <title>PDNNet: PDN-Aware GNN-CNN Heterogeneous Network for Dynamic IR Drop Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18569v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: IR drop on the power delivery network (PDN) is closely related to PDN's configuration and cell current consumption. As the integrated circuit (IC) design is growing larger, dynamic IR drop simulation becomes computationally unaffordable and machine learning based IR drop prediction has been explored as a promising solution. Although CNN-based methods have been adapted to IR drop prediction task in several works, the shortcomings of overlooking PDN configuration is non-negligible. In this paper, we consider not only how to properly represent cell-PDN relation, but also how to model IR drop following its physical nature in the feature aggregation procedure. Thus, we propose a novel graph structure, PDNGraph, to unify the representations of the PDN structure and the fine-grained cell-PDN relation. We further propose a dual-branch heterogeneous network, PDNNet, incorporating two parallel GNN-CNN branches to favorably capture the above features during the learning process. Several key designs are presented to make the dynamic IR drop prediction highly effective and interpretable. We are the first work to apply graph structure to deep-learning based dynamic IR drop prediction method. Experiments show that PDNNet outperforms the state-of-the-art CNN-based methods and achieves 545x speedup compared to the commercial tool, which demonstrates the superiority of our method.</description>

      <title>VimTS: A Unified Video and Image Text Spotter for Enhancing the Cross-domain Generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19652v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Text spotting, a task involving the extraction of textual information from image or video sequences, faces challenges in cross-domain adaption, such as image-to-image and image-to-video generalization. In this paper, we introduce a new method, termed VimTS, which enhances the generalization ability of the model by achieving better synergy among different tasks. Typically, we propose a Prompt Queries Generation Module and a Tasks-aware Adapter to effectively convert the original single-task model into a multi-task model suitable for both image and video scenarios with minimal additional parameters. The Prompt Queries Generation Module facilitates explicit interaction between different tasks, while the Tasks-aware Adapter helps the model dynamically learn suitable features for each task. Additionally, to further enable the model to learn temporal information at a lower cost, we propose a synthetic video text dataset (VTD-368k) by leveraging the Content Deformation Fields (CoDeF) algorithm. Notably, our method outperforms the state-of-the-art method by an average of 2.6% in six cross-domain benchmarks such as TT-to-IC15, CTW1500-to-TT, and TT-to-CTW1500. For video-level cross-domain adaption, our method even surpasses the previous end-to-end video spotting method in ICDAR2015 video and DSText v2 by an average of 5.5% on the MOTA metric, using only image-level data. We further demonstrate that existing Large Multimodal Models exhibit limitations in generating cross-domain scene text spotting, in contrast to our VimTS model which requires significantly fewer parameters and data. The code and datasets will be made available at the https://VimTextSpotter.github.io.</description>

      <title>Fourier Boundary Features Network with Wider Catchers for Glass Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09459v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Glass largely blurs the boundary between the real world and the reflection. The special transmittance and reflectance quality have confused the semantic tasks related to machine vision. Therefore, how to clear the boundary built by glass, and avoid over-capturing features as false positive information in deep structure, matters for constraining the segmentation of reflection surface and penetrating glass. We proposed the Fourier Boundary Features Network with Wider Catchers (FBWC), which might be the first attempt to utilize sufficiently wide horizontal shallow branches without vertical deepening for guiding the fine granularity segmentation boundary through primary glass semantic information. Specifically, we designed the Wider Coarse-Catchers (WCC) for anchoring large area segmentation and reducing excessive extraction from a structural perspective. We embed fine-grained features by Cross Transpose Attention (CTA), which is introduced to avoid the incomplete area within the boundary caused by reflection noise. For excavating glass features and balancing high-low layers context, a learnable Fourier Convolution Controller (FCC) is proposed to regulate information integration robustly. The proposed method has been validated on three different public glass segmentation datasets. Experimental results reveal that the proposed method yields better segmentation performance compared with the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in glass image segmentation.</description>

      <title>CoSy: Evaluating Textual Explanations of Neurons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20331v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A crucial aspect of understanding the complex nature of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) is the ability to explain learned concepts within their latent representations. While methods exist to connect neurons to human-understandable textual descriptions, evaluating the quality of these explanations is challenging due to the lack of a unified quantitative approach. We introduce CoSy (Concept Synthesis), a novel, architecture-agnostic framework for evaluating textual explanations of latent neurons. Given textual explanations, our proposed framework uses a generative model conditioned on textual input to create data points representing the explanations. By comparing the neuron's response to these generated data points and control data points, we can estimate the quality of the explanation. We validate our framework through sanity checks and benchmark various neuron description methods for Computer Vision tasks, revealing significant differences in quality.</description>

      <title>Learning in Wilson-Cowan model for metapopulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16453v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Wilson-Cowan model for metapopulation, a Neural Mass Network Model, treats different subcortical regions of the brain as connected nodes, with connections representing various types of structural, functional, or effective neuronal connectivity between these regions. Each region comprises interacting populations of excitatory and inhibitory cells, consistent with the standard Wilson-Cowan model. By incorporating stable attractors into such a metapopulation model's dynamics, we transform it into a learning algorithm capable of achieving high image and text classification accuracy. We test it on MNIST and Fashion MNIST, in combination with convolutional neural networks, on CIFAR-10 and TF-FLOWERS, and, in combination with a transformer architecture (BERT), on IMDB, always showing high classification accuracy. These numerical evaluations illustrate that minimal modifications to the Wilson-Cowan model for metapopulation can reveal unique and previously unobserved dynamics.</description>

      <title>Nl2Hltl2Plan: Scaling Up Natural Language Understanding for Multi-Robots Through Hierarchical Temporal Logic Task Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08188v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To enable non-experts to specify long-horizon, multi-robot collaborative tasks, language models are increasingly used to translate natural language commands into formal specifications. However, because translation can occur in multiple ways, such translations may lack accuracy or lead to inefficient multi-robot planning. Our key insight is that concise hierarchical specifications can simplify planning while remaining straightforward to derive from human instructions. We propose Nl2Hltl2Plan, a framework that translates natural language commands into hierarchical Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) and solves the corresponding planning problem. The translation involves two steps leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs). First, an LLM transforms instructions into a Hierarchical Task Tree, capturing logical and temporal relations. Next, a fine-tuned LLM converts sub-tasks into flat LTL formulas, which are aggregated into hierarchical specifications, with the lowest level corresponding to ordered robot actions. These specifications are then used with off-the-shelf planners. Our Nl2Hltl2Plan demonstrates the potential of LLMs in hierarchical reasoning for multi-robot task planning. Evaluations in simulation and real-world experiments with human participants show that Nl2Hltl2Plan outperforms existing methods, handling more complex instructions while achieving higher success rates and lower costs in task allocation and planning.

      <title>Online SLA Decomposition: Enabling Real-Time Adaptation to Evolving Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08968v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When a network slice spans multiple technology domains, it is crucial for each domain to uphold the End-to-End (E2E) Service Level Agreement (SLA) associated with the slice. Consequently, the E2E SLA must be properly decomposed into partial SLAs that are assigned to each domain involved. In a network slice management system with a two-level architecture, comprising an E2E service orchestrator and local domain controllers, we consider that the orchestrator has access solely to historical data regarding the responses of local controllers to previous requests, and this information is used to construct a risk model for each domain. In this study, we extend our previous work by investigating the dynamic nature of real-world systems and introducing an online learning-decomposition framework to tackle the dynamicity. We propose a framework that periodically updates the risk models based on the most recent feedback. This approach leverages key components such as online gradient descent and FIFO memory buffers, which enhance the stability and robustness of the overall process. Our empirical study on an analytic model-based simulator demonstrates that the proposed framework outperforms the state-of-the-art static approach, providing more accurate and resilient SLA decomposition even under varying conditions and limited data scenarios.</description>

      <title>OMEGA: Efficient Occlusion-Aware Navigation for Air-Ground Robot in Dynamic Environments via State Space Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10618v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Air-ground robots (AGRs) are widely used in surveillance and disaster response due to their exceptional mobility and versatility (i.e., flying and driving). Current AGR navigation systems perform well in static occlusion-prone environments (e.g., indoors) by using 3D semantic occupancy networks to predict occlusions for complete local mapping and then computing Euclidean Signed Distance Field (ESDF) for path planning. However, these systems face challenges in dynamic, severe occlusion scenes (e.g., crowds) due to limitations in perception networks' low prediction accuracy and path planners' high computation overhead. In this paper, we propose OMEGA, which contains OccMamba with an Efficient AGR-Planner to address the above-mentioned problems. OccMamba adopts a novel architecture that separates semantic and occupancy prediction into independent branches, incorporating two mamba blocks within these branches. These blocks efficiently extract semantic and geometric features in 3D environments with linear complexity, ensuring that the network can learn long-distance dependencies to improve prediction accuracy. Semantic and geometric features are combined within the Bird's Eye View (BEV) space to minimise computational overhead during feature fusion. The resulting semantic occupancy map is then seamlessly integrated into the local map, providing occlusion awareness of the dynamic environment. Our AGR-Planner utilizes this local map and employs kinodynamic A* search and gradient-based trajectory optimization to guarantee planning is ESDF-free and energy-efficient. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OccMamba outperforms the state-of-the-art 3D semantic occupancy network with 25.0% mIoU. End-to-end navigation experiments in dynamic scenes verify OMEGA's efficiency, achieving a 96% average planning success rate.

      <title>Spatio-Temporal Context Prompting for Zero-Shot Action Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15996v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spatio-temporal action detection encompasses the tasks of localizing and classifying individual actions within a video. Recent works aim to enhance this process by incorporating interaction modeling, which captures the relationship between people and their surrounding context. However, these approaches have primarily focused on fully-supervised learning, and the current limitation lies in the lack of generalization capability to recognize unseen action categories. In this paper, we aim to adapt the pretrained image-language models to detect unseen actions. To this end, we propose a method which can effectively leverage the rich knowledge of visual-language models to perform Person-Context Interaction. Meanwhile, our Context Prompting module will utilize contextual information to prompt labels, thereby enhancing the generation of more representative text features. Moreover, to address the challenge of recognizing distinct actions by multiple people at the same timestamp, we design the Interest Token Spotting mechanism which employs pretrained visual knowledge to find each person's interest context tokens, and then these tokens will be used for prompting to generate text features tailored to each individual. To evaluate the ability to detect unseen actions, we propose a comprehensive benchmark on J-HMDB, UCF101-24, and AVA datasets. The experiments show that our method achieves superior results compared to previous approaches and can be further extended to multi-action videos, bringing it closer to real-world applications. The code and data can be found in https://webber2933.github.io/ST-CLIP-project-page.</description>

      <title>Objective Features Extracted from Motor Activity Time Series for Food Addiction Analysis Using Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00310v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study investigates machine learning algorithms to identify objective features for diagnosing food addiction (FA) and assessing confirmed symptoms (SC). Data were collected from 81 participants (mean age: 21.5 years, range: 18-61 years, women: 77.8%) whose FA and SC were measured using the Yale Food Addiction Scale (YFAS). Participants provided demographic and anthropometric data, completed the YFAS, the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale, and the Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire, and wore an actimeter on the non-dominant wrist for a week to record motor activity. Analysis of the actimetric data identified significant statistical and entropy-based features that accurately predicted FA and SC using ML. The Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) was the primary metric. Activity-related features were more effective for FA prediction (MCC=0.88) than rest-related features (MCC=0.68). For SC, activity segments yielded MCC=0.47, rest segments MCC=0.38, and their combination MCC=0.51. Significant correlations were also found between actimetric features related to FA, emotional, and restrained eating behaviors, supporting the model's validity. Our results support the concept of a human bionic suite composed of IoT devices and ML sensors, which implements health digital assistance with real-time monitoring and analysis of physiological indicators related to FA and SC.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03669v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Process curves are multivariate finite time series data coming from manufacturing processes. This paper studies machine learning that detect drifts in process curve datasets. A theoretic framework to synthetically generate process curves in a controlled way is introduced in order to benchmark machine learning algorithms for process drift detection. An evaluation score, called the temporal area under the curve, is introduced, which allows to quantify how well machine learning models unveil curves belonging to drift segments. Finally, a benchmark study comparing popular machine learning approaches on synthetic data generated with the introduced framework is presented that shows that existing algorithms often struggle with datasets containing multiple drift segments.</description>

      <title>WaveletGPT: Wavelets Meet Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12924</link>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have ushered in a new wave of artificial intelligence advancements impacting every scientific field and discipline. They are trained on a simple objective: to predict the next token given the previous context. We live in a world where most of the data around us, e.g., text, audio, and music, has a multi-scale structure associated with it. This paper infuses LLMs with traditional signal processing ideas, namely wavelets, during pre-training to take advantage of the structure. Without adding \textbf{any extra parameters} to a GPT-style LLM architecture, we achieve the same pre-training performance almost twice as fast in text, raw audio, and symbolic music. This is achieved by imposing a structure on intermediate embeddings. When trained for the same number of training steps, we achieve significant gains in performance, which is comparable to pre-training a larger neural architecture. Our architecture allows every next token prediction access to intermediate embeddings at different temporal resolutions in every Transformer decoder block. This work will hopefully pave the way for incorporating multi-rate signal processing ideas into traditional LLM pre-training. Further, we showcase pushing model performance by improving internal structure instead of just going after scale.</description>

      <title>Introducing the Large Medical Model: State of the art healthcare cost and risk prediction with transformers trained on patient event sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13000v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With U.S. healthcare spending approaching $5T (NHE Fact Sheet 2024), and 25% of it estimated to be wasteful (Waste in the US the health care system: estimated costs and potential for savings, n.d.), the need to better predict risk and optimal patient care is evermore important. This paper introduces the Large Medical Model (LMM), a generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) designed to guide and predict the broad facets of patient care and healthcare administration. The model is trained on medical event sequences from over 140M longitudinal patient claims records with a specialized vocabulary built from medical terminology systems and demonstrates a superior capability to forecast healthcare costs and identify potential risk factors. Through experimentation and validation, we showcase the LMM's proficiency in not only in cost and risk predictions, but also in discerning intricate patterns within complex medical conditions and an ability to identify novel relationships in patient care. The LMM is able to improve both cost prediction by 14.1% over the best commercial models and chronic conditions prediction by 1.9% over the best transformer models in research predicting a broad set of conditions. The LMM is a substantial advancement in healthcare analytics, offering the potential to significantly enhance risk assessment, cost management, and personalized medicine.</description>

      <title>Developing a Thailand solar irradiance map using Himawari-8 satellite imageries and deep learning models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16320v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an online platform showing Thailand solar irradiance map every 30 minutes, available at https://www.cusolarforecast.com. The methodology for estimating global horizontal irradiance (GHI) across Thailand relies on cloud index extracted from Himawari-8 satellite imagery, Ineichen clear-sky model with locally-tuned Linke turbidity, and machine learning models. The methods take clear-sky irradiance, cloud index, re-analyzed GHI and temperature data from the MERRA-2 database, and date-time as inputs for GHI estimation models, including LightGBM, LSTM, Informer, and Transformer. These are benchmarked with the estimate from a commercial service X by evaluation of 15-minute ground GHI data from 53 ground stations over 1.5 years during 2022-2023. The results show that the four models exhibit comparable overall MAE performance to the service X. The best model is LightGBM with an overall MAE of 78.58 W/sqm and RMSE of 118.97 W/sqm, while the service X achieves the lowest MAE, RMSE, and MBE in cloudy condition. Obtaining re-analyzed MERRA-2 data for the whole Thailand region is not economically feasible for deployment. When removing these features, the Informer model has a winning performance in MAE of 78.67 W/sqm. The obtained performance aligns with existing literature by taking the climate zone and time granularity of data into consideration. As the map shows an estimate of GHI over 93,000 grids with a frequent update, the paper also describes a computational framework for displaying the entire map. It tests the runtime performance of deep learning models in the GHI estimation process.</description>

      <title>HydraViT: Stacking Heads for a Scalable ViT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17978v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The architecture of Vision Transformers (ViTs), particularly the Multi-head Attention (MHA) mechanism, imposes substantial hardware demands. Deploying ViTs on devices with varying constraints, such as mobile phones, requires multiple models of different sizes. However, this approach has limitations, such as training and storing each required model separately. This paper introduces HydraViT, a novel approach that addresses these limitations by stacking attention heads to achieve a scalable ViT. By repeatedly changing the size of the embedded dimensions throughout each layer and their corresponding number of attention heads in MHA during training, HydraViT induces multiple subnetworks. Thereby, HydraViT achieves adaptability across a wide spectrum of hardware environments while maintaining performance. Our experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of HydraViT in achieving a scalable ViT with up to 10 subnetworks, covering a wide range of resource constraints. HydraViT achieves up to 5 p.p. more accuracy with the same GMACs and up to 7 p.p. more accuracy with the same throughput on ImageNet-1K compared to the baselines, making it an effective solution for scenarios where hardware availability is diverse or varies over time.

      <title>Transferring disentangled representations: bridging the gap between synthetic and real images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18017v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Developing meaningful and efficient representations that separate the fundamental structure of the data generation mechanism is crucial in representation learning. However, Disentangled Representation Learning has not fully shown its potential on real images, because of correlated generative factors, their resolution and limited access to ground truth labels. Specifically on the latter, we investigate the possibility of leveraging synthetic data to learn general-purpose disentangled representations applicable to real data, discussing the effect of fine-tuning and what properties of disentanglement are preserved after the transfer. We provide an extensive empirical study to address these issues. In addition, we propose a new interpretable intervention-based metric, to measure the quality of factors encoding in the representation. Our results indicate that some level of disentanglement, transferring a representation from synthetic to real data, is possible and effective.</description>

      <title>SwiftKV: Fast Prefill-Optimized Inference with Knowledge-Preserving Model Transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03960v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: LLM inference for popular enterprise use cases, such as summarization, RAG, and code-generation, typically observes orders of magnitude longer prompt lengths than generation lengths. This characteristic leads to high cost of prefill and increased response latency. In this paper, we present SwiftKV, a novel model transformation and distillation procedure specifically designed to reduce the time and cost of processing prompt tokens while preserving high quality of generated tokens. SwiftKV combines three key mechanisms: i) SingleInputKV, which prefills later layers' KV cache using a much earlier layer's output, allowing prompt tokens to skip much of the model computation, ii) AcrossKV, which merges the KV caches of neighboring layers to reduce the memory footprint and support larger batch size for higher throughput, and iii) a knowledge-preserving distillation procedure that can adapt existing LLMs for SwiftKV with minimal accuracy impact and low compute and data requirement. For Llama-3.1-8B and 70B, SwiftKV reduces the compute requirement of prefill by 50% and the memory requirement of the KV cache by 62.5% while incurring minimum quality degradation across a wide range of tasks. In the end-to-end inference serving using an optimized vLLM implementation, SwiftKV realizes up to 2x higher aggregate throughput and 60% lower time per output token. It can achieve a staggering 560 TFlops/GPU of normalized inference throughput, which translates to 16K tokens/s for Llama-3.1-70B in 16-bit precision on 4x H100 GPUs. Our training, inference, and model implementations are open-sourced and can be found through https://huggingface.co/collections/Snowflake/swiftkv-models-674f7d7474eb789e185d31cb.</description>

      <title>Model-GLUE: Democratized LLM Scaling for A Large Model Zoo in the Wild</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05357v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) excel across tasks and specialized domains, scaling LLMs based on existing models has garnered significant attention, which faces the challenge of decreasing performance when combining disparate models. Various techniques have been proposed for the aggregation of pre-trained LLMs, including model merging, Mixture-of-Experts, and stacking. Despite their merits, a comprehensive comparison and synergistic application of them to a diverse model zoo is yet to be adequately addressed. In light of this research gap, this paper introduces Model-GLUE, a holistic LLM scaling guideline. First, our work starts with a benchmarking of existing LLM scaling techniques, especially selective merging, and variants of mixture. Utilizing the insights from the benchmark results, we formulate an optimal strategy for the selection and aggregation of a heterogeneous model zoo characterizing different architectures and initialization.Our methodology involves the clustering of mergeable models and optimal merging strategy selection, and the integration of clusters through a model mixture. Finally, evidenced by our experiments on a diverse Llama-2-based model zoo, Model-GLUE shows an average performance enhancement of 5.61%, achieved without additional training.

      <title>Efficiently Learning at Test-Time: Active Fine-Tuning of LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08020v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent efforts in fine-tuning language models often rely on automatic data selection, commonly using Nearest Neighbors retrieval from large datasets. However, we theoretically show that this approach tends to select redundant data, limiting its effectiveness or even hurting performance. To address this, we introduce SIFT, a data selection algorithm designed to reduce uncertainty about the model's response given a prompt, which unifies ideas from retrieval and active learning. Whereas Nearest Neighbor retrieval typically fails in the presence of information duplication, SIFT accounts for information duplication and optimizes the overall information gain of the selected examples. We focus our evaluations on fine-tuning at test-time for prompt-specific language modeling on the Pile dataset, and show that SIFT consistently outperforms Nearest Neighbor retrieval, with minimal computational overhead. Moreover, we show that our uncertainty estimates can predict the performance gain of test-time fine-tuning, and use this to develop an adaptive algorithm that invests test-time compute proportional to realized performance gains. We provide the $\texttt{activeft}$ (Active Fine-Tuning) library which can be used as a drop-in replacement for Nearest Neighbor retrieval.</description>

      <title>Context Matters: Leveraging Contextual Features for Time Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12672v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time series forecasts are often influenced by exogenous contextual features in addition to their corresponding history. For example, in financial settings, it is hard to accurately predict a stock price without considering public sentiments and policy decisions in the form of news articles, tweets, etc. Though this is common knowledge, the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) forecasting models fail to incorporate such contextual information, owing to its heterogeneity and multimodal nature. To address this, we introduce ContextFormer, a novel plug-and-play method to surgically integrate multimodal contextual information into existing pre-trained forecasting models. ContextFormer effectively distills forecast-specific information from rich multimodal contexts, including categorical, continuous, time-varying, and even textual information, to significantly enhance the performance of existing base forecasters. ContextFormer outperforms SOTA forecasting models by up to 30% on a range of real-world datasets spanning energy, traffic, environmental, and financial domains.</description>

      <title>In-context learning and Occam's razor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14086v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A central goal of machine learning is generalization. While the No Free Lunch Theorem states that we cannot obtain theoretical guarantees for generalization without further assumptions, in practice we observe that simple models which explain the training data generalize best: a principle called Occam's razor. Despite the need for simple models, most current approaches in machine learning only minimize the training error, and at best indirectly promote simplicity through regularization or architecture design. Here, we draw a connection between Occam's razor and in-context learning: an emergent ability of certain sequence models like Transformers to learn at inference time from past observations in a sequence. In particular, we show that the next-token prediction loss used to train in-context learners is directly equivalent to a data compression technique called prequential coding, and that minimizing this loss amounts to jointly minimizing both the training error and the complexity of the model that was implicitly learned from context. Our theory and the empirical experiments we use to support it not only provide a normative account of in-context learning, but also elucidate the shortcomings of current in-context learning methods, suggesting ways in which they can be improved. We make our code available at https://github.com/3rdCore/PrequentialCode.</description>

      <title>A Complexity-Based Theory of Compositionality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14817v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Compositionality is believed to be fundamental to intelligence. In humans, it underlies the structure of thought, language, and higher-level reasoning. In AI, compositional representations can enable a powerful form of out-of-distribution generalization, in which a model systematically adapts to novel combinations of known concepts. However, while we have strong intuitions about what compositionality is, there currently exists no formal definition for it that is measurable and mathematical. Here, we propose such a definition, which we call representational compositionality, that accounts for and extends our intuitions about compositionality. The definition is conceptually simple, quantitative, grounded in algorithmic information theory, and applicable to any representation. Intuitively, representational compositionality states that a compositional representation satisfies three properties. First, it must be expressive. Second, it must be possible to re-describe the representation as a function of discrete symbolic sequences with re-combinable parts, analogous to sentences in natural language. Third, the function that relates these symbolic sequences to the representation, analogous to semantics in natural language, must be simple. Through experiments on both synthetic and real world data, we validate our definition of compositionality and show how it unifies disparate intuitions from across the literature in both AI and cognitive science. We also show that representational compositionality, while theoretically intractable, can be readily estimated using standard deep learning tools. Our definition has the potential to inspire the design of novel, theoretically-driven models that better capture the mechanisms of compositional thought.</description>

      <title>HoPE: A Novel Positional Encoding Without Long-Term Decay for Enhanced Context Awareness and Extrapolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21216v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many positional encodings (PEs) are designed to exhibit long-term decay, based on an entrenched and long-standing inductive opinion: tokens farther away from the current position carry less relevant information. We argue that long-term decay is outdated in the era of LLMs, as LLMs are now applied to tasks demanding precise retrieval of in-context information from arbitrary positions. Firstly, we present empirical analyses on various PEs, demonstrating that models inherently learn attention with only a local-decay pattern while forming a U-shape pattern globally, contradicting the principle of long-term decay. Furthermore, we conduct a detailed analysis of rotary position encoding (RoPE, a prevalent relative positional encoding in LLMs), and found that the U-shape attention is caused by some learned components, which are also the key factor limiting RoPE's expressiveness and extrapolation.Inspired by these insights, we propose High-frequency rotary Position Encoding (HoPE). HoPE replaces the specific components in RoPE with position-independent ones, retaining only high-frequency signals, which also breaks the principle of long-term decay in theory. HoPE achieves two major advantages: (1) Without constraints imposed by long-term decay, contradictory factors that limit spontaneous attention optimization and model extrapolation performance are removed. (2) Components representing positions and semantics are are optimized. These enhances model's context awareness and extrapolation, as validated by extensive experiments.</description>

      <title>Marginal Causal Flows for Validation and Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01295v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Investigating the marginal causal effect of an intervention on an outcome from complex data remains challenging due to the inflexibility of employed models and the lack of complexity in causal benchmark datasets, which often fail to reproduce intricate real-world data patterns. In this paper we introduce Frugal Flows, a novel likelihood-based machine learning model that uses normalising flows to flexibly learn the data-generating process, while also directly inferring the marginal causal quantities from observational data. We propose that these models are exceptionally well suited for generating synthetic data to validate causal methods. They can create synthetic datasets that closely resemble the empirical dataset, while automatically and exactly satisfying a user-defined average treatment effect. To our knowledge, Frugal Flows are the first generative model to both learn flexible data representations and also exactly parameterise quantities such as the average treatment effect and the degree of unobserved confounding. We demonstrate the above with experiments on both simulated and real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>Tencent Hunyuan3D-1.0: A Unified Framework for Text-to-3D and Image-to-3D Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02293v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While 3D generative models have greatly improved artists' workflows, the existing diffusion models for 3D generation suffer from slow generation and poor generalization. To address this issue, we propose a two-stage approach named Hunyuan3D-1.0 including a lite version and a standard version, that both support text- and image-conditioned generation. In the first stage, we employ a multi-view diffusion model that efficiently generates multi-view RGB in approximately 4 seconds. These multi-view images capture rich details of the 3D asset from different viewpoints, relaxing the tasks from single-view to multi-view reconstruction. In the second stage, we introduce a feed-forward reconstruction model that rapidly and faithfully reconstructs the 3D asset given the generated multi-view images in approximately 7 seconds. The reconstruction network learns to handle noises and in-consistency introduced by the multi-view diffusion and leverages the available information from the condition image to efficiently recover the 3D structure. Our framework involves the text-to-image model, i.e., Hunyuan-DiT, making it a unified framework to support both text- and image-conditioned 3D generation. Our standard version has 3x more parameters than our lite and other existing model. Our Hunyuan3D-1.0 achieves an impressive balance between speed and quality, significantly reducing generation time while maintaining the quality and diversity of the produced assets.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Monkeys at Play: Random Augmentations Cheaply Break LLM Safety Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02785v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Safety alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs) has recently become a critical objective of model developers. In response, a growing body of work has been investigating how safety alignment can be bypassed through various jailbreaking methods, such as adversarial attacks. However, these jailbreak methods can be rather costly or involve a non-trivial amount of creativity and effort, introducing the assumption that malicious users are high-resource or sophisticated. In this paper, we study how simple random augmentations to the input prompt affect safety alignment effectiveness in state-of-the-art LLMs, such as Llama 3 and Qwen 2. We perform an in-depth evaluation of 17 different models and investigate the intersection of safety under random augmentations with multiple dimensions: augmentation type, model size, quantization, fine-tuning-based defenses, and decoding strategies (e.g., sampling temperature). We show that low-resource and unsophisticated attackers, i.e. $\textit{stochastic monkeys}$, can significantly improve their chances of bypassing alignment with just 25 random augmentations per prompt.

      <title>Dockformer: A transformer-based molecular docking paradigm for large-scale virtual screening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06740v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Molecular docking is a crucial step in drug development, which enables the virtual screening of compound libraries to identify potential ligands that target proteins of interest. However, the computational complexity of traditional docking models increases as the size of the compound library increases. Recently, deep learning algorithms can provide data-driven research and development models to increase the speed of the docking process. Unfortunately, few models can achieve superior screening performance compared to that of traditional models. Therefore, a novel deep learning-based docking approach named Dockformer is introduced in this study. Dockformer leverages multimodal information to capture the geometric topology and structural knowledge of molecules and can directly generate binding conformations with the corresponding confidence measures in an end-to-end manner. The experimental results show that Dockformer achieves success rates of 90.53% and 82.71% on the PDBbind core set and PoseBusters benchmarks, respectively, and more than a 100-fold increase in the inference process speed, outperforming almost all state-of-the-art docking methods. In addition, the ability of Dockformer to identify the main protease inhibitors of coronaviruses is demonstrated in a real-world virtual screening scenario. Considering its high docking accuracy and screening efficiency, Dockformer can be regarded as a powerful and robust tool in the field of drug design.</description>

      <title>MetricGold: Leveraging Text-To-Image Latent Diffusion Models for Metric Depth Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10886v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recovering metric depth from a single image remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision, requiring both scene understanding and accurate scaling. While deep learning has advanced monocular depth estimation, current models often struggle with unfamiliar scenes and layouts, particularly in zero-shot scenarios and when predicting scale-ergodic metric depth. We present MetricGold, a novel approach that harnesses generative diffusion model's rich priors to improve metric depth estimation. Building upon recent advances in MariGold, DDVM and Depth Anything V2 respectively, our method combines latent diffusion, log-scaled metric depth representation, and synthetic data training. MetricGold achieves efficient training on a single RTX 3090 within two days using photo-realistic synthetic data from HyperSIM, VirtualKitti, and TartanAir. Our experiments demonstrate robust generalization across diverse datasets, producing sharper and higher quality metric depth estimates compared to existing approaches.</description>

      <title>MC-LLaVA: Multi-Concept Personalized Vision-Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11706v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current vision-language models (VLMs) show exceptional abilities across diverse tasks including visual question answering. To enhance user experience in practical applications, recent studies investigate VLM personalization to understand user-provided concepts. However, existing studies mainly focus on single-concept personalization, neglecting the existence and interplay of multiple concepts, which limits the real-world applicability of personalized VLMs. In this paper, we propose the first multi-concept personalization method named MC-LLaVA along with a high-quality multi-concept personalization dataset. Specifically, MC-LLaVA uses a joint training strategy incorporating multiple concepts in a single training step, allowing VLMs to perform accurately in multi-concept personalization. To reduce the cost of joint training, MC-LLaVA leverages visual token information for concept token initialization, yielding improved concept representation and accelerating joint training. To advance multi-concept personalization research, we further contribute a high-quality dataset. We carefully collect images from various movies that contain multiple characters and manually generate the multi-concept question-answer samples. Our dataset features diverse movie types and question-answer types. We conduct comprehensive qualitative and quantitative experiments to demonstrate that MC-LLaVA can achieve impressive multi-concept personalized responses, paving the way for VLMs to become better user-specific assistants. The code and dataset will be publicly available at https://github.com/arctanxarc/MC-LLaVA.</description>

      <title>ScribeAgent: Towards Specialized Web Agents Using Production-Scale Workflow Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15004v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are rapidly improving to handle increasingly complex web-based tasks. Most of these agents rely on general-purpose, proprietary models like GPT-4 and focus on designing better prompts to improve their planning abilities. However, general-purpose LLMs are not specifically trained to understand specialized web contexts such as HTML, and they often struggle with long-horizon planning. We explore an alternative approach that fine-tunes open-source LLMs using production-scale workflow data collected from over 250 domains corresponding to 6 billion tokens. This simple yet effective approach shows substantial gains over prompting-based agents on existing benchmarks -- ScribeAgent achieves state-of-the-art direct generation performance on Mind2Web and improves the task success rate by 7.3% over the previous best text-only web agents on WebArena. We further perform detailed ablation studies on various fine-tuning design choices and provide insights into LLM selection, training recipes, context window optimization, and effect of dataset sizes.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Circuit Behavior and Generalization in Mechanistic Interpretability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16105v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability aims to understand the inner workings of large neural networks by identifying circuits, or minimal subgraphs within the model that implement algorithms responsible for performing specific tasks. These circuits are typically discovered and analyzed using a narrowly defined prompt format. However, given the abilities of large language models (LLMs) to generalize across various prompt formats for the same task, it remains unclear how well these circuits generalize. For instance, it is unclear whether the models generalization results from reusing the same circuit components, the components behaving differently, or the use of entirely different components. In this paper, we investigate the generality of the indirect object identification (IOI) circuit in GPT-2 small, which is well-studied and believed to implement a simple, interpretable algorithm. We evaluate its performance on prompt variants that challenge the assumptions of this algorithm. Our findings reveal that the circuit generalizes surprisingly well, reusing all of its components and mechanisms while only adding additional input edges. Notably, the circuit generalizes even to prompt variants where the original algorithm should fail; we discover a mechanism that explains this which we term S2 Hacking. Our findings indicate that circuits within LLMs may be more flexible and general than previously recognized, underscoring the importance of studying circuit generalization to better understand the broader capabilities of these models.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Fluorescence Lifetime Parameter Estimation Accuracy with Differential Transformer Based Deep Learning Model Incorporating Pixelwise Instrument Response Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16896v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging (FLI) is a critical molecular imaging modality that provides unique information about the tissue microenvironment, which is invaluable for biomedical applications. FLI operates by acquiring and analyzing photon time-of-arrival histograms to extract quantitative parameters associated with temporal fluorescence decay. These histograms are influenced by the intrinsic properties of the fluorophore, instrument parameters, time-of-flight distributions associated with pixel-wise variations in the topographic and optical characteristics of the sample. Recent advancements in Deep Learning (DL) have enabled improved fluorescence lifetime parameter estimation. However, existing models are primarily designed for planar surface samples, limiting their applicability in translational scenarios involving complex surface profiles, such as \textit{in-vivo} whole-animal or imaged guided surgical applications. To address this limitation, we present MFliNet (Macroscopic FLI Network), a novel DL architecture that integrates the Instrument Response Function (IRF) as an additional input alongside experimental photon time-of-arrival histograms. Leveraging the capabilities of a Differential Transformer encoder-decoder architecture, MFliNet effectively focuses on critical input features, such as variations in photon time-of-arrival distributions. We evaluate MFliNet using rigorously designed tissue-mimicking phantoms and preclinical in-vivo cancer xenograft models. Our results demonstrate the model's robustness and suitability for complex macroscopic FLI applications, offering new opportunities for advanced biomedical imaging in diverse and challenging settings.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Proximal Policy Optimization Learning Using Task Prediction for Solving Environments with Delayed Rewards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17861v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we tackle the challenging problem of delayed rewards in reinforcement learning (RL). While Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) has emerged as a leading Policy Gradient method, its performance can degrade under delayed rewards. We introduce two key enhancements to PPO: a hybrid policy architecture that combines an offline policy (trained on expert demonstrations) with an online PPO policy, and a reward shaping mechanism using Time Window Temporal Logic (TWTL). The hybrid architecture leverages offline data throughout training while maintaining PPO's theoretical guarantees. Building on the monotonic improvement framework of Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO), we prove that our approach ensures improvement over both the offline policy and previous iterations, with a bounded performance gap of $(2\varsigma\gamma\alpha^2)/(1-\gamma)^2$, where $\alpha$ is the mixing parameter, $\gamma$ is the discount factor, and $\varsigma$ bounds the expected advantage. Additionally, we prove that our TWTL-based reward shaping preserves the optimal policy of the original problem. TWTL enables formal translation of temporal objectives into immediate feedback signals that guide learning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments on an inverted pendulum and a lunar lander environments, showing improvements in both learning speed and final performance compared to standard PPO and offline-only approaches.</description>

      <title>R-MTLLMF: Resilient Multi-Task Large Language Model Fusion at the Wireless Edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18220v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-task large language models (MTLLMs) are important for many applications at the wireless edge, where users demand specialized models to handle multiple tasks efficiently. However, training MTLLMs is complex and exhaustive, particularly when tasks are subject to change. Recently, the concept of model fusion via task vectors has emerged as an efficient approach for combining fine-tuning parameters to produce an MTLLM. In this paper, the problem of enabling edge users to collaboratively craft such MTLMs via tasks vectors is studied, under the assumption of worst-case adversarial attacks. To this end, first the influence of adversarial noise to multi-task model fusion is investigated and a relationship between the so-called weight disentanglement error and the mean squared error (MSE) is derived. Using hypothesis testing, it is directly shown that the MSE increases interference between task vectors, thereby rendering model fusion ineffective. Then, a novel resilient MTLLM fusion (R-MTLLMF) is proposed, which leverages insights about the LLM architecture and fine-tuning process to safeguard task vector aggregation under adversarial noise by realigning the MTLLM. The proposed R-MTLLMF is then compared for both worst-case and ideal transmission scenarios to study the impact of the wireless channel. Extensive model fusion experiments with vision LLMs demonstrate R-MTLLMF's effectiveness, achieving close-to-baseline performance across eight different tasks in ideal noise scenarios and significantly outperforming unprotected model fusion in worst-case scenarios. The results further advocate for additional physical layer protection for a holistic approach to resilience, from both a wireless and LLM perspective.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00083v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs), such as GPT-4o, excel at integrating text and visual data but face systematic challenges when interpreting ambiguous or incomplete visual stimuli [9]. This study leverages statistical modeling to analyze the factors driving these errors, using a dataset of geometric stimuli characterized by features like 3D, rotation, and missing face/side. We applied parametric methods, non-parametric methods, and ensemble techniques to predict classification errors, with the non-linear gradient boosting model achieving the highest performance (AUC=0.85) during cross-validation. Feature importance analysis highlighted difficulties in depth perception and reconstructing incomplete structures as key contributors to misclassification. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of statistical approaches for uncovering limitations in MLLMs and offer actionable insights for enhancing model architectures by integrating contextual reasoning mechanisms.</description>

      <title>RILQ: Rank-Insensitive LoRA-based Quantization Error Compensation for Boosting 2-bit Large Language Model Accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01129v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) has become the dominant method for parameter-efficient LLM fine-tuning, with LoRA-based quantization error compensation (LQEC) emerging as a powerful tool for recovering accuracy in compressed LLMs. However, LQEC has underperformed in sub-4-bit scenarios, with no prior investigation into understanding this limitation. We propose RILQ (Rank-Insensitive LoRA-based Quantization Error Compensation) to understand fundamental limitation and boost 2-bit LLM accuracy. Based on rank analysis revealing model-wise activation discrepancy loss's rank-insensitive nature, RILQ employs this loss to adjust adapters cooperatively across layers, enabling robust error compensation with low-rank adapters. Evaluations on LLaMA-2 and LLaMA-3 demonstrate RILQ's consistent improvements in 2-bit quantized inference across various state-of-the-art quantizers and enhanced accuracy in task-specific fine-tuning. RILQ maintains computational efficiency comparable to existing LoRA methods, enabling adapter-merged weight-quantized LLM inference with significantly enhanced accuracy, making it a promising approach for boosting 2-bit LLM performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01253v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This technical report presents Yi-Lightning, our latest flagship large language model (LLM). It achieves exceptional performance, ranking 6th overall on Chatbot Arena, with particularly strong results (2nd to 4th place) in specialized categories including Chinese, Math, Coding, and Hard Prompts. Yi-Lightning leverages an enhanced Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, featuring advanced expert segmentation and routing mechanisms coupled with optimized KV-caching techniques. Our development process encompasses comprehensive pre-training, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), where we devise deliberate strategies for multi-stage training, synthetic data construction, and reward modeling. Furthermore, we implement RAISE (Responsible AI Safety Engine), a four-component framework to address safety issues across pre-training, post-training, and serving phases. Empowered by our scalable super-computing infrastructure, all these innovations substantially reduce training, deployment and inference costs while maintaining high-performance standards. With further evaluations on public academic benchmarks, Yi-Lightning demonstrates competitive performance against top-tier LLMs, while we observe a notable disparity between traditional, static benchmark results and real-world, dynamic human preferences. This observation prompts a critical reassessment of conventional benchmarks' utility in guiding the development of more intelligent and powerful AI systems for practical applications. Yi-Lightning is now available through our developer platform at https://platform.lingyiwanwu.com.</description>

      <title>Negative Token Merging: Image-based Adversarial Feature Guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01339v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Text-based adversarial guidance using a negative prompt has emerged as a widely adopted approach to steer diffusion models away from producing undesired concepts. While useful, performing adversarial guidance using text alone can be insufficient to capture complex visual concepts or avoid specific visual elements like copyrighted characters. In this paper, for the first time we explore an alternate modality in this direction by performing adversarial guidance directly using visual features from a reference image or other images in a batch. We introduce negative token merging (NegToMe), a simple but effective training-free approach which performs adversarial guidance through images by selectively pushing apart matching visual features between reference and generated images during the reverse diffusion process. By simply adjusting the used reference, NegToMe enables a diverse range of applications. Notably, when using other images in same batch as reference, we find that NegToMe significantly enhances output diversity (e.g., racial, gender, visual) by guiding features of each image away from others. Similarly, when used w.r.t. copyrighted reference images, NegToMe reduces visual similarity to copyrighted content by 34.57%. NegToMe is simple to implement using just few-lines of code, uses only marginally higher (&lt;4%) inference time and is compatible with different diffusion architectures, including those like Flux, which don't natively support the use of a negative prompt.

      <title>Concept Based Continuous Prompts for Interpretable Text Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01644v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Continuous prompts have become widely adopted for augmenting performance across a wide range of natural language tasks. However, the underlying mechanism of this enhancement remains obscure. Previous studies rely on individual words for interpreting continuous prompts, which lacks comprehensive semantic understanding. Drawing inspiration from Concept Bottleneck Models, we propose a framework for interpreting continuous prompts by decomposing them into human-readable concepts. Specifically, to ensure the feasibility of the decomposition, we demonstrate that a corresponding concept embedding matrix and a coefficient matrix can always be found to replace the prompt embedding matrix. Then, we employ GPT-4o to generate a concept pool and choose potential candidate concepts that are discriminative and representative using a novel submodular optimization algorithm. Experiments demonstrate that our framework can achieve similar results as the original P-tuning and word-based approaches using only a few concepts while providing more plausible results. Our code is available at https://github.com/qq31415926/CD.</description>

      <title>HERO: Hint-Based Efficient and Reliable Query Optimizer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02372v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel model for learned query optimization which provides query hints leading to better execution plans. The model addresses the three key challenges in learned hint-based query optimization: reliable hint recommendation (ensuring non-degradation of query latency), efficient hint exploration, and fast inference. We provide an in-depth analysis of existing NN-based approaches to hint-based optimization and experimentally confirm the named challenges for them. Our alternative solution consists of a new inference schema based on an ensemble of context-aware models and a graph storage for reliable hint suggestion and fast inference, and a budget-controlled training procedure with a local search algorithm that solves the issue of exponential search space exploration. In experiments on standard benchmarks, our model demonstrates optimization capability close to the best achievable with coarse-grained hints. Controlling the degree of parallelism (query dop) in addition to operator-related hints enables our model to achieve 3x latency improvement on JOB benchmark which sets a new standard for optimization. Our model is interpretable and easy to debug, which is particularly important for deployment in production.</description>

      <title>Hybrid-SQuAD: Hybrid Scholarly Question Answering Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02788v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing Scholarly Question Answering (QA) methods typically target homogeneous data sources, relying solely on either text or Knowledge Graphs (KGs). However, scholarly information often spans heterogeneous sources, necessitating the development of QA systems that integrate information from multiple heterogeneous data sources. To address this challenge, we introduce Hybrid-SQuAD (Hybrid Scholarly Question Answering Dataset), a novel large-scale QA dataset designed to facilitate answering questions incorporating both text and KG facts. The dataset consists of 10.5K question-answer pairs generated by a large language model, leveraging the KGs DBLP and SemOpenAlex alongside corresponding text from Wikipedia. In addition, we propose a RAG-based baseline hybrid QA model, achieving an exact match score of 69.65 on the Hybrid-SQuAD test set.</description>

      <title>CNNSum: Exploring Long-Conext Summarization with Large Language Models in Chinese Novels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02819v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been well-researched in many long-context tasks. However, due to high annotation costs, high-quality long-context summary datasets for training or evaluation are scarce, limiting further research. In this work, we introduce CNNSum, a new multi-scale Chinese long-context novel summarization benchmark, including four subsets, length covering 16k\textasciitilde128k, 695 samples in total, the annotations are human-driven. We evaluate commercial and open-source models on CNNSum and conduct a detailed analysis. Based on the observations, we further conduct fine-tuning exploration with short-context summary data. In our study: (1) GPT-4o underperformed, due to excessive subjective commentary. (2) Currently, long-context summarization mainly relies on memory ability, small LLMs with stable longer context lengths are the most cost-effective. Using long data concatenated from short-context summaries makes a significant improvement. (3) Prompt templates may cause a large performance gap but can be mitigated through fine-tuning. (4) Fine-tuned Chat or Instruction versions may harm the Base model and further fine-tuning cannot bridge performance gap. (5) while models with RoPE base scaling exhibit strong extrapolation potential, their performance may vary significantly when combined with other interpolation methods and need careful selection. (6) CNNSum provides more reliable and insightful evaluation results than other benchmarks. We release CNNSum to advance research in this field.</description>

      <title>Memory-efficient Continual Learning with Neural Collapse Contrastive</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02865v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Contrastive learning has significantly improved representation quality, enhancing knowledge transfer across tasks in continual learning (CL). However, catastrophic forgetting remains a key challenge, as contrastive based methods primarily focus on "soft relationships" or "softness" between samples, which shift with changing data distributions and lead to representation overlap across tasks. Recently, the newly identified Neural Collapse phenomenon has shown promise in CL by focusing on "hard relationships" or "hardness" between samples and fixed prototypes. However, this approach overlooks "softness", crucial for capturing intra-class variability, and this rigid focus can also pull old class representations toward current ones, increasing forgetting. Building on these insights, we propose Focal Neural Collapse Contrastive (FNC2), a novel representation learning loss that effectively balances both soft and hard relationships. Additionally, we introduce the Hardness-Softness Distillation (HSD) loss to progressively preserve the knowledge gained from these relationships across tasks. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, particularly in minimizing memory reliance. Remarkably, even without the use of memory, our approach rivals rehearsal-based methods, offering a compelling solution for data privacy concerns.</description>

      <title>PEMF-VVTO: Point-Enhanced Video Virtual Try-on via Mask-free Paradigm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03021v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Video Virtual Try-on aims to fluently transfer the garment image to a semantically aligned try-on area in the source person video. Previous methods leveraged the inpainting mask to remove the original garment in the source video, thus achieving accurate garment transfer on simple model videos. However, when these methods are applied to realistic video data with more complex scene changes and posture movements, the overly large and incoherent agnostic masks will destroy the essential spatial-temporal information of the original video, thereby inhibiting the fidelity and coherence of the try-on video. To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel point-enhanced mask-free video virtual try-on framework (PEMF-VVTO). Specifically, we first leverage the pre-trained mask-based try-on model to construct large-scale paired training data (pseudo-person samples). Training on these mask-free data enables our model to perceive the original spatial-temporal information while realizing accurate garment transfer. Then, based on the pre-acquired sparse frame-cloth and frame-frame point alignments, we design the point-enhanced spatial attention (PSA) and point-enhanced temporal attention (PTA) to further improve the try-on accuracy and video coherence of the mask-free model. Concretely, PSA explicitly guides the garment transfer to desirable locations through the sparse semantic alignments of video frames and cloth. PTA exploits the temporal attention on sparse point correspondences to enhance the smoothness of generated videos. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments clearly illustrate that our PEMF-VVTO can generate more natural and coherent try-on videos than existing state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>LuxEmbedder: A Cross-Lingual Approach to Enhanced Luxembourgish Sentence Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03331v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sentence embedding models play a key role in various Natural Language Processing tasks, such as in Topic Modeling, Document Clustering and Recommendation Systems. However, these models rely heavily on parallel data, which can be scarce for many low-resource languages, including Luxembourgish. This scarcity results in suboptimal performance of monolingual and cross-lingual sentence embedding models for these languages. To address this issue, we compile a relatively small but high-quality human-generated cross-lingual parallel dataset to train LuxEmbedder, an enhanced sentence embedding model for Luxembourgish with strong cross-lingual capabilities. Additionally, we present evidence suggesting that including low-resource languages in parallel training datasets can be more advantageous for other low-resource languages than relying solely on high-resource language pairs. Furthermore, recognizing the lack of sentence embedding benchmarks for low-resource languages, we create a paraphrase detection benchmark specifically for Luxembourgish, aiming to partially fill this gap and promote further research.</description>

      <title>Learning Semantic Association Rules from Internet of Things Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03417v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Association Rule Mining (ARM) is the task of discovering commonalities in data in the form of logical implications. ARM is used in the Internet of Things (IoT) for different tasks including monitoring and decision-making. However, existing methods give limited consideration to IoT-specific requirements such as heterogeneity and volume. Furthermore, they do not utilize important static domain-specific description data about IoT systems, which is increasingly represented as knowledge graphs. In this paper, we propose a novel ARM pipeline for IoT data that utilizes both dynamic sensor data and static IoT system metadata. Furthermore, we propose an Autoencoder-based Neurosymbolic ARM method (Aerial) as part of the pipeline to address the high volume of IoT data and reduce the total number of rules that are resource-intensive to process. Aerial learns a neural representation of a given data and extracts association rules from this representation by exploiting the reconstruction (decoding) mechanism of an autoencoder. Extensive evaluations on 3 IoT datasets from 2 domains show that ARM on both static and dynamic IoT data results in more generically applicable rules while Aerial can learn a more concise set of high-quality association rules than the state-of-the-art with full coverage over the datasets.</description>

      <title>PBP: Post-training Backdoor Purification for Malware Classifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03441v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the rise of machine learning (ML) in cybersecurity has brought new challenges, including the increasing threat of backdoor poisoning attacks on ML malware classifiers. For instance, adversaries could inject malicious samples into public malware repositories, contaminating the training data and potentially misclassifying malware by the ML model. Current countermeasures predominantly focus on detecting poisoned samples by leveraging disagreements within the outputs of a diverse set of ensemble models on training data points. However, these methods are not suitable for scenarios where Machine Learning-as-a-Service (MLaaS) is used or when users aim to remove backdoors from a model after it has been trained. Addressing this scenario, we introduce PBP, a post-training defense for malware classifiers that mitigates various types of backdoor embeddings without assuming any specific backdoor embedding mechanism. Our method exploits the influence of backdoor attacks on the activation distribution of neural networks, independent of the trigger-embedding method. In the presence of a backdoor attack, the activation distribution of each layer is distorted into a mixture of distributions. By regulating the statistics of the batch normalization layers, we can guide a backdoored model to perform similarly to a clean one. Our method demonstrates substantial advantages over several state-of-the-art methods, as evidenced by experiments on two datasets, two types of backdoor methods, and various attack configurations. Notably, our approach requires only a small portion of the training data -- only 1\% -- to purify the backdoor and reduce the attack success rate from 100\% to almost 0\%, a 100-fold improvement over the baseline methods. Our code is available at \url{https://github.com/judydnguyen/pbp-backdoor-purification-official}.</description>

      <title>A Bidirectional Siamese Recurrent Neural Network for Accurate Gait Recognition Using Body Landmarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03498v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gait recognition is a significant biometric technique for person identification, particularly in scenarios where other physiological biometrics are impractical or ineffective. In this paper, we address the challenges associated with gait recognition and present a novel approach to improve its accuracy and reliability. The proposed method leverages advanced techniques, including sequential gait landmarks obtained through the Mediapipe pose estimation model, Procrustes analysis for alignment, and a Siamese biGRU-dualStack Neural Network architecture for capturing temporal dependencies. Extensive experiments were conducted on large-scale cross-view datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach, achieving high recognition accuracy compared to other models. The model demonstrated accuracies of 95.7%, 94.44%, 87.71%, and 86.6% on CASIA-B, SZU RGB-D, OU-MVLP, and Gait3D datasets respectively. The results highlight the potential applications of the proposed method in various practical domains, indicating its significant contribution to the field of gait recognition.</description>
